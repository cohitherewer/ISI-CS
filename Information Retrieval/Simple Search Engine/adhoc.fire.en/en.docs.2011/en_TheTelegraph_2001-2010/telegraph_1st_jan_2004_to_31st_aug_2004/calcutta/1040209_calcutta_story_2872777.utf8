 Monday, February 09, 2004  Gem of a show CONTRIBUTED BY JANINE WYNNE-PETERS AND PRAKRITI SINGHANIA
					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DAS Models at Regalia   the jewellery show at The Taj Bengal and (below) Joy  shows off a diamond set at the same event															The Taj Bengal appeared suspiciously like Fort Knox recently with a cavalry of security guards scouting the place on full alert. The reason wasnt any visiting head of state or high-profile celebrity, though. It was all about gold, diamonds and more gold. Titled Regalia, the fashion show that played up the role of jewellery, was held to mark the opening of Sonar Sansar 2004  the ongoing exhibition of ornaments at Netaji Indoor Stadium that will continue till today. 																					The showing saw some of the citys biggest names in jewellery-making unveiling the best they had to offer  giving the audience a sneak-peek of whats in store at the exhibition. Showing off the gems were 20 models including Priyanka Pal, Pinky, Jessica, Anangsha, Sudipta, Joy and Kimberline, all looking svelte and sexy in single-hued chiffon saris. 																					Of course, it was the jewellery that really stole the show. B.C. Sen Jewellers dazzled with their diamond necklaces and bracelets as well as kundan jewellery, gorgeous sets that saw an interplay of rubies and emeralds and even intricate filigree-work and minakari. D.K. Basak Jewellers turned the spotlight on intricate gold ornaments in traditional and Mughal-inspired designs replete with emeralds, rubies and other precious stones. For Guinea Emporium, the emphasis was on light-weight jewellery that managed to retain a classic, heavy look. Thus antique necklaces inlaid with tourmalines, rubies and emeralds were showcased along with gold filigree necklaces and of course, sleek diamond necklaces that caught many an eye. Bringing up the rear was Nemichand Bamalwa and Sons and this sequence saw amidst a line-up of antique gold chokers, sita-haars and traditional gold designs, a glittering range of diamond necklaces that were simply stunning.  tReshmi Bhattacharya  with some of the Rajasthani specialities from Dhun of  Marwar at Kalash 												On the spice route																					If you have a penchant for all things spicy, you would do well to head for The HHI, which is currently hosting Dhun of Marwar, a Rajasthani food festival at its Indian speciality restaurant, Kalash. On till February 15, Dhun of Marwar showcases authentic vegetarian Rajasthani cuisine churned out by cooks specially flown in from the state.																					Rajasthans cuisine bears the mark of the tough life its natives have to lead due to extreme climatic conditions and scarcity of water. Also, the need to preserve food for days is of prime importance, hence the dishes  consisting of such ingredients as dried lentils, gram flour and beans of indigenous plants  use excessive spices, clarified butter and milk or buttermilk. But Rajasthani cuisine is none the worse for this lack of water or fresh vegetables and takes in a whole repertoire of delicacies, right from starters to desserts.																					At Kalash, you can kickstart your meal with a refreshing glass of jaljeera and shorba, accompanied by namkeens such as Mirchi Vada, Subz Bara or Kachori Pyaz Ki. Go on to sample lip-smacking subzis including Rajasthani Gatta, Kachra Fali, Barri Mangori, Pyaz Patti Ka Saag and Panchmela Dal which can be enjoyed with sada chawal, Subz Pulao or rotis such as Bajra Ki Roti, Missi Roti and Meethi Puri. Chutneys including Chura Kismis Chutney, Kachri Chutney and Lahsun Chutney as well as achaars made of sangri, Jaipuri mirch and pyaz make for heady accompaniments for your meal, and in case you need to get off the spice trip, dig into the cool curd-based Boondi Raita, Chilla Ka Raita, Kari Ka Pani Patta or Bhesan Pakora Khari.																					And while youre at it, it would be sacrilege to give the sinfully-rich Rajasthani delicacy, Dal Bati Churma a miss. So, for once, stop counting calories and indulge your palate with sada or masala batis swimming in ghee, topped with Panchmela Dal and Kesaria Churma. And if you still crave a sweet ending, mithais such as Gajar Ka Halwa, Goondpak, Moong Dal Halwa or hot syrupy jalebis are also part of the line-up.

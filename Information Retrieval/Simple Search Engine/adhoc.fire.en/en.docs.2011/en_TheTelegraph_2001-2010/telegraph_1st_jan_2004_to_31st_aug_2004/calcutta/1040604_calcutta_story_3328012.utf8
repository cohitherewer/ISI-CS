 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Bench bar on civic garbage dumping
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A vacation bench of Calcutta High Court on Thursday passed an interim order restraining the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) from dumping garbage on land owned by Eastern Organic Fertiliser Private Limited at Dhapa, on the EM Bypass.																								The order follows a petition filed by the firm, alleging that the CMC was forcibly dumping concrete chunks as well as solid waste on its land. The company said the CMC had awarded it 30 acres after an agreement was inked. By the agreement, the CMC could dump 700 metric tonnes of garbage every day on the land and the company, after processing the same, would send the fertiliser to other firms.																								Our main clients were the tea gardens, and as most of them have shut down, we have asked the CMC to dump 300 tonnes of garbage, instead of 700 tonnes a day. The revised scheduled is not acceptable to the CMC and it now wants the land back, the company petition alleged.																								Appearing for the firm, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya sought a court order directing the CMC not to dump garbage on his clients land.																								CMC lawyer Aloke Ghosh opposed the petition and told the court that the petitioners allegations against the civic body were baseless. Justice A. Mitra, after hearing both sides, passed the interim order and sent the matter to a regular bench for final disposal.

																								Capturing through her lenses the essence of everyday visual experiences has been a passion with Mala Mukerjee for close to two decades. Having dabbled in both photography and printing, she has experimented with a variety of forms, figures, themes and compositions, allowing her creative spirit to flow freely and embrace subjects ranging from political to philosophical to the intensely personal. With a number of successful exhibitions to her credit, her present show focuses on her endeavour to work on themes for which she has developed a new interest. Apart from exploring areas of perennial concern, where she feels an endless desire to pursue, this exhibition includes some of her works in digital photography, articulating Mukerjees willingness to indulge in new, exciting, creative experiments in non-conventional styles and media. Specimens of her latest work taken on digital camera also informs us about the immense potential that digital technology has in transforming the art of photography.

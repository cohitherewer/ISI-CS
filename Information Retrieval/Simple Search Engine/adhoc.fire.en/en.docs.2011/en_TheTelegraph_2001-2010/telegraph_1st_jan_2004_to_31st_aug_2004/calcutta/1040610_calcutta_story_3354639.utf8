  Such uninterrupted stretches of green are increasingly becoming rare in the city. A Telegraph picture  There is no denying that the city has been developing of late at the heavy cost of its water bodies and green patches (From the heart, cry for breather, May 7). Trees have been mercilessly felled to make way for wider roads and multistoreyed buildings by promoters, with the state government playing a mute spectator.  A new tram line, on the stretch from Kankurgachi to Ultadanga, has been laid the same way. And the widening of VIP Road, from Ultadanga to Lake Town, was done by filling up the water bodies in the area and felling of a large number of trees. The worst is yet to come in the form of a flyover on VIP Road at Teghoria, which has already claimed a whole lot of greenery and will definitely call for more. Water bodies and trees are absolutely necessary for maintaining the environmental balance of any area. Along with environmental abuse, vehicular pollution adds to the risk of breathing ailments in Calcuttans. The pertinent problem is that there is still no proper planning to replace the trees cut by planting saplings elsewhere in the area. Making things worse, the existing environment plans are being implemented rather slowly. Sunil Banerjee, 
Anupama Housing Complex,
VIP Road. Take them to task The tragic murder of an aspiring medico from the city at a private medical college in Lucknow is shocking (Medical student flown home dead, May 19). The culprit should be caught and punished at the earliest. Prahlad Agarwala, 
Majdia, Nadia.The dowry system is not only cruel, but is also shameful for the entire nation (Torment tale in fatal burns, May 13). It is unfortunate that this practice is still prevalent in our society. It is a curse which is retarding our progress as a nation. Anil Kumar Sen, 
Ramchandra Chatterjee Lane.It is fortunate that cases of exhortation of donation from successful candidates of school service commission are surfacing now (School asks teacher to pay for post, May 12). This practice is not a new one, but it is surprising to know that this happens even to teachers appointed by the school service commission. The education department should take measures against school authorities, if found guilty. Debaprasad Mukherjee, 
Nayapatty Road.It is shameful that some political parties resort to booth jamming tactics on the polling day in order to deprive supporters of the opposition from excercising their franchise (Serpentine queues in blazing sun, a cry of peaceful rigging, May 11). If such irregularities carry on unabated, people will lose faith in the democratic system and the basic objective of democracy will be frustrated. Rabindra Nath Kar, 
Sankar Ghosh Lane. It was interesting to note that GenNext is reluctant to enter politics (Nod to vote, nay to power career, May 10). They think most politicians are dishonest but this preconceived idea is not always correct. There surely are some sincere politicians in the country, otherwise the democratic process may not have functioned for so long. The younger generation is the future of the country and only young blood can assure better leaders in future. Piyal Mukherjee, 
Lake Town. It was interesting to learn that the state government is contemplating making mandatory the sale of sweetmeats by weight (Bitter truth, rosogolla by kg, May 8). In order to ease difficulties faced by small buyers, the manufacturer can make small quantities, such as 50 gms, of sweets available for customers. Besides, the problem of weighing juicy sweets may be solved by charging a compensatory 10 per cent less than the actual price. Santosh Chakravarty, 
Unique Park. The brutal murder of the unknown woman on the maidan proves conclusively that in spite of many 21st century laws to ensure the rights of women, hardly anything can be done to actually protect them (Torture twist to murder on maidan, June 2). Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
Beleghata

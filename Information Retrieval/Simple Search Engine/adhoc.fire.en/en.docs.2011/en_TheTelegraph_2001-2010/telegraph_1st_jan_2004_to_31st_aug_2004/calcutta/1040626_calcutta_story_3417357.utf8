 															- Stringent elimination formula to stem scramble for school seats A STAFF REPORTER																								A seat in the star chamber may not book a berth in high school, after all. Students who have scored star marks  75 five per cent and above  in Madhyamik 2004 may still struggle to gain admission to some of the more reputed city schools.																								With the star student count jumping from 15,898 in 2003 to 22,127 in 2004, academic councils of various schools decided on Friday to make the screening of applications more stringent and deal with the demand-supply mismatch.																								If some schools  unable to cope with the pressure of 75 per cent-plus students  decided to slam the doors on some high-scorers the day after the results, others were working out additional interview sessions and admission tests to pare applications.																								We started the process of distributing forms from Friday and in the first few hours itself, we received over 400 applications, said Ishita Das, principal of Patha Bhavan.																								A good number among the applicants have scored very high marks. As the number of seats are limited, we have decided to conduct interviews and some other tests to screen meritorious candidates, she added.																								With an overall improvement in the Madhyamik results this time  more pass percentage (71.61 from 70.45), more first divisions (92,807 from 91,053) and more star marks  the scramble for seats, especially in the science stream, has already reached fever pitch.																								This has forced schools to return to the drawing board and revise the admission method. But if Patha Bhavan is devising oral tests for the elimination process, some schools have decided to stick to the simpler route of going strictly by merit alone.																								This year, we feel that students scoring below 92 per cent will not be able to get a seat in our school in the science stream. It will also be difficult to get a berth in our commerce stream this time, felt Father Tottham, in-charge of the Higher Secondary section of St Lawrence School.																								At Hindu School, where there is a great demand for science, the authorities said it is going to be really difficult to find a place in the much-sought-after stream.We may have to eliminate all applicants below 90 per cent marks when it comes to admissions for the science stream, said Debiprasad Purakayastha, headmaster of the institution.

 																											- 224 years on, girls seek to enter all-boy madarsa college SANJAY MANDAL																								The countrys first government-run educational institute is poised to open its doors to its first female student in 224 years. 																								Calcutta Madarsa College, established in 1780, has received applications from 13 girls who want to pursue higher studies.																								The college authorities have forwarded the applications to the West Bengal Board of Madarsa Education. The states higher education department will have to tell us how to go about it, said board president Abdus Sattar.																								Director of public instruction Subha Shankar Sarkar, however, denied comment on the issue. We believe it is an interesting proposal, but let us go through it first, Sarkar said.																								According to Sattar, several students unions, including Paschim Banga Madarsa Students Union and Calcutta Madarsa Students Union, have appealed in favour of allowing the girls in.																								The college, set up by Warren Hastings to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and the Islamic law, started its first medical courses in 1828. Since its inception, it has been a college for boys. Now, we hope to break the tradition, said a senior madarsa board official.																								This is the first time in recent memory that women have sought admission. Tanveer Ahmed, teacher-in-charge of Calcutta Madarsa College, said the applicants were mostly from the districts. The majority is from South 24-Parganas, added Ahmed. The applications were received in June-end.																								The college has around 650 students at three levels: Fazil (Plus-II, not equivalent to Higher Secondary), Qamil (treated as the graduation course) and MM (post-graduate).																								Although the college does not have a single female student, more girls (54 per cent) took this years high madarsa examination. Theology and Arabic are also taught at the college, but madarsa board officials said only 20 per cent of students passing out from high madarsas opt for these subjects.																								Nearly 80 per cent go for the common courses after the high madarsa examinations, board president Sattar said. Of the other 20 per cent, most opt for common studies simultaneously.																								K.M. Yusuf, chairman of West Bengal Minorities Commission, welcomed the proposal, but added that he was in favour of a separate shift for female students.																								Some writers and intellectuals also backed the proposal. Earlier, women students were not allowed entry into Maulana Azad College. But in the late 1980s, the college was opened for girl students. Its time for things to change at the Calcutta Madarsa College, too, observed Hossainur Rahman.

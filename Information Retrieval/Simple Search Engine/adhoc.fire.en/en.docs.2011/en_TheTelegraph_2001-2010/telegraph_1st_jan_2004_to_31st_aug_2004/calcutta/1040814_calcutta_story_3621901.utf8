 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Death-row mates on the edge
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A curious youth peeps through a gap in the front gate of Alipore Central jail, hoping to catch a glimpse of the action in the run-up to the hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee at dawn on Saturday. Picture by Amit Datta																								Mrinal Dutta has not been getting any sleep ever since the news trickled into his condemned cell at Presidency jail that Dhananjoy Chatterjee will be hanged. 																								Sentenced to death in August 2003, Dutta has been frantically asking warders whether Dhananjoy has any chance of escaping the gallows.																								In Barrackpore, Randhir Jha, charged with murder, has sent an SOS to his lawyer to come up with a sure-fire strategy that will help him escape conviction.																								Across the city and suburbs, the Dhananjoy verdict has convicts suffering from situational stress disorder and hysterical behaviour.																								Criminal lawyer Nimai Ray says most convicts, specially those on death row and the ones charged under Sections 396 (dacoity and murder) and 302 (murder), are now extremely nervous. 																								Understandably, most of them are terrified. They have closely followed the developments in the Dhananjoy case. I could feel the tension in the air. Some of them are quite depressed. 																								City-based psychiatrists feel this sudden fear among convicts  especially those like Dutta and Jha, who have been sentenced to death or charged with murder  might give way to phobia and reactive depression, which result in a person forced to shut himself in the close confines of a cell. 																								Dutta and two aides, all sentenced to death on August 21, had killed a man and dumped his body in a storeroom last year. 																								Death row convicts are desperately trying to contact their lawyers to find out when their appeals against execution will come up for hearing. Other convicts, too, are behaving strangely of late, claims a warder at Presidency jail.																								R. Ghosh Roy, who has researched the personality of jail inmates, feels the next few days will see a change for the worse in the state of mind of convicts or accused lodged in jails. 																								Another criminal lawyer, who doesnt want to be quoted, says his client, currently lodged at the Dum Dum jail, called up on his mobile phone on Friday. 																								Dhananjoy has barely 19 hours to live, what will be my fate? he asked, voice trembling in fear. 																								Psychiatrists say what is worrying the convicts most is the fact that Dhananjoys clemency petitions had been rejected so many times.																								They are fearing something similar might happen to them, says neuro-psychiatrist Chandra Shekhar Mukherjee.																								Given a choice, some of the convicts would prefer to die of a heart attack or in a natural disaster than be hanged, adds researcher Ghosh Roy.

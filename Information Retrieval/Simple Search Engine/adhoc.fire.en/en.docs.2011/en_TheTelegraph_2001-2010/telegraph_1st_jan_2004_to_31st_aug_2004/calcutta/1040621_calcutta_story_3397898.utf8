 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Seven-day service with silent smile
 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA				 	 Anuj Jain: Quiet efficiency. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Twenty-four-year-old Anuj Jain is a businessman at one of the hottest addresses in town. He holds fort at the Forum franchise of Nik Nish, seven days a week, from 9.30 am  when the sweepers march in  to 9.30 pm, long after the last customer has left.																								Anuj sits behind the cash register at the cheery store, serving each customer with a silent smile. Silent, because he is deaf and mute. Smiling, because he enjoys every minute of his work.																								Visitors may not be able to communicate with Anuj in his native tongue  American Sign Language  but he sees enough to be happy.																								The former student of Manovikas Kendra was sitting idle after completing his exams and a one-year diploma at the National Institute of Fashion Design. That was when he thought of opening a shop, and his father invested in the lifestyle store.																								Most of my friends were involved with store-keeping, and it seemed like something I could do, communicates Anuj, through younger brother Deepak.																								While the cash section is his primary domain, Anuj is also involved with management of the shop, monitoring employees and looking into administrative details with the help of his family and colleagues.																								I like being here on Sundays, smiles Anuj, hands busy signing his approval. That is when the most number of people come and buy, smiles the pucca businessman.																								That is also when most of his closest friends from Manovikas Kendra drop by at the store to hang out, now their favourite venue for an adda.																								He has a better, more close-knit group of friends than most of us, laughs a proud Deepak.																								Youngest brother Ankur  who is hearing and speech impaired, too  also drops by in the evenings, though he is still a very sharp student of Manovikas Kendra.																								Being amongst the crowd  particularly children  is clearly what keeps Anuj happy. He interacts through some of the staff here. A few people have known Anuj for some years, explains Deepak.																								And when work isnt keeping him busy, Anuj watches and plays cricket and paints portraits in oils.

 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Court rap for tainted water
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Friday advocated stern action against the authorities of public institutions with impure drinking water flowing on their premises.																								Those responsible for supplying the silent killer should be awarded exemplary punishment, observed Chief Justice A.K. Mathur. He asked government pleader Rabilal Moitra to be present in court next Friday with all relevant documents for detailed discussion on the issue.																								The court frown was prompted by a report submitted on behalf of the chief engineer of the water supply department of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). Chief engineer Dibyendu Roy Chowdhury stated in his report that a recent test on samples of the drinking water collected from various public places of the city revealed that potable water supplied by at least 21 institutions of the city were not fit for human consumption.																								On the bad-water list are three major government-run hospitals: RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Medical College and Hospital and SSKM Hospital. The drinking water there is bacteria-infested. The report also slams the water at Goenka College, in central Calcutta, and Asutosh College, in south Calcutta.																								The chief engineer said water samples from 89 public places were sent to the CMC central laboratory, of which 21 tested positive for contamination. The CMC is not supplying tainted water. There are other reasons why the water is being polluted, he pointed out.																								The division bench, presided over by Chief Justice A.K. Mathur, asked the government pleader to seek a remedy to the water-contamination problem. 																								Environment activist and petitioner Subhas Dutta then told the court that supply of impure drinking water was a crime. Why should not those responsible for these silent killings be penalised in accordance with the law? demanded Dutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Glad about NRI grab
 															- Breakthrough soon, says artist SOUMITRA DAS				 	 S.H. Raza, who is in Calcutta for the first time, at an exposition that will feature his works. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Perhaps when one is past 80, the past becomes more vivid than the present. When one speaks to S.H. Raza, in Calcutta for the first time, one gets the distinct impression that this Paris-based artist, who had formed the Progressive Artists Group along with the likes of M.F. Husain and the deceased Francis Newton Souza in 1943, is very much alive to the present and to the position of Indian artists in this era of globalisation. Yet, his prodigious memory is a treasure trove of names, meetings with people who mattered to him, snatches of Hindi poetry that he loves so much, and religious texts that he can quote chapter and verse.																								Raza is here for the opening of an exhibition titled Images and Imagination, organised by Galerie 88, where he is showing his works, along with those of Ganesh Haloi, Ram Kumar, Prabhakar Kolte, Laxman Shreshtha, Seema Ghurayya and Akhilesh of Bhopal and Sujata Bajaj, who lives in Paris. The two last-named artists are here too.																								Raza is long-limbed and slim and nattily, but soberly, dressed in black, without any sign of frippery whatsoever. His white hair is carefully brushed and he has tapering fingers that one associates with people of a refined sensibility. He is gentle and polite to a fault, without being demonstrative about it. He is articulate and he has an agile mind that allows him to speak at one moment about his first childhood encounter with the bindu, the dot that is the hallmark of his work, and the next about the virtues of NRIs snapping up contemporary Indian art cheap.																								Raza was the first Indian artist to win the coveted Prix de la Critique back in the Fifties in Paris, but when asked if European museums and institutions had given contemporary Indian art its due, he comes out with a very emphatic No. He goes on to say that recognition of Indian painting has been very slow. They are very conservative, he adds. Souza was the first Indian artist to make a mark abroad.																								Art has become a commodity in Europe, but he asserts: We are coming to a point where a breakthrough is bound to happen. Europe is cold because Indian sensibility and concepts, such as the bindu and prakriti and purush, are foreign to the West.																								Raza maintains that NRI acquisition of Indian art is a healthy thing. We should be a little chauvinistic. If Americans could back American art and Canadians Canadian art in the early stages, why should not NRIs buy Indian art?																								Fond of quoting Hindu scriptures, Raza rues the widening religious rift and bigotry in India today. Thinking of it, he feels a great sadness.

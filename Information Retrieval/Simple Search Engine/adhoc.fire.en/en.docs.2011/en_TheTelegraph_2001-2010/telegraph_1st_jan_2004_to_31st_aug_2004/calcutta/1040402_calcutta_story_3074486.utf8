 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Exploring the feminine
Ranans first independent production, Crossings, weaves together the dance forms of Kathak, Bharata Natyam and Manipuri alongside textbased drama. The production explores the various facets of the character of Shakespeares Lady Macbeth, who has lived in time by dint of a fierce personality that initially questions and finally negates the feminine in her. The diverse layers of Lady Macbeths character are unveiled with references to such figures from Indian mythology as Putana and Kali, in the process examining what it means to be feminine countered with the severe implication of being de-feminised through an inherent and existential flaw. It is this transparency between two extremes that is addressed in both the style and content of the presentation which has for its background an amalgamation of Indian classical dance, Indian classical and folk music and drama. Concept amp; direction: Vikram Iyengar.																								Event: Dance-theatre Crossings, presented by Ranan																								When: Till April 4; 6 pm amp; 8 pm																								Where: Uma, 2/4A Lansdowne Road, near Minto Park

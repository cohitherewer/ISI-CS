 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Gas leak link to blast disputed
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE 																								A month after the blast in Salt Lake, the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has rejected the police report that an LPG cylinder leak was the cause.																								On June 10, there was a massive explosion in an apartment in the townships IB Block. The residents were away, so there was no casualty. However, the blast blew off the fridge door and left the ceiling fan blades twisted.																								Police and forensic experts investigating the explosion came to the conclusion on June 27 that the cause was the formation of an air-gas mixture that got ignited as the refrigerator, on auto mode, started up.																								We are not in a position to agree with the report as it is baseless and unbelievable, said IOC deputy general manager (LPG) A.C. Dey. 																								There was no leak from the cylinder. We have conducted a separate inquiry in the presence of police and found that the oven and both burners were sound, he asserted. Besides, no leak was detected in the valve and regulator of the cylinder or in the pipeline. Then how did the gas form? Dey asked.																								He rued that the companys experts on LPG were not called during investigation. We conducted our own inquiry to find out if a gas leak was the cause of the blast, so that we could take preventive measures in future, he added. 																								Dey explained: If a gas leak is behind any explosion, the cylinder will explode. In this case, the cylinder was intact, as was the compressor of the fridge. Instead, the fridge door and fan blades were twisted out of shape. Our investigation says the cause of the explosion is different.																								IOC officials said such a report could create panic among LPG users. Let there be a joint investigation to reveal the truth. We want to dispel all fears about using LPG cylinders. LPG is a very safe fuel and cylinders do not pose any threat, provided the user follows the minimum common safety measures, deputy general manager Dey said.																								North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Parveen Kumar said the police report was based on findings of the Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory (CFSL). 																								I do not want to comment on the observations of the IOC in the case. They are free to conduct a separate inquiry. The CFSL is the official authority to deal with such cases and we have to go by their report, Kumar said.																								It was up to the government to decide on any further joint probe into the blast, said the district police superintendent.

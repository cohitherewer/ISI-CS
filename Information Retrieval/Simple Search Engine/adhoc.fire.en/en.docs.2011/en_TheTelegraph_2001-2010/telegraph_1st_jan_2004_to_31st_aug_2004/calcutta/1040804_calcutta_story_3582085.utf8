Owner of a bus on route 242 Bus-owners are being penalised on every count. When the police slap a case on the driver for racing or overtaking, the fined amount goes from our pockets. If a tyre bursts on a bad stretch of the road, we have to buy a replacement. On top of that, there are the hefty insurance premiums that we have to pay so that accident victims can be compensated by the insurance firms. If the front tyre bursts or the spindle breaks when the patch repairs wear off during the monsoon and the bus spins out of control to hit someone, is it still our fault?

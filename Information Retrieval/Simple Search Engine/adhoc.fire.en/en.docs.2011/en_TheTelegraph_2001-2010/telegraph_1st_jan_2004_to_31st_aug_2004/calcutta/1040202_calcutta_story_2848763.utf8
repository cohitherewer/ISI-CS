					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DAS The Sami Sisters   Maya, Usha and Indira with Swati Gautam (left to right)  at the inauguration of the new Necessity store at Hindusthan  Park															Tired of underwear thats ill-fitting, unflattering and altogether uncomfortable? If youre one of those whove ever been plagued by these problems, Necessity could well be the one-stop answer to all your shopping needs. Buoyed by its successful run over the last 12 years, the brand has finally stepped out of its previous outlet on Southern Avenue to newer, more swanky digs at 9, Hindusthan Park. The new 400 sq.ft store was recently inaugurated by the Sami Sisters, Usha, Indira and Maya, who along with fitness expert Bebe Mukherjee spent a good two hours at the launch, browsing through the mind-boggling variety on display.																					And quite a formidable line-up it is. For among the many options up for grabs at the store are cotton, lace and knit bras as well as those in hakoba, chikan, batik, bandhni and other eye-catching prints. Styles here range from lingerie for starters to those for extra support, special bras for mastectomy patients, sexy ones for bridal trousseaus as well as ones with intriguing heart-shaped and square necklines. These come in a range of striking hues  right from basic blacks, whites and beiges to pretty pinks, blues and pastels and more adventurous reds and maroons.																					However, its not just the wide variety of styles that is Necessitys USP. For unlike most undergarment brands that cater to only a specific number of sizes, this label, started by young entrepreneur Swati Gautam, prides itself on having over 32 sizes for everyone from the under-weight teenager to the extremely overweight. Whats more, each client at the store undergoes a free interaction with a trained counsellor and the undergarment is prescribed only after taking all possible factors into account for that perfect fit. All this, at prices that start at just Rs 129 for a simple style and go up to a maximum of Rs 219, with one bra complimentary with every three that you buy. For more on the store, call: 2465 9544.

Tania, Tanvir and  Bindu show off outfits from the newly-opened Shock												Fruits of the sea																					Theyve been coveted by Columbus, deemed the sole preserve of royalty and held in higher regard than gold by the ancient Chinese. For such is the magic and mystique of pearls that for centuries altogether, the rich and the poor alike have succumbed to their allure. Now bringing the worlds most valuable South Sea pearls to jewellery addicts in Calcutta is renowned jewellery house A. Sirkar, which recently unveiled a first-of-its-kind display inaugurated by actress Rupa Ganguly. 																					South Sea pearls, also known as the Rolls Royce of pearls, come from a species of giant mollusks known as Pinctada Maxima or Silver Lip Oyster, abounding in the seas between Australia and Japan. A shell can weigh up to 5 kilograms and grows a single pearl of commensurately large size that comes in a wide choice of lustrous colours. Of these, though, its the silver, gold and black varieties that are most prized because of their timeless beauty and iridescence.																					At the A. Sirkar showroom at 171/1A Rashbehari Avenue, South Sea pearls in all these hues and more vie for attention in a collection of stunning earrings and neckpieces in designs inspired by international trends that take in everything from the floral and geometric to the abstract. While some of the items on offer are liberally studded with diamonds, others come in matt-finish or 18K rhodium polish gold  but it is the exquisite South Sea pearls that dominate the designs.																					Prices of the collection will have you reaching deep into your wallets, for even a small pendant costs Rs 15,000 at least. For further details, call: 2440 5821/6258.

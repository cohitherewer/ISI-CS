 SOMA BANERJEE				 	 Shah Rukh lighting up is fine, but the young male adult needs to know more about smoking etiquette																								To smoke or not to smoke is the obvious ask in the puff problem  more immediate are the how, where and when to smoke questions. And thats something that the young male adult is struggling to get a fix on, with stub-it-out shouts getting louder, at work and at play.																								Ive received queries from young men wanting to know more about smoking etiquette, says Uma Majumdar, who runs a South Calcutta finishing school. They find it difficult to kick the habit but would like to smoke in a more acceptable manner, so as not to offend anyone around them. So, a grooming session dedicated to smoking habits has become a must, she adds.																								Roshan Chowdhury, whose finishing school Persona is three years old, has mostly aspiring models for students. For them, a role model often dictates their smoking style and substance. When Shah Rukh Khan lights up every now and then, it gives these young men the impression that it is nothing wrong to smoke in public, provided it is done in style. What they fail to realise is that even celebrities must stick to certain etiquette and cannot afford to do things carelessly, observes Chowdhury.																								Topping the list of social smoking dos and donts, says Majumdar, are: Dont light up suddenly (seek the permission of those around you) Check whether there are ashtrays or sand-bins at hand Blowing the smoke into anyones face, smoker or non-smoker, is a complete no-no Refrain from offering a woman a cigarette publicly, unless you know her well Dont smoke in a seminar or during a meeting.																								The smoking protocol at Writers Buildings sets the tone for the great divide between public and private smoking its perfectly fine to light up in the chambers of power, but tobacco is taboo in the corridors of power.																								In the states new-age working capital  Sector V of Salt Lake  there are some corridors of smoking certainty. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for instance, banishes all smokers to a small stretch in the workplace. Being neck-deep in work, our executives do not get the time to step out of their cubicles to smoke. So, very few frequent the smoking area, smiles Col. P. B. Chowdhury, head-administration.																								A distinct lack of smoking etiquette has made eating out a not-so-pleasurable experience for some. Grain of Salt, at 22 Camac Street, has even seen storms being cooked up over diners lighting up. There have been women who have abandoned politeness to protest the puff at the adjoining table, admits manager Atikram Gupta.																								Such resistance to smoking neighbours at the lunch table has actually forced an address that feeds the Sector V corporate crowd to redo its seating arrangement. We have noticed a high level of discomfort among non-smokers. So, we are setting up a partition and segregating six out of the 19 tables for non-smokers, says Neil Witchell, manager, Red Hot Chilli Pepper.																								Star destinations are also doing their bit to safeguard against passive smoking. If Hyatt Regency can allot 16 non-smoking covers at the Waterside Caf, at The Park, about 45 per cent at each foodstop is dedicated to non-smokers and Taj Bengal has five such tables reserved at each restaurant.

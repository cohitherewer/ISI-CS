																																																																																		Thursday evenings Norwester was different from the others so far in this years season of storms. It was accompanied by warnings from the weather office of high-velocity winds and heavy rain. Around 3 pm, experts at the Alipore Met office analysed a trough of low pressure extending from Jharkhand towards Gangetic West Bengal, as well as a cyclonic circulation in the upper atmosphere. They also noted an instability at that level, which had led to cloud formation.																																																								y 4 pm, they had concluded that the combination of these natural phenomena would lead to heavy rain, accompanied by gales of between 70 kph and 80 kph. The weather office, accordingly, issued a ground-level warning and a temporary river cap, saying that a storm with high windspeed would strike between 5 pm and 8 pm, said an official at the weather office.																																																								he storm hit the city around 7 pm from the north-west.

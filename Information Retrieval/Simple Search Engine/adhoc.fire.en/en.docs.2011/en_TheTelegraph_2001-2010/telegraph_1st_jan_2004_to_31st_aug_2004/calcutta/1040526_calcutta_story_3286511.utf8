The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Patient spurns tout, surgery denied
 JAYANTA BASU																								A corruption complaint has come back to haunt a major city-based government hospital, with a patient allegedly refused to be operated upon as his family did not purchase a steel plate required in an orthopaedic operation from a tout referred by the treating doctor.																								The complaint was lodged with the offices of the chairman of West Bengal Human Rights Commission, the principal secretary of the department of health and family welfare, the government of West Bengal, and the superintendent of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.																								Principal Jayshree Mitra Ghosh confirmed to Metro that an internal inquiry has been started and should be completed in another 15 days.																								The state health department is also learnt to have initiated an independent inquiry, starting Monday.																								The medical mess involves Md Shamsad, a 35-year-old construction labourer living in Chandernagore, who slipped and fractured his left hand while working, and was immediately rushed to Chandernagore sub-divisional hospital.																								Subsequently, the sub-divisional hospital referred him to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where he was admitted to the orthopaedic department under Dr N.C. Ghosh on April 30. 																								We thought he would be cured soon, observed Md Samser, brother of the patient. Little did he know that two-and-a-half-weeks later, he would be taking his younger brother back home, without being operated upon.																								The reason, as put down in the complaint: the family refused to purchase a steel plate  required to be installed in Shamsads left hand  at four times the market price, as quoted by the tout referred to by the doctor.																								Narrating the sequence of events, Md. Samser told Metro: Dr N.C. Ghosh had recommended an operation and advised us to purchase the steel plate from a particular person and also gave us his cellphone number. He turned out to be a tout and was demanding Rs 2,000, instead of the normal price of Rs 300 to Rs 500.																								Shamsads family members then lodged a complaint with the hospital superintendent, who advised them not to purchase anything from the tout.																								Dr Ghosh became furious. He told me categorically that he would not operate upon my brother as we had complained to the superintendent, said Samser. The patient was released in the third week of May without being operated upon and is presently under treatment in a Chandernagore nursing home.																								While Dr Ghosh could not be contacted, Sanjay Das  the tout mentioned in the complaint  brushed off the allegations, even though he admitted being contacted by the family members of patient Md Shamsad.																								I am not a tout; I am a salesman of orthopaedic instruments. I have no idea of such a complaint having been filed, he told Metro.

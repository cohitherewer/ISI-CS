 Actress June and US consul-general George N. Sibley interact with Hollywood biggies. Picture by Aranya Sen																								It was a date Tollywood could hardly have missed. In a one-of-its-kind interactive session, the local film industry got up close and personal  well, maybe not quite  with Hollywood, sharing ideas on how entertainment could be made educational.																								The video-conference hosted by US consul-general George N. Sibley and his wife Lee-Alison at American Center on Thursday evening saw a bevy of actors, directors and those associated with the film industry, including June, Anindita Sarbadhicary, Arjun Chakraborty and wife Nilanjana, and Jayabroto Chatterjee trickle in.																								On the other side of the talks table  on a video-conferencing screen  were Cindy Popp, producer-director of The Bold and the Beautiful, Joe Sachs, writer-supervising producer of ER, Mark Brown, consulting producer of Girlfriends, and Vicki Beck, director of the firm Hollywood, Health amp; Society.																								From interesting story-lines to intelligent dealing of health issues, churning out dramatic plots while feeding correct information, the Tollywood brigade had a lesson to learn from the success stories of some of the most popular shows on the US small screen.																								After the screening of video clips from the three TV shows  which consisted of episodes dealing with problems related to obesity, AIDS and alcoholism  the talk revolved around how critical health issues could be sensitively woven into a TV show to raise viewer awareness.																								We dont look for health issues and then devise the storyline. Rather, its the other way round. We think of the various aspects of characters and the crisis situations we can put them in. This enhances the dramatic quotient of the story as well, explained Joe Sachs of ER, the 60-minute primetime TV drama set in a hospital.  Actor George Clooney in a still from the popular Hollywood serial ER: Critical issues to raise medical awareness 																								We go through medical journals and call in nurses, doctors and social workers to share their anecdotes with us, which we incorporate in the plots, he added.																								Cindy Popp discussed the issues TV producers need to keep in mind while scripting a storyline that addressed sensitive issues like AIDS. In one of the episodes of The Bold and the Beautiful, which showed Christine Forester grappling with her HIV-positive husband, we had a great debate on what stand we ought to take from her fathers point of view, recalled Popp.																								Vicky Beck, who oversees outreach and research activities, including studies on the content and effects of storylines with health issues, had the most pertinent point to make. Most popular TV shows in the US deal with health issues and recent surveys have revealed that a positive storyline does have an effect on viewers, she said. A cue there for Tollywood?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 03, 2004  Nite of classic rock  SANGITA S. GUHA ROY The packed dance floor at London Pub. Picture by Rashbehari Das 															 Last week was a musical fest starring guest artistes at Someplace Else. Friday featured Mumbai-based singer Gary Lawyer belting it out with local regulars Hip Pocket, while a couple of days before that, music veteran Louis Banks son Gino provided the sound at the pub.																					Gary took his own sweet time to appear, well past 10.30 pm, as an expectant audience kept piling into the tiny space. Hip Pocket filled in with its usual repertoire, including Pink Floyds Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Bon Jovis Bed of Roses, Rolling Stones Jumping Jack Flash and Dire Straits Sultans of Swing. The packed house, out to have a good time, lapped up the sing-along covers while waiting patiently for the main attraction.																					When Gary finally did appear, he blended effortlessly with the mood of the moment, keeping up the tempo with classics like Beatles Day Tripper, Sinatras My Way, I Want To Break Free by Queen and Love Me Two Times, Break On Through and Roadhouse Blues by The Doors.																					Even though a standard covers list is a sure-fire way to please audiences, Gary has a new treat coming up for fans. An original set, written and composed by the singer, is tentatively due for an August release this year. All he is willing to let out of the bag now is that it will be an understandable rock album, produced by Mahesh Tinaikar (formerly with Indus Creed).																					ans for this album go way back, Gary admitted. Yes, its long overdue. We ran into a couple of glitches. The record label that was supposed to produce it first shut down, so we had to sign a new contract, and things like that, he explained. At the moment, he is busy working on the videos for the 12 songs that feature on the album.																					Though his schedule is hectic, he was happy to squeeze in the Someplace Else gig. Calcutta is one city I love coming back to. To me, the city has a fascinating appeal, be it in its sweet and simple people or in the historical nature of the place, gushed Gary. 																					And places like Someplace Else promoting live western music set it apart from the rest of the country, which is forever busy pushing Hindi film music and Indipop acts. India has a huge western music audience that needs to be tapped, said the showman. With proper infrastructure and a support system, there is far more scope for this genre of music in the country, he felt. Gary Lawyer performs at Someplace Else on Friday night.

Marrying old jazz standards with contemporary beats is what drives the fiery drummer.																					I have always been inspired by fusion, which allows for a lot of creative improvisation and spontaneity, said Gino, whose genre of choice is jazz funk. 																					Accompanying him were members of band Black Market, featuring Sheldon Shaun DSilva on bass, Harmeet on keyboards and vocalist Sonia Saigal. Named after the famous song by Weather Report, the band specialises in merging cutting edge, new-age grooves to old stylistic jazz sequences, that appeal to the young as well as the old.																					And thats exactly what he does for joint gigs with dad, Louis. Dad plays some excellent Indo-jazz fusion, said Gino. But my music is more contemporary than his and we have great fun blending the two together during impromptu jam sessions as well as on stage, he added.																					But dad is not his only role model. Gino has been drawing upon the rich musical experiences of Ranjit Barot, Sivamani, Simon Phillips, Mike Portnoy, Dennis Chambers, Virgil Donati and Steve Smith from an early age. Bands like Dream Theatre, Liquid Tension Experiment, Chick Correa Electric Band, Mahavishnu Orchestra and Planet X have broadened his musical horizons as well.																					Freelancing with various bands and the odd programming and studio jobs keep the drummer fairly busy apart from gigs with roaming international musicians. One of the enjoyable concerts that stand out was the one with Rashid Khan, Talat Aziz, Shaan and Sunita Rao that I did recently. But really, Im happy doing any kind of music as long as it feels good, smiled Gino.																																													Bday bonanza																					 The tune was different at London Pub on Friday night. The watering hole at The Golden Park celebrated its third anniversary with thumping remixes and Bollywood numbers, luring an enthusiastic bunch to the dance floor while a not-so-sporting group watched from the sidelines.																					The mood changed completely with Mumbai-based dancer Konkona  who will be seen on screen in the upcoming Perizaad Zorabian starrer Devaki  took the stage with her dance troupe. She performed to item numbers like Babuji Zara Dhire Chalo, Dum, Ishq Samundar, Aisa Jadoo Dala Re and Khallas in hot pants, tube tops, spaghettis and halters. 																					Resident DJ Pradeep churned out hits like Bin Tere Sanam, Chhod Do Aanchal and Its the Time to Disco during breaks between Konkonas sequences. Keeping the floor packed were prizes like best dancer and best dressed couple.

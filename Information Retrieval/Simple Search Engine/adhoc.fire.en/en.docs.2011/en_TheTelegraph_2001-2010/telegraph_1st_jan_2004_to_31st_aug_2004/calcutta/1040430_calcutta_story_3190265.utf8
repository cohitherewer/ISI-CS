																																																		In a bid to arrest the drop-out rate, the West Bengal Madarsa Education Board has taken upon itself the job of publishing and bringing out textbooks. That will make the texts cheaper from 2004-05. We have published 12 texts for Classes VI to VIII at highly-subsidised rates. The books will reach the madarsas from Friday, board president Abdus Sattar said on Thursday. A large number of students in the 508 madarsas across the state are first-generation learners and come from poor families, Sattar pointed out. We had two things in mind: keeping the price low yet maintaining quality, as per the Kothari Commissions recommendations. The publishing rate has been set at Rs 1.75 per form, Sattar said, adding that this would help check the 20-odd per cent drop-out rate from madarsas in the state. The books on Bengali literature and grammar, geography, general science, life science, physical science and history cost between Rs 12.25 and Rs 17.50. The board had floated tenders for publishers and will hold 12 per cent royalty on the books, Sattar elaborated. A stall will be set up on Friday at the boards office, where the books will be available. Teachers and madarsa heads have hailed the boards move.

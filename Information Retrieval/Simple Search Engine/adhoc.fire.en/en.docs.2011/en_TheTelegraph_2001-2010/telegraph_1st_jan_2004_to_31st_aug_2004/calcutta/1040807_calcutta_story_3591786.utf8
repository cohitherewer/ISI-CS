																								With civilization of human race, comes progress in every walk of life. But do we find the change reflected in the lives of the fairer sex? Have they undergone the transformation yet? Such a sensitive issue as this, meticulously unfolds in Women on the Edge, conceptualised by Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee and directed by Lee-Alison Sibley. Right from the ancient Greek period till the present day, women have experienced similar problems; they have gone through crises that connects them all and places them on the edge of sanity. It is this common thread of suffering that binds women, be it a Medea from ancient Greece or an Indira Chowdhury closer home. Women on the Edge brings these women and their conflicts into sharp focus. A journey of discord, born out of conflicts, which was initiated centuries ago, has taken on different shades with every passing generation. They have fought back and ensured a way of survival, a path that could very well be fatalistic but would ensure that they survived on their own terms.

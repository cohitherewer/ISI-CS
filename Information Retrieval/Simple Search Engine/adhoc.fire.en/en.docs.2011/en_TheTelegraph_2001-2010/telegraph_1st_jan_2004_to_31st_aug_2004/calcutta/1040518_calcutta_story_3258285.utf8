 Pizzas made for a delicious do at DominosKnow your pizza, up close and personal. That seemed to be the most important thing to do on a sultry Sunday evening.																								At least for a handful of 20- somethings from the Rotaract Club of Calcutta who hopped over to the Dominos Pizza outlet on Ballygunge Circular Road to see just how a pizza is made and what the insides of a kitchen doling out these yummies looks like.																								We invite young people on a regular basis to our outlets just to give them an idea of what goes into making a pizza and what hygiene standards are followed by us, said Dominos district manager Kunal Maiti.																								When the invites for domain knowledge on Dominos went out to members of the Rotaract Club, the response was more than enthusiastic. As long as we get to eat a pizza, we are happy to be part of any inspection, joked Abhishek, one of the participants for the evening.																								But the young adults had more than just sinking their teeth into the pizzas in mind. They went through the whole system of cooking, including a visit to the cold storage to get a hang of how raw materials are stored and used.																								The trip around the shop took off from the order counter and ran the gamut of the pizza-making process  from making the crust to setting the topping and finally loading the pizza on to the oven. 																								This was followed by the pizza being cut and put into the box for the delivery boys to rush out with.																								The members tried their hand at almost everything to make the swell sell pizzas, otherwise known as the perfect pizza. While the women opted to deck up the pizza toppings with fresh capsicum, tomato and baby corn, the men sliced em up and packed them into boxes.																								The best part of the evening was saved for last  finishing off the large pizzas the team had managed to cook up. Talk about pizza being of, by and for the people!						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

	Outdoor stadiums in Calcutta are in bad shape. Rabindra Sarobar stadium, constructed almost half-a-century ago, was well-maintained when it hosted the National Games in 1964. Since then, it hasnt received much attention. The sports department should renovate the stadiums in phases. Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia. 
	There is a leak in the Calcutta Municipal Corporations water pipeline on the pavement adjoining 20A, Sarat Bose Road. A lot of water is wasted continuously. Shanty-dwellers use the water for personal ends. Isnt this a waste of the tax-payers money? Azad Sen, Sarat Bose Road.

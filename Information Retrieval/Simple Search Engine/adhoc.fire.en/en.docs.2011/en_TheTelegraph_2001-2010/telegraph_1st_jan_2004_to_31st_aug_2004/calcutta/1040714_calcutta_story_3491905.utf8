The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Tripathi row laid to rest
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government on Tuesday announced that Santanu Tripathi would continue to serve as superintendent of SSKM Hospital, even if the hospital gets the necessary permission from the Medical Council of India (MCI) to start an under-graduate medical course.																								Putting to rest a controversy over the fate of Tripathi, who last year took over charge from Debdwaipayan Chattopadhyay, the government said that in case the hospital got the MCI nod to start MBBS courses, Pradip Deb, head of the hospitals radiology department, would look after the hospitals academic affairs.																								There is no question of removing an able administrator like Tripathi. We need him to look after the hospital. If and when we get the MCI nod, Pradip Deb can take charge of the college affairs, director of medical education C.R. Maiti told Metro on Tuesday.

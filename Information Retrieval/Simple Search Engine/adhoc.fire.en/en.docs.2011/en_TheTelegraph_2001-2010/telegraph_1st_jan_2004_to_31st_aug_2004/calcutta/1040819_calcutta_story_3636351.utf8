 At least one petrol pump in each blockAfter failing to improve on the chaotic traffic situation in and around the city, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has begun to tap reputed institutions and urban planners across the country for guidance in framing traffic and transportation rules for Rajarhat New Town. The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), implementing agency of New Town, held a workshop early this week. It was attended by planners from the city, Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, and even from Singapore.																								We sought the opinions of eminent architects and city planners to formulate a traffic and transportation policy for New Town. We do not want a repeat of the flaws being witnessed in Delhi and Salt Lake. Since the township is coming up on an area more than three times that of Salt Lake, we must be careful from the very beginning, explained Gautam Deb, Hidco chairman and housing minister. 																								Lee Laic, professor of the National University of Singapore, urged the government to go for a rapid transit system and called for curbs on movement of vehicles in select zones. 																								Geoff Malone, director of Malone International, a Singapore-based agency for urban planning, felt the government should allow both private and public transport systems to run in New Town. Thatll help reduce the number of private cars, he said.																								Ashes Maitra, director of Delhi School of Planning, pointed out that New Delhi and Salt Lake had committed the same mistakes while planning their traffic and transportation strategies. No provisions were made for pavements in Delhi. As a result, pedestrians had to walk on the roads, leading to accidents. Salt Lake planners, too, had made the same mistake. Its not wise to pre-suppose that everyone will own a car. Maitra said.																								Sources said the chief minister had asked Deb to formulate traffic and transportation rules keeping in mind three major factors. First, vehicles should be allowed to ply on main roads without interruption. Second, traffic should not become chaotic. And third, commuters must have a hassle-free and safe journey.																								Deb said the major thrust would be on the public transport system. Besides, efforts are on to introduce Metro Railway and Light Rail Transit in the township.

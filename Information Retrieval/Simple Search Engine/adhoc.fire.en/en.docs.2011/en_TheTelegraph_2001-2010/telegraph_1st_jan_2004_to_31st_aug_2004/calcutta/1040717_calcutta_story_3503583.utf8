 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Women, kids beaten up in dawn dacoity
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A gang fled with more than Rs 1 lakh in cash from a businessmans house after beating up the family members, including women and children, at Bishnupur, on the southern fringes of the city, early on Friday. 																								The dacoits, at least 10 in number, stormed the house of businessman Niranjan Mandal around 1.45 am. Imitating a voice known to Mandal, they asked him to come out. 																								When the businessman emerged from his room, the dacoits held him at gunpoint and later, his sons Samir and Sandip.																								Then, a few members of the gang entered the bedrooms of the house. When the women and children tried to ward off the raid, the dacoits started beating them up. 																								The other members of the gang took Mandal and his sons to their respective rooms and asked them to hand over the keys. Their hesitation was met with blows. The women and children came rushing in to save the trio, and were beaten up again. 																								By this time, some of the dacoits had opened the cupboards and removed ornaments and the cash. They gathered the booty and fled, exploding bombs in their trail to avert a chase.																								Mandals neighbours dared not come to his aid as the dacoits had surrounded the house, brandishing bombs and guns. 																								Later, they took the injured family to hospital and also called in the local police. Mandals son Sandip claimed: The police station had been alerted even while the house was under siege, but arrived at least six hours after the incident.																								Local Trinamul Congress MLA Dilip Mondal complained that dacoities had become a regular affair in the area. I have asked police to take proper action, but they seem reluctant to do so, he said.																								However, additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Subarna said the local police had reached the spot as soon as they were informed. 																								We are conducting raids to arrest the dacoits and recover the booty, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 Bonani Kakkar								President, PUBLIC																																							Why only graffiti? There are banners, hoardings and party flags all over the city, most of them in tatters. This is nothing short of visual encroachment. The election code of conduct specifies this act to be illegal. It is the responsibility of the parties to remove every scrap of poll material. City funds should not be used for this. Candidates should be shamed into removing their publicity material. Some years ago, a candidate had defaced murals painted by children on their school wall. Under our guidance, they appealed to the election commission and also repeatedly registered their protest to the candidate till he cleaned the walls again.

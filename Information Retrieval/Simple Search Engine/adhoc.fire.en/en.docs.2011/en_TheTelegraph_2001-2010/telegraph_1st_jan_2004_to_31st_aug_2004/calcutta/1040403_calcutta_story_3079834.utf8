 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Cops give Salt Lake auto rivals separate stands 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Tension simmered at Salt Lakes Karunamoyee on Friday, with a section of autorickshaw-drivers brow-beaten by Citu musclemen for the second day. 																								Around 70 auto-drivers, supported by Trinamul Congress-backed unions, lodged a protest at Bidhannagar (North) police station against the threats and assault.																								We held a meeting with two groups of auto operators. Another is slated for Sunday. The two groups will have separate stands at Karunamoyee, a police station official said. Till Friday, the Trinamul-backed operators had a temporary stand opposite Vidyut Bhavan.																								On Thursday, a group of musclemen, allegedly backed by the CPMs labour arm Citu, threatened a number of auto-drivers at the Karunamoyee stand, ordering them off the route. 																								These operators do not have a permit. They are illegal and they will not be allowed to ply on a route fixed by the authorities, explained Mrinal Das, Citu state secretariat member, who looks after the unorganised sector. 																								Police should impose a curb on them. If we see these illegal autos trying to squeeze themselves into a fixed route, our union will ward them off, Das asserted.																								Another Citu leader said: The Salt Lake incident is part of our clean-up drive. Things might have turned a bit violent there, but we intend to keep the routes free from illegal operators.																								However, the auto-drivers who bore the brunt of the Citu cadres wrath, alleged that they were forced out of the routes because they refused to pay a daily subscription to the Citu. 																								We have all the valid papers. Our only fault is that we do not pay a daily subscription to the CPMs labour arm, said one of the drivers.																								Citu cadre are forcing auto operators to pay such a subscription. Several complaints to the police stations have not had any effect, alleged Sabyasachi Dutta, Trinamul councillor.																								Although the state Citu leaders claimed they were on a clean-up drive, officials of the CPM-controlled Salt Lake municipality said their efforts to rein in the illegal autos over the years have fallen flat.																								There was stiff resistance from a section of our party when we planned such moves, said a civic official, on condition of anonymity. In the case of illegal rickshaws, too, the Opposition came from both unions, councillor Dutta added.

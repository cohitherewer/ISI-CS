The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 81-year-old robbed of vote
 AMIT UKIL 																								Kenda (Purulia), May 10: This could be her last vote and she wanted to be on the button.																								At 81, Hemi Sahish did not have much else to wish for. But she was robbed of her right.																								At Turuhulu Primary School here, about 300 km from Calcutta, the frail woman with impaired vision needed an escort to help her cast the ballot.																								But Kantiram Mahato, a stranger, walked into the cubicle and cast the vote all by himself even as the old woman waited for her escort to turn up.																								Hemi said: I wanted to vote for the Congress candidate and was looking for Shibu (her escort) when someone entered the booth and cast my vote. 																								Kantiram, a known Forward Bloc supporter, slipped out quietly but Congress supporters created commotion demanding his arrest.

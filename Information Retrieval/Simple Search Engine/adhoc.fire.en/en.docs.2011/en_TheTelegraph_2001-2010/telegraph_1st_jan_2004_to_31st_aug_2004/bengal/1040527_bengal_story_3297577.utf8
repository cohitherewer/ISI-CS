 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Divorce over polio drops
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, May 26: Montaj Sheikh divorced his wife yesterday for administering polio vaccine to their two children against his wishes.																								Sheikh, a resident of Lochanpur-Shishapara village, 235 km from Calcutta, had instructed Tulbanu Bibi not to have their children vaccinated against polio.																								Tulbanu, thus, did not go to the pulse-polio camps organised on Sunday. On Monday, too, she turned away health workers, members of NGOs and local villagers who were going door-to-door to administer the vaccine to children who had missed it on Sunday.																								But, yesterday Tulbanu allowed her one-month-old son and three-year-old daughter to be vaccinated when health workers visited her house in the Islampur area of Murshidabad district and urged her to change her mind.																								Sheikh, who was then working in the fields learnt of the vaccination when he returned home. The furious farmer uttered talak thrice addressing his wife.																								However, the village elders refuse to accept Sheikhs utterance of talak three times as absolute divorce. They say talak has to be uttered in three consecutive months and have explained their stand to his wife.																								Uttering the word talak three times at a go in an angry state of mind does not amount to divorce. So, we are not accepting Sheikhs uttering talak thrice as divorce. If the word talak is uttered three times every month within the next three months then only it will be considered as divorce, according to our religion, said Karim Sheikh, a village elder.																								The elders have rebuked Sheikh for what he has done. We were very angry when we heard what Sheikh has done. We told him not to carry this issue forward, said Wahab Ali, a villager. Sheikh, however, was not available for comment.																								My husband had strictly asked me not to have our children vaccinated against polio. According to his instructions, I did not go to the pulse polio health camps on Sunday. Health workers came to our house on Monday during the door-to-door campaign and I refused again, said a very depressed Tulbanu.																								But, yesterday, health workers, NGO workers and villagers pressured me to administer polio drops to my children and I gave in. When my husband came to know of it he became very angry, beat me up and uttered talak thrice, she said.																								Murshidabad chief medical officer (health) Sachidananda Sarkar said he had received a report from the block health officer on Tulbanus talak.																								The incident is shameful and very unfortunate. I have received a report from my block health officer. The incident is a pointer to the lack of awareness in rural areas. We have to work hard and take the polio vaccination programme forward by convincing the rural people that the vaccine is harmless, Sarkar said.																								Health officials said Murshidabad district lags behind in polio vaccination.

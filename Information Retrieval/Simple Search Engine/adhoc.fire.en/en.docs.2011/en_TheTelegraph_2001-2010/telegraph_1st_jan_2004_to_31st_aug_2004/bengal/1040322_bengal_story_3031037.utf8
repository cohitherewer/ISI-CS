 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Daughter-killer repents
 RABI BANERJEE																								Krishnagar, March 21: Two days after killing his daughter, Sanath Mandol today broke into sobs and regretted his act.																								Priyanka, barely a month old, was fed poison on Friday because she was a girl. Sanath wanted an heir. His 17-year-old wife Sonali is still crying intermittently and often hysterically. 																								Sanath confessed to his crime after the first interrogation and admitted that he had been obsessed with the idea of siring a son. A police officer said: Sanath said he prayed for a son every day when his wife was pregnant. 																								Tehatta subdivisional police officer Swapan Sarkar said: He broke down and could not utter a word for several minutes. Sanath spent the day weeping in his cell. He did not touch his lunch.																								We are investigating whether he brought the bottle of pesticide from home or got it elsewhere with the connivance of a third party, the officer added. 																								He (Sanath) killed his own daughter and deserves the highest punishment, said Sonalis father Sachin Mandol.																								Sanath was arrested from his Benekhali home yesterday morning following Sachins complaint. He has been sent to 14 days jail custody by the Krishnagar subdivisional judicial magistrate.																								Sarkar said: The statement Sanath made today clears up the case even before the investigation is complete. It is confirmed that he was obsessed about having a male child.																								The second of four brothers in a well-to-do peasant family, Sanath told his parents after his wife delivered the girl that she had suffered a miscarriage and needed to recuperate at her fathers house. 																								Sanaths father Sasthi today said he was not aware of the happenings. The only other female member of Sanaths family, his mother, passed away more than five years ago, the police said.

 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Citu faces strike fire and probe 
 OUR BUREAU																								Haldia, Feb. 27: The CPM brass has ticked off the partys labour arm, Citu, for locking up employees of Haldia dock who defied Tuesdays industrial strike.																								CPM officials said the Citu leaders of East Midnapore have been asked to explain the circumstances in which nearly 2,000 employees were kept confined in office for about 24 hours. We have reasons to believe that certain situations could have been avoided even when the union functionaries were carrying out their programme, a CPM official said. The letter seeking explanation apparently went from state party secretary Anil Biswas. 																								District Citu secretary Lakshman Seth, in a corner after the hostage drama, tried to wriggle out claiming that the Haldia unit of the Port and Shore Mazdoor Union had acted on its own, ignoring the district leaders. What happened at the Haldia dock is condemnable. What they (the Mazdoor union) did was wrong. We had no idea that they were planning to do something like that. We are now trying to fix responsibility, said Seth, also the MP from Tamluk and chairman of the Haldia Development Authority. 																								About a thousand Citu supporters, many of them armed with crowbars and bottles, laid siege to the dock complex and prevented the employees from leaving office after work on Tuesday evening. Ananta Bera, a leader of the Mazdoor union who is believed to have played a role in the siege, said his men did not disrupt work. We did not stop them from going in. Some of our supporters stopped them from coming out, he said. 																								Police today began an investigation following a complaint filed by the dock management. However, as no names were mentioned, the probe is against a group of unknown persons. 																								In Durgapur, CPM and Citu leader Debabrata Sain obtained anticipatory bail after the police started a case against him for allegedly ransacking Ganga Rasayanik, a creosote oil manufacturing and exporting unit in which he is a manager. 																								Das said he was being framed for his fight against pollution.

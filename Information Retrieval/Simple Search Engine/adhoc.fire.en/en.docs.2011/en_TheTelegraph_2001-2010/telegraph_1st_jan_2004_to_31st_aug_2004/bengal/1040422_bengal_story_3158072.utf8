The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Heist heat on unions 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, April 21: Pressure from the employees union has resulted in several unsavoury elements getting jobs at Visva-Bharati and this could have led to the Tagore Nobel heist, vice-chancellor Sujit Kumar Basu said today. 																								There are a number of persons working in the administrative wing of the university who are not only inadequately qualified but they also do not have proper cultural background. They, I think, are not fit to serve the university, Basu said. 																								He added that a section of people belonging to this unsavoury group might have a hand in robbing the Nobel medal other memorabilia. I have not bowed to the pressure created on me on various issues by the unions. These people have found employment at VB earlier. It could be that these people might be responsible for the heist and other irregularities. They might have done this deliberately to tarnish my image as the administrative head of this institution, he said. 																								The vice-chancellor said he would hand over the Justice Moloy Sengupta Committees inquiry report on the affiliation scam to the CBI tomorrow. The bureau had sought the report a few days ago as they feel the affiliation scam might have a link with the Nobel heist. 																								The matter was discussed at the universitys executive council meeting on Monday. The report could not be handed over to the sleuths till today due to some technical reasons but we are sure we will be able to submit a copy of the report to the CBI by tomorrow, Basu stated. 																								He regretted the universitys inability to release CDs of a rare collection of Tagores songs on the poets birthday next month. 																								We had a plan to release CDs of 70 rare songs in different phases. But our plan did not materialise because of the ongoing trouble prevailing at the university since the theft at Uttarayan, Basu said. 																								I believe all the stolen articles, including the Nobel prize, will soon be recovered. It is my speculation and I have full faith on the investigators, he signed off during a visit to the city.

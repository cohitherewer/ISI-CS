The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Steps to beat poll-day heat
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, April 14: Forecast for May 10 (when Bengal votes): Scorching, on the roads and in the booths. 																								Experience says Bengal witnesses some of its hottest days in May, and keeping that in mind, chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee today announced a string of measures to combat the heat on polling day. 																								The Election Commission has sent us some instructions that are to be implemented due to the heat. This is keeping in mind the voters as well as the poll personnel, Banerjee said. He discussed the measures with 18 district magistrates in a three-hour teleconference today at Writers Buildings. 																								For one, every booth must have a source of safe drinking water. We reviewed this today, and gathered that most booths do have sources of drinking water, he said. However, some tube wells need to be repaired. 																								In booths with no drinking water source, there must be arrangements for storing enough water, Banerjee told the district magistrates. 																								The poll personnel would require sufficient amount of drinking water as they have to work at booths throughout the day. Also, voters standing in the sun for hours might require drinking water, he added. In addition, ORS tablets (to fight dehydration) would be provided in the packs offered to poll personnel, he said. 																								The district magistrates have been asked to discuss with chief medical officers of health of their districts the possible deployment of medical teams. We are also hoping to arrange for spare rooms in every booth, so that voters or polling personnel taken ill can rest for a while and can be treated by a doctor, he said. 																								Banerjee added measures would be taken to ensure that physically challenged people do not face any inconvenience at booths. Trinamul complaint 																								Nationalist Trinamul Congress leader Pankaj Banerjee today went to Writers Buildings to meet Banerjee with complaints of anomalies in the voters lists from several parts of the state, including Tamluk and Tollygunge. 																								But the electoral officer, who was engaged in the meeting, did not meet him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Threat leader sorry
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER Calcutta, August 27: The  CPM local committee leader who had issued a veiled threat  to a man locked in a legal dispute with his landlord stood  in the dock today, arms folded and all apologies.																								Manabendra Aditya, the secretary of the partys south Dum Dum local committee, also gave a written undertaking to the court saying he would not repeat such a mistake. 																								In the partys official letterhead, Aditya had virtually threatened Subhrakanti Dhar with unknown consequences for not attending a conciliation meeting called by him to settle the dispute that was already being heard in the high court.																								After listening to Adityas apologies, Justice Pinaki Ghosh said: Remember not to take the law in your own hands in future. I will have to summon you again if I hear that you have interfered with the judiciary.																								Aditya, a health department employee, stepped into the dock with folded hands and sounded nervous when he said: I have done wrong my lord. Please forgive me... I acted emotionally while writing the letter. I assure you that I will not repeat the mistake. Along with the judge, a crowded courtroom witnessed the CPM leaders apparent turnaround.																								Last Wednesday, the judge had ordered Aditya to appear before him and explain why contempt proceedings should not be initiated for threatening Dhar, whose case was pending before the court. 																								Police in south Dum Dum appeared to have woken up after the court snub to the CPM leader. Officials from the local police station, who appeared before the court without being asked to, told the judge today that Dhars water connection, which landlord Subhrashankar De had snapped, had been restored.																								On August 8, Aditya wrote to Dhar: Your absence from our conciliation meetings and decision to send us a letter of your advocate prove you are refusing our initiative in favour of legal redress. We do not know if that will mean good for you. Neither us nor the residents of the area would be responsible if the outcome of your move proves harmful for you.																								Dhars lawyer had told the court that the letter amounted to maligning the judiciary.

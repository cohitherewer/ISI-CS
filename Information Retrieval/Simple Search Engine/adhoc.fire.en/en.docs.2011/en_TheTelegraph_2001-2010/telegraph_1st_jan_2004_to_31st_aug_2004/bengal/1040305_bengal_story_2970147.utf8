 OUR CORRESPONDENTKrishnagar, March 4: The owner of a nursing home at Bethuadahari near here and his wife were arrested today for allegedly conspiring with a man to kill his wife. 																								Prakash Pal, a trader who was accused of poisoning his wife, surrendered before the district court yesterday. Police said Prakash confessed during interrogation that he had poisoned Rita, 30, with the help of Lakshminarayan Das, the nursing home owner, and his wife Dipti. 																								The police said the Dases had posed as doctors, which they are not. The nursing home at Bethuadahari, 110 km from Calcutta, was sealed for not having a licence.																								Rita was admitted to the nursing home for delivery on December 10 last year. When her condition worsened, she was shifted to Bethuadahari Hospital the same day. Four hours later, Rita died. 																								The hospital authorities suspected foul play and sent the body for postmortem. The study revealed that Rita had died of poisoning. 																								The doctor who treated Rita at the hospital first smelt a rat because her medical reports during pregnancy was all right. She should not be having the complications she had, said circle inspector A. Rashiduzzaman.																								Ritas brother Tapas Dutta lodged a complaint on January 21 accusing Prakash of murdering his sister. When we received the complaint, we were armed with the postmortem report. We began a murder case but Prakash was absconding, said Rashiduzzaman. He had tried to divorce Rita to marry another woman for dowry. 																								The police said that after over a month in hiding, Prakash realised that there was no escape.

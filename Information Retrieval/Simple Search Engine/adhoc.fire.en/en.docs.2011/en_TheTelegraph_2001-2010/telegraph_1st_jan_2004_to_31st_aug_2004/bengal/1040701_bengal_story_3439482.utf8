The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 House furore on Amlashol
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 30: The Opposition today signalled its aggressive intent by raising the alleged starvation deaths in West Midnapore as the budget session of the Assembly got underway. 																								The House was adjourned after obituary references to former members Shyamadas Bhattacharya and Prabir Mallik, and other eminent personalities like former US President Ronald Reagan, Odissi guru Kelucharan Mahapatra and actor Sukhen Das. 																								The session will resume at 11 am tomorrow. 																								As Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim entered the House, Opposition MLAs led by Saugata Roy of the Trinamul Congress and Asit Mal of the Congress clamoured that the names of the five persons reported to have starved to death in Amlashol be included in the obituary list. 																								The united attempt to embarrass the government did not escape the chief minister, who asked his flock to prepare themselves to face tough questions from members of the Opposition. 																								 Bhattacharjee also advised the Left legislators not to be provoked by unsavoury remarks. 																								Of course, we will raise the issue of starvation deaths in Amlashol and in the north Bengal tea gardens, said leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee of Trinamul. 																								The controversial block-level conciliation board bill is expected to be tabled in this session as Jyoti Basu today asserted in a rally at Kalyani, in the presence of law minister Nisith Adhikari, that it would soon become a law.

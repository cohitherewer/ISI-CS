The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 CPM spice likely in Sudip seat
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta, March 7: The CPM seems to be preparing to field its own nominee in Calcutta Northwest following a lack of progress in its talks with Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) which has staked claim to the seat. 																								Nothing has so far emerged from our current talks with the RJD. They are still reluctant to offer us two seats in Bihar. Against this backdrop, we have decided to put up our nominee in Calcutta Northwest, said Jyoti Basu tonight. We are sure to sail through with the Opposition votes getting divided in the crucial seat. 																								He was referring to the confusion in the constituency where Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress has put up mayor Subrata Mukherjee, disregarding the claims of sitting MP Sudip Badopadhyay. The Trinamul rebel is almost certain to queer the mayors pitch by contesting as an Independent. 																								Talks are on about Sudip contesting with Congress support, but the party tonight said there has been no progress. If he is willing, our doors are open for him, said Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya. 																								CPM central leaders, particularly politburo member Sitaram Yechury, are believed to be still working on reaching an electoral understanding with the RJD. 																								We are still expecting the RJD to strike a seat-sharing deal with us at the earliest. Otherwise, we are left with no option but to field our nominee, Basu said. 																								CPM insiders said the leadership is considering a few prominent central Calcutta party functionaries like Sudhangshu Sil, MLA from Jorabagan, one of the seven Assembly segments that make up Calcutta Northwest. Also on its list of probables is Lagan Deo Singh, MLA from Howrah. 																								Reports suggest Sils name has found favour with the Calcutta District Committee, which enjoys a say in the selection of names. 																								Left Front chairman Biman Bose said industrialist Sisir Bajoria had approached the CPM to secure support for his candidature from Calcutta Northwest. We told him we were in no position to think about it. 																								Bajoria was not available for comment. 																								We have already finalised the name and you will come to know everything by Wednesday, Bose added. The seat is expected to be discussed in tomorrows Left Front committee meeting.

 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 Rape slur report to HC
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta/Nadia, June 12: The administrative committee of Calcutta High Court will meet on Monday to discuss the course of action to be taken about an allegation of rape against an additional sessions judge of the fast-track court in Ranaghat.																								A woman, a resident of Gangnapur in Nadia, about 70 km from Calcutta, has lodged an FIR at the Ranaghat police station against Shyamal Sengupta, alleging the judge had raped her at her residence last Sunday.																								The judge is also hearing the in-camera Dhantola loot-and-rape case in which a group of miscreants waylaid two bu-ses returning from a marriage party and allegedly raped the women and robbed their belongings in February last year.																								Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb today said a report from the district judge on the latest alleged rape case had been submitted to the state government. We have sent this report to the Calcutta High Court and are awaiting a response, he added.																								According to high court sources, the administrative committee in such cases appoints one or more judicial officer(s) to conduct an inquiry into the allegation. The high court does not take any action against the accused judicial officer till the appointed committee files a report.																								A senior judicial officer today said the high court had received reports, including a copy of the FIR, from Nadia district judge Raghu Roy.																								Swapan Dhar, the former secretary of the West Bengal Judicial Services Association, said: We are suspicious about the complaint. However, we are keeping a close watch on the developments and the association members will meet on Monday to decide the next course of action.																								The district police today decided to petition the sub-divisional court of Ranaghat to record the statement of the alleged victim before a judicial magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code.																								The woman who brought the rape charge against the judge was taken to the court by inspector-in-charge of Ranaghat police station Sunil Guha but the plea could not be forwarded as the sub-divisional judicial magistrate was absent.																								We have decided to take a statement of the alleged victim and wait for her medical report, said district police superintendent Benoy Chakraborty.																								Sources said the medical test, which was scheduled to be held today, has been deferred till Monday.

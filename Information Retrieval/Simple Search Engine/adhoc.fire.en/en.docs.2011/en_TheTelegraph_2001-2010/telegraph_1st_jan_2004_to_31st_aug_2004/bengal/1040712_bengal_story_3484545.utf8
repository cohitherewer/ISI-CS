 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Train to Nepal on trial run
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, July 11: The first Indian Railways container train to chug across the international border will begin its maiden journey from Netaji Subhas dock here tomorrow with food products meant for Nepal.																								The train will ferry cargo that is part of the World Food Programme and unload it at Nepals Birganj terminal, an official of the Container Corporation of India said today. There will be a few trial runs and we have plans to run 10 container trains every month, he added. Similar container trains are likely to be operated from the Haldia port, too.																								Eastern Railway officials said the 74-coach train drawn by a diesel engine will leave Majherhat station  at the entrance to the dock complex  in the evening for Raxaul on East-Central Railways Samastipur division, the last halt on the Indian side. After a customs check there, it will enter Nepal.																								The train will cover 763 km in about 48 hours. 																								A new 5-km track was laid between Raxaul and Birganj in 2001. The Nepal government built the container terminal at a cost of Rs 70 crore with assistance from the World Bank. The Container Corporation of India was contracted for its management. Till now, goods trains used to run till Raxaul. Officials said tomorrows trial run will usher a new era. 																								Nepalese imports from countries other than India were earlier unloaded at Calcutta and Haldia ports and carried by road to Raxaul. From there, the goods were taken by road.																								Opening of the rail route would be a boost to Indian Railways. Now, we are aiming at 70 to 80 per cent of the traffic on this route, a railway official said. 																								Nepal imports food, industrial and telecom equipment, computer spares, relief materials and chemicals through India. 																								Cement, petroleum products, coal and fertilisers are some of Indias exports to the Himalayan kingdom.

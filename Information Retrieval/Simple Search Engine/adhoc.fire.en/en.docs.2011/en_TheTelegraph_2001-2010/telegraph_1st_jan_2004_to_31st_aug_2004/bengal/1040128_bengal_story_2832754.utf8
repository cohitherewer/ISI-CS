The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Sudip smells ouster after meet snub
 BARUN GHOSH AND SATTAM GHOSH																								Calcutta, Jan. 27: The renomination of Sudip Bandopadhyay, the Trinamul Congress MP from Calcutta Northwest, appears uncertain because of his strained relationship with party chief Mamata Banerjee.																								I dont know whether or not I will be renominated this time. But the fact remains that I am being slighted in the organisation with which I have been associated since it was launched in 1999, Bandopadhyay said tonight.																								His chances of bagging a party ticket from his constituency became remote after Mamata did not invite him to a high-level meeting with BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan here yesterday. The Trinamul-BJP combines poll preparations and names of prospective candidates of both parties were discussed at the meeting.																								I am very much in Calcutta but Mamata did not care to ask me to attend the meeting. I feel humiliated, Bandopadhyay said. Mamata, also the Union coal and mines minister, was unavailable for comment as she left for Delhi this afternoon to attend an emergency cabinet meeting.																								Bandopadhyay fell from grace last year after he unsuccessfully tried to secure a cabinet berth with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis backing but without Mamatas consent. 																								He also incurred Mamatas wrath by constantly hobnobbing with central leaders of the BJP and attending railway minister Nitish Kumars programmes in the city without taking her into confidence.																								Trinamul sources said mayor Subrata Mukherjee may replace Bandopadhyay as the partys candidate in the Lok Sabha polls. Mukherjee could not be contacted as he is in Manila for a conference.																								The sources said Mukherjee has already been sounded out by Mamata. There is no problem if Subrata continues to be mayor after being elected to the Lok Sabha, a key party functionary added.																								Mukherjee has started preliminary election work in the constituency. Subrata will shortly unveil a water project in central Calcutta that will produce 6 million gallons for the residents of Burrabazar, Jorasanko and Jorabagan that fall under the Calcutta Northwest constituency, said Satyanarayan Bajaj, the Trinamul MLA from Jorasanko.																								Ajit Panja, the Trinamul MP from Calcutta Northeast who was suspended from the party for nearly two years for opposing Mamata on organisational matters, is all set to become the chairman of the partys election committee.																								Panja was assigned the job after he called on Mamata yesterday. We have set the election machinery rolling and will soon announce the names of our candidates, spokesman Pankaj Banerjee said.																								Mamata, who met Mahajan for 20 minutes yesterday, had said she was confident of a better seat-sharing arrangement with the state BJP as Tathagata Roy was at its helm.

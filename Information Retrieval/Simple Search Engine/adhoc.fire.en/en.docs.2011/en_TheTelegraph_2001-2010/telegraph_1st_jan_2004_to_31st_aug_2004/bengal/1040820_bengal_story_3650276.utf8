				 																																	Calcutta, Aug. 19: Kapil Deo Rai, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) constable arrested yesterday for allegedly raping a woman in an empty train after threatening her husband in the waiting room of Hasnabad station in North 24-Parganas, has been dismissed from service.				 																																	Eastern Railway issued a press note saying he has been axed. The railway said only Rai was involved in the incident but added that it was trying to figure out whether anyone else was involved. Rai was remanded in custody for 14 days.				 																																	Krishnagar: Niranjan Sarkar, a tailor, attacked his 19-year-old wife and her father with a kitchen knife on Wednesday morning because she refused to give in to his demand for money. A month ago, he drove out wife Mithu from his Ranaghat home. She then came to her parents at Dhubulia, 110 km from Calcutta, where Niranjan appeared. Mithu, who needed 60 stitches, is at Shaktinagar State General Hospital. Her father Suren Dey, a train hawker, has also been hospitalised. Ironically, Niranjan, who was thrashed by neighbours, is being treated in the same hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Left Front divided on Cooch Behar
 BARUN GHOSH																								Calcutta, Feb. 3: The CPM went public with its opposition to Forward Blocs nominee from Cooch Behar barely 48 hours before the Left Fronts scheduled announcement of candidates for the Lok Sabha polls.																								A day after the Bloc chose Hiten Barman, the chief of its farmers wing, for Cooch Behar, the CPM was up in arms. The partys district leaders said they will not campaign for Burman. 																								The Bloc had expelled MP Amar Roy Pradhan for anti-party activities. The veteran leader now heads his own outfit, the Subhaswadi Forward Bloc.																								The Bloc cannot take a unilateral decision. Roy Pradhan had appealed for the induction of his outfit into the front and renomination from the seat that he has retained since 1977. We want him as a front nominee because he has a better chance of winning, said Chandi Pal, the CPMs Cooch Behar secretary.																								Bloc leader and agriculture minister Kamal Guha ruled out bowing to the CPM. How can we accept our expelled leader as a front candidate? he asked.

 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Fake-paper teachers on SSC panel face the stick
 TAMAL SENGUPTACalcutta, March 2: Twenty candidates who were empanelled for the post of assistant schoolteachers face legal action after certificates confirming their Scheduled Tribe status were found fake.																								The School Service Commission has instructed its north zone office in Malda to lodge FIRs against the candidates from Balurghat in South Dinajpur. 																								Their names have already been struck off the panel drawn up by the commission, which conducts tests to recruit schoolteachers across the state.																								This is the first instance of such fraud detected by the commission since its inception in 1997. Now that it has suffered a jolt, it is planning to set up a separate wing, which will handle cases of forgery and recommend measures to check them. 																								We dont have adequate space at our office at the Administrative Training Complex in Salt Lake. But we will soon shift to our own building at EE Block, where we will have enough space to open a separate unit to handle cases of forgery, said a senior commission official. The commission is likely to shift to its new office, Acharya Sadan, by the middle of the year. 																								The examination for the recruitment of assistant teachers was conducted on March 16 last year. 																								Some senior commission officials were the first to raise doubts about the certificates produced by the Balurghat candidates. The officials got in touch with the subdivisional officer who reportedly issued the certificates. The officer told the commission that all the certificates were fake and were not issued by his office. After its suspicion was confirmed, the commission cancelled their names from its panel. 																								We have instructed our northern region to file FIRs against all these candidates as producing fake certificates is a crime, said Arun Kiran Chakraborty, the chairman of the commission.																								The west zone office of the commission in Bankura has also been instructed to cancel the appointment of three candidates who falsely stated that they had studied Bengali in the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary levels. The candidates had studied Hindi.																								The commission has now decided to strengthen its system of checking documents produced by candidates. Though it is difficult to check every certificate, marksheet and other papers of lakhs of candidates, we have instructed officials to check them more seriously and immediately consult higher officials in case of any suspicion, said Chakraborty.

 OUR BUREAU 																								Burdwan/Calcutta, July 3: Police today arrested three car-jackers who made off with a Toyota Qualis after drugging its owner, throwing the lid off an interstate car smuggling racket. 																								Burdwan superintendent of police Niraj Singh said Pintu Singh, Vijay Prasad Singh and Rajesh Prasad were held from Palsit More, about 15 km from the spot on G.T. Road where they had stolen the car. The three are from Uttar Pradesh. 																								They had intercepted an Asansol-bound Toyota Qualis on its way from Calcutta near Budbud Bridge here and drugged the owner, a businessman, before setting off for Calcutta. While we have managed to nab the three, one of their associates managed to escape, Singh said.

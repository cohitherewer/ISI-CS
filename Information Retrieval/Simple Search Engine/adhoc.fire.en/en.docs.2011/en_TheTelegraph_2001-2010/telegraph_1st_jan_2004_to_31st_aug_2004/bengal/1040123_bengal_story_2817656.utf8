The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Premji bats for Bengal 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Jan. 22: After roping in Infosys chief .R. Narayana Murthy to redraw business strategy, the Bengal government has requisitioned Wipros Azim Premji to promote the state. 																								Responding to a request from Writers Buildings, Premji wrote to Reliance chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani earlier this week asking him to consider Bengal for setting up a submarine cable landing station. 																								For the growth of IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) industry, we need more bandwidth and cheaper connectivity for companies in Bengal. Reliance has shown interest in setting up the countrys fourth submarine cable landing station in Haldia after Chennai, Kochi and Mumbai, and Premji wrote to Reliance recently to consider Haldia, said G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, information technology. 																								Tata Consultancy Services S. Ramadorai has also agreed to say a few good words in favour of Bengal, he added. 																								According to Gautama, Premjis letter highlighted why Haldia would be a natural choice and how the cable landing station  a node through which data, both voice and non-voice, is transmitted using undersea cables  can give a fillip to the states IT and ITES industry. Wipro will be kicking off its operations in the city by March and will be one of the beneficiaries of the project, which will result in faster connectivity and bring down terrestrial telephony costs. 																								BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) firms have to route their calls through some network till Chennai, Mumbai or Kochi to reach the landing points and this adds to their overheads. A landing station here will cut cost and ensure faster connectivity, said an industry expert. 																								The state, on its part, has been lobbying with the Centre for the past six months to clear the decks for a possible investment in the proposed landing station in Haldia. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has taken up the matter with Delhi.																								We requested Union IT minister Arun Shourie to give necessary permission to any private party interested in setting up a submarine cable landing station in Bengal, said state information and technology minister Manab Mukherjee. 																								He, however, added that Reliance is yet to confirm its plans to either the central or the state government. We have been informed by the company that they are now conducting a feasibility study on the landing station in Haldia, said Mukherjee.																								A Reliance spokesperson in Calcutta declined to comment.

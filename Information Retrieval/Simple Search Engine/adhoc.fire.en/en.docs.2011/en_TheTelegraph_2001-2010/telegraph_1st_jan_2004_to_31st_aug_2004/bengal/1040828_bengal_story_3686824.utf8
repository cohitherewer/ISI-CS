The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Benign Citu promise in draft pledge
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 27: A three-day conference of the Citus Calcutta district committee got underway today in the face of the chief ministers repeated criticism of the trade unions role.																								On the opening day, discussions veered round the governments expectations, the unions objectives and ground realities even as competing opinions emerged on what part the union should play at a time when the state is striving for industrialisation.																								The moderates rally round Bhattacharjee was evident in the draft resolution to be discussed in the next two days. 																								In the changing global and national scenario, we cannot cling to old forms of movement. The present demands a collaborative approach, understanding of industry and faith in the negotiating table, a delegate said. 																								The draft resolution calls for more union-management talks and less strikes and gheraos in industrial units. 																								The direction, the content of our movement needs to be changed in keeping with the changing times. A wildcat strike, without serious attempts at reconciliation, is bound to give Citu a bad name, the draft resolution says. 																								Such a disruptive act would send out a false signal about the changing industrial scenario in Bengal.																								The draft document prepared by the Citu district committee discusses how best it can supplement Bhattacharjees bid at industrialisation. It proposes formulation of a policy to ensure that industrial units and not housing complexes come up on the premises of closed factories. 																								Such land should be used exclusively for setting up units that deal in information technology, garments, gems and jewellery, sophisticated toys and the like. So far, we have utilised such land for housing and commercial complexes like the one developed at Chandmoni tea estate in north Bengal, a delegate said. 																								Jyoti Basu lent his voice to Bhattacharjees cause. He said the union would have to learn to realise objectives minus strikes or gheraos but added a rider. A government cannot send in police to break a strike, the workers last weapon, the veteran leader said.

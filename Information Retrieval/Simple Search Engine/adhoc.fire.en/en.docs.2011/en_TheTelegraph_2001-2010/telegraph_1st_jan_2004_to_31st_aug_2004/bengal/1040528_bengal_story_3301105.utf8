 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Bookshops to down shutters
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, May 27: Over 6,000 bookshops and 700 publishing houses across the state will down shutters from tomorrow in response to an indefinite strike called by the Publishers and Book Sellers Association of Bengal, affecting lakhs of school students.																								The decision was taken at a meeting of the association this evening, said Joydeb Ghosh, a spokesman of the association and owner of Model Publishing House.																								Workers of the book-binding industry had gone on an indefinite strike a few days ago  demanding an increase in wages  affecting the supply of books to publishing houses and bookshops.																								Owners of binding units, a vital component of the publishing process, had on Monday told publishers that they would be able to pay more to workers only if binding rates were raised.																								Understanding the crisis that may arise if book-binding workers intensify their movement, we agreed to enhance the rates as demanded by the binding unit-owners. An agreement was also signed. But, the binding units did not deliver a single book to us since Tuesday, Ghosh said. 																								The non-delivery of books created a supply crisis at the outlets, finally prompting publishers and booksellers to call the strike this evening.																								The strike will affect lakhs of school students who have been promoted to new classes. New sessions in schools under all major boards generally begin in May-June. Several lakh students, especially those studying in schools under the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, buy textbooks around this time.																								My son got his book list last week. He still does not have at least six books as they were not available in the market. I was told by the bookshops that the books would be available next week. My son will suffer if the strike continues for long, said Suchitra Porel, mother of a class VIII student of a Madhyamik school in north Calcutta.

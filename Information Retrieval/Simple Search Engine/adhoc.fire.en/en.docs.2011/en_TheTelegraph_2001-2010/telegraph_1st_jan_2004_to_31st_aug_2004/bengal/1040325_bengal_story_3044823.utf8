 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Students on fast 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Santiniketan, March 24: Students of the social work department of Visva-Bharati University started an indefinite relay hunger strike yesterday in protest against the authorities decision not to allow 30 students to sit for the BA examination for not having 75 per cent of attendance in classes.																								The BA final examination is scheduled to begin next month. 																								A union leader alleged that a section of teachers never attended classes on time and rescheduled them without informing all the students. He also charged the teachers with granting special favours to some students by giving them grace attendance. 																								Vice-chancellor Sujit Basu said the university will strictly follow the attendance rules but is ready to consider the cases of students with genuine grievances.

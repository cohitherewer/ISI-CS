According to commission chairperson Shyamal Sen and member Amit Kumar Sen, the report says 12 gardens in Jalpaiguri and 6 in Darjeeling were closed or abandoned by the owners. But there is no mention of the reasons behind the closure of the gardens. The report also does not elaborate whether they were closed or abandoned in accordance with provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, they said.Dhantola trial																								Responding to a government petition, the high court today directed the Nadia fast-track court to hold the trail in the Dhantola loot, rape and murder case in camera.

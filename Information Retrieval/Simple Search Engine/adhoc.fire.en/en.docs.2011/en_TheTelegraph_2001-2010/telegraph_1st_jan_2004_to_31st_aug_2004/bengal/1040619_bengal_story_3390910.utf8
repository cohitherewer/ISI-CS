The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Lawyer strike on June 23
Calcutta, June 18: Over 26,000 lawyers will stay away from courts across the state on June 23 to protest against the governments move to enact a bill that allows settling of disputes before they reach court.																								The Block Level Pre-Litigation Conciliation Board Bill will be tabled in the coming Assembly session. Bar council chairman Amiya Kumar Chatterjee justified the strike. The Supreme Court had ruled in 2001 that lawyers have no right to cease work or strike. So, we are not calling it a ceasework. We will not remain present in court that day. The anti-people bill should be dropped, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
		 Thursday, June 24, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Purulia, June 23: District inspector of secondary schools Khagendranath Sau today received a threat letter purportedly signed by the Peoples War Group. It triggered a series of counter measures, including deployment of central forces in the extremist-prone areas of the district.				 																																	District magistrate B.P. Gopalika, however, doubted the authenticity of the letter as it was hand-written in blue ink. These extremists usually use red ink and sign their communications differently.				 																																	Basirhat (North 24-Parganas): Unable to pay back Rs 10,000, trader Dilip Dey killed moneylender Rathin Howladar, 47, on Saturday night and buried his body in the courtyard of his house at Keotsa village. The body was exhumed on Wednesday and sent for post-mortem. Dilip is absconding, but his wife and mother were arrested. 				 																																	Calcutta: Police had to charge with batons to disperse about 400 persons near Jagdighata on Jessore Road protesting against an ammonia gas leak that has left about four persons in a critical condition. They were demanding that an ice-cream factory, from which the gas leaked, be sealed. About 20 persons suffered serious respiratory problems and had to be admitted in hospital. 				 																																	Calcutta: The CBI arrested the manager of the Garden Reach branch of UCO Bank on charges on taking bribe. He was apparently taking money from a woman to hasten her loan approval.

 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Sambhu spares Buddha but leaves dent on shield 
 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN 				 	 A policeman keeps watch on Sambhu (centre). Picture by Jhunjhun 																								Behrampore, June 29: Neither Naxalites nor Opposition parties, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had to be provided special protection from Sambhu, the bull, when he came here today.																								The hefty animal had stalled the chief ministers convoy in its tracks during a visit here in February and had shown a liking for white Ambassadors with red lights in the past. 																								He was put inside a police cordon to ensure that he didnt harm anybody, said district magistrate Manoj Panth.																								It was no mean task keeping Sambhu confined to the ring. But the fearless animal had earlier shown one frailty  his fear of water. 																								Eighteen policemen armed with buckets of water and plastic mugs were entrusted with the daunting task of keeping him away from Bhattacharjees convoy. They managed that. 																								But Sambhu had his revenge. About 45 minutes after the VIP convoy had passed by this afternoon and the policemen were preparing to leave, he struck a constable down. He was taken to a local hospital unconscious. 																								Six feet in length and four-foot tall with horns adding another foot, the bull has been living in the Barrack Square field for the past decade. With the gait of a ganglord, he is known to extort food from local stores, which dare not refuse. His charge is now famous in Behrampore.																								Named after a feared town sub-inspector, Sambhu is notorious for his propensity to attack passing vehicles, particularly those belonging to VIPs. 																								No wonder Sambhu knows VIPs well. Government offices, the district magistrates bungalow, the circuit house, the districts head post office and the subjudicial magistrates court surround the square. 																								Hospital sources said the condition of the injured policeman is stable.																								In February, Bhattacharjee had to disembark from his car as Sambhu had brought the convoy to a stop by attempting a head-on charge. The chief minister was amused but senior police officers were put to shame. Lengthy meetings to devise ways to keep the animal out of VIPs way followed. 																								I myself have been a victim when Sambhu charged at my car, said Gyanwant Singh, the superintendent of police. It was becoming a prestige issue for us to tame the bull.

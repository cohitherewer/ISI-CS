 MAIN UDDIN CHISTI																								Chilakhana (Cooch Behar), March 11: Two Madhyamik candidates were critically injured here this afternoon when a speeding Maruti van ploughed into them while they were crossing NH 31 in Tufanganj.																								Police said the injured were identified as Amal Das, 16, Gopal Burman, 16, and Swapan Chakraborty, 50. Amal and Gopal were returning after writing the geography paper. Chakraborty owns a hotel at the local market.																								All three were first taken to Maharaja Jitendra Narayan Hospital, about 20 km away, and later shifted to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital. 																								Ramkrishna Saha, a witness, said the speeding Maruti van first hit Amal and then Gopal. The boys were dragged beneath the car for some distance. It then veered towards the right side of the road and ploughed into the bamboo awning of Trinath Hotel, where Chakraborty was standing, Saha said. The van rammed into him and then the verandah. The driver fled the scene. 																								Moments after the news of the accident reached Chilakhana High School, teachers and students rushed to the spot and arranged for a mini-bus, which took the three to the hospital. A force from Tufanganj police station removed a roadblock put up by the residents.																								Reckless driving led to the accident. We are looking for the driver, sub-inspector Kamal Pradhan Upadhyay said.																								Amals father Budheswar Das said: I only hope that my son survives. I have so much to look forward to. He is a very good student.																								The police said the van was filled with people bound for New Cooch Behar station and, despite some injuries, they took a bus and continued their journey.

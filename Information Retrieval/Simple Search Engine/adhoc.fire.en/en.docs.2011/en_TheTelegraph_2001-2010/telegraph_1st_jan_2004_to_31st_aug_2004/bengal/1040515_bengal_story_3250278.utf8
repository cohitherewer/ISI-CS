 VIVEK CHHETRI				 	 Dawa Narbula: Trying times																								Darjeeling, May 14: After paving the way for the Congress victory, the GNLF today demanded its pound of flesh by asking Dawa Narbula to be Gorkhalands man in Delhi. 																								Dubbing the Congress win as a victory of the hill people, the party renewed its call for Gorkhaland and asked Narbula to voice the demand at the Centre. He should be Gorkhalands man first and an MP later, a senior GNLF leader said. 																								Narbula won the Darjeeling seat for the Congress by trouncing the CPMs Mani Thapa by over 100,000 votes. The GNLF, which had boycotted the general elections of 1996, 1998 and 1999 and cleared the way for the CPM, sprang a surprise by deciding to support the Congress this time.																								GNLF chief Subash Ghisingh, while announcing his decision, had made it clear that he was supporting the Congress as he expected the party to back it on the issue of a separate state. During todays victory celebrations, the GNLF categorically stated that the political stand taken by the party, including the previous boycott calls, was aimed at achieving its ultimate goal.																								Deepak Gurung, the president of the GNLFs Darjeeling branch committee, while conveying Ghisinghs message to the public, said: Our supremo has in his message mentioned that the election victory is that of the hill and the hill people. He has also said that this is how politics has to be played and we can reach our goal.																								Gurung pointed out the Congress had supported the Telengana Rashtra Samiti in Andhra Pradesh, which is demanding a separate state. That had also spurred the hill party into raising its pitch on Gorkhaland. Gurung, however, was quick to add that the GNLF was aware of the ground reality. We must realise that the political situation in other places is different from that of ours, he said.																								The Congress has so far not made public its stand on the issue of a separate state. Narbula has earlier said that he would have to follow the direction of the high command on such issues before taking a stand.

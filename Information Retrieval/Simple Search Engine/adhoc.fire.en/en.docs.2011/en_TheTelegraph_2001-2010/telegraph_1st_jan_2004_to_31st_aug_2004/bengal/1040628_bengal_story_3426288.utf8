The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 School head shunted
																								Howrah, June 27: Jobarani Mondal, the head of Santimoyee Primary School in Uluberia, about 30 km from Calcutta, was transferred today for negligence that led to the death of a child. 																								The chairman of the district primary education board, Dipali Diwanji, said the order will be served tomorrow but Mondal has been told about it. 																								Mou Mistry, a seven-year-old student of Class II, who fell sick in school on June 17 but was not allowed to return home, died on way to the Uluberia State General Hospital later that day.																								Diwanji said a probe revealed that the headmistress did not react properly after Mou fell sick. If she had been sent home when she took ill, she would not have died. Its sad that nobody cared about the cause of her illness.

Picture by Amit Datta																								Calcutta, April 6: Special election observer for Bengal Afzal Amanullah today said he is anticipating trouble during the May 10 polls. 																								After a three-hour meeting with political parties, the IAS officer from Bihar commissioned by the Election Commission to supervise elections in the state said: I think there will be a lot of problem, but we will be able to manage.																								Bracketing Bengal with Bihar, where special observers have been deputed as well, Amanullah said: Some observers have been posted by the commission as special observers in certain states, so there must be something specific. 																								Apart from Bengal and Bihar, special observers have been commissioned in six other states.																								Amanullah said the parties he met today made some substantial and serious complaints, which include allegations against police officers. Some allegations are backed by facts and figures, he said. 																								Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee hinted that allegations were levelled against the new superintendent of North 24-Parganas police, B.. Ramesh. The officer was posted in the district after the commission asked the government to transfer Basudeb Bag, who was accused of bias. The Opposition parties had submitted several complaints against Bag. 																								Amanullah also received complaints against a police station officer-in-charge. We have received complaints. These would be studied and the commission will take a view. General observers will go to their constituencies and I will also tour the districts. And after a round of ascertaining facts, I can say kya hai aur kya nahin hai (what is true and what not), he said.

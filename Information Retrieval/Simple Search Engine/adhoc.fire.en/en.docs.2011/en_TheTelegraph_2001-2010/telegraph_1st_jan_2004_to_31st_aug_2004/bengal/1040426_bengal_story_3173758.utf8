The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Jobs vacant, candidates missing
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 25: The government is unable to identify candidates to fill up half-a-dozen posts that have been unoccupied for some time or will fall vacant by the year-end.																								Officials said president of the board of primary education Jyotiprakash Ghosh, president of the board of secondary education Dibyendu Hota, president of the council for higher secondary education Jyotirmoy Mukherjee and vice-chancellor of Bengal Engineering College Amal Jyoti Sengupta will complete their tenure by December. 																								The chair of the pro vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University has been lying vacant since Ashok Nath Thakur joined West Bengal Technical University as vice-chancellor. 																								School Service Commission chairman Arun Kiran Chakrabortys one-year extension is also due to expire by the turn of 2004. 																								Senior CPM leaders who look after academic affairs are worried about the number of vacancies. They are yet to find suitable candidates for the top jobs. The partys education cell has lined up a meeting immediately after the Lok Sabha polls, apparently to discuss the vacancies. 																								Among all the rest, the vacancies in the secondary board and the higher secondary council are worrying the party brass most. The posts are crucial for both the CPM and the government as they deal with more than 900,000 examinees and face the maximum flak if anything goes wrong.																								The board and the council are under public scrutiny since a series of alleged paper leaks, breaking open of seals of question paper packets weeks before the examinations and loss of answer scripts. 																								Party insiders said those handling education are determined to stem the rot. We are serious about selecting the right heads for the two organisations, said a key CPM functionary. 																								The operations of the Madhyamik board hit a nadir during the term of Hotas predecessor Haraprasad Samaddar. The board was dragged to court after reports of widespread discrepancies in marksheets. A red-faced government had to apologise for the flaws and remove Samaddar from the post.																								Calcutta University registrar Ujjwal Kumar Bose is keen to move to the secondary board, where he had earlier served as a secretary. But in that case, the government will have to cope with another vacancy  that in the registrars post. 																								The other job on top of the priority list is that of the School Service Commission chairman. The panel that recruits teachers for government and sponsored schools has run into trouble following complaints of irregularities and several institutions reluctance to accept candidates recommended by it.

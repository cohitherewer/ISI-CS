 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Letter hitch in schoolteacher appointment
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 17: Hundreds of candidates are unable to secure teaching jobs in secondary schools despite clearing the recruitment tests because there is none to issue appointment letters. 																								Though the School Service Commission clears the candidates, the power to issue appointment letters rests with the secretaries of the institutions managing committees. But many government and government-aided schools are functioning without the committees.																								Teaching posts in a few hundred secondary schools  where the committees do not exist  are lying vacant, said Arun Kiran Chakraborty, the chairman of the commission. 																								According to practice, the managing committees  consisting of representatives of guardians, teachers and local people  are dissolved every three years. They are reconstituted through secret ballot.																								There are a few hundred schools where elections for constituting the managing committees are pending for years. The purpose of conducting recruitment tests does not get served if the teaching posts in the schools remain vacant in this manner, said Chakraborty. 																								The commission, on the basis of the results of the recruitment tests, prepares a panel of candidates for filling up the vacancies in nearly 7,000 state-aided secondary schools. The panel is then sent to the headmasters of schools where posts are vacant. The headmasters are required to place the panel before the managing committees for approval. The committees, after discussions among their members, issue appointment letters to the selected candidates. The place of posting is, however, determined by the commission.																								A worried commission, Chakraborty said, is now planning to send a proposal requesting the government to empower district school inspectors to issue appointment letters.																								Education department sources said government rules provide that it can appoint an administrator for performing the duties of managing committee secretaries in schools where elections have not been held for a long time.

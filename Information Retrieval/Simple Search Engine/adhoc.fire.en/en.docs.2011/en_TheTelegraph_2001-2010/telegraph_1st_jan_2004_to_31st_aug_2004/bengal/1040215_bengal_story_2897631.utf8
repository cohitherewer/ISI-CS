The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 Kamtapur militant arrested
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Alipurduar, Feb. 14: A hardcore activist of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation was arrested during a raid this morning at Madhya Haldibari in Alipurduar subdivision.																								Bhupesh Das, alias Kalia (24), was part of a team of six KLO militants who had entered Kumargram in the first week of February, according to Alipurduar additional superintendent of police Rahul Srivastav. On February 8, Abhijit Burman alias Shiba, and Nripen Singh Barua were arrested in a raid and four AK-56 rifles recovered from the bed of the Raidak river.																								The police are now on the lookout for the other three, Akshay Das, Binoy Chowdhury and Sanjoy Roy, Srivastav said.																								Kalia held an important position in the organisation as he masterminded most of the operations, Srivastav said. His position was similar to that of Tom Adhikary, the head of the organisations action squad who was handed over to Jalpaiguri police by the Royal Bhutan Army during Operation Flushout.																								In 1996, Kalia joined a training camp in Bhutans Kalighola and later took part in several operations in north Bengal, said the police official.																								The militant, along with KLO chief Jiban Singh and late United Liberation Front of Asom leader Rustam Chowdhury, kidnapped Roshanlal Garg, a businessman of Siliguri, police said. Kalia is also charged with killing Sunil Dutta, a CPM leader of Duramari village in Banarhat police station area during a dacoity on March 4, 2003. He also later killed CPM leader Mainul Haq and Sunil Jha, a lorry driver at Mainaguri. The same day, he killed Mohammed Mumtaz, a CPM leader of Dhupguri.																								Although the militant was not directly involved in the attack on the CPM party office at Dhupguri on August 17, 2002, he had drawn up the plan for the strike in which five CPM workers were killed, asserted Srivastav. We have information that Kalia had chalked the entry and escape routes of the militants, he said.																								Kalia is also charged with smuggling in arms from Bangladesh. In March 2001, Kalia, KLO militant Rohini Barman, KLO foreign secretary Animesh Adhikary, and Ulfa militant Smriti Patwari smuggled in 20 AK-56 rifles from Bangladesh, Srivastav said.																								He had visited Bangladesh at least seven times, informed the police official. Kalia also admitted visiting Bangladesh several times earlier and revealed that he had plans of going there to bring in more arms and ammunition, Srivastav said.

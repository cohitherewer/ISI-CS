The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Election sop to staff
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 17: As parties prepare for early polls, the Left Front government has decided to keep some of its disgruntled employees in good humour.																								The government today announced payment of two instalments of pending dearness allowance to teachers and non-teaching staff of state-aided institutions and employees of municipal and panchayat bodies and government undertakings at the same rate as that given to employees of government offices.																								The DA  with effect from January 1, 2004  will benefit about 5.6 lakh people and another 1.8 lakh retired employees. The cash-strapped government would have to shell out an additional Rs 30 crore in the current financial year for the move.																								Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who announced the decision, said the government would also release Rs 156 crore for irrigation, drinking water and road repair.																								Dasgupta denied that the governments move was a pre-election sop. The government had already expressed its view on this, he said. As for the funds released for repair work, this is the best time for such work and has nothing to do with the coming elections.																								The government has been paying two instalments of DA to its employees since July last year, leaving out teachers and non-teaching staff of state-aided institutions, employees of panchayat and municipal bodies and government undertakings. Dasgupta said no decision had yet been taken on DA dues for these employees.																								Unions of teaching and non-teaching staff in universities and colleges across the state were agitated and even threatened to organise protests against the non-payment of DA. They were angry that those working in state-aided educational institutions still drew DA at the old rate of 41 per cent while that for state government employees had been raised to 45 per cent in July. According to government norms, teaching and non-teaching staff of state-aided institutions are entitled to DA on a par with employees of government offices.

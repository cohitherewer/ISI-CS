 MITA MUKHERJEE																								Calcutta, Jan. 5: The examinations to recruit teachers in state-aided secondary schools will be delayed this year. 																								School Service Commission chairman Arun Kiran Chakraborty said though there is no fixed date for holding the tests, the commission had targeted March for this years examination. 																								The tests, he said, will be delayed by a month because of the shuffling of the commissions geographical jurisdiction. The move is aimed at helping new teachers get postings near home.																								The shuffling was initiated after the government was flooded with requests from teachers seeking transfer to institutions nearer to home. Once the new system is implemented, teachers will not have to seek transfer, said Chakraborty.																								The commission conducts the examinations to appoint teachers in 6,500 state-aided schools. More than 100,000 candidates take the tests every year. 																								According to rules, the selected candidates are posted in schools in areas specified under the region where they belong. For example, the northern region comprised Malda, the two Dinajpurs, Murshidabad, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Siliguri. This means, a candidate from Murshidabad could be posted in Jalpaiguri. Postings far from home often led to many selected candidates not taking up the job and paralysing the recruitment procedure.																								In the new system, the jurisdiction of the northern region has been split into two. Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri and Siliguri will come under a new northeast region. The northern region will have the Dinajpurs, Malda and Murshidabad.																								The southern region will consist of South 24-Parganas, Calcutta and Howrah. It included North 24-Parganas earlier. Nadia and North 24-Parganas will make the new southeast. The new eastern region will have Hooghly, Birbhum and Burdwan. The composition of the western region will remain unchanged. CMs literacy mission																								The government is planning to reintroduce the mid-day meal scheme to shore up its mission to ensure total literacy by 2010, the chief minister said today.																								We could not achieve more than 70 per cent literacy. We must now work towards cent per cent, for which we have to prevent drop-outs and draw children out of homes, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at the closing of the Vidyasagar Mela on the Maidan.

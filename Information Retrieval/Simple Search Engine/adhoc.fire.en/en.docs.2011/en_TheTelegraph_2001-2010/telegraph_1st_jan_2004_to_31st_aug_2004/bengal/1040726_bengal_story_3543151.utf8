The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Govt mulls tougher driver law 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 25: Alarmed at the spurt in accidents, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said the government is talking to the Centre on making the Motor Vehicles Act more stringent. 																								At a meeting with drivers and owners of private and mini buses, Chakraborty said errant drivers need to be punished more severely. But under the existing rules, we cannot take strong action against drivers for violating traffic rules, he added.																								The minister, along with transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, pointed out that most mishaps were the result of drivers zeal to overtake other buses and grab more passengers. 																								This is a dangerous trend and has to be stopped, Chakraborty said, making it clear that he plans to make drivers strictly abide by the traffic rules. 																								People may think the government is indirectly giving indulgence to drivers as they escape punishment due to slackness in the existing laws. But mark my words, either be disciplined or look for another trade, he said. 																								He requested the owners to introduce a fixed salary for the drivers and conductors instead of giving them commission on the basis of sale of tickets. 																								But Swarna Kamal Saha, president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate, turned down the proposal pleading the burden of taxes. Saha, who was present in the meeting, instead blamed the government for haphazardly issuing permits for buses. 																								Chowdhury said video surveillance will be introduced soon on intersections during rush hours to catch errant drivers.

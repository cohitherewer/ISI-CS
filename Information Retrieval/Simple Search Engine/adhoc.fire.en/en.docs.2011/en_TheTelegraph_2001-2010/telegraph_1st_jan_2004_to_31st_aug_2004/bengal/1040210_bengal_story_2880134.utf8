The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Flutter over fowl burial
 OUR BUREAU																								Feb. 9: Poultry farmers of north Bengal have threatened to move court against Saint Alphonsus Social and Agricultural Centre in Tung for burying alive 12,000 fowls, saying the brutal act has severely hit their business. 																								The Committee of Government and Non-government Poultry Industry said it would submit a memorandum to district magistrate Aariz Aftab tomorrow demanding a thorough investigation into the February 5 mass burial, which the Tung centres authorities said was done to pre-empt any possible outbreak of bird flu. But the poultry farmers said they suspected a well-hatched conspiracy aimed at slackening their trade.																								A preliminary inquiry conducted by the district administration has found no trace of disease in the fowls that were killed. Preliminary reports suggest that the fowls were perfectly healthy, but we have sent samples to the Institute of Veterinary Sciences in Calcutta for confirmation. The report is expected to come in a day or two, a senior official said.																								Addressing newspersons in Siliguri, convener of the poultry committee Sumit Ghosh said business across north Bengal had dropped 25 per cent since the centre, run by a Canadian Jesuit Father Joseph Murray Abraham, buried alive the fowls. The poultry market of north Bengal, which controls almost one-fourth of the states Rs 300 crore weekly business, has received a severe jolt. It created panic, jeopardising the future of over 100,000 people connected with the business both directly and indirectly, he said.																								Subrata Maity, a member of the committee, said poultry business had come down 25 per cent because of the extensive media coverage of the burial. We will start legal proceedings against the farm and also submit a memorandum to the district magistrate demanding a thorough probe. We have requested the civic authorities to begin a concerted campaign to combat the panic created by the baseless rumour, he said.																								Indicating a conspiracy, Maity sought to downplay the administrations disease-free certificate. We smell a rat and therefore want an inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter. We want to know what really led the farm to take such an important decision independently. 																								Authorities at the Saint Alphonsus centre said they were ready to face any punishment if the government found them guilty. Manager Sudhir Bhitrikoty said: We have maintained that the fowls were perfectly normal and we were only taking a precautionary measure as we did not want to put to risk the people of the region in the future. If the government thinks we have not done the right thing, we will accept any penalty it wants to impose on us.

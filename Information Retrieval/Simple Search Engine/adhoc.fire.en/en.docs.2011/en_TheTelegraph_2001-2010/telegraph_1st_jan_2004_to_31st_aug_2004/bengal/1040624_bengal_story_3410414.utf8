 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Policeman caught with paramour
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta/Nadia, June 23: A sub-inspector of Calcutta polices detective department was arrested last evening on his wifes complaint from a hotel in Mayapur, about 95 km from Calcutta, where he was holidaying with his paramour. 																								During a joint raid conducted by Hooghly and Nadia police, Pintu Ghosh was found to be carrying his service revolver. Rules stipulate a sub-inspector cannot take his gun out of office without his superiors permission. 																								We booked him for torturing his wife, said an official of Bhadreswar police station. 																								As news of the arrest reached Lalbazar, officials ordered an inquiry. A departmental probe is on. We have asked the Nadia police to send us a report, said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of the detective department. Ghosh was absent from June 15. 																								Police said Ghosh, an officer of DDs preventive wing, went missing from his Bhadreswar residence in Hooghly district a week ago without informing Nandita, his wife of seven years. When he did not return after two days, she lodged a missing diary. 																								The police found Ghosh had gone missing with his revolver without informing his seniors. The investigators started checking tourist spots as Nandita had told them her husband had gone on holidays earlier without telling her.																								Two days ago, Bhadreswar police received a tip-off that Ghosh was in Mayapur. They raided after a nod from Nadia police. 																								As soon as the joint team reached Mayapur, Ghosh was spotted by Nandita in front of Iskcons main gate. Police surrounded him. A search was carried out in the hotel where he was staying. The moment police entered the room, they found Ghoshs girlfriend, said Benoy Chakraboarty, Nadia superintendent of police.

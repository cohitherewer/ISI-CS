																								Howrah, April 29: The body of a 50-year-old maid, Chhabi Mondal, was recovered from a house in Howrah this morning. 																								Police believe the Sautia family, for whom she worked, killed her by placing sacks of hot paddy grain on her and then beating her with sticks for allegedly stealing a gold ring. 																								We have arrested Niranjan Sautia, but his wife is absconding. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said superintendent of police Mihir Bhattacharya.

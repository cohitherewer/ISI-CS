 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 IIT goes back to wisdom of the Vedas
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 5: After steering the nation on the fast track of technology, the oldest Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) is now taking a U-turn to the traditional knowledge system. 																								In a bid to dig out the best from the past and use it for the future, IIT Kharagpur is organising a three-day national conference on traditional knowledge systems of India, from haldi to yoga. 																								With increasing focus on modern science and technology, people are forgetting the richness of the Indian knowledge system. We want to initiate a process of documenting the traditional system and using it for the countrys development, said S.K. Dubey, the director of the institute. 																								From drawing up indigenous strategies for sustainable development to use of ancient Indian wisdom for healthy living with herbs, the conference, billed as the first of its kind in the country, will have six sessions and involve over 200 participants from across the country. 																								Not just a one-off conference, IIT Kharagpur has decided to take a leading role in reviving interest in the traditional knowledge systems. Talks have already started with IIT Delhi and IIT Roorkee for joint research on herbal medicines, water management system, non-chemical agriculture, architecture, Vedas and yoga. 																								We have also decided to set up a research centre on the subject and are planning to introduce an elective course for B. Tech students,  said H.R. Tiwari, of the humanities department. Interest from the engineering and scientist fraternity will hold the key to their success, he added.  Fast-track courts																								A central circular has prompted the government to set up 38 more fast-track courts by this month. 																								There are 114 such courts in the state now. The finance commission had sanctioned 152 fast-track courts for Bengal but the government had failed to set up that many in time.

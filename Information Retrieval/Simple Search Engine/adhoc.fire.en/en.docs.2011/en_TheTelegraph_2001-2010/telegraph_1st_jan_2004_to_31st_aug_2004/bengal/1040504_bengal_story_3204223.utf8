 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Wife amp; child dead, cuffs on husband
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 3: Soma Rana killed her 14-month daughter and committed suicide, apparently because her husband refused to take her to a Kali temple.																								Police today fished out their bodies from a pond at Howrahs Domjur. Soma, 30, is suspected to have jumped into the pond with Sanchari following a tiff with husband Soumen on Friday night after he refused to escort her to a nearby Kali temple to offer special prayers for the child. 																								In a diary, Soma wrote before death that she missed her date with the goddess. The police, who found it in her room, insisted that the contents will not influence investigation. Howrah superintendent of police Mihir Bhattacharya said in the evening Soumen has been arrested. 																								Soma conceived five years after marriage, apparently following a mannat (commitment) to Kali. She gave birth to the girl in March last year. 																								Soumen lodged a missing diary at Domjur police station on Saturday. The owner of an electronics goods shop, he sounded distraught. She requested me several times to take her to the temple for a special puja but I couldnt because of my business. If only I knew the outcome.

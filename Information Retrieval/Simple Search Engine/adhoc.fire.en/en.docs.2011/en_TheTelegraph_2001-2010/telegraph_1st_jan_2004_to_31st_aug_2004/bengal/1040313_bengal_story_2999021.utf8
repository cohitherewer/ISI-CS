The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Kanti passes buck to English paper-setters
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 12: School education minister Kanti Biswas today ticked off paper-setters and moderators for a tough Madhyamik English paper.																								Dont you realise the fact that students are not erudite like you? Biswas said in an obvious reference to them during a discussion on the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (Amendment) Bill, 2004, which was passed by the Assembly today.																								They (paper-setters) must remember that the Madhyamik is the first school-leaving examination. We dont expect them to show their expertise in the subject by setting difficult questions, Biswas added.																								 It is the primary duty of all paper-setters and moderators to understand that their level of knowledge is not the same as the students for whom the questions are meant. Great scholars like Sir Asutosh Mukherjee also stressed on this point, Biswas said. 																								For the third consecutive day, Opposition members voiced protest against the English paper. However, unlike other days, Biswas alone did not bear the brunt. Madhyamik board president Dibyendu Hota was under attack as well.																								We are surprised to learn that while the minister himself has offered an apology for the mess in the Assembly, the Madhyamik board chief is still silent on the matter, said Ashoke Deb of the Trinamul Congress. 																								Hota, too, deflected the blame. The paper-setters and moderators were asked time and again to be very careful, he said. Hota also promised action against the errant paper-setters and moderators.

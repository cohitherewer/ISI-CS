The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Mamata lines up revenge rally 
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta, Aug. 7: Mamata Banerjee is crying revenge. 																								On August 2, she was furious with the CPM for bringing out a rally in favour of the West Bengal Block-level Pre-litigation Conciliation Board Bill, 2004, during a bandh she had called to protest against the proposed law. 																								Now, she is planning to get even by organising a law-violation agitation at Esplanade on September 1 when the Left Front will observe anti-war day by holding a peace rally. 																								I myself, along with thousands of Trinamul Congress supporters, will court arrest on September 1 by violating the orders promulgated under 144 CrPC, Mamata said. 																								State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said the party had announced the rally two months ago. Every year we organise a peace rally on September 1 to condemn war. This time also there will be no exception. I believe Mamata will be swamped by the huge turnout of the proposed peace rally, he said. 																								Besides the front partners, other leftist parties like the SUCI and the Naxalite outfit, the Communist Revolutionary League of India, will join the rally. Over 50,000 people are expected to participate, said a CPM leader. 																								But Trinamul is not awed. Hurt that the ruling communists had ignored several requests to postpone their Monday rally, the party is bent on the September 1 agitation.

 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 High court raps police for shielding guilty
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 17: The high court had to remind policemen today that they were public servants and had to serve the interest of people.																								Slamming the force for its failure to investigate the murder of a housewife at Titagarh in North 24-Parganas last October and take action against the accused, the court asked the states top most police officer, director-general D.C. Vajpai, to look into the case.																								It should be kept in mind by every officer of the state that they are public servants and have been appointed to serve the interest of the people, said Justice Barin Ghosh.																								The court asked Vajpai to take appropriate action against the former officer-in-charge of Titagarh police station Paresh Roy, who had allegedly let a criminal escape. For no reason, the DG has not taken note of such major allegation against one of his subordinate public functionaries, said todays order.																								Justice Ghosh said the police would have to remember that they are paid from public money to take care of people. If an officer acts contrary to peoples interests at someone elses instance and that tarnishes the image of the state machinery, it is the foremost duty of the administration to investigate the allegation. 																								This, the judge said, was essential to strengthen peoples confidence in the force.																								The court order followed a petition by retired army officer Balaram Kanti Saha, who lodged an FIR on October 14 last year with the Titagargh police alleging that his daughter Sikha Biswas was killed by her husband Biswajit.																								Saha told the police that his daughter was married to Biswajit in March 1999. Two years later, she gave birth to a daughter. Days later, Sikha came to know that her husband had an illicit relationship with a girl named Mamata who stayed in Malda.																								The entry of the third party (Mamata) created bitterness in the relationship between Sikha and Biswajit and my daughter was subjected to both mental and physical torture by her husband. Around 2.30 pm on the night of October 14, 2003, when Sikha was sleeping, Biswajit strangled her to death, Saha alleged.																								In his FIR, he wrote: Amar meyeke hatya kara hoyechhe (My daughter has been killed). But Saha alleged that the police tampered with the FIR. 																								From the FIR I lodged, the police removed the letters k and e from meyeke and added atma before hatya. So, the sentence read Amar meye atmahatya korechhe, which meant My daughter has committed suicide. The police allowed Biswajit to go scot-free, said Saha. 																								When Balaram realised that the FIR was tampered with, he informed the director-general of police. But Vajpais office did not respond.																								Saha then moved the high court alleging police inaction. The courts rap to the police came after the judge went through Sahas FIR.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Crores in hand, but no uplift
 AMIT UKIL				 	 Women of Borogora at a hill stream, their only source of water. Telegraph picture																								Purulia, June 22: As many as 27 central and state government schemes are underway and as much as Rs 160 crore allocated. Yet, more than 100 villages in the district are crying for basic needs  two square meals and healthcare.																								When senior officials in the administration were told about the conditions at Borogora village in the Ranga gram panchayat area of Bagmundi block, they said there were 110 problem villages across 20 blocks. 																								We have identified these villages and are taking steps for their development, district magistrate B.P. Gopalika said last week. His assurance that officials would visit the remote village bore fruit when the Bagmundi block development officer went to Borogora and distributed relief materials yesterday. He was the first official to do so in ages. Clothes, wheat, tarpaulins, soap and even shampoo pouches were distributed to the bewildered but happy villagers. 																								That Purulia is a backward district is evident from the fact that 15 central government schemes, including the Swarnajayanti Gramin Rozgar Yojna, the Indira Awas Yojna, the Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojna, the Prime Ministers Gram Sadak Yojana and the 10th and 11th finance commissions have allocated crores for its development.																								In addition, the MPs local area development funds from the two parliamentarians from the district  Bir Singh Mahato and Basudev Acharya  have added Rs 2 crore and Rs 1.15 crore every year. Then, there are the Paschim Anchal Unnayan Parshad, the Backward Classes Welfare Scheme and a special area development programme from the state government.																								Funds are not a problem, the district has lots of it. But they have to be utilised and schemes have to be implemented, said Gopalika.																								Minister of state for the development of the region, Maheswar Murmu, who held a meeting here today to discuss progress in the district, said: Our distribution system needs to be improved.																								He reportedly snubbed officials for the sluggish development work and stressed that all funds allocated for the welfare of adivasis must be spent in time and an account of each paisa would have to be maintained.																								After the Maoist Communist Centre strikes in the Bansgarh area of Jhalda-II block in 2001, police had recommended better road communications in the region bordering Jharkhand. The proposal had been approved. 																								But the block administration has still not floated a tender for the construction of two roads connecting the interiors with Jhalda and Kotshila towns.

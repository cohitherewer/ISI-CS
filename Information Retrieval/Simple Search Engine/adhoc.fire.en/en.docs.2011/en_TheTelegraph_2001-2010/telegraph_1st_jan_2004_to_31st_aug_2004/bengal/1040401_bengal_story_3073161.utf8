The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Low tide link to dark spells 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, March 31: Bengal experienced widespread power cuts this evening as three 210 mw units of the state-run Kolaghat thermal plant remained shut from last afternoon due to acute shortage of water, needed to condense the steam generated by the boilers. 																								The shutdown led to prolonged dark spells in Calcutta and across the state. The deficit in the CESC areas was about 90 mw and reached 150 mw in the state electricity board-served areas. The state board, therefore, restricted supply to the CESC grid and provided about 200 mw, in place of about 300 mw. 																								The three plants were closed as authorities could not pump in water from a canal that channels in a part of the Rupnarayans flow. Heavy siltation at the mouth of the canal has blocked the water flow. The situation has been compounded by the very low tide  mora kotal  in the river, usual at this time of the year. 																								This is a natural phenomenon and we are helpless. We have contacted Calcutta Port Trust authorities and (are) planning to dredge a channel through the silted canal mouth to let water in, said power minister Mrinal Banerjee. 																								He said an appeal has been made to factories requesting them not to draw power for production between 5 and 11 pm to enable the state electricity board to supply as much power as possible to the domestic sector in view of the Higher Secondary examination beginning tomorrow. 																								The power crisis is unfortunate at a time when so many students are appearing for their HS exams from tomorrow. We will contact the power department and request them to ensure uninterrupted power supply, said Dibeyendu Chakraborty, secretary of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education. 																								A state power board official said tonight the situation was brought under control by overdrawing about 457 mw from the NTPC plant in Farakka. The board usually takes 523 mw every evening.																								He said the appeal to industries also yielded results. We found that the industries consumed less electricity this evening and this way we saved about 100 mw that we could supply to the domestic sector, said the official. 																								Officials of the Power Development Corporation Ltd, which runs the Kolaghat plants, said the low tide had set in over the past few days and the authorities were running the units with the help of water stocked in the plant reservoir. 																								The stock in the reservoir ran out and from yesterday afternoon we were forced to shut down three units in phases. We are expecting the high tide to set in from tomorrow and will start one unit as soon as we get the water, said MD Birenjit Pal.

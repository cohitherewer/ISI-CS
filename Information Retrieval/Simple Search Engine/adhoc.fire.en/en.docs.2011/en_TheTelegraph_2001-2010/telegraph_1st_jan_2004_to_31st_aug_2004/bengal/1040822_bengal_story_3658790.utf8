 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN																								Behrampore, Aug. 21: Sambhu, the terror of Behrampore, is at it again. The bull that detained chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy on February 8 is the cause of trouble for a local doctor who faces a compensation demand from a Congress leader.																								Sambhu had attacked the Behrampore block Congress president, Arun Sarkar, on July 19. Sarkar was admitted to a local nursing home with a fractured right arm.																								The Congress leader was released from the nursing home after being treated by H.K. Mondal, but the arm did not show any sign of improvement. Sarkar was then treated at a nursing home in Calcutta.																								Sarkar returned home a few days ago when his condition improved and lodged a complaint at the district consumers forum against Mondal for negligence, demanding Rs 4,91,000 as compensation.																								I first went to the Behrampore General Hospital with the broken arm. However, as there was no orthopaedic surgeon there, I visited Mondals chamber. I was admitted to a local nursing home where Mondal had my arm plastered, recounted Sarkar.																								But, as the pain did not subside, I went to Calcutta for treatment. Doctors at Calcutta told me that my arm would have had to be amputated if I had come much later, Sarkar said today.																								I decided to move the consumers forum against Mondal as I sustained considerable financial loss because of his wrong treatment, clarified the Congress leader.																								Mondal, however, denied charges of negligence.																								Sarkar came to me with a broken arm that was profusely bleeding. He was under my treatment for about a week, but then stopped visiting my chamber. How can he hold me responsible for his condition without allowing me to complete the treatment? asked Mondal.																								Besides, I had warned Sarkar that the wound could get infected if sufficient care was not taken, observed the doctor.																								Sambhu, who was named after a former sub-inspector of Behrampore town police, Sambhu Roy, however, has been roaming around without much hindrance.																								The bull had also once detained the car of former district magistrate Manoj Panth and overturned a Maruti van belonging to the former chairman of the Behrampore municipality, Akbar Kabir.																								The district administration is yet to chalk out a plan to contain Sambhu, who poses a serious threat to the residents of the area.

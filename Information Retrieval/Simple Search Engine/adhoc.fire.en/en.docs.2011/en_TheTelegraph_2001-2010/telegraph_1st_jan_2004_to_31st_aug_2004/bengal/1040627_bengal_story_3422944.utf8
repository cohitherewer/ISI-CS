The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Lawyers smart under CM silence 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 26: The state bar council has called an emergency meeting on Wednesday after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did not respond to their pleas for a discussion on the controversial block-level conciliation board bill. 																								The proposed bill will empower block-level boards appointed by panchayats across the state to settle legal disputes involving amounts up to Rs 1 lakh. Litigants would not be entitled to appeal to any court against a board decision. 																								The state bar council, an apex body of lawyers, has been on the warpath since the government hinted that it would introduce the bill in the budget session beginning June 30. 																								Aggrieved lawyers observed a token ceasework last Wednesday as a mark of protest against the move to curb the fundamental right of rural litigants to seek justice. 																								Saradindu Biswas, council executive committee member, said today: A week has passed since we sought an appointment with the chief minister to convey our grievances on the proposed bill. But till date we have not heard from the CMs office. So we have decided to review the situation on Wednesday and intend to start a continuous movement across the state to put pressure on the government to give up the retrograde move. 																								Biswas added that the chief ministers enigmatic silence on the councils demand indicated that the government has no intention of discussing the bill. 																								Sources said the lawyers are divided on the mode of agitation against the governments decision to bring the bill. While most of them are opposed to a continuous ceasework and favour other forms of agitation like dharna, hunger strike, rallies and demonstrations, the hardcore elements do not mind resorting to an indefinite strike.

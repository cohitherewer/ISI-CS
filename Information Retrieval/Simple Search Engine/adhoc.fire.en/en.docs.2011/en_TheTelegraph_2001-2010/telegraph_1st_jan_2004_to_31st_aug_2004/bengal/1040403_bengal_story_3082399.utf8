The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 New set of papers
 Calcutta, April 2: A fresh  set of question papers would be prepared for the biology  second paper examination scheduled for April 15, an embarrassed  secretary of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary  Education said.																								We are ashamed, said Dibyendu Chakraborty. The way wrong question papers were taken out is unwanted. These mistakes are occurring despite instructions to the centres-in-charge and centre secretaries. We have ordered a probe. 																								A clerk at the Cooch Behar treasury had by mistake opened sealed packets of the Madhyamik life science paper about a fortnight before the examinations began.																								The council had promised that it would ensure the Madhyamik mistake is not repeated. Today, it urged the government to punish the centre-in-charge at Siddheswari High School in Chanchol, Malda.

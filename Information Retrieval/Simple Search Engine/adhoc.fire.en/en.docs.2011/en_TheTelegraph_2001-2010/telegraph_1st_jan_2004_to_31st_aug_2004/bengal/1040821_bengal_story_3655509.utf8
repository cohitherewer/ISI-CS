 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Widower damages case against doctors
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, Aug. 20: A bank officer has filed a Rs 15-lakh malpractice case at the district consumer court against a couple of doctors and a nursing home whom he blames for his wifes death. 																								Sisir Ganguly, branch manager of Gour Grameen Bank at Samsi in Ratua, lost his wife Shikha on January 19, two days after he took her to gynaecologist .R. Saha. 																								Ganguly called reporters home this morning to say he filed the case in the consumer court on Wednesday. Asked why the claim for damages seven months after the death, he said he bought books on medicine and pored through them before going to court. 																								My wife Shikha Ganguly, who was 42, died because of the doctors negligence. After her death, my life and that of my two sons has completely changed. I want those involved to be punished to set an example, he said.																								His wife was bleeding on January 17 when Ganguly took her to Saha. The doctor examined her and asked for blood tests and an ultrasonography. After going through the reports, he advised her to get admitted to a nursing home the next day.																								 Ganguly said soon after admission Shikha was given two units of blood. But my wifes pressure shot up and she started throwing up. Seeing her condition, the gynaecologist referred her to another physician, D. Bose.																								The second doctor examined Shikha on the evening of January 18 and he felt that she needed more blood. 																								On the next day, two more units of blood were procured from the bank of the district hospital, but they were not required as my wife passed away in the morning, Ganguly said. 																								The death certificate issued by Saha read, death due to cardio-respiratory failure because of severe anaemia.																								In Gangulys opinion, Shikha was given more blood than required and so she died. I read several medical books over the past few months and spoke to a number of doctors. Only after that have I decided to file the case, he said.																								Saha said when Shikha was brought to him, she needed blood. She was severely anaemic. There is no chance that what we did was wrong, no question of negligence.

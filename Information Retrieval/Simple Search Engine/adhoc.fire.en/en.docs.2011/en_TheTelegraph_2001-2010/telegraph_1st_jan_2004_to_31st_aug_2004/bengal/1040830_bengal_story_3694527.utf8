The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, August 30, 2004 				 Trinamul bypoll plan
																								Calcutta, Aug. 29: Trinamul Congress youth leaders Madan Mitra and Sanjoy Bakshi have been chosen party nominees for the bypolls to Shyampukur and Jorasanko Assembly seats to be held in October. 																								The seats fell vacant after Forward Bloc legislator Subrata Bose and the CPMs Sudhanshu Sil were elected to the Lok Sabha.																								Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said the party would finalise a candidate for the Entally seat by tomorrow. That seat fell vacant when the CPMs Mohammad Salim was elected to the Lok Sabha. 																								Sources in Trinamul said the selection of the Entally candidate was delayed by infighting. Sultan Ahmed, who had lost to Salim earlier, has apparently declined to enter the fray.

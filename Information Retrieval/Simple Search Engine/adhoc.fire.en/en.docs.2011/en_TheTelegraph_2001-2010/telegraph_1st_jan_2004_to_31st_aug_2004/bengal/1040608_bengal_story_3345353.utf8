 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, June 7: Mitali Pal has been waiting for nearly five years now to get a job since her husband Dulal, a group-D employee at the Midnapore district collectorate, died in 1999.																								The district magistrate and other senior officials had recommended her name for the job but after filling up several forms and undergoing the statutory medical test came the bifurcation of the district into east and west in 2002. Mitali has not heard from the authorities since.																								The mother of two school-going daughters and a son is in a quandry over how to pursue her case. It is difficult to make ends meet with a pension of Rs 2,645.																								Like Mitali, Tuhin Bera and Sangita Biswas are also waiting for their promised job since their fathers died in the late 1990s. Tuhins father worked in the land and land reforms department, Sangitas was an employee in the office of the Jhargram subdivisional officer in undivided Midnapore. 																								In all, 21 families are awaiting jobs for one of their members since the death of either a father or a husband. 																								The district administration had decided to absorb them in the land and land reforms department as there were vacancies, a senior official said. Sources said the process of providing jobs to 24 families was started in 2001 but slowed down after the bifurcation of Midnapore.																								Officials seemed secure in putting the blame for the delay on the districts division. Many vacancies were created in either district following the bifurcation but the then DM of West Midnapore filled up the vacancies in his own district. This led to uncertainty over 21 other people who were hopeful of a job. Mind you, all these jobs were recommended officially as per rules, an official said.																								We repeatedly requested the authorities here as well as in Writers Buildings but that did not yield result, said Tuhin.																								 Assistant secretary of the land and land reforms department L.K. Banerjee wrote to the West Midnapore authorities in August last year asking them to look into petitions of the 21 job applicants. But nothing has moved yet. 																								Additional district magistrate (general) Surendra Gupta who looks after such recruitments said steps were being taken to get the appointments cleared by higher authorities. We hope that we will get our instructions soon, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Nayana missing at Sudip show
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta, Feb. 20: Sudip Bandopadhyay today organised a convention to measure the mood of Trinamul Congress workers in his constituency but no legislator, including wife Nayana, turned up. 																								The meet didnt go unattended though. About 2,000 Trinamul workers were there to express solidarity with the Calcutta Northwest MP who has been asked by the party to contest from Raiganj in the Lok Sabha polls.																								Bandopadhyay reaffirmed his unwillingness to move over to Raiganj and fight against his mentor, Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. I am overwhelmed with your request to once again enter the fray in Calcutta Northwest, he said. 																								I shall convey this feeling to our party leader Mamata Banerjee. You should start writing graffitis in my favour. I will certainly contest from my seat. But I will take a week to decide on which symbol, said the rebel leader.																								However, Trinamul leaders again ruled out the possibility of renominating Bandopadhyay. The chapter is closed. The party does not also approve of todays meeting, said Pankaj Banerjee, the party spokesman and leader of the Opposition.																								As he has been doing of late, Bandopadhyay reminded his audience of the days of struggle together with Mamata. She has forgotten, he said.

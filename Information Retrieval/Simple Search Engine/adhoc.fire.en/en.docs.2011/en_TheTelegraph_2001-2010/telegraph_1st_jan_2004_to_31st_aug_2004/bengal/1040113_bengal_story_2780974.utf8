The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Hunt for cop father-in-law after torture
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Taherpur, Jan. 12: The Nadia administration today issued a warrant against Government Railway Police sub-inspector Nitin Das who was accused of torturing his daughter-in-law.																								Shankar Majumdar, a sub-inspector of the police camp here, was suspended this afternoon for not acting against Das even after she complained. Das is absconding. Majumdar was not available for comment.																								Married last year to Das son Rathin at Taherpur village, about 75 km from Calcutta, Dipika, 19, was allegedly subjected to regular physical and mental torture. The rail police sub-inspector attached to Krishnagar station was the sole bread-earner in the family and his unemployed son refused to react to Dipikas complaints for fear that he might be thrown out.																								A humiliated Dipika left for her parents house on January 4 and four days later, mustered courage to approach the police against her father-in-law. 																								I am ashamed that Majumdar did not take any action against Das even after a specific complaint. The FIR details the torture. I am left with no option but to suspend Majumdar and issue an arrest warrant against Das, superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty said today.

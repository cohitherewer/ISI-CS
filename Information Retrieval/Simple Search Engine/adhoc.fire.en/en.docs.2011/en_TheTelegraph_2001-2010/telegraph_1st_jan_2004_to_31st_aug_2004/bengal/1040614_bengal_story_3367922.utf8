 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Pacemakers not for a lifetime: Govt
 							 - Cheating complaints prompt advisory  A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 13: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today informed cardiac patients that pacemakers do not last a lifetime. 																								The advisory was issued after several complaints that representatives of pacemaker companies had conned patients into buying pacemakers with lifetime guarantees without telling them that the gadgets had limited life and their batteries needed to be replaced. 																								We are getting complaints almost everyday from hapless heart patients who, after purchasing lifetime pacemakers, are finding in the third or fourth year that the gadgets are not functioning at the desired level because the batteries have only limited life, said Chittaranjan Maity, director of medical education. 																								Many patients, fitted with pacemakers they believed would last them a lifetime, had approached the government after the gadgets began to malfunction for want of new batteries and its makers refused to replace the batteries according to with the lifetime warranties. 																								Sankari Das of Howrah received a pacemaker at SSKM Hospital in 1997. The agency of a Germany-based manufacturing company had provided the pacemaker for Rs 43,000 with a lifetime warranty. However, in May 2004 it was exhausted and doctors recommended a new pacemaker.																								When her son, Rabindranath, approached the agency, he found that it had been replaced by a new one. He appealed to the company for free replacement but was turned away on the ground that the pacemaker actually had only 48 months warranty. 																								After intervention by the hospital authorities and persuasion from the present agency, the company agreed to replace the equipment at a nominal service tax of Rs 6,000. 																								We advised the patients relatives to take up the issue with the agency as without the replacement, the patient would have been in mortal danger, said Santanu Tripathi, medical superintendent of SSKM. 																								Partha Roychowdhury, regional manager of the Mumbai-based Interventional Technologies Pvt Ltd, said his agency has received complaints from 40 patients who were sold pacemakers with lifetime warranty that were exhausted within five years. 																								Pacemaker manufacturers said the basic problem lay with the battery. Usually lifetime warranty means a pacemaker battery running for around 12 years. However, in this particular model, the battery life was much less, said an official.																								With the chips of pacemakers becoming smaller, the manufacturers are trying to reduce the size of the batteries too. So the life span of a battery is also reduced, he added.

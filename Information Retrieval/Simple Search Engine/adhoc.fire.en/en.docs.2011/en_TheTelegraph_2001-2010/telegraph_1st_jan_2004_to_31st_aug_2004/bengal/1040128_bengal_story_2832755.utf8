 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 No Sahib, Mamata doles out sop
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 27: Months before the general elections, Union coal and mines minister Mamata Banerjee launched a social security scheme for workers in the unorganised sector. 																								The scheme will help poor wage-earners. Now, they will be able to sustain themselves when old with the pension provided by the scheme. They need not beg or borrow from others, the Trinamul Congress chief announced. 																								Union labour minister Sahib Singh Verma, who was supposed to launch the scheme in the state, could not attend the programme as he was caught up in Delhi.																								You just need to approach the officials of the Regional Provident Fund office to fill up the form and pay a one-time registration fee of Rs 500. The form will be processed and an identity card will be issued to you in a couple of days. You need not pay anyone to get yourself registered, said Mamata.																								Those between 18 and 35 years of age will have to deposit Rs 50 every month and those between 36 years and 50 will have to give Rs 100. The scheme offers Rs 500 every month as pension on retirement at the age of 60, family pension in case of death of the worker or total disability, a personal accident cover of Rs 1 lakh and health insurance for a worker and his three-member family at Rs 548 annually.																								We want the scheme to benefit people at the grassroots. We will open provident fund offices in the districts to enable farmers, cobblers, tailors, auto-drivers, hawkers and other such people belonging to the unorganised sector to take advantage of the scheme. It will provide them security and help them lead a tension-free life in old age, Mamata said.																								(Prime Minister Atal Bihari) Vajpayee is fully aware of the need to provide basic social security to workers in the unorganised sector. This is just the beginning and we assure a bright future to all the workers in the unorganised sector, said Mamata.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Job for mine victims son
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Durgapur, March 29: A day after Eastern Coalfields Limited shovel operator Taraknath Gope was killed in a mishap, his 19-year-old son got a job at his fathers workplace, Jambad open cast mine.																								Taraknath, 39, died when a chunk of land caved in while he was accompanying an inspection team at the mine, about 200 km from Calcutta, yesterday morning. His body was recovered in the evening. 																								His son Babon received the appointment letter during the day. I really needed the job but never thought it would come my way under such circumstances, Babon said.																								ECL personnel manager Ujjal Mukherjee said: Babon has already joined as trainee worker. However, he will not be able to attend office for a few days because of his fathers last rites.																								Union coal and mines minister Mamata Banerjee called ECL chairman Abdul Kalam to enquire about the incident. 																								Taraknaths colleagues alleged that the authorities did not take adequate safety measures. We have to work at our own risk. Such subsidence may occur anytime, said Kalyan Ghosh, a mechanical filter operator at the Jambad mine.

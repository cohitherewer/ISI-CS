The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 Bandh bar plea in high court 
- Bombay HC has shown us the way, cries lawyer
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 26: Buoyed by the Bombay High Court fine of Rs 20 lakh each on the BJP and the Shiv Sena for a bandh called last year, a trio moved Calcutta High Court today challenging the legality of the Bengal bandh Trinamul Congress has called on August 2. 																								The petitioners demanded damages for the loss to be incurred because of the shutdown.																								However, in the Assembly, politicians bridged all divides and adopted a unanimous resolution opposing the Bombay High Court verdict. Left Front chief whip Rabin Deb raised the issue and legislators from the Congress and Trinamul supported him. 																								The democratic right to protest was at stake after the Mumbai order, they said.																								At the high court, Sekh Sahjahan, Laila Begum and Tarak Chakraborty argued that political parties had no right to paralyse life in the wake of the Supreme Court verdict banning bandhs and hartals. 																								The apex court had categorically ruled that the parties responsible for curbing the right of people to move freely should have to pay the penalty by way of fine. The Bombay High Court verdict was (pronounced) in the light of the apex court judgment, which should be a precedent in similar cases across the country, the petitioners said.																								Appearing on behalf of the petitioners, Idris Ali, also the leader of the Congress minority cell, said: At least on two earlier occasions, I filed cases seeking the courts orders asking political parties to call off bandhs. On all the occasions, Calcutta High Court expressed helplessness and said as the administrative machinery was with the state government, the judiciary had no role to play. But, this time, Bombay High Court has shown us the way.																								The state, Ali said, loses about Rs 300 crore because of a bandh. Every daily labourer has the right to claim compensation from the parties for calling the bandh, he added. The division bench of acting Chief Justice A.N. Roy and Justice A.K. Mitra would again hear the case on Friday.																								Legal experts said the judgment of a high court may not be acceptable to its counterparts in other states. Only orders of the Supreme Court are laws of the land and every high court is bound to follow it, said one of them.																								The Anglo-Indian community urged Trinamul to call off the bandh that clashes with World Anglo-Indian Day.

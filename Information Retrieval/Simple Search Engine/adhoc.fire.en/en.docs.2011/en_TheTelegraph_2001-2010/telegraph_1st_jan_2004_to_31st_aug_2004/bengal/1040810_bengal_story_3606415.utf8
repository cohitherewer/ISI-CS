				 																																	Dhantola (Nadia), Aug. 9: Three persons were injured when BSF jawans opened fire last night at a mob that attacked them. 				 																																	Around 9.30 pm, two BSF jawans stopped a Ranaghat-bound bus at Boronberia near Dhantola and began inspecting it. When the jawans got up, the passengers mistook them for dacoits. Last year, several women were allegedly raped while the buses they were travelling in were robbed. They started beating up the two, prompting one to open fire. 				 																																	Barasat: A mob led by Forward Bloc activists vandalised 15 online lottery centres here. 				 																																	Calcutta: The government has introduced a medical insurance scheme for state police personnel. The scheme, initially meant for constables, head constables, assistant sub-inspectors and sub-inspectors, provides for an annual medical cover of Rs 50,000. A monthly amount of Rs 46.25 is deducted from a policyholders salary as premium.

 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Yechury rejects Cong tie-up
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 26: CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury today reiterated that his party will neither join any front with the Congress nor go for any joint programme. 																								He also ruled out possibility of joining a coalition government in Delhi headed by the Congress. (The) Congress represents the ruling class in our country and forming an alliance with the party means joining hands with the ruling class. As a communist party, how can we go for this?																								Asked if his party will accept Sonia Gandhi as the Prime Minister, Yechury said: It is really difficult for me to answer this at the moment. The MPs of the largest political party select their leader as the Prime Minister. How can I predict																								Yechury rejected the notion that the CPMs stand on the Congress in the state and outside will confuse voters.

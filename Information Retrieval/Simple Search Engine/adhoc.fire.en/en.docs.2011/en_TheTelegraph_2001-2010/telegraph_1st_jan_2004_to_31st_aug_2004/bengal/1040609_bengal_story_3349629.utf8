The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Monsoon plays truant 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, June 8: The monsoon is so near, yet so far.																								According to the book, it should have set in today but the Met office said rains could be expected only after June 10. 																								Favourable conditions in the Bay of Bengal, required to drag in the monsoon currents, are yet to take shape. 																								The director of the weather section of the regional meteorological centre at Alipore said a low-pressure system over the bay is essential to bring in the monsoon currents. 																								There is a cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal near the Andhra Pradesh coast and a circulation near the Myanmar coast that is leading to the formation of clouds. We need such a system to become stronger so that it can pick up the monsoon currents and bring it over south Bengal, said K.K. Chakraborty.																								The monsoon currents slowed down over the past couple of days because of a depression in the South China Sea. However, that depression is shifting in a north-eastern direction and losing grip over the monsoon currents, the weather director added. 																								Officials said there was a high possibility of early rain this year as the monsoon advanced rapidly and reached Jalpaiguri in north Bengal on May 23, about 12 days ahead of schedule.																								But the monsoon did not proceed any further till last week, when it covered the rest of north Bengal. Then, it stopped again and remains confined to the north Bengal districts.																								There are many reasons behind the slow progress of monsoon. After it reached Jalpaiguri on May 23, there was no cyclonic circulation in the Bay of Bengal to drag it south. There was a low-pressure trough line stretching from Haryana to the Andamans but it was not strong enough. Then the development over the South China Sea slowed the monsoons progress, a weather official said.																								Even as most parts of south Bengal continued to thirst for rain, parts of South 24-Parganas were experiencing floods.																								Minister of state for irrigation Ganesh Mondal said he would visit Canning and Kakdwip subdivisions, where vast areas were flooded by the Hooghly and Matla rivers during pre-monsoon high tide on Friday. 																								Large parts of Sagar Island, Namkhana, Pathar Pratima, Mathurapur , Kultali, Basanti, Canning and Gosaba are now under water. Thousands have been rendered homeless and crops destroyed. The cabinet discussed the situation at a meeting this morning.

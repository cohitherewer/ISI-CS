The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Erosion horror revisits early 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Panchanandapur (Malda), July 14: The Ganga broke its banks last night, devouring three villages in four hours. 																								Monsoon misery struck Panchanandapur earlier than feared as the surging waters of the swollen river swamped Hajaritola, Kabirtola and Jahantola, displacing more than 100 families. 																								Only a ring embankment and the Malda-Panchanandapur state highway now stands between the raging river and Bazar Para.																								The river, however, did not catch the residents unawares. Wizened by its run last year, most had moved to higher and safer ground. The stragglers, too, began moving out yesterday. 																								Ganga Erosion Resistance Committee secretary Rafiqul Islam said the erosion started early this year. Last year, the erosion began on August 5. On September 5, the river claimed the irrigation departments building, Ganga Bhavan. I shudder to think of what will happen as the monsoon progresses, he said.																								The 7 pm to 11 pm destruction yesterday is only a prelude of things to come, said an irrigation department official.																								We have warned the administration and zilla parishad the river will strike with devastating fury next month. We have asked them to evacuate all residents of Panchanandapur, he said. 																								Panchanandapur, a cluster of 27 villages till two years ago, has been reduced to a knot of 10 hamlets today. Residents, more than 10,000 of them, fear nothing will be left of it after this monsoon.																								Last nights erosion reduced the area of the gram panchayat by another half a kilometre.																								There is every reason to believe that Panchanandapur (I) gram panchayat will be wiped out this time, Islam. Last year we watched helplessly as 14 villages fell to the rivers fury. The speed and magnitude of last nights erosion does not bode well for us.Flood toll rises 																								The flood situation in Cooch Behar remains grim though there has been no rainfall in the past 24 hours. Over 50,000 people have been left marooned in Toofanganj subdivision and the death toll has risen to five.																								Two more bodies were found during the day, taking the death toll to five, officials said.

 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Bharati wants to hear it from Kohli, face to face
 REZA PRADHANKalimpong, July 18: She looked pale and withdrawn, but determined to put up a brave front. 																								Bharati Das, 32, still had the vermillion bright in the parting of her hair when she faced reporters at the Upper Cart Road home of her parents. 																								In the face of a barrage of questions, she expressed her desire to see her husband, Mike Davis alias Maninderpal Singh Kohli  the prime suspect in the rape and murder of British schoolgirl Hannah Foster  now lodged in Kalimpong Subsidiary Correctional Home. 																								Kohli, who fled UK after the incident, married Bharati in June and has lived here since. 																								He tried to flee the hill town as newspapers flashed his pictures as wanted in the rape and murder case and Hannahs parents, who came over to Chandigarh, made an emotional plea to launch a police search.																								Kohlis arrest from Panighatta, about 120 km from here, on July 15 prompted Bharati to go into hiding, possibly to escape the humiliation. 																								She had known Kohli as Mike Davis, a man keen on working with the Red Cross, whose local chapter her father headed. A sandwich-delivery driver in Southampton, Kohli has a wife and two children in UK. 																								Bharati said all the time they were on the run she was under the impression that they were shopping for their new home. 																								I was shocked when I heard that he was the prime suspect for the murder and rape of Hannah Foster. I am confused, but feel happy for the Fosters. I still cannot believe he has done it. He was always very good, not only to me, but also the people and children here. I always felt safe with him, said Bharati, making an effort to conceal the quiver in her voice.																								I dont know if he is guilty, but I want to meet him and ask him about it. If he is guilty, it is good he was caught. 																								It had been love at first sight for the social worker, who met Kohli at a medical camp in March. We came to know each other through medical camps. I was very happy for the short time that I was married to him, said Bharati. 																								Kohli and Bharati had eloped on June 17. Bharati said: Whenever I asked him about his family, he would say they were in Bangalore and refused to talk about his past. 																								The Das are living a near nightmare. Local residents are asking Bharatis father Oath Bahadur Das, the secretary of the Kalimpong unit of Red Cross Society, if the Hepatitis-B vaccines administered at the medical camps were genuine. Das, 60, today issued a press note saying they were.

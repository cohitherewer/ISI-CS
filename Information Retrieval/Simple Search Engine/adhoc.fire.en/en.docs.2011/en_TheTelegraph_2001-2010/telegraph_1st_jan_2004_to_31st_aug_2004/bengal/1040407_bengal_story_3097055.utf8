 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Sobs save madarsa headmaster from jail
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER Calcutta, April 6: A madarsa  headmaster was jailed today for disobeying a high court  order and released after he broke down and sobbed.																								The court had asked Baharuddin Ahmed to prepare the service book of a retired teacher, who took legal recourse in 2002 realising that he was not getting pension even a year after retirement as his service book was not in order.																								Abdus Sattar, a teacher of Chanchol High Madarsa in Malda, retired on January 31, 2000. He died six months ago. 																								Justice Barin Ghosh read out Ahmeds sentence today. He was sobbing since the judge began. Court officers handed him to police after the judge finished and Ahmed was rushed to an outpost on the premises for formalities before being sent to jail. The headmaster in tears collapsed in the camp. 																								Government pleader Rabilal Moitra rushed to Justice Ghoshs court and prayed for a stay on his order. And the judge obliged. The order was recalled and Ahmed was released.																								Once released, Ahmed started running. He wouldnt even listen to frantic calls from his lawyer.																								Moitra assured the judge that the government would take all possible steps to disburse the teachers pension to his widow.																								Sattar had asked for his pension before the Malda authorities, who told him that the madarsa had not sent them his service book.																								After more than a years wait, the teacher filed a petition before the high court, seeking its intervention. On June 12, 2002, Justice Ghosh asked the district madarsa authorities to take steps to release the pension immediately. 																								The order was not carried out. Sattar died during the period and his widow continued the case. She filed a contempt petition against the district madarsa authorities.																								Following the petition, Justice Ghosh asked the authorities why his earlier order was not carried out. 																								The Malda officials told the court that Ahmed did not send the service book even after repeated requests.																								The court then summoned the headmaster. Asked why the service book was not sent to the district authorities, Ahmed could not provide a satisfactory reply. 																								His lawyer argued that two women were claiming to be Sattars wife and hence the delay in preparing the service book. At this, the judge became furious. Justice Ghosh said preparing the service book could have nothing to do with how many wives the dead teacher had.

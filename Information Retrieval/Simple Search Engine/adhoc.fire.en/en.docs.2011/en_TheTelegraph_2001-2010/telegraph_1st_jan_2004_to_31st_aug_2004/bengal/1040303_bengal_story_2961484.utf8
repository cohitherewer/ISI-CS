 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Bypoll in poverty seat
																								Calcutta/Burdwan, March 2: The byelection to the Khandoghosh Assembly seat, which CPM legislator Jyotsna Singh quit driven by poverty, is likely to be held along with the Lok Sabha polls on May 10. 																								Jyotsna gave in her papers as an MLA to accept the post of superintendent of a girls hostel in Balurghat, South Dinajpur.																								A day after she quit, Jyotsna said she needed the job more than anything else to sustain her family of two unmarried sisters and three unemployed brothers, one of them a Class IX student.																								Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said: I shall inform the Election Commission about the gazette notification concerning the resignation of the CPM legislator. It is up to the commission to take a final decision.																								The CPM said it is looking for a nominee from Khandoghosh. We shall select our candidate by early next week, said Amal Halder, the partys Burdwan secretary, who had claimed that Jyotsna resigned because she was sidelined in the party.																								Chandranath Mukherjee, a Trinamul Congress district secretary, said: We are sure to wrest the seat defeating the CPM candidate.

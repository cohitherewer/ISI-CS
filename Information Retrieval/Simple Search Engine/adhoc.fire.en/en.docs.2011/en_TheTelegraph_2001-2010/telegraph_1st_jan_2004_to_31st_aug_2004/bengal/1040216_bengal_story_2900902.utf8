 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Independent Sudip to fight whimsical bosses
 BARUN GHOSH  Calcutta, Feb. 15: A defiant  Trinamul Congress MP Sudip Bandopadhyay today said he would  not shift from Calcutta Northwest to Raiganj to oblige  some people and instead contest from the city seat as an  Independent.																								Enough is enough. I dont find any justification for my shift to Raiganj, a place with which I am not even remotely connected. This is unjust and vindictive, Bandopadhyay said. His barbs were directed at party chief Mamata Banerjee and a section of the party opposed to his candidature. 																								Bandopadhyay said he would contest as an Independent to lodge my protest against such (his party leaderships) autocratic style of functioning. He added: I have decided to seek re-election from Calcutta Northwest as an Independent risking the displeasure of the party bosses. There should be a limit to whimsical politics.																								Asked if this will amount to violation of party discipline, an agitated Bandopadhyay said: Nothing doing. I cannot go to Raiganj leaving my people here in the lurch. I cannot disown my voters, who want me to seek re-election from the seat.																								Bandopadhyay, smarting under the humiliation of being denied a patient hearing by Mamata, said: It was an insult. I wrote to her yesterday requesting her to sit with me to sort out the problem arising out of my candidature. But she suggested that I talk to those at the helm in the election committee. I dont expect such behaviour from my leader.																								The Trinamul MP recalled the time he was expelled from the Congress in 1997 along with Mamata and the formation of Trinamul the next year. Today Mamata has forgotten the past and is out to finish my political career, he said, but left room for rapproachment, adding: I still regard her as my leader.																								However, key Trinamul leaders are angry at Bandopadhyays insistence on being allowed to contest from Calcutta Northwest. We are watching the developments. If he contests violating the partys decision, he will face disciplinary action, said Mukul Roy, a Trinamul general secretary. Roy said the party would step in as soon as Bandopadhyay enters the fray. Didi wants him to contest from Raiganj and if he does not, he will face the music. 																								In a bid to cash in on the squabble within Trinamul, the Congress said it would back Bandopadhyay if he contests as an Independent and seeks support. But he has to make his stand on the NDA clear. We shall extend support only if he parts with the NDA and contests as an Independent, said former party chief Somen Mitra.																								The CPM today reiterated that a party veteran will fight from Calcutta Northwest to cash in on a split in Trinamul votes if Bandopadhyay contests mayor Subrata Mukherjee. 																								Veteran CPM leader Jyoti Basu said: We are particularly interested in this seat. We have decided to field a formidable nominee to take on the duo and wrest Calcutta Northwest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Foul, cry all parties
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, May 10: Wiser from her experience of the 2001 Assembly elections, Mamata Banerjee did not flash a V or compliment people in advance. 																								Minutes after todays polls, a cautious Trinamul Congress chief got lieutenant Pankaj Banerjee to allege rigging and lament the Election Commissions failure to prevent CPMs scientific manipulation.																								Lawyer legislator Kalyan Banerjee by his side, Pankaj said: Like in 2001, a huge number of voters could not venture out of their homes to exercise their franchise as they were terrorised by the cadre. Though the EC tried its best to hold the elections free and fair, the Marxist government frustrated this by not cooperating with the poll observers. 																								The Trinamul leaders who met reporters at a makeshift party office called for re-polling in booths where the CPM goons resorted to booth jamming and scientific rigging. 																								Pankaj said: We are preparing a list of the polling stations where the CPM terrorised voters and even our candidates in connivance with police.																								The Leader of Opposition in the Assembly referred to Hema Choubey, the party nominee from Panskura in Midnapore who was allegedly harassed by the police and CPM supporters while visiting a booth. Imagine the state of affairs prevailing in Bengal, Pankaj said.																								Congress leaders echoed their Trinamul counterparts. They alleged that CPM activists heckled state Congress chief and Jangipur candidate Pranab Mukerjee outside a booth in Murshidabads Sagardighi block. We condemn the attack on Mukherjee, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said. It has exposed the CPMs terror tactics.																								Bhattacharya also alleged that the CPM had rigged a large number of booths in Purulia and Murshidabad and demanded repolling. Sultan Singh, the Congress candidate from Howrah, said he boycotted the polls to protest against rigging. 																								The CPM, too, demanded re-polling. In 34 booths across the state. CPM politburo member and Left Front chairman Biman Bose said that Congress supporters in Domkol under the Murshidabad Lok Sabha seat captured six booths. 																								The CPM, Bose said, has called for repolling in 14 booths in Bhatpara under Barrackpore in North 24-Parganas and 13 booths in the Nanoor Assembly segment under Bolpur in Birbhum. 																								In all the booths, the party apparently could not deploy agents as Trinamul activists resorted to violence. Bose said the front has demanded repolling in a booth in Tamluk. 																								Special election observer Afzal Amanullah said he had received reports of intimidation, booth jamming and forced vote casting from across the state.

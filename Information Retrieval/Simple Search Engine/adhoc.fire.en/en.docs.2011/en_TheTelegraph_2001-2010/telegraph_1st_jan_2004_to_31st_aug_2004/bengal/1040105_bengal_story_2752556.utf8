The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Wanted: school managers
 MITA MUKHERJEE  Calcutta, Jan. 4: For a  headmaster, being an academic is not enough. He has to prove  his merits as a manager as well. 																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is planning to make it mandatory for all candidates applying for the post in state-aided secondary schools to prove in an interview that they have a strong personality and appropriate managerial skills. 																								We have submitted a report to the government suggesting ways we can test the personality and managerial skills of aspirant headmasters. We may implement the decision from this year if we get the governments nod, said School Service Commission chairman Arun Kiran Chakraborty. 																								The commission, which conducts tests for recruiting teachers of state-aided schools, also recruits headmasters. 																								Officials said the government is working on a formula to reorganise the procedure of headmasters recruitment in over 6,000 secondary schools across the state. We have initiated the move to introduce personality tests for headmasters, they added.																								In the existing system, there is provision for a viva voce for candidates applying for the post of headmaster, but it is not compulsory to appear in it. Moreover, the candidates are only asked questions relating to the subjects they have studied at the postgraduate level.																								Sources in the education department said the government is now planning to make the recruitment procedure more scientific. The personality test will carry 10 marks. The candidates awareness of social and environment issues will be examined during the interviews and teaching and leadership abilities tested.																								Education officials admitted that reports of poor management from many secondary schools prompted the government to overhaul the headmaster-recruitment procedure. 																								We are unhappy with the reports from some educational institutions, where academic activities are disturbed because of faulty management, said an official.

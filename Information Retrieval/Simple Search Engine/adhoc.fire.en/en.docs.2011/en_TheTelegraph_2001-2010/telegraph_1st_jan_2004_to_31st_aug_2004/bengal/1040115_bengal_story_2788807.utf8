 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Purulia, Jan. 14: The Howrah-Chakradharpur passenger train carrying over 200 travellers averted a possible mishap following timely detection of a fracture in the track between Tamna and Kantadih stations in the Purulia section of South Eastern Railway this morning. 																								According to reports, the crack was noticed by a villager from nearby Dhanara when he took his cows out for grazing. As the train approached the spot a little after 8 am, he waved a piece of cloth to draw the drivers attention. The train stopped just metres away from the crack. 																								A team from the engineering department of Purulia station, about 15 km away, reached the location and fitted a fish-plate to fill the gap. The train resumed its journey after a 52-minute halt while repairs were carried out. 																								Adra divisional railway manager K.B.. Mittal, however, said the fracture was noticed by the driver who stopped the train in time. By a stroke of luck, a maintenance engineer happened to be in the locomotive on that stretch. He could have also noticed the crack. His presence facilitated the repair work, Mittal said. 																								He explained that such fractures commonly occur in extreme temperatures.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 CM in rebel tough talk
																								Calcutta, March 8: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today vowed not to let Peoples War (PW) activists hinder the conduct of the Lok Sabha polls in May, says a staff reporter.																								Addressing reporters at the Assembly lobby, the chief minister said security has been beefed up in four vulnerable police station areas  Belpahari and Binpur in West Midnapore, Bandwan in Purulia and Ranibandh in Bankura  where the guerrillas are active.																								We have tightened the security so much that the PW activists are not being able to sit together and hold secret meetings. We will not allow them to disrupt the poll process in Bengal and we are sure they dont have the strength to do so, Bhattacharjee said.

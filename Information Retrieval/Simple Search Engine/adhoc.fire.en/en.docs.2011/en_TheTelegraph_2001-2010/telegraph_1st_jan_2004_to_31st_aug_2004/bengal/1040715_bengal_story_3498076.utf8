The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Doctors cry foul at pushy pill-pushers 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Kalyani (Nadia), July 14: Half-a-dozen newly appointed doctors in the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital here today lodged complaints with the superintendent and police against harassment by medical representatives. 																								They said a section of medical representatives in connivance with wholesalers have been threatening them over the past fortnight to prescribe the drugs they wanted them to. 																								Hospital superintendent Nirupam Biswas forwarded the complaint to district chief medical officer of health Prabas Chowdhury and director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee. 																								We will conduct an inquiry. We shall not tolerate any intimidation A doctor has every right to prescribe the medicine he thinks is best for his patient, said Chatterjee in Calcutta.																								The doctors said it was becoming impossible for them to work in the face of such threats. They named Shankar Nandy, a wholesaler who runs a medicine shop in front of the hospital, in the FIR as the mastermind. 																								Nandy said he was innocent. 																								Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said Nandy was named in the FIR after a threat call to a doctors mobile phone was found to have been made from his house. 																								The doctors said representatives of some small medical companies were pressing them during outdoor duty to prescribe certain medicines which have been blacklisted by the authorities as inferior. 																								Biswas said the entry of medical representatives into the hospital was restricted recently as they added to the chaos and disturbed doctors during working hours at the outpatients department. 																								He also accused a section of hospital employees of being in league with the medical representatives. 																								We were really frightened, particularly in the wake of the recent murder of a doctor (read Sushil Pal). We could not sit and wait any longer, said a complainant, Sanjiv Haldar.

 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Cop pays for attack on health staff
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, May 26: The officer-in-charge of Chanditala police station was suspended last night for failing to arrest villagers who had misbehaved with Hooghly zilla parishad sabhadhipati Krishna Banerjee and attacked officials accompanying her to a polio immunisation camp Sunday.																								Kamal Bairaggya, an official of the district intelligence bureau, has replaced Narayan Samanta, who had taken charge of the police station on March 8.																								Banerjee had gone to Sahana village under Kapasaria gram panchayat around 3 pm on Sunday to supervise the polio immunisation programme as some villagers were not allowing their children to be given the dose.																								When they reached the house of Kibat Ali, who had also objected to the dose being given to his child, some villagers attacked them, injuring Banerjees security officer, Sadhan Biswas, and some health officials. Five persons were admitted to Chanditala rural hospital and three people were arrested.																								Banerjee had lodged a complaint with superintendent of police Ajoy Kumar on Sunday. I am not satisfied with the role of the Chanditala police, which did not arrest those who had actually targeted us. The police later released on bail those arrested, she told the media this evening.																								On the basis of the complaint, Kumar today suspended Samanta and sent him to the district police lines in Chinsurah.																								I am confident that the role of the local police was not satisfactory. The OC also did not handle the case properly and that is why I have placed him under suspension, Kumar said.

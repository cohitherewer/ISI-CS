The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Militant worth $64,000 arrested
 PROBIR PRAMANIK																								Siliguri, March 30: A bandage strapped across his right eye, the 50-year-old master strategist of the dreaded Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) looked anything but the top gun whose name was synonymous with terror in his strife-torn homeland. 																								Mohan Baidya, also known as Kiran, ranks third in the command structure of the NCP (Maoists) and carries a reward of $64,000 declared by the US for his capture. Kiran, who was arrested yesterday, was escorted under heavy security to the Siliguri subdivisional judicial magistrates court today. 																								Kiran was nabbed from Darjeeling More by central intelligence officials along with Narayan Bikram Pradhan, the treasurer of the year-old Nepalese National Democratic Front of India, following a tip-off that he was being sheltered by Maoist sympathisers in Pradhan Nagar.																								Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Siddh Nath Gupta said: We had formed a task force last week after learning that Nepalese National Democratic Front of India leaders were sheltering the Maoists. We also had feedback on the Maoists trying to develop Western Dooars as a shelter. 																								Along with self-styled commander-in-chief Puspa Kamal Dahal alias Prachanda, Baburam Bhattarai and Ram Bahadur Thapa alias Madan, Kiran is part of the four-member core-committee of the 55,000-strong rebel army that is waging an armed struggle to overthrow the constitutional monarchy in the landlocked Himalayan kingdom. On his way to the court,  Kiran said: The sleuths of the intelligence bureau picked  me up from Sunrise Nursing Home on March 28. I do not know  what crime I have committed on Indian territory. Yes, there  is an Interpol red alert against me but I had come to Siliguri  to get a cataract operation done on my right eye.

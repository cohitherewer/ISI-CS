The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 AK-47s for rebel hunt
																								Calcutta/Lalgarh, March 1: Alarmed at the spate of militant activities in Purulia, Bankura and the Midnapores, the government has decided to increase the firepower of policemen in the region.																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said talks are on with Delhi on ways to better equip the police. We have placed orders for 1,000 Insas rifles and other weapons, including SLR and AK-47 rifles. But the procedure will take some time.																								Inspector-general, law and order, Chayan Mukherjee said 35 police stations have been identified where the Peoples War, the Maoist Communist Centre and the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation are active. We will supply more sophisticated arms to these stations, said Mukherjee. Asked about the morale of the force after a series of strikes targeting the police, Mukherjee said once in the force, policemen have to handle dangerous situations.

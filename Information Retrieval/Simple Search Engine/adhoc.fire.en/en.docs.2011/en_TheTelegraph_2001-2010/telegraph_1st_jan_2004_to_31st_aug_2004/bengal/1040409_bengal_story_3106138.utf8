																								Calcutta, April 8: A girl of 17 who left home last night with a woman of her neighbourhood who wanted to talk to her in private was found dying early this morning.																								She died a while later at a local hospital in Kakdwip, South 24-Parganas, about 70 km from the city. Police said there were four others with the woman last night. The girls father said he knew all of them by face. We started worrying about two hours after she left. We found her near a bush without clothes, said Mukunda Das. In his complaint, Das named local youth Gopal Haldar, who had proposed to marry his daughter but was refused as he was unemployed and had contacts with local goons. The police officer in charge of Kakdwip, Debashis Chakraborty, said: It appears she was raped.

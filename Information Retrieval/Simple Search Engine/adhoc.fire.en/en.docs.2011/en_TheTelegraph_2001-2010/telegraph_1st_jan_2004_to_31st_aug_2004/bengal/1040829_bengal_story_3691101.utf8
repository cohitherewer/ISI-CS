 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Potshots at police again
 OUR BUREAU Durgapur/Calcutta, Aug. 28: Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty today again criticised the police department run by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for arresting Avtar Singh on Independence Day. 																								Though CPM sources said Bhattacharjee himself gave the go-ahead for the operation at Avtars Salt Lake hotel, Chakraborty gave a clean chit to Avtar and his CPM MP-wife Jyotirmoyee Sikdar. 																								He is innocent and has been framed by police, Chakraborty told reporters at a conference of the Citu-backed municipal workmens federation in Durgapur. 																								On Friday, Chakraborty had claimed that Avtars arrest might have been unfair. Today he was strident. I do not trust the police. They are framing Singh. I am worried about the way police are treating him, he said. 																								The chief minister is convinced the police are on the right track. Law will take its own course. I have asked police to conduct a full-fledged investigation, he had said a few days after Avtars arrest. 																								Recalling his experiences during the Naxalite movement in 1971, Chakraborty said: I remember the night when the police were looking for me and raided our house. I, along with Jyoti Basu, was in a meeting in the locality. When the police did not find me, they held my parents and sister. They ransacked our house and harassed my aged parents. This is what the police can do. They only torture and harass innocent people.																								The transport minister argues that if police raided the hotel for a suspected murderer, they had no business arresting the others instead.

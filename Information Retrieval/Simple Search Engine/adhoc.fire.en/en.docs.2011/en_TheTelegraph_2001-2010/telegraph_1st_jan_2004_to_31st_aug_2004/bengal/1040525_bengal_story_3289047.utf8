The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Protest tool: polio drops
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Purulia, May 24: Polio drops have become the mode of protest for a parched hamlet that has been waiting in vain for a drop of drinking water.																								The residents of Purulias Hetkahan, 290 km from Calcutta, boycotted the pulse polio programme yesterday in a trend that is gaining ground in rural Bengal as desperate villagers try out novel forms of protest to make the government sit up.																								We tried to convince the residents that it was for the benefit of their children that the immunisation drops were being given. But they refused, saying that a more important problem needed to be solved first, that of non-availability of drinking water, said Motilal Mahato, one of the health workers looking after the village.																								It was only after block development officer Prafulla Ghosh went to the village last night, accompanied by the block medical officer of health, and assured the residents that the problem would be looked into that the children could be administered the drops.																								We had decided to refuse the polio drops because the administration had ignored our pleas to sink a tubewell in our village, said Shasti Mahato, a villager. We have to walk almost a kilometre to get water from a well on the outskirts of the village.																								With the mercury soaring over the past few days, quenching the thirst of our children is more important than giving them polio drops. The two drops will not wet parched throats, Mahato said.																								Though the district has recorded a 73 per cent achievement on the first day of the current pulse polio programme, which is 2 per cent more than the last campaign undertaken in April, incidents of villagers not responding to the governments polio eradication drive keep recurring in Purulia.																								During the drive undertaken in February, villagers of Bulan in Arsa block refused to give the drops to their children in protest against the lack of development in the region.																								In the next programme conducted in April, members of a minority community in Hariharpur village in Para block stayed away from the pulse polio programme.

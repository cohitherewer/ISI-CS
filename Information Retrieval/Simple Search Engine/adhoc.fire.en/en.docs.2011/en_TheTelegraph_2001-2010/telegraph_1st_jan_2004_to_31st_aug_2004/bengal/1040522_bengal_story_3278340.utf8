The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Wanted: Cong state unit boss
 BARUN GHOSH																								Calcutta, May 21: Pranab Mukherjee being in the thick of things in Delhi, a search is now on for a new state Congress chief.																								Mukherjee, who replaced an ailing A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury in August 2001, expressed desire to relinquish the post soon after he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Jangipur. He even summoned former state party chief Somen Mitra and working president Pradip Bhattacharya to discuss the issue. 																								The high command had asked Ghani Khan to lead the party when Mitra resigned accepting responsibility for the partys debacle in the 1998 general elections. Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress won eight seats then and the Congress one.																								The Congress, which has established itself as a force to reckon with this time will get a fresh lease of life if Somenda takes over. Several unit office bearers and district leaders have already reposed faith in him, general secretary Manas Bhuniya said.																								However, another section of leaders said Bhattacharya, the working president, should be made the president. 																								The matter tops the agenda for next months executive committee meeting, said a key state Congress functionary.																								It is learnt that some Priya Ranjan Das Munshi loyalists are rooting for D.P. Roy and Adhir Chowdhury. They have forwarded the argument that the Congress should be headed by a strong leader from north Bengal, where the party did well in the May 10 elections. 																								Anti-Mamata brigade: Former Trinamul MP Sudip Bandopadhyay appeared set to float a forum to protest against Mamata Banerjees style of functioning. We have called a meeting tomorrow to condemn Mamatas whimsical politics, which led to the partys poll debacle, said his actor-legislator wife Nayana.

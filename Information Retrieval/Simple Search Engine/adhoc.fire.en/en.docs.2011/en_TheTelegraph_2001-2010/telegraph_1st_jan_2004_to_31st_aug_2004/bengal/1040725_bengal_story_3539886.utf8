 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Lifeline for paintings
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 24: The preservation officer of the Indian Museum, Amalendu Bikash Mitra, today temporarily restored 120 of the 196 paintings in the strongroom of the Rabindra Bharati Society that were listed by the special officer appointed by Calcutta High Court on July 17.																								The special officer, Soumava Bhattacharjee, had sought the Indian Museums expertise to temporarily preserve the paintings by members of the Tagore family, including Abanindranath, Gaganendranath and Jyotirindranath, which he found lying in a shambles in the strongroom.																								A number of the rare paintings are by Rabindranath Tagore himself. They have been lying in the storeroom without any care since 1938, said Santosh Kumar Ghorai, the registrar of Rabindra Bharati University.																								The restoration work done today was very perfunctory, wherein tissue paper was used strap up the decaying portions, Ghorai said.																								None of the other trunks or cupboards containing 4,840 other paintings were opened. We want to preserve all the 196 paintings that we found decaying in the first almirah before opening the others, the special officer said.																								The high court had to intervene when the society filed a case against the university after being denied access to its office in the varsity campus. This followed a conflict over taking 100 of the paintings for an exhibition outside the campus.																								Ghorai said they found a list of other items in the strongroom. A piano used by Tagore and his niece Indira Devi was also there, he said.

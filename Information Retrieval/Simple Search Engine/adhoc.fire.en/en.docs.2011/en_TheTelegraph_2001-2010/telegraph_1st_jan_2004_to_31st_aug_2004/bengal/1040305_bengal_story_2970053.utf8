 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 4: Neetu Sau, who was in a nursing home since giving birth to a girl four months ago, was taken home by her husband today, but without the baby.																								Her father Madhusudan Sau later went to the nursing home in Barrackpore and took the girl home. 																								Husband Surendra Pratap had refused to take Neetu, 22, back allegedly because she failed to give birth to a son. But he had claimed that he did not have the money to foot the nursing home bill.																								Madhusudan said: Surendra Pratap took my daughter home after knowing that he will not have to pay the Rs 95,000 bill.																								Pradip Ghosh, the clinics owner, said: Id decided to release the woman even if the bill was not paid after her husband said that he could not take her home because of it.																								Members of the state womens commission will meet Neetus parents tomorrow.

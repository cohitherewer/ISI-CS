				 																																	Burdwan, Aug. 6: Irrigation officials fear it would be impossible to release 15,000 acre ft of water daily for transplantation of aman paddy after Sunday.				 																																	The level of water in Maithon and Panchet reservoirs has gone down alarmingly. This has led to flow of less water to the Durgapur Barrage. From Sunday, we may have to reduce the daily release, said Manas Bharati, the barrages executive engineer. Agriculture director Dhabaleswar Konar, however, was hopeful of heavy rain in a few days, as forecast by the Met office in Calcutta.				 																																	Calcutta: Kaushik Moitra, 24, a medical representative on a motorcycle, was killed in a collision with a truck on Bijon Setu on Friday night. The driver of the truck fled.				 																																	Calcutta: An Aizwal-bound passenger, F. Lalzahawma, 24, was arrested before boarding an Indian Airlines flight at Dum Dum airport on Friday night. Security personnel found a bullet in a pouch attached to Lalzahawmas belt.

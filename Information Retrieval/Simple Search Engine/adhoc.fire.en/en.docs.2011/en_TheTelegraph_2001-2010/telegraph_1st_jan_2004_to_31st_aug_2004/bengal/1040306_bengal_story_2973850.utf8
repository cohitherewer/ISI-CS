The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Mahasweta blasts realtors
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Santiniketan, March 5: Mahasweta Devi today alleged that the Sreeniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority, under the leadership of CPM member of Parliament Somnath Chatterjee, had been destroying the greenery in the name of development work. 																								The authority plans to construct an amusement park on a 17.5-acre water body. The proposed park in the middle of the lake will definitely destroy the greenery and the water body, said the writer.																								Migratory birds have already stopped coming to the locality, she alleged at a press conference at Lahabandh here at which intellectuals and artists, including Jogen Chowdhury, Ganesh Pyne and Chidananda Dasgupta, were present.																								Earlier, Chatterjee and Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Sujit Bose had dismissed Mahasweta Devis allegation. They said tourism was the only industry in Bolpur and there was no harm in promoting it.																								Why is the authority not repairing the roads in Santiniketan if they consider tourism the only means to develop the area? countered the writer.																								Whats the use of opening a bar and amusement park by destroying the green here? All these are meant for rich people and they can afford such luxuries anywhere in a city like Calcutta. I really dont understand why the development authority is showing so much interest in developing the area by opening a licensed bar and amusement park, she said.																								Mahasweta Devi said she had not seen such encroachment on greenery in other famous universities in the world, including Cambridge, Berkley or Sussex.																								The writer also came down heavily on Chatterjee and said he had done nothing for the development of his constituency. He is representing Bolpur in Parliament, but he has not nurtured his constituency. Neither has he cared for the people living here, alleged the social activist.																								The writer said she had already informed President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam about the matter and was assured of an inquiry by a team of experts.																								Copies of the letter she wrote to the President had been sent to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Chatterjee, she said.

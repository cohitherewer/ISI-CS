 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Boys death after power cut
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, May 17: A nine-year-old boy suffering from bronchitis and diarrhoea died last night at locked-out Hastings Jute Mills labour lines, where power and water supply were snapped by the management. 																								Sheikh Murtaza, son of a contract labourer of the mill at Rishra in Hooghly, about 40 km from Calcutta, died before he could be taken to hospital. 																								Doctors said excessive heat and suffocating conditions could have aggravated the condition of the child suffering from acute diarrhoea and dehydration. Too much heat and suffocating conditions can cause electrolyte imbalance in the body, which may lead to death, said Ashok Ray, a paediatric surgeon at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital.																								The death that led to raging protests and political intervention resulted in police sticking a notice on the factory wall in the evening saying power supply would be restored for two hours from 7 pm to 9 pm and water supply for three hours every day. 																								The steps came too late for Murtaza. My son was running high fever over the past two days and was suffering from diarrhoea. Last night, he drank water and vomited, said Murtazas father Mustaq. It was all over before we could take him to the hospital.																								Officer-in-charge of Rishra police station Sushanta Mukherjee said, according to the medical report, bronchitis and acute diarrhoea and a cardiac failure caused the death. 																								The suspension-of-work notice was stuck on the mill gate on April 20. Power and water supply to the labourers quarters, where about 2,000 people stay, was disconnected on Saturday.																								It is unbearable here. There is no water, electricity, said Sheikh Fazal, a labourer at the mill. Other children could have met the same fate. 																								The labourers converged outside the mills entrance this morning demanding restoration of power and water supply.																								Later in the day, CPM MP from Serampore and president of the mills Citu-affiliated union Shantashree Chatterjee made a round of the coolie lines and said: The condition is inhuman here. I have requested the chief ministers office to take steps to provide them power and water.																								Superintendent of police Ajay Kumar said: I know about the death. I have talked to the management and they promised me to restore power and water. However, the management officials were not available for comment till late tonight.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Blackout close shave
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug. 19: An acute power crisis hit the state today as the combined shortfall in CESC and state electricity board-served areas shot up to 600 mw in the evening.																								According to the power department, the deficit in the board areas alone was 400 mw.																								However, a major blackout could still be avoided as the board received a windfall from the western grid. 																								A senior board official said: There may have been some drop in demand in the western region because of rainWe could draw heavily from the western grid. 																								Around 8 pm, the shortfall in the CESC system came down to about 120 mw and to about 200 mw in the boards. 																								Nonetheless, power cuts across Bengal ranged between two and three hours. 																								With many units out of order at various plants, our generation was way below average. A 500-mw unit at National Thermal Power Corporations Farakka plant collapsed this morning soon after being revived. If the same situation prevails tomorrow, we will impose restrictions on power supply to industries between 6 pm and 10 pm, a power department official said.

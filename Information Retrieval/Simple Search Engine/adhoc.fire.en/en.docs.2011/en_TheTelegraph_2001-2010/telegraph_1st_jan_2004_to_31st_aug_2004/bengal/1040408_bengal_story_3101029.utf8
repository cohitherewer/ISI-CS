The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Bengal Siksha fails Delhi test 
 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, April 7: The human resource development ministry believes the Bengal government is doing virtually nothing to implement the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA), a programme for universalisation of elementary education. 																								A central team, which recently visited the state, pricked the state governments claims of great strides in putting children back to school. 																								A senior official in the ministry said there are still 40 lakh out-of-school children. In many places, there is just one upper primary school for every five primary schools. This often forces the students to stay back in the fourth class, he said.																								The state education department also is refusing to allow the Centre to disburse funds through the panchayats. West Bengal is completely bankrupt. But the education department will not allow us to give the money directly to panchayats, the official said. 																								The SSA wants state governments to decentralise the programme and route the funds through panchayat samitis. But the West Bengal state education department is keeping all the money, he said.																								The Centre believes Bengals policy of not opening new schools and not hiring new teachers is hurting the state. This is the same state which used to export teachers to the rest of India at one time, he added. 																								The policy of not hiring qualified teachers is leading to large-scale induction of para-teachers  those who have passed Class 12. This is one way of meeting the financial crunch as the government pays them a fraction of the salary of qualified teachers. 																								Senior officials said the system of education in Bengal has collapsed and the only solution is a complete overhaul. The human resources development ministry has also reserved its most hard-hitting reminders for Bengal. 																								But chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, officials say, has been talking about the importance of primary education. Some slow changes are taking place. For instance, some bureaucrats and grassroots level workers have begun taking an interest, said an official.

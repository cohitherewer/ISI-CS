 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, April 12: The Vidyasagar University vice-chancellor last night received a threat call from this district at his Dunlop home on the northern fringes of Calcutta.																								Swapan Pramanik informed varsity registrar Jogen Debnath who lodged a complaint with West Midnapore superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.																								We are looking into the complaint but are yet to trace the culprits. However, we have arranged adequate security cover for the VC, Kumar said.																								Asked if the threat was made by an extremist group, a police official said: We have just begun a probe and it is unfair to say anything till it is complete.																								Pramanik was unavailable for comment but Debnath said that he was threatened with dire consequences if he tried to attend a meeting of the law departments board of studies. 																								However, there was no trouble when he arrived at Kharagpur station around 8.25 this morning and attended the scheduled meeting, he added.

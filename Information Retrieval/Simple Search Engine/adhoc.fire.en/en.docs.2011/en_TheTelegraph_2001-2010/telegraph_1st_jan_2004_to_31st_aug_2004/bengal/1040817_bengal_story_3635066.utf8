 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Life after a death two days ago
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dhananjoys sister-in-law Shyamali, 29, whose marriage was to have been finalised on Sunday had the groom to-bes family not called it off in the wake of the hanging. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya Kuludih (Bankura), Aug. 16: Two days after Dhananjoy Chatterjee was hanged at Alipore Jail, his family appeared to have come to terms with reality. 																								The family, which refused to accept Dhananjoys body, will perform his last rites after 45 days, as it said should be in case of such a death. 																								We cannot let one tragedy bring lives to a standstill, said Dhananjoys father Banshidhar Chatterjee.																								I have three granddaughters who have come of age, and it is our responsibility to marry them off.																								Days ago, he had said the family would be ruined if Dhananjoy was hanged and threatened to commit suicide with the rest of the members. 																								Following the threat, the district authorities had a police contingent posted to keep a watch on the movements of the family members. 																								On Saturday, when Dhananjoy was hanged, police personnel shadowed the grieving Chatterjees. 																								This morning, the adults in the family resumed their daily responsibilities. 																								Dhananjoys younger brother Bikash returned to till the family fields and elder brother Gangadhar took his place at the table to tutor his pupils again. 																								The idol of household goddess Kali in the family temple reaffirmed the Chatterjees faith in life and their desire to live. On receiving the news of the hanging, the idol had been removed. Today, it was reinstated to the altar it occupied earlier.																								Several groups and individuals have taken the initiative to come to the familys aid. The Chatterjees received Rs 50,000 collected from several organisations based in the Asansol colliery area. 																								Residents of Hatisil, a few kilometres from Kuludih, donated Rs 500 and a quintal of rice. Others from adjoining villages visited the house through the day, consoling the bereaved and making gifts of small quantities of food grain. 																								Neighbours, who shared the familys disappointment and grief through the proceedings, were frequent visitors to the small mud house, doing what they could to ease the suffering. 																								The Chatterjees remained stoic about the execution. They believe Dhananjoy, who was charged with raping and killing 14-year-old schoolgirl Hetal Parekh, was innocent. 																								The judicial system, a family member said, has committed an offence against their humility and financial ineptitude. 																								Members of the family also blamed chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for having egged on the process in such a way that Dhananjoy had no chance of receiving a fair trial.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Purulia, Aug. 4: A standoff between a CPM-led panchayat samity and the Puncha block administration in Purulia has forced Alimuddin Street to intervene and limit the partys sphere of influence. 																								The confrontation began at a block-level transport committee meeting in early May when Shammo Pyari Mahato, MLA from Puncha, a block in east Purulia, began distributing briefcases as gifts to participants. 																								Block development officer Supriyo Das protested and the meeting had to be called off midway. The incident triggered a series of conflicts between the BDO and the panchayat samity, the most serious being the disruption in distribution of relief to tribal communities. 																								About 20 days ago, Das was distributing tarpaulin, rice and chira to deprived Sabar families when panchayat sabhapati Mithila Murmu interrupted, challenging the process. The distribution was one-sided and was being done without consulting the panchayat samity, she claimed. 																								The relief material storeroom in the block office compound was locked by the sabhapati on July 12 without intimating the authorities. 																								Das rushed to district magistrate B.P. Gopalika, seeking his intervention. The issue was a serious one as an open conflict between the CPM and the administration had emerged, Gopalika said. 																								He called the BDO and the sabhapati to his chamber for a meeting to end the impasse, but the panchayat representative did not turn up. With verbal confrontations taking place in the block office, Gopalika ordered a police post to be set up on the premises for Das protection. 																								He then sent a report to panchayat minister Surjya Kanta Mishra. 																								District CPM secretary Nakul Mahato said Das was politically motivated and his style of functioning was hampering development work in the block. He sought Das transfer. 																								On receipt of Gopalikas report, CPM bigwigs called a meeting at the Alimuddin Street headquarters last week. They decided there should be no political interference in administrative matters and the partys role should be limited to an advisory capacity. Decisions relating to relief distribution and allotting work for various schemes was within the ambit of the administration alone. 																								Soon the lock on the storeroom door was removed, 15 days after it had been placed there by the sabhapati. Simultaneously, as a face-saving gesture, orders were issued for the transfer of the BDO, who himself had sought a change.

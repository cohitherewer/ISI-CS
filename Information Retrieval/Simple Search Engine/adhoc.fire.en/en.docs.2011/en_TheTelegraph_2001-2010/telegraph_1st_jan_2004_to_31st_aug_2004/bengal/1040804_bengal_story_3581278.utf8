 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 One of the two oil-fired steam locomotives at the Tiruchirapalli workshop. A Telegraph picture																								Tiruchirapalli, Aug. 3: Darjeelings toy train is set to get more steam.																								The train will soon puff through the Eastern Himalayan ranges with its two new oil-fired steam locomotives, the first of its kind, replacing its old coal-fired engines. 																								Christened Himrathi and Himanand, the two oil-fired steam locomotives, indigenously designed and built by Southern Railways Golden Rock Workshop (GOC) here, would make the 88-km journey from New Jalpaiguri to the queen of the hills safer, said GOCs chief executive G.R.K. Raju. 																								Two azure blue engines wait on the workshop rails here, awaiting the outcome of trials currently on in the narrow gauge Darjeeling Himalayan Railway with an earlier modified engine from this workshop.																								The DHR was accorded World Heritage status by Unesco in December 1999, which perhaps gave the steam engine a last chance to survive on the railway map, said Raju. The oil-fired steam locomotives should give DHR a longer lease. The twin engines are expected to be moved to New Jalpaiguri by September-end. 																								Explaining how the locomotives were crucial for the DHR, which runs through picturesque mountain country and touches a maximum height of 7,400 feet at Ghoom, Raju said the Golden Rock Workshop had first modified a coal-fired engine into an oil-fired loco. Extensive tests were then carried out.																								Based on that experience, this workshop bagged the Railway Boards order to manufacture the oil-fired engines. As DHR was one of the most beautiful railway networks in the world, with several loops and reverses en route, Raju said many tourists wanted to travel in the heritage train pulled by a steam locomotive. 																								The structure of DHR had to be borne in mind in our designs, pointed out Raju, who had served Eastern Railway for over eight years before coming here.

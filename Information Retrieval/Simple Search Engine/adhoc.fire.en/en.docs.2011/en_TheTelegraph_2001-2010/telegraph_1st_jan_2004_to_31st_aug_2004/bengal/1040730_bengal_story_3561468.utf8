The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Come March, take a train to Digha
 SANJAY MANDAL																								Digha (East Midnapore), July 29: Calcuttas nearest seaside tourist town will no more be a bumpy bus ride away. 																								The Tamluk-Digha rail link is near completion and trains from Calcutta will chug into Digha some time by next March, about 20 years after the foundation stone was laid by then railway minister A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury.																								Trains from Calcutta to Digha will run by March 2005, said R.R. Bhandari, the South-Eastern Railway general manager. The construction of tracks will be completed by end-August, he said at the renovated Digha terminal station. 																								We are planning to run goods trains on this section from September or October, Bhandari said. The tracks will be handed to the Controller of Railway Safety by December and once it waves the green flag, a passenger train will make its maiden run.																								We are working out the details. If there is demand, we can run two pairs of trains, Bhandari said. They will either start from Howrah or Shalimar, which Bhandari said is under-utilised despite having all the facilities. 																								There are two proposals regarding the train schedule. According to the first, the train will leave Shalimar or Howrah around 10.30 pm and reach Digha, about 185 km away, early next morning. The Calcutta-bound train would leave late in the afternoon. This will enable a tourist on a days sojourn to visit Digha without checking into a hotel, an official said. The second proposal is to start the train from Calcutta early in the morning. In this case, too, the return train will leave Digha in the afternoon. 																								Railway officials said a survey is being conducted on the possible volume of freight and passenger traffic. After getting the report, we will decide whether to run express or passenger trains, Bhandari said.																								The fares would be finalised once the timings are fixed. If sleeper coaches are introduced for the night journey, a berth could cost Rs 100. For day travel in a passenger train, the fare would be Rs 30 and Rs 60 in an express.																								Bhandari said Rs 11 crore was allotted in 2004-05 and another Rs 26 crore is required to complete the project estimated to cost about Rs 300 crore. He added: It is our top priority now and funds will not be a problem.

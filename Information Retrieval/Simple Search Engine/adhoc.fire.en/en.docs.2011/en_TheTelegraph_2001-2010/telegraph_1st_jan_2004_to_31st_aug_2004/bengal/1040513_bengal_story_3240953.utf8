 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Murder stink in death on spikes 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Serampore (Hooghly), May 12: A businessman was impaled on the spikes of the boundary wall of his house after falling off the terrace and died in hospital this morning. His elder sister blamed the death on his wife and brother-in-law. 																								Arijit Ghosh, 35, was allegedly hit with a spanner and forced to jump from the roof of his two-storey house by his wife Suparna and brother-in-law Abhishek Biswas last night at Goswamipara in Serampore, 30 km from Calcutta. 																								The spikes on the wall pierced his chest and he was rushed to the local Walsh Hospital, where doctors referred him to the National Medical College and Hospital. He died there this morning. 																								As soon as news of Arijits death spread, a mob assembled in front of his house, dragged out Abhishek and started beating him up. He was rescued by the police and arrested along with Suparna on the basis of a complaint by Arijits elder sister. 																								We have received a complaint from Arijits elder sister that Abhishek and Suparna conspired and killed her brother. However, we will be sure after a post-mortem is carried out. We will be able to ascertain whether Arijit was hit with a spanner before he jumped off or he was chased and forced to leap from the roof, said Sankhasuvro Chakraborty, sub-divisional police officer of Serampore. 																								Preliminary investigation showed Arijit was a drunkard and his wife resented his habit. Arijit used to drink every day and this led to noisy quarrels between almost daily. Last night, too, he was drinking heavily. Arijit tried to force his 18-year-old brother-in-law, Abhishek, to drink with him. It seems Suparna became furious at this and hit her husband on the head with a spanner. Arijit ran to the roof to escape the beating. On reaching the roof, he was either forced to jump or he tripped and fell, said an official investigating the case. 																								Neighbour Aniruddha Pal said Arijit, who ran a catering business, had inherited money from his parents and was well off. Abhishek had recently arrived from Jamshedpur to stay with them.

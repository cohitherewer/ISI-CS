The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Veil off teachers with fake marksheets 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Lalnagar (Murshidabad), Jan.  30: Two people teaching at a high school since the mid-1980s  have been charged with furnishing fake Calcutta University  marksheets to secure the jobs.																								The managing committee of the Lalnagar High School has lodged a complaint with police against assistant science teacher Abdur Rahim Biswas and assistant physical education teacher Abdur Rezzak Biswas  both students of Krishnanath College in Behrampore.																								We lodged an FIR after receiving written complaints from parents and guardians against the two teachers. We contacted the controller of examinations of Calcutta University to find out about the academic qualifications of the two. We were informed in writing by the deputy controller that there is no record that the two had passed out of the university, said the secretary of the managing committee, Ehsan Ali.																								He added that he had informed school education minister Kanti Biswas, the district magistrate, the police superintendent and the vigilance commission.																								Abdur Rahim Biswas, who has been teaching since 1985, had submitted a fake Calcutta University B.Sc. Part II marksheet of 1980. Abdur Rezzak Biswas had furnished a fake Islamic history MA marksheet of 1986 of the same varsity and has been teaching since 1986.																								The scam came to light early last month when Abdur Rahims name was not found on the list of former students brought out by Krishnanath College during celebrations to mark 150 years of the institution.																								This led to rumours, following which the two high school teachers confessed to the managing committee and resigned. Abdur Rahim immediately resigned from his post and left the school and never came back, said Ali. Abdur Rezzak also resigned but came to school regularly, he said.																								The school secretary said teacher members of the managing committee were in favour of clemency and urged others to accept the resignation as an end of the issue. 																								However, many others were in favour of strict action against the two. Because of a division of opinion at the meeting, the committee could not immediately decide on any action against the teachers. The district inspector of secondary schools will take a decision on this score, said Ali.																								District magistrate Chhoten Lama said he has received the complaint from Ali and would ask the school inspector, Subhendu Ghosh, to take strong action against the teachers. Ghosh, however, said he was yet to hear from the district magistrate. The secretary of the schools managing committee has lodged a verbal complaint, he said.																								Teacher-in-charge Korban Ali said he had joined the school only two years ago and the managing committees secretary was handling the case.

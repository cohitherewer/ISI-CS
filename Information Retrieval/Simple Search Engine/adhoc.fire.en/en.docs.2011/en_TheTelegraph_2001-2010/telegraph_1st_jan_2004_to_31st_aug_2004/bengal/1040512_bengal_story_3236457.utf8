 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Atal aide amp; George on line with Mamata
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 11: Doctors attending to Mamata Banerjees mother Gayatri, who was injured last night, today said she is stable.																								The Trinamul Congress chief had alleged that Gayatri was injured when CPM supporters stormed her Kalighat home. 																								Mamatas office, next to her Harish Chatterjee Street house, was flooded with phone calls to enquire about her mother. Among the callers were defence minister George Fernandes, minister of state for external affairs Digvijay Singh and officer-on-special-duty at the Prime Ministers Office Sudheendra Kulkarni.																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said there was no substance in Mamatas charge that CPM cadre attacked her house. It is baseless. I have already spoken to the police commissioner about it, the chief minister said.																								Mamata took her 70-year-old mother to a nursing home around 10.30 last night and stayed with her till about 2.30 am. 																								Doctors carried out several tests on her. The final reports are awaited but Mrinmoy Nandy, who is part of a medical team looking after Gayatri, said: The provisional CT scan report suggests there is no problem. 																								When she arrived last night, Gayatri was conscious but confused, the doctor said.																								Before being taken to the nursing home, she had complained of pain in her head, chest and abdomen. Nandy said: She did not have any external injury. But a stiff muscle on the abdomen meant she was hurt.																								A case was registered at Kalighat police station late last night and the investigation has begun, said deputy commissioner H.P. Singh.

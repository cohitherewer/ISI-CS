The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Poll officer on rebel alert
 OUR BUREAUCalcutta, April 12: The Naxalites have left the chief electoral officer worried in the run-up to the general elections 																								We are a bit worried about the situation in three districts in the wake of the extremist activities, said Basudeb Banerjee. The three districts he referred to were Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore, which have seen a spurt in militancy. 																								West Midnapore police spotted a landmine planted on their patrol route, explosives and devices to set them off on Saturday night. 																								Banerjee said all possible steps are being taken to ensure free and fair elections in the Naxalite-infested terrain.																								On his return after a recce of the region, Banerjee said he had detailed discussions with the district magistrates and superintendents of police to work out strategies to prevent Peoples War activists from interfering with the poll process. 																								We are deploying central forces in all three districts to ensure free and fair elections, Banerjee said. He has requested chief election commissioner T.S. Krishanamurty to arrange 10 companies of central forces in addition to the 150 already allotted for the elections. Besides, the state will get about 10,000 homeguards from Bihar and police personnel from several other states. 																								Sources said Banerjee had initially requested for 305 companies. Though we are getting 10 more companies, it wont be enough to police 42 Lok Sabha seats, one of them said. 																								Banerjee today announced that filing of nominations for the May 10 polls will begin on April 16 and continue till April 23. The nomination papers will be scrutinised on April 24. The last date for withdrawal of nominations is April 26. The same day, symbols will be allotted to the Independent candidates. 																								Special observer Afzal Amanullah, who will arrive here on Thursday, will proceed to north Bengal the same day. April 19 onwards, he will tour the districts in the south.

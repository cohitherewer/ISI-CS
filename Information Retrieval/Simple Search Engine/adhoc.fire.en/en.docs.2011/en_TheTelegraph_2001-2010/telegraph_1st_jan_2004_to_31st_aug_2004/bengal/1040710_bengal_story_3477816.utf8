The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 CM support for Sarkar challenged
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 9: A day after the chief minister defended former Rabindra Bharati vice-chancellor Pabitra Sarkars scholarship and dodged the row over his doctorate, SUCI legislator Debaprasad Sarkar moved a privilege motion in the Assembly against Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								Trinamul Congress MLA and city mayor Subrata Mukherjee supported Debaprasad Sarkar but Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim rejected the motion saying it was not scheduled. 																								Though Bhattacharjee had avoided endorsing Pabitra Sarkars claim of being a PhD from Chicago University, he said Sarkar was a pundit in linguistics and stood first-class first in MA in Chicago. 																								Justifying his demand, the SUCI MLA said: If the chief minister has assured the former VC that he will defend him, he can be accused of violating the privileges of the House.																								During a discussion on land and land reforms, Mukherjee backed the SUCI. How could Pabitra Sarkar add Dr to his name when he is yet to get the degree? he asked. Sarkar had said he had a provisional PhD certificate and could not apply for the final one because of preoccupations.Sinha remand																								The Bolpur subdivisional judicial magistrate today rejected the bail petition of former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Dilip Sinha and remanded him in judicial custody till July 21. Sinha was arrested on June 25 in connection with a fake certificate scam and has been in custody since.

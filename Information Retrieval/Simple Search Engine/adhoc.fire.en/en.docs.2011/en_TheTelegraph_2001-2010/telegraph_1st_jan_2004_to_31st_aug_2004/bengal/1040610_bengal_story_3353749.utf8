The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Gherao out, says Buddha
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bhattacharjee at the consular corps meet. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Calcutta, June 9: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today used a platform provided by the citys consular core to tee off another Bengal-means-business round.																								We know there is an image problem with our state, which means we have to work that much harder to dispel doubts. I am grateful to Calcutta Consular Corps for making a sincere effort to project Bengal as a good place to do business, the chief minister said at the launch of A resurgent West Bengal, a consular corps publication chronicling the business conference held as part of last years consular golf meet. 																								The publication, to be shipped to Indian missions abroad, should serve as useful information for potential investors, feel the consular corps brass.																								Bhattacharjee grabbed the opportunity to allay investor fears linked to perception about the ruling Left and slammed the doors on trade union hooliganism. We know there are reservations about our workers unions, and there have been mistakes in the past. Gherao is a word we contributed to the Oxford lexicon, but we have now banished it from our own dictionary, he stressed.																								We are realists and not fools. We know if we dont push reforms, we will perish. However, we believe in reforms with a human face and so agriculture and the rural sector are our priorities, he told foreign diplomats and industry representatives.																								We welcome foreign investment in every sector, Bhattacharjee announced, not for the first time. Stressing the need for a mass rapid transit system, Bhattacharjee said the state was in dialogue with a Japanese company for a model that would save Calcuttas public transport network from collapse. He also announced Russian investment in a truck-manufacturing unit.																								German consul-general in Calcutta Erhard Zander, who had chaired last years business conclave, said: The ice has been broken and after years of neglect, a string of business delegations touched down in Calcutta over the past few months.

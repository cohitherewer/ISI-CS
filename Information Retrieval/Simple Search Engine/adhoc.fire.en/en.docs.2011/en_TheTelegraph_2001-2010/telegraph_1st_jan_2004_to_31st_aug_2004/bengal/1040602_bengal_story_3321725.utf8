 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 New HS syllabi under scanner
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 1: Three days after it deferred implementation of the new higher secondary syllabi till next year, the Council of Higher Secondary Education said the curricula would be revised.																								Council president Jyotirmoy Mukherjee today said the syllabi will have to be changed again following demands by some teachers bodies.																								The new syllabi, announced earlier this year and supposed to be implemented from the academic session beginning July, will now come into effect from 2005.																								On Saturday, the council deferred the implementation apparently because the publishers had failed to complete printing the new textbooks.																								When the council announced the new syllabi, a section of teachers had approached the authorities with an appeal for review. They felt that the courses, especially in elective subjects, were lengthy and higher secondary teaching institutions would find them difficult to cover in two years.																								Officials said the council could not pay heed to the demand then because it had finalised plans to get the new syllabi implemented from this year. 																								Now that the publishers have failed to print the textbooks on time and we have deferred the implementation, we will review the syllabi as demanded by the teachers, Mukherjee said.																								We will thoroughly examine the contents and see if there is a need to delete portions that the teachers feel have made the syllabi lengthy.																								The government has decided to increase the number of teaching days by curtailing the Puja vacation and other holidays in Madhyamik and Higher Secondary schools, Mukherjee said.																								Once the vacations are shortened and the holidays reduced, the number of classes will automatically increase. The new system is being introduced from this academic session. In the changed system, I think the teachers will get enough time to cover all topics that have been incorporated in the new syllabi, Mukherjee said. 																								Before the review, he added, the council will meet the teachers bodies to discuss if the deletions were still necessary.																								The council will also take steps to end the furore sparked by its use of modern Bengali spellings in the new syllabi.																								Many publishers assigned to print the textbooks had expressed unwillingness to use spellings according to a dictionary prepared by the Bangla Academy in which words have been spelt as they are used these days.

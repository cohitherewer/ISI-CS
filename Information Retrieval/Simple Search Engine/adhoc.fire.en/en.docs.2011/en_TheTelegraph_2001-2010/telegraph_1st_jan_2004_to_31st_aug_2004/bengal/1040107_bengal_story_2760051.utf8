 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Cooks for American soldiers at home 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranaghat (Nadia), Jan. 6: They went to war in Iraq early this year. They marched with the allied troops, saw the fireworks and, after nearly 10 months, returned not as war heroes but with pats on their backs for cooking some of the best meals. 																								More than a hundred youths from three villages in Nadia were given the responsibility of cooking for thousands of American and British soldiers during Operation Iraqi Freedom. 																								The jobless young men from Begopara, Dayabari and Mandalpara went to Mumbai early this year responding to news paper advertisements saying: Cooks required in Kuwait.																								The youths took the selection tests in Mumbai and left for Iraq without even informing their families. In February, almost all of them were asked to board the flight to Kuwait. They were hired on contract and given a few weeks training before being absorbed as cooks in Kuwait and Iraq.																								Initially, we were not told by our company (US Supporting Service World Wide) that we would have to enter battle zone as the war was not declared at the time. Our employers told us that we would have to cook for the US and UK soldiers, said 24-year-old Pradip Gomes, a resident of Begopara.																								Gomes is among the 15 who returned home on Christmas vacation with a certificate from the US food service officer that enables them to work for the US and British forces in future. Gomes and his friends will return to work at the end of their leave.																								On reaching Abdali, close to the Kuwait-Iraq border, the boys from Nadia saw military camps. It was a terrible moment. We found that every camp had Indian cooks and most of them were from Bengal. They were from Tollygunge in Calcutta, Midnapore and Nadia, said Rakesh Chatterjee of Dayabari village. We were in tears when we heard about the war breaking out, he added.																								Manoj Mondal said some of the soldiers took a liking for Bengali cuisine. We tried to keep them confined to beef biryani, chicken noodles and tomato chatnis with an occasional preparation of dal and potato chips. The infantry moved towards Baghdad after the air-strike. We marched with it, said Manoj.

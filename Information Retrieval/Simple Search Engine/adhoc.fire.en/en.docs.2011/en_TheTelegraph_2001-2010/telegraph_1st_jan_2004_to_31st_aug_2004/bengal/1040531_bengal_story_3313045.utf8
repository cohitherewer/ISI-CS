The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Border talks to trace couple
 RABI BANERJEE																								Krishnagar (Nadia), May 30: The Border Security Force and Bangladesh Rifles will hold talks next month in a bid to trace a couple who allegedly fled to the neighbouring country.																								The BSF will also ask BDR to rescue a minor girl, who was allegedly kidnapped from Tehatta by Bangladeshi criminals 10 months ago.																								Ananya Biswas, 14, allegedly eloped with her private tutor Bimal Biswas, 35, both residents of Bhimpore in Krishnagars Kotwali area, 90 km from Calcutta. 																								The class VII student was reportedly in love with Bimal and they eloped after their families did not agree to the match.																								R.C. Saxena, DIG (Nadia and Murshidabad range), said Ananyas family initially kept her disappearance a secret and did not inform the police or the BSF. 																								Only when they came to know that the girl and her teacher had crossed over to Kushtia through the border at Gede did the girls family inform the police and the BSF, said Saxena.																								The BSF then asked the BDR to trace the couple, but there were no leads in the case.																								BSF officials felt it would be impossible to trace the couple as they had got married. BDR officials repeatedly told us that the duo had married and converted so as to make it difficult to trace them, said Saxena. He added that the marriage would not be recognised as the girl is a minor.																								Bimal is much older than my daughter. He used to teach her and a month before they eloped, he expressed a desire to marry her later. We disagreed and he took advantage of my daughters innocence by eloping with her, said Bikash Biswas, Ananyas father and a trader. 																								The father of another 14-year-old is seeking the BSFs help to trace her. 																								Pallabi Roy of Tehatta was allegedly kidnapped from Sahapur village, about 160 km from Calcutta, by Bangladeshi criminals 10 months ago.																								She was allegedly taken to Bangladeshs Meherpur district. Jabbar Ali and Tutul Sheikh, who the police and the BSF suspect are the culprits, are absconding.																								Pallabis father Prafulla said a complaint had been lodged at Tehatta police station the day after his daughter was kidnapped last July. The case was later handed over to the BSF.																								Saxena will represent the BSF and the BDR will be represented by its Kushtia sector head at the meeting scheduled to be held in Calcutta.																								I will press the BDR to hand over these girls to us, said Saxena.

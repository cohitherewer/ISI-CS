The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 CU puts off model act meeting
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								Calcutta, April 19: The Calcutta University senate has deferred its meeting on the model university act proposed by the Centre.																								Delhi intends to bring all the universities in the country under one umbrella.																								No reason has been cited for putting off the meeting, slated for April 30. 																								The new date, May 28, has triggered speculation that the move has come with the hope of a change of guard in Delhi after the Lok Sabha polls. 																								If the Congress succeeds in defeating the NDA and somehow forms the government, the proposed act may be dropped and we need not wage our battle against the Centre, a CPM leader and member of the senate said.																								The Left Front had opposed the Centres move as some of the acts provisions threaten to curb the states control over universities. If the act is passed, the universities elected bodies like the senate and syndicate will cease to exist. 																								The government is often accused of packing these bodies with its own people. The central act suggested the inclusion of a greater number of experts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Pranab declares oust-CPM agenda
 							 - Allies at Centre shadow-box with civic polls around A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Mukherjee																								Calcutta, June 20: Buoyed by the Congress showing in the Lok Sabha elections, state party president Pranab Mukherjee today said ousting the Left Front government in the state was foremost on his list of priorities.																								Mukherjee, now also the defence minister, told reporters: The goal of our party in the state is not only to secure the status of the principal Opposition party by replacing the Trinamul Congress, but also to wrest power from the Marxists.																								Our intention is to oust the CPM-led government in Bengal, the Union minister said.																								The Congress, he added, did not require Trinamul support to fight the Left. The Congress had fought the 2001 Assembly polls in Bengal along with Trinamul. Our joint effort had failed to beat the CPM. Now the question of an alliance with the party seems insignificant as the Congress itself has regained its strength.																								Support of the Left parties is crucial for the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre.																								CPM state secretary and politburo member Anil Biswas ridiculed Mukherjees threat. It is good to have sweet dreams. Mukherjee should know his dream will never come true in the next 25 years, Biswas said. 																								Mukherjee reiterated that the burden of an important ministry and the partys command in Bengal was too much to bear and he had to be relieved of his party unit post.																								However, asked about his successor, Mukherjee evaded a straight answer. The Congress president is the sole authority to decide on it, he said.

 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Polygamist butchers spouse for money
 OUR CORRESPONDENTKrishnagar, April 10: A man killed his third wife here early this morning after she refused to hand over the money she had made over last few years.																								Niranjan Debnath, 40, butchered 35-year-old Sabita around 4 am at Prafullya Colony near Nabadwip railway station, about 90 km from Calcutta.																								Police said the couples seven-year-old daughter Mallika was asleep in the room when Niranjan killed Sabita. On waking up, she saw her mothers lifeless body with several stab marks on the bed.																								Mallika rushed to her neighbours and told them that her father had been with her mother till late at night. She said she had heard them arguing over money.																								The police have recorded Mallikas statement and have arrested Niranjan as the prime accused in the case. 																								They will question Mallika again as she was the only one present at the scene of crime.																								Preliminary investigations have revealed that Sabita was looking after her five daughters and one son on her own without any financial help from her husband, the police added.																								Niranjan was deep in debt after repeatedly failing to run a successful business. 																								Under pressure to repay his debts, he asked Sabita to hand over the money that she and her children had made by singing at local music programmes, district police superintendent Pankaj Dutta said.																								The police have discovered that Niranjan had befriended several women while selling bangles and married three of them. He was in touch only with Sabita though his other wives are alive.																								But as neighbour Bisu Ghosh put it: He (Niranjan), however, had to maintain his other wives and their children. Sabita was the only wife who did not care for his money. He used to tell us that if he did not fund the other wives, then they would inform police that he had several marriages.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Feb. 7: Panchayat minister Surjya Kanta Mishra today expressed displeasure over the functioning of several zilla parishads.																								The minister was addressing a meeting of sabhadhipatis of seven zilla parishads of Bankura, Purulia, Birbhum, East and West Midnapore, Hooghly and Burdwan here. The district magistrates were also present.																								Mishra criticised the panchayat functionaries for failing to utilise central funds for construction of roads, poverty alleviation programmes and implementation of schemes under the Indira Awas Yojana.																								About 50 per cent of the funds released by the Union government under these heads are still lying unutilised. Tell me why the funds are not being used? Mishra asked.																								Todays exercise comes after a meeting last month between chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Mishra and panchayat sabhadhipatis, where it was decided that Mishra would tour the districts to personally monitor the working of panchayats till the end of the Lok Sabha elections.

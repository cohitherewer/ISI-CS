 KUHELI CHAKRAVORTYSiliguri, Feb. 19: The story of Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuarys success as a rhino reserve comes with a sting in the tail.																								The forest department has been systematically clearing sections of the sanctuary by chopping off mature trees to expand the grassland, the preferred habitat of the herbivore. Worse still, the department has introduced Dhadda, a fast-growing species of grass, to give the one-horned rhino more room to roam and multiply. But as the rhino feeds on the bounty and proliferates, the future of smaller herbivores and more than 135 species of herbaceous plants hangs in the balance.																								A study by scientists and conservationists of North Bengal University has sounded the alarm for an induced ecological imbalance at Jaldapara.																								The ever-increasing grasp of grasslands in the sanctuary is exerting pressure on the survival of innumerable herbaceous species of vegetation. Expansion and growth of grasslands is being encouraged only to provide food to the increasing population of rhinos, said A.P. Das, a botanist and varsity professor.																								A comparative study of the flora in the grasslands with that in low-lying herblands and open patches inside grasslands showed the grasslands have 135 herbaceous species. The forested areas have 165 varieties, Das said. A study in 1993 had recorded 534 species of herbs there.																								The forest department began changing the forest-scape in the late 1960s when the area was declared a rhino reserve. No one thought of the consequences. Today, the rhino population has exceeded the optimum number and in its hurry to keep them healthy, the ecological balance is being destroyed, said an official who did not want to be named.

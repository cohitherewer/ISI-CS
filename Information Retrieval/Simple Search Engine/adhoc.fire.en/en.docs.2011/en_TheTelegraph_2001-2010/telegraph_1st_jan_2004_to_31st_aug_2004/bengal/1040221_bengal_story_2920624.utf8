The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Patient dies without oxygen
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Uttarpara (Hooghly), Feb. 20: Fifty-year-old Amal Sil, a patient of chronic asthma, died at the state general hospital here allegedly after a doctor refused to put him on oxygen.																								Sil, a resident of Bally in Howrah, was admitted to the hospital around 9 last night with acute breathing problem. He died at three in the morning. 																								His son Tarun said he could have survived had the doctor not relied entirely on medicines and put him on oxygen immediately after admission. 																								Though my father was admitted at 9 last night with breathlessness, he was not provided oxygen till 2.30 am. My fathers condition worsened as he developed a vomiting tendency. When we approached S.K. Roy, the doctor on duty, with the request for oxygen, he did not bother to listen to us. Within half an hour, my father died, said Tarun.																								Abdul Mannan Mollah, the chief medical officer of Hooghly, later said a three-member probe panel has been constituted. It is gross negligence on the part of the doctor on duty not to administer oxygen to an asthma patient. We have sought an explanation from Roy, the doctor concerned, Mollah added.																								Minutes after the death, a mob of hundreds, mostly Trinamul Congress supporters and Sils relatives, laid siege to the hospital. They gheraoed superintendent Banamali Bala for about five hours demanding a probe and action against the doctor.																								The doctor under fire said he did not realise that the patients condition would deteriorate that fast. Though I gave him medicines immediately after his admission, I did not administer oxygen. I felt that the medicines would be good enough, said Roy.																								Two days ago, trouble erupted in the hospital, about 20 km from Calcutta, when relatives of a patient complained that he died after remaining unattended for hours.

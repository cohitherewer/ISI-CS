 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Engineering college closes doors
 PEMA LEYDA SHANGDERPAGangtok, March 1: The Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology at Mazitar, where students were on a strike since Saturday, has shut down for 15 days and asked students to go on leave.																								The closure order was issued by the vice-chancellor of Sikkim Manipal University, L.C. Amarnathan, this morning. The first-session examination, scheduled to begin today, will start once the classes resume after the break. 																								Varsity registrar S.D. Dhakal said the 15-day break was declared as the students were not allowing the college to function properly.																								The students had decided to stay away from classes and boycott the sessional exams to protest against the thrashing of first-year engineering student Prashant Praful, allegedly by teachers.																								An allegedly drunk Praful was caught trying to sneak into the campus with another student on Thursday night. He was later stripped, tied to a pole and thrashed by a group of 17 teachers, said Soubhik Sur, who was accompanying Praful. Sur hid near the generator room throughout that night.																								The pupils had demanded the resignation of students welfare officer Balwant Singh, who is said to have slapped Praful repeatedly, and an apology from the teachers.																								Dhakal, who was sent to the institute yesterday to probe the incident along with dean of Sikkim Manipal Institute of Medical Sciences R.P. Singh, failed to pacify the students. The students, he claimed, were not willing to listen to them and had started dictating terms. The student was drunk and had turned violent after being caught. There was no manhandling, Dhakal said. 																								Asked why the institute was being shut down, Dhakal said: We are concerned about the students and this was the best possible thing to do.

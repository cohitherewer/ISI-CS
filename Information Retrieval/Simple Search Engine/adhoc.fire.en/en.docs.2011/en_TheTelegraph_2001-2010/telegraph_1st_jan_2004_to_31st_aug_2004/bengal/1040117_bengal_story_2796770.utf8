 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Canal revamp on track
 STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 16: The renovation of the Keshtopur canal on the citys eastern fringes was formally launched today at Rajarhats New Township.																								The authorities laid out a detailed plan to flow in fresh water from the Hooghly to the canal, beautify a part of its banks and make it navigable like old times.																								Three portions of the canal  New Cut, Keshtopur and Bhangar Kata  will be renovated by the irrigation and waterways department and the Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco). 																								Hidco will take up the beautification work on the banks of the canal at Salt Lake and Rajarhat after it is done with desilting along a 20-km stretch. About 4 km of Hidcos project area is in Salt Lake.																								We shall also plant trees to make the banks stronger, Goutam Deb, the state housing development minister and chairman of Hidco, said. 																								Deb said the state irrigation and waterways department will give Rs 3.72 crore for the project. However, since this will be inadequate, we will provide an additional Rs 2 crore, he added.																								The minister stressed on the need to repair the lock gates connecting the canal with the Hooghly at Chitpur and with the Vidyadhari at Kulti. These lock gates are in a dilapidated state and need to be repaired. It will cost crores of rupees, he said. 																								All unauthorised residents along the banks of the canal will have to shift for the interest of lakhs of people, Deb added.																								State irrigation minister Amalendra Ray, who unveiled the project, said if fresh water from the Hooghly can flow in from the Chitpur lock gate, the canal can be used for navigation again. He said it would provide a link with the Sunderbans from where fresh vegetables can be ferried.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Writers wary of rebels
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, April 20: The government feels that extremist groups may resort to violence in certain areas in the run-up to and on the day of elections.																								We are not ruling out such a possibility and security measures are being tightened in certain pockets of the state, inspector-general, law and order, Chayan Mukherjee, said today.																								Security measures in south Bengal districts where the Peoples War is strong and in north Bengal areas where the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation is dominant would be different from the rest of the state, he added. Central forces will be deployed in these areas and they are due to arrive soon.																								Senior officials, including chief secretary Ashok Gupta, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and director-general of police Shyamal Dutta, had recently discussed security measures with the Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore district magistrates.																								Mukherjee said two threat letters written to officials allegedly by extremists were being probed. Achinto Mondal, block development officer of Mograhat I in South 24 Parganas, received a letter a few days ago asking him to boycott the elections. It threatened to kill him as well as 15 CPM, Trinamul and Congress workers in Mograhat if they took part in the polls. The Intelligence Branch is probing the episode.																								Two weeks ago, the block development officer of Bagmundi in Purulia received a letter that said he would face the same fate as Bandwan officer-in-charge Nilmadhav Das, who was killed in an ambush by extremists in October, unless he corrected alleged irregularities in the below- poverty-line list.																								Initial investigations do not confirm that the letter was sent by the Peoples War. However, adequate security has been offered to the official, Mukherjee said. In Mograhat, the district magistrate has ordered special security measures in and around the BDOs office. 																								Recent developments in Hooghly and South 24-Parganas indicate that Peoples War activists are infiltrating into urban areas. Senior police officers in South 24-Parganas said the presence of the Peoples War was strong in Garia and Baruipur on the southern fringes of the city.

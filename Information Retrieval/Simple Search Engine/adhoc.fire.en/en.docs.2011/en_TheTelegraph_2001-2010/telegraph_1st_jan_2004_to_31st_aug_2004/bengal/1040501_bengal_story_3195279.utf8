The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Govt says sorry, bans again
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER				 	 Taslima: Pariah?																								Calcutta, April 30: The government today confessed in court that its notification banning Taslima Nasrins Dwikhandita was improper.																								But that was no relief. The publication and sale of Dwikhandita were banned again under a fresh notification. 																								Earlier, the government had suspected that the Bangladeshi authors autobiographical work could create tension between two communities.																								Now, it feels it hurts the feelings of a particular community.																								Advocate-general Balai Ray told a special high court bench presided by Justice D.K. Seth that the book had been banned apprehending tension between two religious communities.... But, in reality, the government wanted to ban the book as it attempted to hurt the religious sentiment of a particular community. Hence a fresh notification. 																								Following the advocate-generals submission, the court declared a petition filed by Sujata Bhadra as infractuous and disposed of it. Bhadra had challenged the validity of the ban under Section 153A of the IPC. 																								His counsel later described the outcome as our moral victory and said they would challenge the fresh notification under Section 295A of the IPC as it goes against the authors fundamental rights.																								Dwikhandita, which was scheduled for a formal release at Calcutta Book Fair in January, was banned after a section of city intellectuals met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with the demand. 																								Taslima, who was in the city to release the book, had described the decision as a blow to her freedom of expression.

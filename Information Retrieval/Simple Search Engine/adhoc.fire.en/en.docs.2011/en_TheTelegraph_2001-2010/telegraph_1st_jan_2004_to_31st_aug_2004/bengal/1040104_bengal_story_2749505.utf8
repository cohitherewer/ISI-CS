 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Bid to keep tribals off Peoples War
 AVIJIT CHATTERJEE 																								Durgapur, Jan. 3: The state government is going all out to make the tribal population of Bankura, Purulia, the Midnapores and Hooghly part of the mainstream to stem the flow of cadre from these south Bengal districts to the Peoples War. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee conveyed the idea to the people of Jungle Mahal, a tribal-dominated area in Burdwan, while inaugurating Eklabya, a residential secondary school for the tribals of Raghunathpur. 																								We are committed to the tribal population and we are eager to help them join the mainstream. You need not feel inferior or deprived. I am aware that more than 7 lakh children of the state do not go to school but we have to get them educated, he said. 																								Last year, Peoples War posters surfaced in the surrounding areas of Jungle Mahal accompanied by death threats to local CPM leaders. Since then the CPM and the administration have taken up several developmental projects in the area. 																								The state backward class welfare department took up a project for a residential school after the Centre provided Rs 2.5 crore for the development of the districts tribal belt. Two separate hostels for boys and girls and a school are on the verge of completion. Appointment of residential teachers will be made soon. 																								Proper sanitation system will be provided in every house in the tribal belt as well as pump sets for better irrigation. The state backward class welfare department will ask the Union ministry of backward class welfare for more funds to complete the project, said Upen Kisku, the backward class welfare minister. 																								Initially, the school will run classes VI, VII and VIII with 60 students in each class but later it would be upgraded to a higher secondary school. Five more schools would be set up in the area to educate the tribal population, Bhattacharjee said. 																								He congratulated the district administration for completing the first phase of the project within nine months.

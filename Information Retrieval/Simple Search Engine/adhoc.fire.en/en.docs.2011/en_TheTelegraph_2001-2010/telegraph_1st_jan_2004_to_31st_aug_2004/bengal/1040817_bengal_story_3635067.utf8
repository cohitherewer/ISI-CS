The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 I-Day in school, but no teachers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, Aug. 16: The teachers of Maheshpur Uchyamadhyamik Vidyalaya were in for a shock this morning.																								Angry that neither the teachers nor the headmaster were present at the Independence Day programme yesterday, students locked up the school gate and kept the teachers confined to the staff room for nearly an hour.																								The tension was defused after the block development officer and a force from Bamungola police station arrived.																								Boys and girls had assembled in the school grounds yesterday to observe Independence Day. But none of their teachers, not even headmaster Nakul Mahato, were at the flag-hoisting ceremony.																								Finally, the students themselves hoisted the national flag, sang patriotic songs and went back home.																								We want to know why they did not come for the programme, the students asked while keeping the teachers and the headmaster confined. They did not because it was a Sunday, said a student. 																								Realising that the demonstration could get out of hand, Mahato rang up block development officer Ranjan Jha and Bamungola police station officer-in-charge Farid Hossain. 																								But Jha and Hossain failed to pacify the students. Finally, Mahatos apology on behalf of the teachers brought peace. 																								We are happy that the headmaster regretted having stayed away, a student said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, June 20, 2004 				 Story of apathy, retold in court 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 19: He took the witness box jaws set in grim determination  to get justice for the death of his young son. As he began recalling the final hours of Rajnis Patel, a budding cricketer, his determination dissolved in tears, like yesterday. 																								Voice choking and tears rolling down his cheeks, Manoj Patel (file picture above) narrated the facts during the fifth and final operation as the courtroom listened in silence. 																								On May 31, Rajnis had a bout of fever due to the infection, Patel resumed from where he had left off on Friday, drained and distraught. 																								Rajnis was not attended to and bled from his wound through the night. It was only on the following morning that a house staff changed the dressing soaked in blood, Patel said. 																								The pained father said the only sensitive person he met at the hospital was a nursing staff. She was concerned about my sons condition and said that if I wanted to save my son, SSKM was not the place to treat him, he told the judge between sobs. 																								During the operation (only a few hours before Rajnis died), doctor Nirmalya Basu approached Patel and asked him to sign a bond. I told him that I had not signed a bond on previous occasions, then why should I do so now? Patel said. 																								The doctor replied that it was necessary as Rajnis condition was very serious. 																								Rajnis was shifted to his bed after a successful operation and Patel was told his son was recovering well. 																								Only a few hours had gone by before my son developed respiratory problems round 3 am on June 2. Immediately, I informed doctors Jayanta Mondal and Nirmalya Basu. They came and massaged his chest but to no avail, Patel said before breaking down. His body racked by sobs, he added: His condition further deteriorated and he breathed his last around 5 am. 																								Rajnis, 17, died at SSKM hospital four months and five botched surgeries after he fractured his left shinbone in a match. 																								Testimony over, Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate Manjit Singh asked Patel to identify the accused doctors. Public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh placed material and documentary evidence before the court. 																								The copy of the FIR, the seizure list and related documents were produced before the judge. Then the X-ray films and the two steel plates along with its fittings that were used to repair Rajnis shinbone fracture were placed as evidence, Ghosh said.																								The judge adjourned the hearing for a month. The date of the next hearing has been fixed on July 19. Manoj Patel would be cross-examined on the day and then the rest of the witnesses would follow, Ghosh added.

				 Delhi DNA data delays Dalgaon trial

 AVIJIT SINHA 
 Jalpaiguri, Jan. 23: Police 
 are racing against time to file the chargesheet in the Dalgaon 
 flare-up with the DNA test results of the 19 people killed 
 in the garden yet to land from Delhi and only 13 days remaining 
 for the deadline to expire. 
																								A chargesheet has to be filed within 90 days of the accuseds first appearance in court. The police have to do it by February 5 in this case. 
																								On November 6, several hundred people attacked the house of former Citu leader of Dalgaon tea estate Tarakeswar Lohar and set it ablaze with 19 people inside. The immediate provocation was the recruitment of three outsiders in clerical posts, in which Lohar allegedly made money.
																								Lohar, who was missing at the time of the attack, was later arrested and charged with attempted murder and possession of arms. Another 108 people, picked up in connection with the massacre, also face murder charges. 
																								We hope to file the chargesheet on time. We expect the results of the DNA test to reach us before the deadline, said Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Siddh Nath Gupta. 
																								The DNA samples had been taken for identification of the bodies that were charred beyond recognition. The police were faced with an identity crisis after Lohar handed them a list of 25 people who were present at his house on that day. 
																								Samples were also taken from the parents and relatives of those mentioned in the list. A final list will be ready once the DNA samples are matched at the Central Forensic Laboratory in Delhi. 
																								With time running out, tension is building up in the district police. We are eagerly awaiting the DNA test results. So much work will go waste if it does not land on time, said a senior police officer. 
																								Six people among those arrested have obtained bail from the Alipurduar court, said sources.

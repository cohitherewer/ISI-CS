 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Santiniketan, Feb. 15: A student of Visva-Bharati University committed suicide on Valentines Day, allegedly frustrated over his unrequited love.																								Rajib Sarkar, 22, a resident of Patrasayar village in Bankura and a third-year undergraduate student of the physical education department, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Tan hostel room this morning. 																								Police said a suicide note and a photo album were found on his bed. From the note, it appears to be a case of suicide because of a frustrated affair, said Rabindranath Sarkar, subdivisional police officer, Bolpur. However, we will probe the incident to make sure there was no foul play, he added. 																								Vice-chancellor Sujit Basu said: This is very shocking for us.																								Rajibs hostel mate Abul Kalam Azad said there were only four students in the wing last evening. 																								He had dinner alone in his room last night and that was the last time we saw him, Kalam said. When we knocked on his door around seven in the morning, he did not answer. So we opened the window to see what he was up to and saw him hanging from the fan.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Aug. 7: Calcutta University has decided to recruit teachers on contract. 																								The Syndicate, the universitys highest policy-making body, took the decision this week in view of the acute funds crunch plaguing the institution for several years and the governments embargo on creation of new teaching posts. 																								Our decision to recruit teachers on contract is final. To begin with, we shall recruit teachers on contract for the IT department and then do so for other departments also in the coming days. This is being done for the benefit of students and to improve the quality of education, registrar Ujwal Basu said today. 																								Five teachers will be appointed at a time on contract for the information technology courses. We have plans to recruit three more teachers on contract soon for teaching post-graduate courses in polymer science, Basu said. 																								All five will be offered a consolidated salary of Rs 15,000 per month. They will be hired on a one-year contract that may be renewed, a university source said. 																								The source attributed the universitys financial crisis to the state governments decision to gradually cut down on its maintenance grants, amounting to about Rs 55 crore every year. A bulk of the maintenance grants is spent on paying the salaries of nearly 600 teachers and 2,500 non-teaching staff. 																								An official said the university was supposed to get an instalment of Rs 6 crore this month. But the government has released only Rs 4 crore, he added. 																								Another official explained that the governments embargo on creation of full-time teaching posts was posing a problem. At a time when we are forced to introduce more and more new courses in emerging areas like IT, computer science, bio-chemistry, polymer science, micro-biology and molecular biology bowing to students demands, the embargo has badly affected teaching of the courses, he said. 																								The new courses introduced over the past few years do not have full-time teachers. The authorities had to appoint the teachers on contract to run the courses smoothly. 																								The CPM-controlled Calcutta University Teachers Association said it would not protest against the hire-and-fire policy, provided the authorities restricted it to the new courses.																								There are nearly 600 permanent teaching posts and their entire salary is provided by the government at present. We will not allow the authorities to appoint a single teacher on contract against any of these 600 permanent post, a member said. 																								The registrar said teachers on contract would be engaged only for the new self-financing courses.

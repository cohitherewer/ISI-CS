 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Lost sandalwood tree in pond
 OUR CORRESPONDENT,																								Santiniketan, April 28: The sandalwood tree that went missing from Malancha has been found in a pond a few kilometres from Santiniketan, sparking hopes of a solution to the Tagore memorabilia heist.																								Bolpur police recovered large chunks of the tree from the pond called Kalisayar, near Sriniketan, following the interrogation of Sheikh Akhtar Nobi and his son Afroz, who were earlier arrested for the tree theft.																								Other pieces of the tree have already been sold or hidden elsewhere, the police believe.																								Raids to trace the tree from around Kalisayar were on since last evening. Finally, the police decided to look in the pond.																								Earlier, armed with information from Tagore-heist top suspect Pradip Bauri and Akhtars girlfriend, the police had dug around in the Moldanga and Mejhen localities but without any result.																								This time, we did not take chances and grilled Afroz for several hours and finally found the tree in several pieces, said Mrityunjoy Banerjee, the police station officer-in-charge.																								The recovery has sparked hopes of a solution to the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal and other memorabilia last month.																								In the last few days, we have picked up several persons and our investigation has revealed that a few involved in the sandalwood-tree theft and the missing-lock case (at Uddyan Vibhag) might have a hand in the museum theft, a senior police officer overseeing the probe said.																								We should be able to solve the Tagore heist case also. Getting specific information about a person like Abhoy Mahapatra (the arrested Visva-Bharati garden superintendent), who had regular contacts with people like Bauri and Akhtar and at the same time with high-level university officials, was a steppingstone for that, another senior officer said.																								Abhoys involvement in the lock-breaking case and this information will open up many closed doors in the Tagore heist (case) as well, the officer added.																								The sandalwood tree near the Uttarayan complex was found missing on January 13. Twelve days later, Mahapatra lodged a complaint with the police station through the watch and ward department of the varsity.																								Sleuths found specific documents against Mahapatra through which his illegal deals with Akhtar under false names were revealed. 																								Akhtar took a contract in the name of his one-and-a-half-year old grandson and Mahapatra had signed the papers, the officer said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Life term for Kalus catch
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, June 17: If Kalu were alive, he would have wagged his tail.																								The sniffer Doberman from Burdwan police lines had helped trace the culprits after a triple murder at Goswamikhanda in Ausgram, nearly 200 km from Calcutta, last September. 																								Today, Sasanka Pramanick, Nilkantha Das Bairagya, Sukumar Ghosh and Basudeb Banerjee were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life by the additional sessions judge of a special court, Nandita Majumdar.																								Kalu died a fortnight ago following an infection in his left hind leg. 																								Early on September 26, the four raided the house of Uttam Basuri, armed with daggers and information that he had sold a plot and kept the money at home. When they did not find the money, they hacked Basuri to death in front of his wife and daughter. Then they killed Chandana and Rupa to wipe out the witnesses. When the police reached Ausgram, Basuri, his wife and five-year-old daughter were lying dead in pools of blood. Chandana was nine months pregnant. She had been butchered and her foetus flung away. 																								The police were clueless as nothing was missing from the house. No one could tell the police about any enemy that the family may have had. 																								On a rain-soaked morning, when all searches had failed, Kalu stepped in.																								It was raining heavily and we were surrounded by agitated villagers. Kalu guided us a kilometre away, where we found the murder weapon from a pond. He then headed straight to Sasankas house and sniffed out a blood-stained shirt. Seeing Sasanka, Kalu lunged. He confessed to his crime and helped us arrest the others, said an officer. 																								Impressed with their teammates performance, the police had recommended Kalu for an award.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER Calcutta, April 7: A Calcutta High Court judge today criticised the method adopted by police in investigating complaints. 																								Police should be impartial and should refrain from taking the help of complainants while conducting inquiries, Justice Barin Ghosh said. He asked North 24-Parganas superintendent B.R. Ramesh to direct Baranagar police station to probe afresh the complaint lodged by Subir Roy, owner of Kajol Industries.																								The order follows an accusation that a sub-inspector of the police station, Subhasish Chakraborty, and two constables went to Mumbai by air to conduct an inquiry into a cheating case and returned after arresting a person. The complainant underwrote their expenses, the complaint said. 																								Justice Ghosh had asked former superintendent Basudeb Bag to file a report. Bag admitted he had given verbal permission to the sub-inspector to go to Mumbai. 																								By Bags own admission, it is a practice with the police to take money from complainants for undertaking tours, if needed for early disposal of cases. He added that the police did not have the infrastructure to probe cases quickly. 																								Bag also told the court that in accordance with the judges direction, the police officials who had travelled to Mumbai were suspended.																								Unhappy with Bags report, Justice Ghosh asked the state police chief to address the issue and file a separate report. 																								The director-general submitted his report today, saying his department did not approve of the sponsored journey by the policemen. 																								He added that his department had not issued any tour warrant to the travelling policemen and clarified that according to the rules, policemen would have to get a tour warrant before leaving the state for inquiries. 																								The judge appreciated the report and said the police should be impartial while dealing with a case. He also said the police department must be provided the necessary infrastructure.

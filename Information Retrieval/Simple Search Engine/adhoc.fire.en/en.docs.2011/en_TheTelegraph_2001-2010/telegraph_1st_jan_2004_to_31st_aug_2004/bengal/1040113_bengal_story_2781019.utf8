The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 A sop and promise of more
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 12: Mamata Banerjee, the new coal and mines minister, today announced a 15 per cent interim relief for seven million coal industry employees with effect from January 1.																								The minister, who met the Coal India Limited brass and leaders of the Joint Bipartite Coal Committee of India, said no colliery would be shut down and there would be no retrenchment.																								The statement comes three days after Mamata took charge of the ministry and in the face of Coal Indias attempts to shut down loss-making collieries. 																								Mamatas remarks were welcomed by the trade unions. The minister said she would request the Union labour department to discuss the relief with the steel ministry so that miners at Tata Steel and the Indian Iron and Steel Company also get the benefit.																								She would discuss customs duty on coal with the finance minister. The unions have urged Mamata to restore customs duty on imported coal at the pre-1991 level of 85 per cent. It is 25 per cent now. The bill to pave the way for private participation in coal mining will not be pushed through without the unions consensus, Mamata said.

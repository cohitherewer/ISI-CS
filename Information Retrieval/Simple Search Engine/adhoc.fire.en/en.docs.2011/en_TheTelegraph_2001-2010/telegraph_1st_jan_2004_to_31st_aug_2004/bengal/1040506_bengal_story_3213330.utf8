 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Dawa dares Buddha
 PROBIR PRAMANIK 																								Siliguri, May 5: Dawa Narbula, the Congress candidate from Darjeeling, today reacted to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees insinuation that he had links with the ISI saying he would write to the Election Commission against him.																								Bhattacharjee had said at a rally in Chopra yesterday that Subash Ghisingh had told him he would never back Narbula or the Peoples Democratic Front (PDF) for their ISI links. The Congress is a partner in the five-party PDF that includes the BJP.																								Buddhas revelation followed Ghisinghs surprise announcement that the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) would back Narbula and not boycott the polls as in the past three general elections. The CPM had benefited from the boycott on all the occasions. 																								Narbula said: It is unfortunate that the chief minister made such an irresponsible statement. Bhattacharjee has lost his mental balance after the GNLF, whose support he personally tried to secure, refused to back his party. I will not only write to the Election Commission but will take legal action against Bhattacharjee. I am going to file a defamation case.																								Narbula slammed Bhattacharjee for what he said was a breach of the Official Secrets Act. 																								What Ghisingh as the chairman of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council and Bhattacharjee as the chief minister discussed in private should not have been made public. We do not know what Ghisingh told the chief minister..., Narbula said.																								GNLFs Darjeeling unit chief Deepak Gurung echoed him. The (Bhattacharjees) statement is baseless. He has no moral right to disclose what he had discussed with our chief, he said.																								Even as Narbula opened fire on Bhattacharjee in Darjeeling, the chief ministers man, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, said in Siliguri the CPM was willing to discuss a pact with the PDF before the November polls to the hill council.

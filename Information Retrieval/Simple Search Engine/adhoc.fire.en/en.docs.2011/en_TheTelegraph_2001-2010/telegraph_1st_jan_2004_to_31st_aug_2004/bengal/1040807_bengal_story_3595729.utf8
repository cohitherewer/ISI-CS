The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Rs 100 cr for roads and dams
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Water from the Bay of Bengal rushing into a village in the Sunderbans following a breach in an embankment. File picture Calcutta, Aug. 6: The finance  minister, who had been forced to keep his fists tight because  of the states cash crunch, announced Rs 100 crore for emergency  repair of roads and embankments.																								Sources at Writers Buildings said PWD minister Amar Chowdhury and irrigation minister Ganesh Mondal had told Asim Dasgupta that several roads and embankments needed immediate repair.																								The irrigation department has already got busy drawing up a list of embankments that need to be fixed before the monsoon takes a fresh toll.																								Mondal said he had sought about Rs 25 crore for embankments in North and South 24-Parganas and the coastal areas between Digha and Shankarpur in East Midnapore. We have miles of damaged embankment in these districts. We know it will be difficult to carry out repairs during monsoon but as rain has been scarce since July, we hope to start some of the work immediately, the minister said.																								Chowdhury, who had asked his officers to coordinate with the zilla parishads and identify roads that needed to be repaired immediately, said a list would be drawn up soon. We had drawn the finance ministers attention to the fact that some major roads in the districts were in very bad shape, said Chowdhury.																								PWD sources said some minor repair work was taken up before the Lok Sabha elections but no large-scale repairs could be carried out because of paucity of funds. Of the Rs 100 crore, the PWD expects about Rs 40-50 crore for roads. 																								But even this fund is inadequate for large-scale repairs. We will only be able to carry out patchwork, said a PWD official.

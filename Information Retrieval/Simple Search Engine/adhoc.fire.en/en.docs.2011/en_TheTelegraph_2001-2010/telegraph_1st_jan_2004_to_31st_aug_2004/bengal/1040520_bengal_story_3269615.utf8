The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Loss lash on Mamata, Modi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, May 19: Muslim leaders tonight apportioned much of the blame for the Trinamul Congress dismal poll performance on Mamata Banerjee, saying her compliment to Narendra Modi on winning the Gujarat Assembly elections had cost the party its minority bases. 																								Leaders like Sultan Ahmed and Samsuzzaman Ansari told Mamata that the party had made a tactical error in renewing association with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. 																								We dissociated ourselves from the NDA over the Tehelka issue when the coalition was an asset to us. Mamata was then the railway minister. But we showed solidarity with the NDA after the Gujarat riots when the entire country condemned Modi. Our party leader went ahead and complimented Modi after the Gujarat elections, sources quoted Ahmed as saying at the meeting which lasted over five hours at Trinamul Bhavan in Topsia. 																								Leaders like Sougata Roy said the slashing of interest rates of small savings and provident fund had severely affected the middle class and poor people. Our party had to bear the brunt of popular discontent towards the NDAs economic policy in the elections, one of those present said .																								Despite deep divisions in the party over the alliance with the NDA, Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee reiterated that the party would remain a part and parcel of the BJP-led coalition and work with the state BJP to fight the CPM in Bengal. 																								In an expected move, the party suspended Nayana, the actor-turned-legislator from Bowbazar and wife of Trinamul rebel Sudip Bandopadhyay, for six years, along with councillor Radheshyam Saha from ward 51 for campaigning for the Congress-backed Independent from Calcutta Northwest.

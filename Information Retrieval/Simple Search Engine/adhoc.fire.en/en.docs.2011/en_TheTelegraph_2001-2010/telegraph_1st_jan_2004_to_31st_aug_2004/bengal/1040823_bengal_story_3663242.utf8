 VIVEK CHHETRI																								Darjeeling, Aug. 22: Truant students were known to try securing proxy attendance, but teachers bunking classes and registering their presence through dummies were not. 																								However, some teachers in the hills seem to have mastered the skill. 																								The regular teacher pays the dummy for taking classes. Teachers who earn between Rs 7,000 and 12,000 apparently pay between Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,500 to their dummies.																								B.B. Pradhan, the general secretary of the Hill Secondary Teachers Organisation, said: Most headmasters are scared to complain against teachers who hire dummies. The problem would not have been there had the inspector of schools come for regular checks but he does not and the errant teachers do as they please.																								He added that at least three headmasters have complained against proxy teachers. 																								The teaching fraternity is keen to see the black sheep punished. Some of them have threatened a hunger strike.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, February 29, 2004 				 Family faces poll brunt
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Feb. 28: Four members of a family were attacked by alleged CPM activists in Ausgram today for ignoring the partys diktat to attend an election meeting.																								The incident comes three days after Citu, the partys labour arm, locked up around 1,700 employees of Calcutta Port Trust in Haldia dock for defying Tuesdays industrial strike.																								Police confirmed that three of the victims were critically injured and admitted to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.																								CPM leaders, however, denied the involvement of party members in the attack.																								The clash broke out this morning among rival groups of villagers over a past feud and this has nothing to do with politics. The charges against me are false and fabricated, CPMs Burdwan district secretary Amal Halder said.																								Residents said the partys Guskara zonal committee had called a meeting at Naoda village  around 180 km from Calcutta  last evening in the light of the coming Lok Sabha elections.																								Raju Mondal and his two sons, daily-wagers by profession, could not attend the meeting. A group of seven persons, alleged to be CPM workers, including a zonal committee member, barged into Mondals house and attacked him and his sons with spears and other weapons.																								The residents alleged that a woman of the family was also tied up and beaten. Villagers rushed to Mondals house hearing their screams, but before they could do anything, the assailants fled.																								Raju and his sons, Khokon and Seepan, were rushed to hospital. One of Khokons arms was severely damaged, while the blade of a spear pierced into Seepans arm. Doctors had to operate on him, hospital sources said.																								Police officials were tight-lipped about the incident. We have not yet received any complaint. Once we get one, we will take proper action, Burdwan additional superintendent of police Shib Shankar Bose said. Citu raps leader																								Two days after Citu activists ransacked a chemical factory in Durgapur and manhandled its officials, the Burdwan district Citu leadership today summoned local leader Debabrata Sai and asked him to settle the dispute with the factory authorities immediately.

 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Bandit queen in Bengal stuns police 
 NARESH JANA				 	 Phoolan Devi after her surrender. File picture Midnapore, Aug. 25: The  ravines of Chambal once shook in fear of Phoolan Devi, the  Bandit Queen. The forests of West Midnapore are now astir  with the footfall of a gang of 40 led by a woman. 																								The district police got a sniff of the gang after the arrest of two women dacoits  Sobhonara Bibi and Aslima Bibi  in connection with a robbery at Chandrakona, about 130 km from Calcutta. 																								Dacoits raided a house on August 13 and looted jewellery worth Rs 5 lakh, other valuables and cash. An officer of Chandrakona police station said: The victims told us that a woman in a sari was directing her male companions during the raid.																								Early August, the same gang raided another house in the area. But one of the dacoits, Jaan Mohammad, was shot dead by the owner of the house. Police questioned Jaans wife Fatima and raided two hideouts to pick up Sobhonara and Aslima.																								We are interrogating the arrested women to find out how many crimes they have committed so far. We have detained four other women, whose names cannot be disclosed, the officer said.																								Most of the women in the group are said to be widows of dacoits. The rest are girlfriends of notorious bandits who were killed by rival gangs, he added.																								Senior officers concurred that they had not heard about women dacoits in the region before. This is the first time we have come to know about women in robberies. A high-level investigation is on to track down the rest of the women, said Manoj Verma, the Kharagpur additional superintendent of police.																								In 1997, Soma Saha, a dacoit leader, was arrested at Hooghlys Uttarpara while fleeing after a heist. She is still in jail. Phoolan, who had given up arms and joined politics to become an MP before being murdered, inspired several women gangsters in the rugged and harsh terrain bordering Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Many of them, including the dreaded Seema Parihar, have surrendered. Several are still active.																								A West Midnapore police officer said: It appears that at least 20 dacoits participated in the (August 13) raid.																								Sonali Barik, a member of the robbed family, said a woman called the shots during the raid that lasted about two hours. A group of male dacoits was beating up my husband and a woman in her mid-30s was standing in the middle of the room, directing others what to take and what not to. I held her feet and requested her to spare him. The dacoits stopped when she asked them to, said Sonali.																								Sobhonara and Aslima told the police during interrogation that they were part of a 40-member gang comprising men and women from Hooghly and Midnapore. They are well organised. They use a truck and a matador van to move from one place to another, said an officer.																								Weeks ago, the police intercepted a truck and found a woman surrounded by about 15 men and women. They said she had consumed poison and were on way to hospital. Now it seems that the gang tricked its way through a cordon, said an officer.

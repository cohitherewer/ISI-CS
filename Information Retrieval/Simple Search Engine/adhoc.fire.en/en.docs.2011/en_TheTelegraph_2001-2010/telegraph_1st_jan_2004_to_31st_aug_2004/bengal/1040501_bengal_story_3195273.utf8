The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 IBM to expand presence in state
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, April 30: IBM has expressed interest in broadbasing its learning services in Bengal.																								IBM executives Marcello Roman, the director of its American information technology education services, and Arleta Chen, director (learning solutions) Asia-Pacific, today met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Building to discuss their plans in the learning services sector.																								After the 40-minute talks, Roman said: It was a good meeting. 																								IBM already has a presence in learning services in the state. In May 2002, the company signed an agreement with Webel Technology to provide infotech education in 200 schools run by the government. 																								As part of the agreement, IBM imparts IT education between classes VII and XII. Providing equipment and managing the project is also part of the deal.																								Information technology secretary G.D. Gautama said: They (IBM) want to get more involved in learning services in the state. 																								IBM has tie-ups with north Bengal and Calcutta universities and IIIT for imparting technical education. Gautama said its officials feel that Bengal can provide a rich human resource pool for information technology. 																								There is a huge gap between the supply and demand of human resources in this sector and IBM feels that if the young generation in the state is trained properly, they can fill a portion of this void. 																								The IBM duo also met infotech minister Manab Mukherjee and school education minister Kanti Biswas to discuss the ongoing project.																								More than 2,00,000 students in 56 countries are trained in information technology under the IBM Learning Services Programme that helps the company rake in $650 million.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Missing glare on guards and nurses 
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, June 20: Stung by yet another death of a patient who had walked out of a hospital, the government has decided to strengthen the lax security system and take stern action against nursing staff for delaying reports on those missing. 																								Ashis Chakraborty, bearing a sticker indicating he was a patient of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, was found dead outside on Friday. Nurses had not reported his disappearance for over three hours. 																								C.R. Maiti, the director of medical education, today said any laxity on the part of nurses and support staff, specially security personnel, leading to patients disappearance would not be accepted. 																								We will do whatever has to be done, but ultimately it is up to the hospitals to ensure that stern action is taken against the guilty, Maiti added. 																								The government had planned a dress code for patients, but it fell through on cost considerations. The enormity of the task is a lot more. But we will definitely strengthen security to check this issue, said Maiti. Deploying more ex-servicemen in wards and asking one family member to stay round-the-clock with patients suffering from depression is another option, officials added.

 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Fees for fire clearance 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Jan. 7: The government today decided to levy fees for issuing clearance certificates from the fire brigade for any new construction. 																								At present, the certificate, mandatory from the fire brigade for any new construction, comes for free. 																								Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said the fees would initially be slapped on high-rises. We will later impose fees on smaller buildings, he added. 																								Builders will have to deposit the fees at the time of submission of a building plan. All the agencies like the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board take fees for sanctioning a building plan. So, why should fees not be collected by the fire brigade department? he asked. 																								The minister said fire brigade officials are working on the rates of the proposed fees.

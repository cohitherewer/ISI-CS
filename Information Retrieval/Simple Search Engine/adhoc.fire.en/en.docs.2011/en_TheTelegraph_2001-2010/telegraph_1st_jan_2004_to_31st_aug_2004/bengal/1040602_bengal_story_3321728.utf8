The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Highway brass pat Buddha
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, June 1: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today won kudos from officials of the National Highways Authority of India for extending full co-operation to the Golden Quadrilateral Project, billed as the dream scheme of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								NHAI chief general manager (technical) S.P.S. Bakshi, who called on the chief minister, discussed various issues related to the project.																								West Bengal is the only state where review meetings are held at the chief secretary level every month. The government has been very prompt in arranging meetings and initiating action on our request, Bakshi said after the 30-minute meeting with Bhattacharjee. Asok Gupta, the chief secretary, was also present.																								Asked if the December 2004 deadline could be met, Bakshi said the project would be substantially complete by the end of the year and it would take another three to four months to put the finishing touches.																								The project had hit several roadblocks in the state due to delay in land acquisition, demand for underpasses by residents and regular interference from union lobbies and political parties.																								From the very beginning there have been delays in the project for various reasons. Rise in costs like steep increase in steel prices and the monsoon will further affect progress in the next few months. There is little chance that the deadline will be met, said a source. 																								To work out a strategy to maintain the pace during the monsoon, Bakshi met representatives of the contractors  Gamuda, RBM-Pati and HCC among them  during his stay in the city. Several contractors are involved in the project estimated to be worth Rs 4,000-crore in the state.																								The critical phases are over and so we dont think that the monsoon will have any significant impact, Bakshi claimed. He also said that some problems affected work at stages, but added that the delays were minimised due to the proactive stance of the government.																								Bakshi said the district administration did its best when suspected Naxalite outfits stalled work in Jhargram and anti-social groups disrupted the project on Durgapur Expressway. He added that Writers Buildings intervention helped solve problems when Citu demanded hiring of local labourers.																								The message from the chief minister about the timely completion of the project is clear, Bakshi said.

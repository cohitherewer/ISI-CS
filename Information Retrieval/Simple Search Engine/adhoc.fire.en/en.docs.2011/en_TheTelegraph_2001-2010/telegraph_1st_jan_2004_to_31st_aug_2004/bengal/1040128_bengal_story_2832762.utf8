 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jalpaiguri, Jan. 27: KLO militants who have surrendered will become home-guards in the district as part of a rehabilitation policy approved by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during his last north Bengal trip. 																								The recruitment is expected to be complete by next month, said sources.																								Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Siddh Nath Gupta said: Out of about 80 KLO militants who surrendered before us or the Royal Bhutan Army during the Bhutanese operation last year, 50 will be offered jobs as home-guards. For those who are not interested in joining the department or are not fit enough, there will be other employment schemes. 																								Several militants have surrendered since September 2001, disillusioned with the movement and lured by promises of government jobs. 																								The rehabilitation, however, has not been easy.																								Tarzan, who was absorbed in the first self-help group, and many like him ended up feeling frustrated as they were given little work to do.																								According to some of the surrendered militants, the earlier self-help groups failed as means to return to the mainstream as the government had expected the members to put together the initial finance. The members of these groups, however, were in no position to cough up that kind of money.																								Another defect of the self-help schemes was lack of focus on individuals, a problem that the new policy tries to address. 																								The government till now was not bothered about any of us. Several times in the past, we applied for loans to start our own business but were rejected. We ended up having a job but not doing any work, said Tarzan.																								Asked about the new move, he said it was a dream come true. I have always wanted to do become a policeman. Now that I have decided to return to normal life, I am delighted about the governments proposal. 																								The placement of the surrendered rebels as home-guards is also good news for the short-staffed department. There are only 1,100 cadets in Jalpaiguri, the sources said. 																								Of them, nearly 750 work in the police department and the remaining have been deputed at government offices like the West Bengal State Electricity Board and the public works department. We need as many as 900 more home-guards. However, we are not yet aware of any decision to recruit former rebels, a senior official of the district home-guards department said.

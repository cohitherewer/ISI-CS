The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 State heat on poll monitors
 SWATI SENGUPTA				 	 Amanullah: In the line of fire																								Calcutta, June 21: The elections are over and the new government in place at the Centre. But the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is unable to leave behind its experience with central election observers. 																								Chief electoral officer of the state Basudeb Banerjee, who will attend an Election Commission meeting in Delhi on Wednesday, would raise the issue and let it be known that Bengal wants the observers to be better trained in dos and donts.																								I will tell the commission that a number of observers went against directives in their handbook, which had clearly defined their roles, Banerjee told The Telegraph today. 																								Though the officer refused to admit that the CPM or the Left Front regime had put words into his mouth, his move was clearly a follow-up of the ruling alliances reaction to the observers alleged excesses in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.																								Front chairman Biman Bose, had said at a news conference at the CPMs Alimuddin Street headquarters: They (some observers) will be caught by the collar by our party cadre and taken to police stations. He had also said that CPM workers would identify, detain and put them in police custody for apparently questioning voters rights to support a party of their choice. 																								I will tell the Commission that observers must not speak to the media. They must also be reminded of the way they interacted with officials, political parties and the public, Banerjee said today. In saying so, he pointed a finger particularly at special observer Afzal Amanullah, who had spoken to reporters several times during his stay here. 																								Amanullah had bracketed Bengal with Bihar while speaking to the media and said on another occasion that there would be a blanket ban on two-wheelers on the day of polling.																								The observers job is to observe and not comment. They should know that for sure, Banerjee said. He will bring to the commissions notice that all observers should work within their jurisdiction and not ask people who they voted for, as some allegedly did. 																								Bose had alleged that an observer had been intimidating voters while another had reportedly asked police to arrest people against whom complaints were lodged by an Opposition party. In another case, an observer had allegedly asked the block development officer to remove CPM posters. Another reportedly wanted to know from voters if they were forced to vote for CPM candidates in the last elections.																								Though the commission is reported to have spoken to Amanullah and other observers who flouted the directives, Banerjee will use the fresh opportunity to suggest that the issue is not forgotten. 																								The office of the chief electoral officer faced the brunt of the after-effects of the behaviour of the EC observers, an official said.																								Like in the lead-up to the polls, the state is keen to avoid any confrontation with chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy and his colleagues but sources said the government is annoyed about the commissions decision to bring polling personnel from other states.

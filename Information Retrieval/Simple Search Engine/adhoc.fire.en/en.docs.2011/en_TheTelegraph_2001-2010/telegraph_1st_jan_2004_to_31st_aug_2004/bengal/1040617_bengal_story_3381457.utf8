 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Court orders salary for matron after 27 years 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER Calcutta, June 16: Teacher Pranab Sengupta got Rs 21.75 as salary for over 31 years because the state did not approve his appointment. Mallika Giri has not received a paisa since she started working as matron in the residential Boheen C.R.D. High School from October 3, 1977, in West Midnapore. 																								The schools managing committee appointed her but the approval from the state school education department never came. For 27 years, the 56-year-old Giri survived on doles by the teachers and students. 																								Sengupta, of the Basak Bagan Primary School in Calcutta, did the rounds of courts for 12 years before a cheque for Rs 8,390  his legitimate salary  reached him in May. Giri began her fight in Calcutta High Court  where Sengupta, too, had started  last year. 																								Today, the court directed the district inspector (DI) of schools of West Midnapore to approve Giris appointment and fix her payscale without any delay.																								Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya also asked the education department to calculate her salary arrears. 																								Giri moved the high court in 2003 on the advice of a teacher. In her petition, Giri referred to a case in which Manoranjan Chowdhurys appointment  made by the school in the same year as hers  was approved by the education department.																								In Giris case, it was clear discrimination on the part of the government. The court should intervene in the matter, her lawyer had argued. 																								After hearing the plea last August, Justice Girish Gupta directed the education department to approve the service of the petitioner. Giri then wrote to the DI, annexing a copy of the high court judgment. 																								But the DI, even after knowing the judgment, informed my client that her service would not be approved. The decision of the DI prompted us to file a contempt case. Today the judge told the DI, who was present, that the order of the court would have to be carried out, Giris lawyer said. 																								The court today also approved the decision of the East Midnapore DI to terminate the service of Abhoy Chandra Jana, who worked as teacher in Takapara Adarsha Vidya Mandir at Amdabad for 22 years by submitting fake certificates.

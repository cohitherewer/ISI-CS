 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Affair whiff in student death 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Krishnagar (Nadia), Jan. 14: Police today arrested a 17-year-old schoolboy and a youth from Kalyani in connection with the murder of Amit Saha, whose decomposed body was found in a field yesterday. They will be produced in court tomorrow. 																								Amit, a Class XII student of Adarsha Sikhayatan in Kalyani, went for private tuition on September 22 last year and never returned home. 																								District police superintendent Benoy Chakraborty said Shekhar Das, the brother of Amits girlfriend, and a classmate, Laltu Ghosh, were picked up this morning on the basis of a complaint lodged by Amits father, Haripada. 																								Preliminary investigation revealed that Shekhar might have plotted the murder of Amit after he came to know about his affair with his sister, a Class IX student of a girls school at Goyeshpur in Kalyani. Amits classmate Laltu, who knew about it, did not disclose anything. However, we are yet to confirm whether the revenge motive is solely responsible for the murder or not, he added. 																								Chakraborty said Shekhar was last seen with Amit in the night of September 22  when he disappeared  at Kanchrapara near Kalyani. Laltu, who might not have any direct link with the murder, had enquired about Amit when he went missing, he said. 																								Kalyani sub-divisional police officer Prasun Banerjee said the two are being grilled to ascertain if professional killers were engaged. We have a feeling Shekhar might have masterminded the crime in association with some of his friends, he added.  Kidnap relief 																								While Amits father mourned, Akram Hussein, a contractor in Haldia, heaved a sigh of relief when his missing six-year-old son was found standing alone near a bus-stand at Chaitanyapur, 15 km from Haldia. 																								Tahir Ali was reported missing from school from the tiffin break on Tuesday afternoon. Hussein immediately filed an FIR, suspecting that his son had been abducted.																								Tahir could not explain how he had come to the bus-stand. Acting on a haunch, police arrested a minor contractor, Sukumar Maity, who harboured a professional grudge against Hussein. 																								Police believe that was the motive, but Maity has not admitted to any wrongdoing. He is being interrogated.

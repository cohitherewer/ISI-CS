The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 The end, of year and a life
 A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta, Dec. 31: His  hopes ended with the year. Four years in an old age home  had squeezed out his will to live through another new year. 																								Barely 24 hours before the world ushered in 2004, 84-year-old Gouri Shankar Lahiri committed suicide by jumping off the roof of Navaneer, a seniors shelter at Chetla here. 																								His roommates first noticed his body lying in a pool of blood on the pavement. They immediately called a doctor, who declared him dead. 																								Police said Lahiri was suffering from acute depression which could have led him to take the drastic step. 																								Though we have not found any suicide note, after interrogating the other inmates, we came to know the old man was depressed from the day he joined the home, said Prakash Ghosh, the officer-in-charge of New Alipore police station.																								Home superintendent Bithi Sarkar said Lahiri, a bachelor, was lodged in the home four year ago by his nephew. 																								The person was suffering from depression. None of his relatives used to come to meet him. They would come once a month only to pay the monthly fee. It probably made him frustrated.																								Home officials said Lahiris roommate Sudhanshu Shekhar Dey woke up around 5 am and went out for his usual morning walk. It was around 6 am when he returned and Lahiri was still in his bed, said Sarkar. 																								Lahiri later came down from his room on the third floor and asked for a cup of black tea at the kitchen. 																								One of our kitchen boys took the tea upstairs for him. But he returned soon as Lahiri was not in his room, Sarkar narrated.																								Initially, the home staff did not suspect anything. We thought he might have gone to a local barber shop for a shave. After some time we inquired and found he was not there. We thought he had gone to the rooftop for his regular physical exercise. But he was nowhere to be found, said an employee. 																								Dey and the others noticed Lahiris slippers lying in a corner on the roof. We went to the corner and leaned over to see Lahiris body lying on the pavement, recalled Dey. 																								The police do not suspect any foul play. We sent the body for post-mortem. If the report confirms it was a case of suicide, the body will be handed over to the deceaseds family on Thursday, said a policeman.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT Raiganj, Jan. 9: Doctors  at the district hospital here clashed inside the operation  theatre midway through a surgery over who had the right  to the beds.																								Assistants at the hospital said the clash between two doctors broke out a little after noon at the two-bed operation theatre in the gynaecology ward. The surgery room had been booked by the husband-wife team of gynaecologists, Uttam Kumar Ghosh and Rini Mukherjee, for 12 noon where they had two patients to operate upon.																								But, the hospital workers said, around 15 minutes into the operation, doctors Pradip Kumar Mondol and Arijit Haldar barged in and demanded that they needed the beds for a surgery. Dr Ghosh was operating on a patient and his wife, too, was preparing for a surgery and they told Mondol and Haldar that the beds were not free. This led to an altercation and Mondol and Haldar threatened Rini Mukherjee. Dr Ghosh came forward to rescue his wife but was beaten by the duo, said a worker, who witnessed the clash. 																								It was left to hospital superintendent Surendra Nath Gachait and the relatives of the patients, who had rushed to the operation theatre, to calm down the warring doctors. The operation resumed a few minutes later.																								Relatives of the patients alleged that the doctors were more concerned about making money than the well being of those admitted in the hospital. Joga Das, a former councillor whose relative is recuperating in the gynaecology ward, said: We heard a commotion inside the operation theatre and saw to our amazement that the doctors were actually fighting. You can well imagine the plight of the hospital where the doctors fight inside the operation theatre where a patient is lying under anaesthesia.																								The relative of yet another patient said the doctors were not concerned about the patients. They were more interested in their private practice in the evenings. Hence the rush to get the operation theatre beds, he said.																								An embarrassed hospital superintendent Gachait said disciplinary action would be taken against those found guilty. The doctors should have known that the operation theatre is not the place to settle disputes. What happened was unfortunate. We will begin a departmental inquiry.																								Ghosh said attacks on doctors were not uncommon in the hospital. I have been the victim of this lack of security in the past. I would not say anything more.																								Mondol said he was worried about his patient. It was an emergency case. I requested the doctors to hurry up but that led to an altercation, he said.

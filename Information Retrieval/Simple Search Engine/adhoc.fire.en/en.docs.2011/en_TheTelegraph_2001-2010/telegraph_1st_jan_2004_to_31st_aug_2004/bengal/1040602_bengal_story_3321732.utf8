																								Burdwan, June 1: Not sure when he would get his next blood transfusion, thalassaemia patient Jamir Mirza allegedly committed suicide by taking poison at his Raina home last night.

Mirza, whose brother Amir is also a thalassaemia patient, requires two bottles of blood every month.																								Mirzas uncle Samsher Ali said he consumed pesticide at Shankarpur village, about 150 km from Calcutta, last night.																								The deputy superintendent of the medical college here said there is no blood with them. It is the same every summer.

 DEBASHISH CHATTERJEE An estuarine crocodile: BewareCalcutta, Aug. 2: A crocodile dragged away Gangamoyee Jana last night as she was looking for shrimps and crabs in the Mridangabhanga river in the Sunderbans.																								The decimated body of the 48-year-old woman, who went missing from the Aswini Maity Jetty near Lakshmipur, about 160 km from Calcutta, was found this morning.																								South 24-Parganas additional superintendent of police B.C. Mondal said this was the second incident of crocodile attack in the past few months. The first victim, early this year, was also a woman busy catching crabs in the same area. 																								Alarmed at the increasing deaths from crocodile attacks, minister of state for Sunderbans development Kanti Ganguly said people in the riverine belt have been asked not go to the river at night. We repeatedly ask villagers not to venture at night but they hardly listen. We have already banned fishing at night in the Sunderbans without permission, Ganguly said.

 SWATI SENGUPTA				 	 Writers Buildings: Corridors of din?																								Calcutta, May 16: Dont blame the babus at Writers Buildings for failing to finish work in time. Dont be surprised either if irritated officials snap at you every time there is work to get done. It could all be because their workplace is way too noisy.																								A quasi-experiment by an enthusiastic government officer armed with noise meters from the pollution control board four years ago showed high noise levels at Writers and that set the alarm bells ringing. An official test is now on its way. 																								My tests were conducted with a purely academic interest but they threw up interesting results, said the officer who measured the decibel level at the states administrative headquarters. 																								His report did not see the light of day. 																								Employees were asked if they found their workplace noisy, very noisy or not much noisy. Among 40 respondents, 50 per cent said they found their workplace noisy. The rest found it very noisy. 																								The meter recorded a sound range from 75 to 90 decibels. 																								According to Noise Regulation and Control Rules, commercial areas may have an average noise level of up to 65 decibels during the day. The same place should have an average of up to 55 decibels in the evening. 																								Noise in most parts of Writers was well above 75 decibels.																								But babudom alone does not contribute to the noise inside it. Rooms in the red-brick building with giant widows that overlooked crossroads and were adjacent to the stock exchange recorded nearly 90 decibels. 																								The rat-tat of typewriters and conversations, too, contributed to the din. 																								Noise inside the rooms of some of the senior-most officers, too, was rarely within the permissible limit, according to the first tests. 																								There is a need to get the noise level checked at Writers. We are planning to get it done by the state pollution control board. Only, some official clearances are still to be taken, a senior environment department official said. 																								Around 9,000 people  from Group-D employees to bureaucrats and ministers  work at Writers. To make themselves heard over and above the buzz, people at Writers talk louder than usual, the report had pointed out.																								At this rate, those at work in the Gothic structure are at the risk of suffering from hearing impairment, high blood pressure and increased stress, the officer who conducted the noise-level tests said. 																								His report quoted a study that mentioned people exposed to noise had complained of tiredness, irritability, insomnia and nausea. 																								Does this make Writers much talked about work environment unsound? Only the new study can tell.

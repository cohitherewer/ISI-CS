 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Stress-buster yoga for forest guards
 TAMAL SENGUPTA 																								Calcutta, Aug. 7: The forest department is beginning a six-day Art of Living course to ease the increasing mental and physical stress on its employees due to growing workload. 																								The training course, being financed by the Union forest and environment ministry, will begin at Aranya Bhavan in Salt Lake, the forest departments headquarters, from Monday. It will be held for two hours and include lecturers on meditation and practising yoga. 																								Special chief conservator of forests (personnel management cell) A. Zaidi said Delhi initially wanted to organise the programme only for Indian Forest Service officers. However, we decided to enrol other employees of the department for the training course, he said. 																								Forty officers and staff members have already enrolled for the sessions. 																								Zaidi clarified that the programme will be held after office hours. The normal functioning of the department will not be disturbed, he said.																								The Union ministry will pick up almost the entire tab for the course. The course fee for an individual participant will be Rs 1,500, of which Rs 1,350 will be provided by our counterpart in Delhi. Every participant will have to cough up only Rs 150, Zaidi said.																								Girish Parmar, a faculty member of Bhakti Vikash Kendra, which will conduct the course, said the aim of the course is to help people achieve mental peace through various forms of meditation and yoga. We will teach the forest employees pranayam, sudarshan kriya and other kinds of yoga, he said. 																								Parmar described Bhakti Vikash Kendra as the Indian chapter of the Art of Living Foundation of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, which is engaged in teaching spiritualism. 																								Apart from the stress-control angle, senior forest officials believe the course would help them develop better working relations with other employees. The officers and staff members will attend the sessions together and get to know one another better. 																								The department is bringing in about 2,500 forest guards posted in the core forest areas in phases for the course. The training course is expected to be particularly helpful for the guards who risk their lives to protect forests and wildlife and often worry about their families back home. 																								The forest department recently set up a hostel for the children of forest guards at Alipurduar. 																								You cant imagine how strenuous life is for these forest guards. We are happy that the forest department has been kind enough to build a hostel for their children, said Arun Chakraborty, general secretary of the Forest Employees Union, West Bengal.

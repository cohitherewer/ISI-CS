The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Tusker worth a crore killed
 ANIRBAN CHOUDHURY																								Alipurduar, June 3: Officials at Buxa Tiger Reserve stumbled on an elephant last night whose tusks had been sawed off. It was dead.																								The bull elephant had tusks measuring more than 3 feet, the officials said. That much ivory may sell for as much as Rs 1 crore internationally.																								The incident in compartment 4 of Raimatang beat in the Pana range dealt a blow to the reserves poacher-free image. 																								Officials hurriedly denied that the death was a result of poaching but forest guards said they had seen a wound on the back of the animal that appeared to have been inflicted by a spear or a crude, sharp weapon.																								Poachers are known to lie in wait for the elephants in tang ghar (tree houses). Spears are their weapons of choice.																								Last nights discovery, which sent forest officials scurrying to hush up the episode, does not bode well for the reserve hailed by the forest department as a safe haven for animals. But till late this morning several senior officers were on denial mode.																								Y.T. Aden, the deputy field director of Buxa Tiger Reserve (West), said: This is an unfortunate incident. We are working hard to recover the tusks as soon as possible.																								Forest staff members, however, were more vocal. The department has pumped in World Bank funds worth crores to form committees and provide residents of forest villages an alternative livelihood to wean them away from poaching. But we told the officers that the villagers continue to kill animals. They refused to believe us, a forest employee said.																								His colleague added: Officers refused to face the truth even after local poachers were arrested in March and animal parts seized. That was branded the final haul that made the reserve poacher-free.																								A forest guard said several bands of poachers operate in the tiger reserve.

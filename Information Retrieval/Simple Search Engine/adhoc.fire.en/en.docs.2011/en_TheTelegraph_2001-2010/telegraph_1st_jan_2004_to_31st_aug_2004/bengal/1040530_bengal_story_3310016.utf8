The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 Visitors make off with mobile 
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, May 29: The Bhattacharyas were stirring in their first-floor residence at 160, Linton Street, around 6.10 am when two youths sauntered in past the unlatched door and made off with a cellphone. 																								Sanchita, who had fetched milk 10 minutes earlier and was dozing by her slumbering father and brother, sensed some movement and opened her eyes to see the crooks disappearing with her mobile. She woke up brother Abhijit, who gave chase but could not nab them. 																								The decline in para culture, which encouraged vigilantism, and police laxity have shred the cocoon of safety the residential apartments in central Calcutta enjoyed. 																								Abhijit complained that a policeman posted outside a bank on CIT Road near Ladies Park did not bat an eyelid when the thieves ran past him. 																								When he went to Beniapukur police station to report the incident around 6.15 am, investigating officer S. Chatterjee allegedly asked him to come later. Abhijit added that he was not given a copy of the FIR after the policemen finally registered the complaint. 																								In the evening, when details were sought on the incident, the duty officer could not provide them because the FIR could not be located. 																								A case has been started, but I cannot furnish any details, said sub-inspector A.K. Ghatak. I think someone has taken the FIR, he added sheepishly. 																								Abhijit did not sound too confident about the action police would take. 																								The investigating officer has said he will round up some local miscreants for us to identify, but I dont think the culprits will be caught. There have been five or six such incidents in this building in the last year, but the police never catch the thieves, he said. 																								The family had become cautious after the recent incidents. But Sanchita left the door unlocked after fetching milk as she was expecting her mother, who was out of town, anytime. 																								The Bhattacharyas mourned the decline of para culture more than their loss. Its obvious that the thieves had been intimated by someone who had access to the building, Sanchita said.

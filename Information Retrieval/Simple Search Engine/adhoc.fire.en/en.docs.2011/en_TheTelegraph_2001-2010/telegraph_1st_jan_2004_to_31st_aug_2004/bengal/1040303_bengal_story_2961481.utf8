 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Clerk at TB clinic kicks nurse
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, March 2: The Dhubulia Bidhan Chandra Tuberculosis Hospital at Tehatta faces a strike by its nurses after a pregnant colleague was allegedly assaulted last week by a CPM-affiliated member of the hospitals clerical staff.																								The nurses today gheraoed the superintendent of the hospital, 130 km from Calcutta, in protest against inaction. I was hurt when the clerical staff kicked me. Hospital superintendent Sachin Chatterjee tried to find an amicable solution, which was not acceptable, said Ashima Chowdhury, the alleged victim.																								Hospital sources said Chowdhury went to collect her salary on Saturday, a day later than the other employees. 																								Bimal Palit, a member of the CPM-controlled Coordination Committee, is said to have told her to wait out the month and be punctual the next time. In the ensuing altercation, Palit started thrashing the woman. He even kicked her a few times, said A. Rashidujjaman, the circle inspector of Nakashipara. 																								The nurses alleged that Chatterjee sat on the complaint as he was scared of Palits CPM links. Palit is now absconding.

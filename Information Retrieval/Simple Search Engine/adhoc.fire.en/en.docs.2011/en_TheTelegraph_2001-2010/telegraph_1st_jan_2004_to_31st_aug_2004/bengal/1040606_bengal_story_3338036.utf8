Khaseng directed the accused to furnish a surety bond of Rs 1,000 each and attend the case trials. Lawyer and Trinamul Congress councillor Dibyendu Biswas, who appeared on behalf of Chakraboty and Bose, told the court that his clients would not leave the state if granted bail. 																								Two Trinamul leaders, along with seven men and five women, were caught red-handed in the resort yesterday, allegedly in a compromising position.

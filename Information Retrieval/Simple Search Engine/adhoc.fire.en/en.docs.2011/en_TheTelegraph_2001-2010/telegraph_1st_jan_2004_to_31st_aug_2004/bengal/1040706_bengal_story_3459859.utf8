The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
		 Tuesday, July 06, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Calcutta, July 5: The police headquarters at Lalbazar plunged into darkness tonight.				 																																	A cable fault on Radhabazar Street literally left the police groping in the dark between 9.35 pm and 11. An officer said the telephone network was working and we could receive information but hardly do anything else. Apprehension of an emergency loomed as only a few departments had emergency lights.				 																																	Calcutta: The CBI will interrogate Dilip Kumar Sinha, the former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor arrested nine days ago in connection with a marksheet scam. The CBI will quiz Sinha for clues to Tagores Nobel medal theft.A team led by CBI joint director Vivek Dubey, who arrived here on Monday, is scheduled to question Sinha.				 																																	Burdwan: At least 12 people, including three children, who were administered anti-rabies vaccine on Sunday had to be admitted to Katwa Subdivisional Hospital. They were apparently vaccinated from vials past their expiry date.

 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Chill spell takes its toll 
 OUR BUREAU																								Jan. 4: The state shivered as a cold wind swept across the plains killing at least nine people over the past three days. 																								As minimum temperatures ranged between 5.5 and 10.5 degree Celsius, the districts were put on alert and officials asked to organise speedy distribution of blankets and warm clothes among the poor. 																								Three deaths were reported from Purulia. The town experienced the coldest day of the season with the minimum temperature this morning reading 5.5 degree Celsius. Bankura recorded a minimum of 7.5 degrees.																								With no let up in the north wind, the cold spell is expected to continue for the next 48 hours. 																								At Santiniketan, the mercury dipped to 5.9 degree Celsius, forcing Visva-Bharati to reschedule early-morning classes at Patha Bhavan. The open-air classes that usually start at 6.30 am are now being held from 8. The school, which opened on Friday after winter vacation, will continue till 12.30 pm, instead of the usual 11 am.																								Sujoy Mukherjee, a student of Class II in Patha Bhavan, said trembling in the cold: I left my bed at quarter to six this morning. Our classes started after 8 am. Sujoy was wearing two trousers, two pullovers and a red comforter.																								In Burdwan, three people have died in three days and the mercury dipped to 7 degrees at 5 this morning. An unidentified woman was found dead on the platform of Burdwan station. 																								Teastall owner Dukhyaharan Harijan, 55, died this morning in Andal, 180 km from Calcutta, because of the cold. Police said he went missing last night. Residents found the body on a road this morning. A doctor at a local clinic said he must have collapsed unable to bear the cold. 																								Two people died in Murshidabad. The town wore the look of a bandh day with most people staying indoors.

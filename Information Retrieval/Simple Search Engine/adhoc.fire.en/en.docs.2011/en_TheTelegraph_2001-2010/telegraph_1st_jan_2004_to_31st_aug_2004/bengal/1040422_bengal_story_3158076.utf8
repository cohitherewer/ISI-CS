 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Delivery at clinic doorstep
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Barasat, April 21: A housewife was forced to deliver her child outside a government hospital at Habra after being allegedly turned away by the doctor on duty. 																								Tajmira Biwi, 23, was taken to the clinic around 3.30 am as she complained of labour pain. Her husband said Dr Tapan Sarkar did not check her before asking him to shift her to the Barasat Sadar hospital, 10 km away, saying it is a complicated case. 																								He asked the doctor to keep an eye on her while he arranged for transport. On his return, he found Tajmira lying outside. She delivered before he could carry her to the waiting car. 																								Mother and child were later admitted to a private clinic.

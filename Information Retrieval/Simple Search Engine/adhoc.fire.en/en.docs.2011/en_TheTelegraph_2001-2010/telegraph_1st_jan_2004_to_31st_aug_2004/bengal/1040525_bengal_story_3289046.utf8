 OUR BUREAU																								Behrampore/Calcutta, May 24: Two minor girls who were lured away from their homes with promises of modelling assignments have been rescued by the CID following the intervention of minister for agricultural marketing Chhaya Ghosh.

Priyanka Chatterjee and Mampi Das, both 15 years old, went missing from their homes in Lalbag, Murshidabad, on May 16.

According to Ghosh, Mampi, a resident of Nehalbag, had been promised modelling assignments in Mumbai by some friends in Barrackpore. She told Priyanka about the assignments and asked her to accompany her.																								Mampis father Kartik Das said: Priyanka is the daughter of a police constable, Amarnath Chatterjee, who lives in our neighbourhood.

Priyanka has appeared for her Madhyamik examination this year.																								Four youths have been arrested from Shyamnagar and Barrackpore and three from Lalbag in this connection, the minister said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Govt gropes for sweet-grape formula
 SWATI SENGUPTA 				 	 Sweet or sour? Grapes at a Calcutta fruit stallCalcutta, April 18: No more sour grapes, literally. 																								Bengal does produce the juicy berries but they are mostly sour and the government wants to change that. Its time to reap sweet grapes and rope in industry to promote it, feels the government. 																								Grapes grown here are mostly sour to taste. But that does not mean there is no potential for good grapes here. Officials of a company based in Tamil Nadu recently came to do a survey of soil and weather conditions to grow roses. And they told us that good grapes can be cultivated here with some technical improvement and better seeds, an official of the West Bengal State Food Processing amp; Horticulture Development Corporation said. 																								Grapes grown in areas adjoining Santiniketan with private enterprise are lacking in quality and cannot be used commercially, the official said. Some grapes are grown by individuals in Birbhum, Bankura and West Midnapore. But these, too, are not up to the mark, and are mostly sour. It has been a popular notion that quality grapes cannot be grown in the state, he admitted.																								However, officials of the Tamil Nadu firm suggested after their study that the soil and weather in Santiniketan are suitable for cultivation of a better variety of grapes. 																								We only need improved seeds and some technical supervision, the horticulture official said. Our main purpose in getting involved in the production of grapes is to use it for commercial purposes. Most grapes sold in the state come from Nashik and Pune.																								The horticulture corporation is awaiting a formal suggestion from the Tamil Nadu company. After that, we will talk to private companies based in Pune and Nashik  two centres known to grow very good grapes  and work out the possibility of a tie-up with one who can offer us seeds and technical support, the official said. 																								The southern India company does not have expertise in growing grapes but are experts in hybrid seeds, horticulture, floriculture and soil. They will help us identify companies in Nashik and Pune from whom we can get the required technical help and supervision, the official added. 																								The corporation is mulling a joint venture with the Santiniketan Sriniketan Development Authority to grow an improved variety of grapes in Santiniketan. The authority has a 50-acre plot meant for floriculture. It is possible to use about 10 to 12 acres of this land, the official said.

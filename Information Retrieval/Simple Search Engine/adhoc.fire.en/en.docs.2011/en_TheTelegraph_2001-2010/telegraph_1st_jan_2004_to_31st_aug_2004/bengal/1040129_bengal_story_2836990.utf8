 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Buta keeps hill plot under wraps
 VIVEK CHHETRI																								Darjeeling, Jan. 28: Congress leader Buta Singh today spent an hour with Gorkha National Liberation Front chief Subash Ghisingh spelling out his partys agenda for the general elections even as his district lieutenants rejected an alliance. 																								The district Congress leaders said they would rather forge an alliance with the Peoples Democratic Front, which includes the BJP.																								Singh admitted to having spoken to the GNLF chief but did not divulge details. He (Ghisingh) is an old friend and I told him about the Congress agenda of tying up with like-minded parties across the country. He neither voiced an opinion nor did we ask for one.																								Congress district committee members who later met Singh at the party office, however, made it clear that they do not want an alliance with the GNLF. Dawa Narbula, the president of Congress (Hills), said: The GNLF had supported the CPM in the last few Lok Sabha elections. That is why we do not want to fight with them. The Congress will contest the prestigious Darjeeling seat with support from the five-party PDF. 																								After the formation of the hill council in 1988, the GNLF and the Congress had thrown their weight behind Independent candidate Indrajit Khullar in the 1989 general elections.

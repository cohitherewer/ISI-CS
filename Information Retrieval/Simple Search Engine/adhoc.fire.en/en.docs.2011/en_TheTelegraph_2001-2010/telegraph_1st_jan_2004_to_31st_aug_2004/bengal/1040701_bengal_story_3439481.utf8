 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Trouble trio looms on Dilip
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Santiniketan, June 30: The fake marksheet case has opened a Pandoras Box at Visva-Bharati University with at least three instances emerging of under-qualified candidates being patronised during the tenure of arrested former vice-chancellor Dilip Sinha. 																								Investigations by the varsity authorities and the CID show that a reader in the humanities section was appointed without a doctoral degree  a must according to university rules. 																								There were two more eligible candidates  one with a PhD degree and another who was doing his PhD  but an interview committee led by Sinha recruited the most unsuitable candidate. 																								He was appointed in February 2001 on condition that he would be on probation for one year, which may be extended by another year. He was also asked to complete his PhD degree within one year from the date of appointment. 																								He is continuing though he has been showcaused for not completing his PhD till date. 																								He has said in his reply that he has submitted his thesis and the university may grant him the time to complete his PhD. But the administration will probe the procedure adopted by the then interview committee at the time of recruitment to the post, an official said. 																								Another teacher was promoted as professor during Sinhas tenure violating recruitment rules. In order to be promoted to the post of professor, a candidate has to work as guide for at least eight to 10 researches. The teacher did not have this experience nor were his research works published in any journal of international repute, another requirement. 																								In another case, a full-time faculty member was allowed to pursue his post-graduate course as a regular student. He was supposed to have a post-graduate degree at the time of applying for the job. 																								We are probing how the candidate managed to get the job without the post-graduate degree. We also wonder how a full-time teacher was allowed to study as a regular student, said the official.

 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Sleuths chase Sumo driver
 OUR BUREAU																								March 30: As the CBI registered a case in the Tagore memorabilia heist, the CID pinned hopes on the helper of a Tata Sumo picked up today and a casual employee of Visva-Bharati.																								The CBI, called in by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Sunday, registered the case ahead of its 20-member team leaving for Santiniketan in groups tomorrow and the day after.																								The team led by the bureaus joint director will include forensic experts and officials from the CBIs Calcutta office. They will be formally briefed by the CID officials investigating the case.																								We have been told that officials associated with the case must be present when the CBI team starts investigation at Santiniketan. The Birbhum SP (superintendent of police) has been informed accordingly, inspector-general of police (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said.																								The Sumo helper, whose name was not revealed, was caught in a pre-dawn swoop on Calcuttas northern fringes. We raided his hideout near Kamarhati Hospital and picked him up. During interrogation, he confirmed that the vehicle was taken near Bolpur last week, said a police officer. 																								We have got the name of the Sumo driver. A massive hunt is on to track him down, he added.																								The news of the vehicle came out during the interrogation of Chandan Das, the Baranagar-based antique dealer now under a cloud. If you can find out the vehicle, some vital leads may emerge, Das told the sleuths. 																								The CID is also pinning hopes on Pradip Bauri, the Visva-Bharati casual employee who is a former CPM gram panchayat member from Ruppur in Bolpur. The local CPM leadership today said he is no longer with the party.																								According to the officer-in-charge of the police station that picked up Bauri, he had extensive knowledge of the memorial museum. We picked up Bauri yesterday after a few jail inmates (burglars) in Murshidabad revealed that he had once said he would rob the museum, the officer said.																								Bauri became the focus after the leads provided by Sunil Bagdi, the burglar picked up from Durgapur, failed to yield results in raids conducted yesterday.

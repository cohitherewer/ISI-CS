The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 Ten Sports stays off air
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 5: Cable turmoil continues to haunt the city. 																								Ten Sports, the channel beaming the French Open tennis tournament and the South American football World Cup qualifiers, was taken off the network of multi-system operator Manthan on Friday evening, affecting around 2.5 lakh households across the city, including Behala, Salt Lake, Baguiati, Golf Green and Ballygunge.																								A spokesperson for Modi Entertainment Network, which distributes the channel in India, attributed the sudden switch off to an outstanding bill of Rs 8.5 lakh that Manthan owes it. 																								Payments from Manthan have been irregular for some time, said Asish Ghosh of MEN. According to our calculations, they owe us around Rs 8.5 lakh as subscription charges and unless they make the payment, we cannot switch on the channel.																								Manthan officials, however, refuted the claim. We have to pay them only Rs 62,000, which is normal in our line of business where we have to collect the amount from our operators, said Sudip Ghosh, the director of Manthan. Since Thursday, we have been asking for a break-up of the outstanding amount but Ten Sports has not come up with any figure as yet, he said.																								MEN also complained that Manthan had been tapping its signal eversince the blackout. We have received such reports from several areas, particularly in Behala, and warned Manthan that if the practice is not stopped, we will approach the police, he added. 																								Ghosh, however, denied the charges. It seems their intention is to destroy our goodwill, he said. 																								The other cable conflict carries on without a solution. Over 60,000 households under SitiCable have not had access to the STAR and Sony bouquets for around two weeks, following dispute over a subscriber listing report.

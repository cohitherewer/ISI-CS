 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Medical reps face curfew
 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 																								Durgapur, June 3: Devika Gorai went to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital from a remote village. She had to wait for about an hour for her turn at the outpatients department. Then she had to keep waiting outside a gynaecologists cabin because a medical representative was in. 																								Diptiman Biswas, a businessman running high temperature and waiting for a general physician, was prevented by another medical representative from entering the chamber. When my turn came after a long wait, I was stopped. The medical representative requested me to allow him for two minutes. He came out half-an-hour later. I sat the while shivering, said Biswas. 																								This is a regular ordeal for patients at the outdoor. But things have come to such a pass that hospital superintendent Debashish Bhattacharjee has decided to ban entry of medical representatives in the hospital before 1 pm. By that time, the rush of patients wears thin.																								We have decided not to allow medical representatives into the hospital premises before 1 pm. We were forced to take the decision, Bhattacharjee said. The bar will be announced soon.																								Director of medical education C.R. Maity said in Calcutta the trend of medical representatives meeting doctors in hospitals during hours reserved for patients is disturbing. 																								I recently met the medical representatives body in Burdwan and asked the members not to meet doctors when they are busy with patients. They should meet the doctors when they are free. If they dont pay heed to our request, we will have to think about tougher norms, he said.																								Bhattacharjee said hospital security guards will be asked to keep a watch on whether doctors are being disturbed by medical representatives when there is a rush of patients. If a doctor is found chatting with medical representatives during the morning rush hour, action may be taken against him, he added.																								Secretary of the district consumer welfare association K. Abedin said: We had drawn the attention of the hospital authorities to the problem. Some doctors hobnob with the medical representatives to bag expensive gifts and commission for prescribing certain brands of drugs. 																								The medical representatives union welcomed the bar. We will abide by it, said its president Achin Ghosh.

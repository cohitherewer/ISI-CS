 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Nabadwip, Aug. 23: A Trinamul Congress supporter draped himself in the party flag and hanged himself from the ceiling fan of the local party office last night at Phansitola in Nadia district.																								Swapan Acharya was apparently peeved with the partys style of functioning, especially since the Lok Sabha polls.																								Pankaj Banerjee, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly, expressed shock over the death of the 40-year-old rickshaw-puller. We will send a team of party workers to Nabadwip shortly to inquire into Swapans death, he said in Calcutta.																								Superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty said Acharya had locked the office from outside around 8 pm yesterday and enter the one-room office through the rear door.																								He took off his trousers and tied a party flag around his waist and draped a blue-and-white banner around himself like a shawl. He made a noose with nylon rope used to hoist the national flag on Independence Day and hanged himself, he said.

				 																																	 Midnapore, April 14: A country liquor vendor today slashed the penis of a 45-year-old man when he refused to pay for the hooch he had guzzled through the night at Dirghagram in Ghatal. 				 																																	Surgeons at Ghatal sub-divisional hospital decided to operate immediately when the profusely bleeding Balai Mondal was taken there. His condition is stable. Hospital sources said Balai had gone to attend a village fair on the occasion of Nava Varsha and drank at the hooch shop through the night. In the morning, when Balai wanted to leave, the owner demanded money and the fracas followed. 				 																																	 Nadia: Abhishek Chakraborty and Prasun Raut, both around 15 years old, drowned when they went to take a dip in the Ganga at Mangaldeep Ghat in the Ranaghat police station area in the evening. Fishermen rescued three other boys. 				 																																	 Calcutta: One person died and about 250 residents of south Dum Dum fell ill after drinking contaminated water supplied by the municipality through its pipelines. Chief medical officer of health Shankar Saha said the contamination could be because sewage had seeped into the water supply. People have been advised not to drink water from the pipelines. 				 																																	 Purulia: A 15-year-old Chhou dancer was killed and 15 others of the Royal Chhou Academy of Balarampur were injured last night when the vehicle in which they were travelling to Neturia lost control after a tyre burst.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Wanted, teachers with tact to control 
 TAMAL SENGUPTA 																								Calcutta, Feb. 12: Candidates for teachers posts in government and government-sponsored schools will have to undergo a personality test.																								Realising the need for a new generation of teachers capable of controlling a class, the school education department has made the test mandatory for every candidate qualifying in the School Service Commission-conducted entrance test.																								Ten marks out of 100 will be allotted to this test. Officials say this may become an important criterion in determining who makes the cut for often just half a percentage point separates a successful candidate from an unsuccessful one.																								Those applying for the post of headmaster would have to score at least four in this section. There is no pass-mark for the rest.																								Quite often in the past, the department has recruited persons who  despite high scores in the written test  have found it difficult to control a class, a senior school education department official said. We want to make sure that this is not repeated in the future, he added, explaining the decision to make the personality test mandatory.																								The change will be introduced in the very next recruitment drive, said school education minister Kanti Biswas. We want more serious and sincere teachers and will try to be careful in recruiting headmasters as they are the most important any school, he added.																								We have broadly decided on what to ask in the test, School Service Commission chairman Arun Kiran Chakraborty said. Knowing environment and the society and the ability to teach and communicate with students, guardians and colleagues will be important, he added.																								Would-be headmasters need not answer questions on their ability to teach. They must have taken classes for years and it is understood that they can teach. 																								The to-be heads would instead be tested on school management and administrative abilities. Teachers work culture and students discipline depends on a headmaster, Chakraborty said.

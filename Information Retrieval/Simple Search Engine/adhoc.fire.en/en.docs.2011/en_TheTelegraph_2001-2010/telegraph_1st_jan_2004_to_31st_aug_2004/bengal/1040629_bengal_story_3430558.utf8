The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Dagger in the chest for protest against teasing women
 OUR CORRESPONDENTRaiganj, June 28: Pulak Kar, 30, paid with his life trying to uphold the dignity of women in his neighbourhood last evening.																								He rushed out of his house hearing a commotion to find a drunk Puspajit Roy, notorious in Collegepara, about 450 km from Calcutta, making lewd gestures and mouthing obscenities at some women. When Pulak intervened to strike sense into him, Puspajit lunged at him with a dagger. The employee of a medicine supplier died almost immediately.																								Residents caught hold of Puspajit, 24, and thrashed him before handing him to police. 																								Puspajit suddenly appeared in front of our house and began shouting obscenities at my sisters. When I came out and protested, he slapped me. I rushed indoor, said Bhaskar Kar, Pulaks cousin and next-door neighbour.																								Bhaskar said his uncle and Pulak came out of their house hearing the melee. Puspajits uncle, Arun Roy, came out as well. Pulak was pleading with Puspajit to leave the women alone when he stabbed him in the chest. It was so sudden, none of us moved, said Bhaskar. 																								Arun fled the scene before others in the area arrived and began beating up Puspajit. 																								Shocked residents of the area are now demanding just retribution. They gheraoed the Roys house and locked it from outside. 																								Police personnel have been deployed in the area to prevent the situation from going out of hand. Puspajit is in hospital and his brother, Tapas, has been arrested. 																								We have moved Puspajits eldest brother and his wife to a safe location, said inspector-in-charge of Raiganj police station Mohan Chhetri. Angry residents demanded punishment for the entire family. 																								Pulaks mother Rani Kar was drifting in and out of consciousness. His father, Jatin, in his eighties and respected for being a freedom fighter, had not been told of his death.																								Pulaks niece Soma Dutta was witness to the murder. She said: Every evening, Puspajit would arrive drunk and abuse women in the neighbourhood.

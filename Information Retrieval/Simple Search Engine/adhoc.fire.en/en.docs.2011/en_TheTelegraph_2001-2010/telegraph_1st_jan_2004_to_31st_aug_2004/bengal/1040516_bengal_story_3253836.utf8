 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Couple commits suicide
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, May 15: Their families did not approve of their relationship. So suicide seemed to be their last recourse. 																								The bodies of Mili Khatun, 17, and Ismail Sheikh, 21, were discovered by the officer on duty inside the protected Bethuadahari forest late on Thursday evening, hours after they had consumed pesticide. 																								Khatun and Sheikh had earlier left their homes unnoticed as their families watched the election results unfold on television. 																								Sources said the two entered the forest around 4 pm. There were hardly any visitors. At 5 pm, the officer on duty spotted the bodies lying near a park. Two empty bottles of pesticide and a photograph of the duo signed by them were found close by, said district police superintendent Pankaj Dutta.																								Khatun and Sheikh, both from poor families, resided at Debagram in Kaligunj police station area, about 130 km from Calcutta. Mili studied in Class VII and Ismail in Class XI. The couple was involved in a five-year-long relationship, which was not acceptable to their families, Dutta said.

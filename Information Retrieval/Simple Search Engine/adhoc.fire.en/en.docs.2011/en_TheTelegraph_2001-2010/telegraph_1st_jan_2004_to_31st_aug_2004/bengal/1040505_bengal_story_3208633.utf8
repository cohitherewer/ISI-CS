The high court had said a final affidavit stating the state governments stand must be submitted. The state government filed an affidavit stating that the judiciary has no jurisdiction to hear the matter as it relates to the elections and so it must be referred to the Election Commission. The division bench referred the matter to Nirvachan Sadan for disposal. The poll panel has also directed that the states chief secretary must see to the matter.

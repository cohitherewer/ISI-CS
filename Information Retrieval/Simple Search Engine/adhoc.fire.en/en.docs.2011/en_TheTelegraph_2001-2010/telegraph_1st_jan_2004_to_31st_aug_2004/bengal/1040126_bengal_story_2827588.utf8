 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 Murder blot on civic body 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Jan. 25: Five employees of the municipality here were arrested last night on charges of murder following the subdivisional courts order of a fresh probe into the death of a Democratic Youth Federation of India activist in 2001.																								Those held for the murder of the CPM youth wing worker were said to be Congress supporters. The Behrampore municipality is under Congress control. 																								 Police said Jhantu Das, 29, was murdered by the five accused on October 8, 2001. His mutilated body was washed ashore by the Bhagirathi river. But the police submitted in court that it was unable to make a breakthrough. 																								Jhantus widow Sima filed a petition in subdivisional judicial magistrate Fatema Iasmins court last month praying for a fresh probe and justice.																								We shall take action against Pranab Dutta, the subinspector of Behrampore police station, and a few others for not being able to arrest any of the culprits involved in Jhantus murder. Dutta and his team arrested two innocent people in connection with the case, said Murshidabad superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh.																								He accused the policemen of shielding the guilty. I must know why the accused were not rounded up, Singh added.																								But Congress activists were angry with the arrests. They called a bandh in the town on Wednesday to expose police atrocities and threatened to suspend work in the municipality. If the administration does not stop being high-handed, we will go for a bigger movement, said MP Adhir Chowdhury. He added that the party will boycott Republic Day programmes in the district. 																								Congress leader Nil Ratan Auddya said: Two of those arrested are permanent employees of the civic body. The rest casual workers. The police have framed them in collusion with the CPM.

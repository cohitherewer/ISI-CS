 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Salim Group in Nadia recce
 OUR CORRESPONDENTHaringhata, July 8: A day after the government formalised an agreement for a satellite township in Howrah with an arm of the Salim Group, its executive director Beni Santoso was in Nadia to look up a proposed site for a motorcycle plant and a loss-making dairy that he may help revive.																								The head of the Indonesian conglomerate inspected the 4,000-acre Haringhata unit for over two hours and said he was interested in reviving the dairy farm, now saddled with poor infrastructure and growing non-performing assets. Setting aside obstacles like unutilised infrastructure and man power, we want to make the dairy a modern unit of international standards, he said.																								Santoso suggested a joint venture with the government to breathe new life into the dairy whose products, he said, are still in demand. 																								About 1,100 employees work in the dairy, which produces about 5,000 litres of milk every day. Ten years ago, it produced about 50,000 litres a day. 																								Production has suffered badly in the last few years because of various reasons, including shortage of funds. The government accepted Salim Groups investment proposal against this backdrop, said .C. Majumder, a special secretary in the animal resources development department who accompanied Santoso. The two-wheeler unit is likely to come up at Kalyani.

 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Job racket slur on CPI leader
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Jan. 9: The Murshidabad secretary of the CPI was removed from his position yesterday after being accused of taking money from youths promising jobs in the water resource development department. 																								CPI leader and MLA from Dantan in Midnapore Nandagopal Bhattacharya is the water resource minister. Alarmed at reports of Mondals involvement in the job racket, he went to Murshidabad with party secretary Manju Kumar Majumdar on Tuesday to conduct an inquiry. 																								The CPIs district council met yesterday in the presence of Majumdar to ratify Mondals expulsion. Haradhan Das replaced him. 																								Majumdar said Mondal was removed on health grounds but the partys secretariat member, Satya Bhattacharya, admitted here this afternoon that he was charged with accepting money after promising jobs. We had to remove Mondal following specific charges of collecting funds from local youths promising them jobs. We have asked the district leadership to probe the allegations and submit a report at the earliest, he said. 																								Bhattacharya also admitted that the development has tarnished the partys image.																								District superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh said: We may arrest Mondal.																								 Syed Wahed Reja, a former CPI minister from Kandi in Murshidabad, was also removed from the party following the same charges as against Mondal.

 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Education woes of starving twins
 OUR CORRESPONDENTAmlashol, June 14: For children of villages that go to sleep hungry, going to school early in the morning is a luxury.																								In 136 families in the villages of Amlashol and Amjharna, at least 160 children are eligible to go to the local primary school. But only 42 children attend classes, said headmaster Tapan Sing.																								What will my child do in school when there is nothing to eat at home? Parbati Sabar said when asked why he does not send his daughter to school.																								About 260 km from Calcutta, the governments lack of planning and effort to develop a backward forest area is apparent.																								Sarojini Muras son Pintu, 10, and daughter Madhuri, 11, cleared Class IV but stopped going to school because the nearest junior high school was 10 km away at Odalchua. The high school was at Belpahari, 28 km away.																								How can children travel so far. There is no public transport. We wish there was a high school nearby, said Sarojini.																								Tamal Das has sent his son Dipu to a school at Ghatiduba in Jharkhand, 6 km from home. The Class VI student cycles to and from the institution. Das said: The problem is my son has to study all the subjects in Hindi.																								Fifteen children, six of them girls, attend schools in Jharkhand from the two villages. The girls invariably drop out on reaching Class VII because their parents feel it is unsafe to walk or cycle to school through vast stretches covered with dense forest. 																								The central scheme to spread education beginning from children below five years and dropouts  the Sarvasiksha Abhiyan  has turned out a virtual farce. 																								In Belpahari block, 135 child education centres (Sishu Siksha Kendras) failed to draw a single dropout.																								Das said the centre at Amlashol folded up early this year and children below five years can no longer attend any school.																								When told that the Amlashol centre had stopped functioning, an agitated block development officer, Subhasis Bej, said: Where do you get these information from? The teachers are in touch with us and getting their requirements but you are saying the school is not running.																								However, the zilla parishad functionary looking after education, Tarashankar Biswas, admitted that there were problems. The biggest problem is to get qualified teachers to run the centres. According to rules, the teachers should be recruited from the locality, he said.

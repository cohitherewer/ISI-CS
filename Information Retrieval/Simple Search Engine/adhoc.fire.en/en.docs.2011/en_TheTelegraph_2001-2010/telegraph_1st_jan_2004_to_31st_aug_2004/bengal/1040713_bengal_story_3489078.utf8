The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Would-be teachers submit fake certificates
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								Calcutta, July 12: The School Service Commission (SSC) has rejected the applications of 390 aspiring work education teachers who submitted diploma certificates in tailoring from an unrecognised institution.																								The candidates, who got the diploma from Bengal Tailoring College on Bidhan Sarani have been barred from appearing in the written test scheduled for July 18. 																								The aspirants for teacher jobs in government and government-aided schools were from Purulia, Bankura, Midnapore and North Dinajpur. They claimed that the tailoring college was recognised by the governments industry directorate. 																								The commission, suspicious about the certificates submitted by the candidates, had urged director of industry Malay Kumar De to investigate. De said the industry directorate is not the competent authority on behalf of the state government to recognise and authorise any institute to issue diplomas to its students and, hence, the question of granting recognition or authorisation does not arise at all.																								The commission requested for the probe apprehending that hundreds of candidates could have earlier been recruited on the basis of certificates issued by the college.																								We became suspicious as some of the certificates described Bengal Tailoring College as an institute recognised by the directorate of industry while some said it was recognised by the directorate of cottage and small-scale industry, an official said.

 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Bullet burst survivor recounts death in arms
 MAIN UDDIN CHISTI Beltapara (Cooch Behar), Jan.  15: Last evening, as a group of villagers huddled together  in a bamboo shack to see Ora Bhoyonkor, a Bangladeshi  film, terror struck in the form of bullets that killed four.																								Luck saved Sudeb Haldar, the only one in the group who escaped unhurt. The 29-year-old had stepped out for a cup of tea and was at a stall when he heard a loud bang. At first, he thought the battery-powered video player had exploded. 																								I had left the room 30 minutes into the show. While drinking tea I heard that loud noise. When I rushed back the room was dark and the people were screaming, said Sudeb. Moving closer, he saw 17-year-old Gautam Sarkar writhing in a pool of blood.																								I just picked him up and ran to a quack nearby. I knew he was injured in the arm by a bullet. He was bleeding in several places and died in my arms, he said. 																								When Sudeb returned to the hall he saw Gour Mondol, Ajoy Biswas and Rabi Biswas lying in blood. All of them eventually died of their injuries.																								Gautams father Sunil Sarkar, a former CPM panchayat member, said last afternoon his son had said that he was leaving for Beltapara market and would be home to savour the goodies prepared by his grandmother on Makar Sankranti. 																								Twelve hours after the assailants opened fire in this village near Mathabhanga, the police are clueless about the identity of the attackers. Eight persons have been rounded up for interrogation but the police are yet to make any breakthrough.																								We have recovered six empty AK-47 cartridges and a live round from the shack. We think this is the handiwork of KLO militants, superintendent of police S.S. Panda said.

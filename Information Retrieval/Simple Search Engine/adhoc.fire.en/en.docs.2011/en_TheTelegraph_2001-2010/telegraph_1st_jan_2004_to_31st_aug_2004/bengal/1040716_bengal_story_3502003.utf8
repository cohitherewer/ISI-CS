The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Assault slur on Metro officials 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 15: A Time photographer and his wife today accused Metro Rail staff and some outsiders of assaulting them. 																								Dev Nayak, 33, and his wife Melissa, 28, lodged a general diary with New Market police station, saying they were abused and assaulted at the Esplanade station south-gate. 																								Around 1.30 pm, the couple saw some men, who later claimed to be Metro employees, heckling two girls for taking photographs on the platform. They were asking the girls to hand over the camera, said Dev. 																								We tried to mediate and asked if the girls could expose the film. The girls did so but the personnel wanted to take away the camera. We told them a procedure must be followed... and their anger turned on us. 																								The group of three to four started abusing them as the girls left. When the Nayaks crossed the turnstile, they surrounded them and slapped Dev. 																								When the couple tried to lodge a complaint with a Metro official, they were told that the culprits were outsiders.

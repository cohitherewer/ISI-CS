The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Escorts for voters on rebel terrain
 AMIT UKIL																								Purulia, April 27: The district administration here is ready to provide escorts for those willing to vote but unable to leave their homes after threats from suspected Naxalites.																								Pronouncing the promise of protection in the presence of central observers, district magistrate B.P. Gopalika said elaborate security arrangements are being made so that escorts are not necessary.																								Of the 1,799 polling stations in the district, 82 have been declared supersensitive. They include several booths in Bandwan block, where residents of many villages are unsure if they should vote following an upsurge in Naxalite activity since October.																								Fear is rife after leaflets signed by alleged Peoples War members telling villagers not to vote were found in a few villages.																								A government official in Baghmundi and a political leader in Manbazar II block have also been threatened, though it is unclear if extremists are behind this.																								Maoist Communist Centre activists are more active in Jharkhand, but have made their presence felt in Jhalda block here. However, they have not issued any election boycott call.																								Gopalika, central observers and V.K. Goyal, superintendent of police, met the 11 candidates for the Purulia Lok Sabha seat as well as their representatives and agents. Preparations for polling, wall writing, election expenditure and other related issues were discussed, the district magistrate said.																								Candidates and party supporters wanting to campaign in trouble-prone areas could do so after informing the police station concerned, Goyal said. Security will be provided to them if they ask for it, he added.																								Asked what would happen if, as in West Midnapore, polling officials refuse to work in trouble-prone areas, Gopalika said they would face suspension, even arrest, if they refuse to accept the appointment letter, do not report for training or fail to show up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Court hurdle to doctor law
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, May 23: The governments plan to implement the controversial Clinical Establishment Act received a jolt after Calcutta High Court admitted a petition filed by the Calcutta branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) challenging it. 																								The IMA said the court has permitted all interested persons to become parties to the case. Several individual doctors and associations, who were separately building a consensus against the law, have now decided to join hands with the IMA. 																								The IMA wants the CE Rules, which were converted after necessary amendments into an Act in January 2002, to be scrapped. 																								Once all the opinion sought by the court comes in, the hearing of the case will resume and we are ready with our suggestions. As of now, the hearing is scheduled to start in the first week of July, said Arabinda Ghosh, counsel for IMA. 																								The Calcutta and Bengal chapters of the IMA have objected to several rules that the government seeks to enforce. Some of them are:  Double registration of doctors. The IMA argues doctors register once with the Medical Council of India and, therefore, there is no need to apply for a second registration with the state health department No doctor will be allowed to practise from pharmacies. The IMA argues that most people cannot afford to consult doctors in private chambers  Revamping doctors chambers by building toilets and waiting rooms Revamping nursing homes and operation theatres Hefty trade licence fee hike for nursing homes 																								Under pressure from the doctors lobbies, the government has invited the state chapter of the IMA, known to take a pro-government stance, to suggest subtle changes in the law. 																								We have drafted the letter and we were planning to meet them soon, but obviously with a court case on everything will take a new turn, said state IMA secretary Moloy Patra.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, March 7: A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhurys estranged brother has again decided to fight the Lok Sabha polls from Malda, convinced he would be able to make a significant dent in the stalwarts support base. 																								I had contested the 1999 general elections against my brother (a Congress MP) as an Independent and secured over 10,000 votes without even campaigning. I will go back to Malda as soon as I make up my mind on whether I will contest as an Independent or on a party ticket, Abu Naser Khan Chowdhury said on phone from Delhi today. 																								The brothers fell out in 1994 when Ghani Khan allegedly hired goons to beat up Abu Naser and his wife Estera and drove them out of the ancestral house. Both brothers had filed complaints in Englishbazar police station. Abu Naser was arrested.																								I have not yet decided whether to join a party or go it alone. I will come to Malda and decide after consultations with my associates there, Abu Naser said.																								His decision to give his more famous brother a run for his money comes a day after Ghani Khan became entangled in a new controversy. Abu Hasem, another of the Malda MPs brothers and the Congress legislator from Kaliachak, allegedly threatened a reporter over phone. The reporter, belonging to a Calcutta-based vernacular daily, has filed a written complaint against Abu Hasem.																								Over the past few days, controversies have been chasing Ghani Khan. On Thursday, the general manager of the United Bank of India had claimed that Ghani Khan had taken a farm loan of Rs 1.4 lakh in 1984 and was yet to return it. 																								This was followed by the subdivisional judicial magistrate issuing summons to the Congress patriarch in the property case filed against him by Abu Naser. 																								Ghani Khans sister and Malda Congress president Ruby Noor had called a news conference here yesterday and asserted her brother had nothing to do with the controversy over the loan. 																								The loan was taken by one of Ghani Khans employees in the name of my brother. The person has since died. The bank had not informed us about the loan. We are in touch with the bank, Ruby Noor said.

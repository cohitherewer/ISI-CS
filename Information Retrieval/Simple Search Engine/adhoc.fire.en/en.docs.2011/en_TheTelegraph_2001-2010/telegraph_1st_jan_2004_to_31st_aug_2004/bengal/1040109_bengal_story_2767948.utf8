 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Driver stoned
																								Behrampore, Jan. 8: The driver of a Calcutta State Transport Corporation bus, Dulal Mondal, was killed by a mob here this morning. 																								Though Mondal managed to save a nine-year-old girl who ran in front of the speeding vehicle on National Highway 34, about 210 km from Calcutta, the mob was angry because she was injured and had to be hospitalised. The bus was on its way to Calcutta from Khejuria in Malda.

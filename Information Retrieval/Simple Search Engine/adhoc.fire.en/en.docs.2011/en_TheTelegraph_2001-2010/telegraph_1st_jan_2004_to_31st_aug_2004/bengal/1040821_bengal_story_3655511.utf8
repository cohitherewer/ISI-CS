 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Sudip in Congress, officially
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 20: Expelled Trinamul Congress leader Sudip Bandopadhyay formally rejoined the Congress today.																								He had left the party seven years ago to set up Trinamul with Mamata Banerjee and described the return to his parent party as a homecoming.																								At Mahajati Sadan this morning, Bandopadhyay brought supporters who followed him to the Congress. In a show of support for the former rebel, the party high command sent Union non-resident affairs minister Jagdish Tytler and AICC secretary Ram Chandra Khuntia to the programme.																								A former Trinamul MP from Calcutta Northwest, Bandopadhyay fell out with Mamata last year following his attempts to bag a berth in Atal Bihari Vajpayees cabinet without her approval.

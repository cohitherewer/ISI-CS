 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Court snubs sobbing bahu
 OUR LEGAL REPORTERCalcutta, June 17: Ranu Banerjee, an 81-year-old mother-in-law whose allegations of harassment at the hands of a daughter-in-law fell on the deaf ears of police, found relief in the high court.																								From being bitter to pressuring her to split their house, the woman from Panchanantala in Behala had a list of complaints against Dalia.																								After several knocks on the police door and no response, she was impelled to move court, where Justice P.C. Ghosh asked the saas-bahu to appear.																								When the judge asked Dalia if the allegations were true, she started sobbing. He asked her to stop, but she would not. 																								Startled she was but still sobbing when Justice Ghosh asked her to stop this drama. He said: We understand every thing. It is clear to me who is responsible for the trouble in the family. I dont think the police can restore normality in family. The members of the family will have to take care for it.																								Dalia, who was married to the younger of the two sons in the family, Subrata, in 1985, was reminded that she could be a mother-in-law some day and in Banerjees place. 																								As the judge ticked off her daughter-in-law, Banerjee stood quiet. Her husband had built a single-storey house and Subhash, the first son, added a floor to it. With wife Purabi and a son, Subhash stayed upstairs.																								After marriage, Subrata and Dalia stayed in a portion of the ground floor. 																								Banerjee added: Since marriage, Dalia had maintained a bitter relationship with other family members. After her husbands death in 1996, Dalia piled pressure on Banerjee to apportion the building and claimed the first floor as hers. 																								As I refused to do so (divide the house), she increased her torture. One of her bothers threatened me with dire consequences, the 81-year-old said.																								But the judges snub seemed to have worked. The saas-bahu left court together. As they turned their backs, the judge said: Go and stay peacefully.In another case, a division bench comprising Justices N.A. Choudhury and A.K. Bhattacharjya rejected the anticipatory bail prayer of Joyeshree Das, a housewife, who was apprehending arrest in connection with a case of torture filed by her mother-in law, Srishti Das.

 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 CPM seeks hill boss help 
																								Darjeeling, April 19: Amid speculation on whether Subash Ghisingh would field a candidate from Darjeeling, the CPM today appealed to the Gorkha National Liberation Front chairman to support its nominee. 																								The GNLF boycotted the last three Lok Sabha elections and asked the hill people not to vote, indirectly paving the way for the CPMs victory. Ghisingh is expected to announce his partys stand in the next few days. 																								Detractors have often accused Ghisingh of having a tacit understanding with the CPM. Denying the allegations, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya told a rally: There has been no understanding, but today, we openly appeal to Subash Ghisingh to support us.

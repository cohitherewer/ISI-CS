The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Fuel price hike draws CM flak
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 1: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today criticised the Centre for increasing the price of petrol and diesel twice in the past two weeks.																								This is very unfair and we must oppose it, Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings.																								The Centre yesterday increased the price of petrol and diesel by about Re 1 a litre. In Calcutta, petrol will cost Rs 36.61 a litre, a rise of Rs 1.04. Diesel will cost Rs 23.99 a litre, an increase of Rs 1.05.																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said he would write to petroleum minister Ram Naik soon. I have received a number of calls from different transport operators during the day. All of them told me they would find it difficult to run their vehicles following the hike in the price of diesel.																								Asked if the government would consider any proposal to increase fares of private buses, mini buses and taxis, he said he would take up the matter with transport operators before taking any decision.																								Public transport operators, however, said they were not interested in increasing fares. We want withdrawal of various additional taxes imposed recently by the state government, said Bimal Guha, general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association.																								Guha said the association would write to the state government on Monday, urging it to withdraw the additional taxes. Increasing fares almost regularly will not solve our problem. On the contrary, it will go against the transport operators, as commuters will have to pay additional charge, he added.																								The Calcutta Taxi Association submitted a memorandum to the transport minister demanding a revision of taxi fares. Subhash Kaushik, secretary of the association, said the government should stop issuing fresh taxi permits.																								The secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate, Sadhan Das, said the syndicate would hold a meeting tomorrow to take stock of the situation. Let us discuss the impending problems among ourselves and then we will meet the transport minister, Das said.

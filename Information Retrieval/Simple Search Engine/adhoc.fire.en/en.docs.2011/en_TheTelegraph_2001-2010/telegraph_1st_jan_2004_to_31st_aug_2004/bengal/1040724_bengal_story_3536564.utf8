The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 After food, football to keep kids in school
 ALAMGIR HUSSAIN  Way to go: Girls play with a Fifa ball. A Telegraph picture 																								Behrampore, July 23: If textbooks do not draw children to school, football will.																								The governing body of world soccer, Federation International de Football Association (Fifa), and the Unicef recently distributed football kits to 32 primary schools in Murshidabads Farakka, 290 km from Calcutta, in a bid to make schools more attractive for children.																								The move, district education officials agree, could ensure better attendance at the primary level. Out of 26 lakh children in the state who get admitted to Class I each year, about 12 lakh drop out by the end of the session. By Class V, the number goes up to about 18-19 lakh, said an official.																								Most dropouts, officials said, are made to work to support their families. The government has introduced mid-day meals in primary schools to woo students. Now, football will boost the attendance, an official said.																								It was soccer carnival at Farakkas NTPC Primary School on Monday as 32 boxes, each with 10 balls, four corner flags, a whistle, 20 jerseys and a football pump, were distributed among schools. Two matches, one among boys and the other among girls, were held on the occasion.																								In a world where far too many children suffer from poverty, football can help rescue the part of childhood that includes the right to play. Fifa has stepped in for the cause of children because football is more than just a game, said Rajiva Sinha, a Unicef education officer. 																								District officials said 32 schools were selected to receive the kits because they had playgrounds near them. The balls will be shared by 90 primary institutions, said Fakrul Islam, the Murshidabad inspector of primary schools and the project director of Sarva Siksha Prasar Samiti.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, June 30: Hours after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee directed Murshidabad police to take steps against a spurt in criminal activities, five armed Congress workers were arrested near Sealmara railway gate last night. 																								Two persons carrying nine revolvers were arrested near the town bus terminus in February following another chief ministerial visit. 																								The five Congress activists were taken into custody along with the driver of the Maruti van they were travelling in. Seven country-made revolvers and seven rounds of ammunition were recovered from them. 																								Behrampore police station in-charge Swapan Kumar Roy said: Haider Ali, who was leading the gang, is a Congress worker and known anti-social. He is also regarded as a confidant of local MP Adhir Chowdhury and happens to be the caretaker of the Gorabazar Town Club, of which Chowdhury is the chief patron, Roy said. 																								The powerful MP admitted Ali is a Congress worker. If Ali and others were really arrested for possessing firearms, then law will take its own course. However, I would have been happy if the district police played a neutral role and also arrested the CPM-backed anti-socials, he said. 																								The miscreants bought seven revolvers from Alam Sheikh, a resident of Gorabazar, for Rs 5,500. We raided Alams house as well as the club he was running, but could not find him, Roy said. 																								The accused were remanded in seven days police custody after they were produced in the Behrampore sub-divisional court today.

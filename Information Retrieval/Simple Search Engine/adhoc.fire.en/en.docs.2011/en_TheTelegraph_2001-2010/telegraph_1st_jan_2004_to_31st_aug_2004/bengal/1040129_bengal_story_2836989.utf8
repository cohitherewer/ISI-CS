 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Protection for small planters
																								Jalpaiguri, Jan. 28: Factories where small growers get tea leaves processed will have to give 60 per cent of their earnings from the sale of tea to them from April, reports our correspondent. 																								The Tea Board order, which brings into effect a standard price policy, has evoked contrasting reactions with the small planters cheering and the factories branding it unacceptable. 																								A standard price policy has been an old demand of the small tea growers, who had complained about the low prices they get for supplying green leaves to the bought leaf factories.The factories can make profit even if they are left with 40 per cent, said a leader of the small growers.

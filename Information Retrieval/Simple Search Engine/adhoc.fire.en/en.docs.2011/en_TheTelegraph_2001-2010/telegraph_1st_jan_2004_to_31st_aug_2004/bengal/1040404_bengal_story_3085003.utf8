The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 Nayana kicks off with yatra
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Nayana: Taking on Didi																								Calcutta, April 3: Nayana Bandopadhyay, the wife of rebel Trinamul Congress MP Sudip Bandopadhyay, will hit the road tomorrow to voice her protest against Mamata Banerjees injustice towards my husband.																								Enough is enough. Now the time has come to speak out in public against the treatment meted out to Sudip. What wrong has he done by refusing to shift to Raiganj to please a section of party leaders? Rather, he has acted judiciously by seeking re-election from the Calcutta Northwest seat where he has to complete the unfinished job. He cannot simply leave his electorate in the lurch and go elsewhere, Nayana said tonight.																								The actress-turned-legislator said she would first lead a padayatra along with her husband in the Cossipore area tomorrow morning and address a party workers meeting at the Muslim Institute in the afternoon where former PCC chief Somen Mitra will share the stage. This is a sustained programme till the elections are over. I shall also shortly make a door-to-door campaign to seek public support for Sudip. Let the people decide if Sudip has done anything wrong.																								A Trinamul MLA from Bowbazar, one of the seven Assembly segments in Calcutta Northwest, Nayana claimed that the people of the constituency want Sudip to re-enter the fray from there. I have intensely toured all seven Assembly segments and everywhere people are clamouring for Sudip. 																								Asked if her move would invite Mamatas wrath, she said: I am not bothered about what the party is thinking about me. I am ready to risk any sort of disciplinary action to speak the truth. I am also hurt at the manner in which the leadership is treating me these days. I dont know why I am not involved in party programmes. Is it my fault that I am married to Sudip?																								She said Mamata was being misguided by a handful of sycophants. Didi will realise what we have done for her in all these years. I pray good sense prevails on her. 																								Trinamul spokesman and leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Pankaj Banerjee said tonight the party would take steps against Nayana if necessary.																								We are keeping a watch on her activities and will definitely take action when the situation arises.

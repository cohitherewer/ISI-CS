The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Makeover for poet resort
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Calcutta, March 30: Mungpoo in Darjeeling, where Rabindranath Tagore spent his summers between 1938 and 40 and penned a couple of poems and several letters, will be developed as an eco-tourism destination.																								The Rs 50-crore project will include a composite farming venture and come up on 700 acres of the abandoned state-owned cinchona plantation as a joint venture of the industries department and the city-based Sufala Super-tech Farming. 																								The government has given its nod to the proposal. Industries minister Nirupam Sen and the secretary of his department, Sabyasachi Sen, have requested the land and land reforms department to transfer the plot. A memorandum of understanding between the government and the promoters is likely to be signed in April, immediately after the land transfer.																								Eleven sites at the cinchona plantation, which include a quinine factory complex and the bungalows of the director, manager and the assistant manager, have been earmarked for the project.																								The tourist cottages made of logs and chalets will come up at varying altitudes, from 1,400 ft above sea level up to 5,000 ft, said the directors of Sufala Super-tech, Sujoy Das and Ratan K. Hati.																								There will be three categories of cottages to cater to all sections of tourists, budget to luxury. Apart from idyllic surroundings, the high points of the getaway would be a floating restaurant, a crafts bazaar, a floating market, a foreign exchange bureau and a shopping mall.																								Composite farming will include cultivation of mushroom, rose (for colour extracts, essential oil concentrates and dry flowers), vegetables (tomato, broccoli, capsicum, chilli, baby corn, garlic and onion) and medicinal plants like Aloe Vera and Safed Musli. Sen said the project was conceived to promote export of specific agro products in contiguous areas by providing remunerative prices to the farmers. Workers of the cinchona plantation, who are out of job, would be given employment in the farming project, Sen said.																								The chairman of the Mullickghat Phoolbazar Parichalan Samiti, Sudhanshu Sil, and the state agri-horticultural corporation have been roped in to oversee the project.

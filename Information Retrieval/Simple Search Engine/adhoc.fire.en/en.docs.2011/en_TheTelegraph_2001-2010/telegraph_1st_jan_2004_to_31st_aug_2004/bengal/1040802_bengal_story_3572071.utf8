 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 HC orders eviction
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 1: A division bench of Calcutta High Court has asked the government to evict all settlers of six colonies adjacent to a new water treatment plant and supply station at Dakshineswar on the northern fringes of the city.																								After hearing a petition filed by the settlers of one of the six colonies, the bench comprising Justice D.K. Seth and Justice R.. Sinha said on Friday: Law and sympathy are on the side of the petitioner. But the court is passing this order in greater interest. The land should be vacated to remove the chances of contamination of water of the treatment plant.																								Government sources said water from this station is being supplied to seven municipal areas. The plant is on 45 bighas but double the size of the plot is required for the supply station and the water treatment plant. The government had acquired 90 bighas for the project in 1982. The illegal colonies came in the way of the facility.																								The division bench passed the order observing that the settlers should be removed to develop the area and prevent contamination of drinking water.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Flop show over, bomb behind bars
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, June 25: His job was cut out: step out before a crowd, say a few lines and explode with a flash into smithereens. 																								The human bomb was brought in from Delhi to campaign for the CPM ahead of the municipal elections. But this morning, the trick backfired on the party when illusionist Arjun Sen failed to pull off the blast and a disappointed crowd went on the rampage.																								The Burdwan railway station premises turned into a battlefield as the mob stoned the makeshift dais and virtually pulled it down. Police wielded the baton but by then two cars belonging to an automobile distributor, which sponsored the event, and the magicians equipment were damaged. Traffic on GT Road adjoining the station was stopped for about two hours.																								Sen, who was engaged by the local CPM, was arrested on charges of cheating people and unlawful assembly. Originally from Andul in Howrah, he leads a magic troupe in Delhi. 																								Subdivisional officer Gopal Ghosh said no one sought permission for the show. 																								Local CPM leaders said Burdwan MP Nikhilananda Sar had brought in the magician as part of campaigning for the civic poll slated for June 27. Sen had earlier been to parts of North 24-Parganas to canvass for the party, said Uday Sarkar, the CPM district committee member and zilla parishad sabhadhipati.

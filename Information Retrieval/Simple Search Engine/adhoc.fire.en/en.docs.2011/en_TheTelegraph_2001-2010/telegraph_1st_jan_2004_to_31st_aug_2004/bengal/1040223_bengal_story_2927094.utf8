 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Vaccine hurdle
																								Feb. 22: The polio immunisation programme rammed into a boycott speedbreaker today. 																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee administered polio drops to three children at Karaya in south Calcutta in the morning and it had a smooth run in the city but about 1,500 children across the state could not be given the drops following boycotts. 																								Murshidabad headed the list of boycott districts followed by North 24-Parganas, where residents alleged that children were infected despite the vaccine.

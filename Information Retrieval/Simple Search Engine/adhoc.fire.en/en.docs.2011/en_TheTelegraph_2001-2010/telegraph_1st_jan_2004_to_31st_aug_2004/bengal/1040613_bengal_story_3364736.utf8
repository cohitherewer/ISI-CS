The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 Euro on air 30 minutes late
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 12: Around 350,000 cable homes in the city and suburbs missed 30 minutes of the first match of Euro 2004 this evening, before police wangled a solution for soccer lovers.																								ESPN and Star Sports, the channels beaming the tournament, were switched off on the network of multi-system operator Manthan by the broadcaster following payment disputes.																								The channels, however, were back on air around 10 pm, by when Greece had taken a 1-0 lead over Portugal. We switched on the channels only at the express request of the deputy commissioner of police, an ESPN-Star Sports (ESS) spokesperson said.																								As uncertainty continued through the day over the fate of the telecast, some Manthan operators went to Lalbazar in the evening to seek police intervention.																								Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (detective department), asked ESS to switch the channels back on for the weekend and resolve the issue on Monday.

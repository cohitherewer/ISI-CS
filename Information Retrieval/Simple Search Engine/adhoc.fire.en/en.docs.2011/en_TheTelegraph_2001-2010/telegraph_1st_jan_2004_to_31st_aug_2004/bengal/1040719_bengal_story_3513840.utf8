 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 The caved-in Hill Cart Road. A Telegraph picture																								Siliguri, July 18: A 200-m stretch of Hill Cart Road, which connects the hills to the plains, has caved in wrenching away part of the toy train tracks and pulling curtains on the movement of vehicles.																								The subsidence comes a week after the seasons first landslide near Paglajhora, about 45 km from Siliguri. 																								Hill Cart Road, which is National Highway 55, is the preferred route for those travelling to the hills from Siliguri. Traffic is now being diverted via Pankhabari Road between Sukna and Kurseong. 																								Torrential rain in the past 24 hours has damaged Hill Cart Road at seven other points between Chunabati and 14th Mile near lower Paglajhora. Two houses have developed cracks. 																								Residents are living in fear of being swept away by an avalanche of rocks or a mudslide. Every day is like a nightmare. After last nights slide at Paglajhora, our single-storey house developed a crack, said Man Bir Tamang, a resident.																								The PWDs highway division, which looks after the road, said the white waterfalls, Paglajhora, lies on unstable geo-tactical plates. The zone has witnessed subsidence almost annually. Both the road and the toy train tracks have suffered severe damage every time this has occurred.																								Several layers of protective walls and wire mesh have failed to arrest subsidence of the highway. Restoration work has been taken up on a war footing, said a senior PWD official. 																								Residents, however, blamed the unrestricted movement of overloaded vehicles on the Paglajhora stretch for the repeated slides.

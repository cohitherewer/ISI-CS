 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Downsizing rolls with two
 A STAFF REPORTERShams and Roy: First to goCalcutta, June 1: Food and civil supplies minister Kalimuddin Shams and irrigation and waterways minister Amalendra Roy resigned today as part of cabinet downsizing sparked by a Supreme Court order that its strength cannot exceed 15 per cent of the Assemblys.																								Shams, a Forward Bloc MLA, has been a minister since 1991 and was deputy Speaker before that. Roy, an MLA from Barah in Murshidabad, became a minister in 2001.																								Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh said a meeting of the partys state secretariat decided this morning that Shams would quit. 																								It has also been decided that (co-operatives and consumer affairs minister) Naren De will look after Shams portfolio. Des portfolios will go to relief minister Hafiz Ali Sairani, Ghosh said.																								Party chairman Kamal Guha handed over Shams resignation to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings. Ghosh said: We will inform the chief minister about our decision to reallocate De and Sairanis portfolios in a day or two. 																								Sources said the chief minister wanted Shams to resign because he was not keeping well and charge of an important department could be a burden.																								It is learnt that Bhattacharjee wanted minister of state for irrigation, Ganesh Mandal of the RSP, to resign on health grounds. 																								The CPM is likely to drop two of its ministers. Among the names doing the rounds are those of minister of state for municipal affairs Anju Kar, minister of state for school education Iva Dey, minister of state for refugee rehabilitation and relief Nayan Sarkar and minister of state for employment exchange, labour and ESI, Susanta Ghosh.																								The partys womens wing, Ganatantrik Mahila Samity, has however insisted that no woman be dropped from the cabinet. 																								The Left Front, which is meeting at the CPMs Alimuddin Street headquarters tomorrow, is expected to discuss downsizing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Cocktail of lesson and lampoon
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Youth Congress supporters celebrate the partys sweep in Andhra Pradesh in Calcutta. Picture by Amit Datta																								Calcutta, May 12: Will Thursday the thirteenth prove lucky or perpetuate the 13 jinx? 																								As in the rest of India, the question must have been gnawing at the minds of most of the candidates of the five Lok Sabha seats in Calcutta, Dum Dum and Jadavpur as they spent the day on a razors edge. 																								Mamata Banerjee, the Trinamul Congress chief and candidate from Calcutta South, fought her nerves, if any, by immersing herself in preparations for the final battle  the counting of votes. 																								She went into a huddle this evening with her workers who would man the counting centres for her constituency at Survey Building, Ballygunge Government School and David Hare Training College. But she frequently took time out from the meetings to enquire after her mother, admitted in a south Calcutta nursing home.																								We trained the workers on how to keep a hawks eye during counting and warned them repeatedly not to get distracted while counting is on. The trend must be carefully noted down after every round of counting, said a close aide of Mamata. 																								She is fighting the CPMs Rabin Deb and Nafisa Ali, put up by the Congress. The former Miss India wound up her counting meetings in the morning and spent the evening in a city hotel giving an interview to a local television channel. 																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee took the cue from Mamata and put his counting agents through a drill. That over, it was business as usual in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. 																								He gave up his black ambassador  his preferred vehicle during polling because he believes it brings him success  and opted for the white ambassador he uses as mayor. I have to clear my pending works, he said. 																								In an extraordinary step, he ordered the removal of banners, buntings and cutouts from Calcutta Northwest, where his expensive campaign set many tongues wagging. As the first citizen, I must set an example, said Mukherjee, who is already a councillor and an MLA and hopes to make a record of sorts by becoming an MP, all at once. 																								His principal opponent, rebel Trinamul candidate and Congress-backed Independent Sudip Bandopadhyay regaled friends and relatives at his Taltala home cooking up rhymes lampooning Trinamul. A sample: Trinamul Trinamul aar kato karbi bhul (How many mistakes will you (read Mamata Banerjee) commit?). Sudhangshu Sil of the CPM was seen passing time by playing cards on the pavement with neighbours. 																								Mohammad Salim, the youth services minister and CPM candidate from Calcutta Northeast, seemed the most relaxed. He attended Writers Buildings as usual. In the afternoon, he watched the final of the Ilias Cup football tournament and gave away the prizes to the victorious players from Heramba Chandra College. 																								I am not at all tense. My party organised the meetings about how to go about the counting. I have spent the day like any other, said Salim. 																								Of his rivals, Moushumi Chatterjee has set off for the Congress high command in Delhi with tales of rigging while Ajit Panja of Trinamul spent most of the day in his C.R. Avenue house overseeing the preparations of his boys who will man the six booths where repolling will be held tomorrow. 																								I am confident of retaining the blessing of my voters, he said.																								In Dum Dum, a visibly tired Tapan Sikdar claimed he would retain the seat before going off to organise his BJP workers for counting duties. 																								The administration has made elaborate arrangements for counting. The six counting centres in the city are under guard. Even before the electronic voting machines reached the centres, special services branch (SSB) and paramilitary forces had been deployed there, said Herman Prit Singh, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). 																								A deputy commissioner of police will be present at each of the counting centres, except Survey Building and Hastings House, where two would be posted, to supervise security arrangements and other measures.

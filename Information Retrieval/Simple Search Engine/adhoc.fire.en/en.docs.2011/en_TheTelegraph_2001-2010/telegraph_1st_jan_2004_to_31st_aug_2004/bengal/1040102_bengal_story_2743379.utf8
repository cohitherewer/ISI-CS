 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Schoolgirl stabbed for turning down suitor
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar (Nadia), Jan. 1: A boy of 20 stabbed to death last night a Class VII girl who refused to marry him and committed suicide.																								Police said Rekhsona Khatun, a student of Bamunpukur Girls School in Mayapur, died immediately. Mridul Sheikh, who had consumed poison, died at Saktinagar Hospital here this morning. 																								Mridul tried hard to convince the girl of 14 to marry him. She remained indifferent. Her family opposed the match, said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh. 																								Rekhsona was attacked around 9 pm while returning with her classmate from a coaching class. As they entered their neighbourhood at Noapara, about 110 km from Calcutta, Mridul intercepted them.																								The roads were empty on the coldest night of the season. Riding a cycle, Mridul accosted them and asked the friend to leave Rekhsona alone. When the girl refused, he dragged Rekhsona to a nearby banana grove and pleaded with her to marry him. The classmate ran to Rekhsonas house and informed her mother, Dilwara Bibi, said Ghosh.																								The friend told Rekhsonas mother that she had heard Mridul say he would end his life if she spurned his offer. Dilwara Bibi rushed to her neighbours as her husband Amirchand Sheikh, a mason, lives in Calcutta. 																								When Dilwara reached the spot with the neighbours, Rekhsona was lying in a pool of blood. She was repeatedly stabbed in the abdomen. Not far away, the boy was writhing in pain. Rekhsona was declared brought dead by the hospital.																								I knew Mridul (also the son of a mason) loved Rekhsona, who lived about 200 yards from his house, but wasnt sure whether she reciprocated. He had conveyed his feelings through someone in her family and that created trouble. Rekhsonas father is considered affluent, not Mriduls father Haru, said a neighbour. 																								A sobbing Amirchand said he could not think of getting his daughter married as she was a minor. He wanted her to study.

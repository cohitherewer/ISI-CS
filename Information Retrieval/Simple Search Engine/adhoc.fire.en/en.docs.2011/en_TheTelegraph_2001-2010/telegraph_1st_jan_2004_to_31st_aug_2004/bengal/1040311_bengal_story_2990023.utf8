 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Police to probe BSF rape charge: Court
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, March 10: Calcutta High Court today upheld the governments decision to direct police to inquire into the alleged rape of a Bangladeshi woman by BSF personnel. 																								The court said unless the subordinate court handling the case asks the BSF to conduct an inquiry, the paramilitary force has no authority to probe the allegations against its jawans. 																								A Nadia lawyer had moved the court seeking its intervention and adequate compensation for the victim. 																								The petition alleged five BSF jawans intercepted the woman and her family when they were trying to infiltrate into India by crossing a river near Basirhat in North 24-Parganas. The jawans allegedly raped her and forced the family back in a boat. 																								She was rescued by fishermen and a complaint was lodged against the jawans by a womens organisation in Basirhat. The police then moved a case against the accused. A sub-divisional judicial magistrate issued an arrest warrant against them.																								But the BSF did not hand over the personnel to the police and said they would investigate the matter, the lawyer said. 																								Appearing for the state, Debabrata Roy argued that the state had the right to investigate into a crime committed in its territory. 																								Additional solicitor-general S.K. Kapoor said according to the BSF act, the paramilitary force had the legal right to conduct an inquiry against its jawans. 																								The court declined to allow the petitioners demands and said the SDJM would hear the case.

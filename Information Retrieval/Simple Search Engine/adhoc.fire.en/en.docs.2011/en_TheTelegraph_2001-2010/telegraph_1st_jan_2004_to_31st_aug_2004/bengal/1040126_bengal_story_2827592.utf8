 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Purulia, Jan. 25: A project that will link four district hospitals with specialised tertiary medical centres in Burdwan and Calcutta is set to be inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tomorrow.																								Telemedicine, though not new in the state, would be introduced in the governments healthcare delivery system in south Bengal with the project. It would facilitate consultation on complicated cases with specialists based at the tertiary centres without the patient having to be present.																								Purulias chief medical officer of health B.B. Patra said the Deben Mahato Sadar Hospital here and the district hospitals in Murshidabad, Birbhum and West Midnapore would be connected through the Net with Burdwan Medical College and Hospital and NRS Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta. Bhattacharjee and health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra will be at the city hospital for the inauguration of the project.																								The method will enable electronic exchange of information regarding a patient, said Patra. Sitting in Purulia, we will be able to furnish details like a patients clinical symptoms, X-ray and pathological reports and seek advice from a specialist or a group of specialists in Calcutta, who would suggest the treatment procedure.																								Sadar hospital superintendent Swapan Sarkar said the facility would benefit patients with complicated cases, which require expert intervention. Most such patients, Sarkar said, are now referred to Bankura Medical College and Hospital. 																								But Internet connectivity in the region is not fast enough and the projects success will depend on the technological hitches being sorted out.																								A section of health employees here said the project could also meet with the same fate as the specialised neo-natal intensive care unit. 																								The unit, opened last year with a dozen beds, is doing well despite the absence of a paediatric surgeon but running at a monthly loss of Rs 50,000, said an official.

 															- SSC  amp; education officials face flak in high court OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 1: Justice Barin Ghosh of Calcutta High Court today asked government pleader Rabilal Moitra to appear before him and explain how a retired disabled teacher can maintain a nine-member family on a monthly pension of Rs 3,600.																								The directive came after education department officials told the court that Muruddin, the retired teacher, should not claim more pension as he owned five bighas and could supplement his pension with the Rs 12,000 he can earn every year from the land.																								Muruddins left arm and right leg were paralysed just before he retired as a high schoolteacher in Burdwan at the age of 58. He applied to district school authorities for the higher rate of pension that is given to retired disabled employees.																								When his application was rejected, Muruddin moved the district civil court, which asked the school authorities to give him pension at a revised rate. But they did not carry out the order and filed an appeal in the high court, which asked the school authorities to file an affidavit.																								In the affidavit, education department officials said a school sub-inspector had visited the teachers house and found that he owned five bighas. From this land he can earn Rs 12,000 per year. So, he should not demand more money, a report by the district school authorities said.																								After seeing the report the judge was furious. These persons should have minimum knowledge of the present market, he said. How can a man, even if he is below poverty level, maintain his nine-member family with Rs 3,600 per month? 																								The judge said he would ask the government pleader how the education officials could arrive at the figure of Rs 12,000, which they claimed the retired teacher could earn from his land.

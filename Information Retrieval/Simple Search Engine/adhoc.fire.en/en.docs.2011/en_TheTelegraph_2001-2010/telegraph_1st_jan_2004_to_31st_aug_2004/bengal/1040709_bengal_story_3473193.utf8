 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 CM stands by pundit Sarkar, skirts PhD
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, July 8: For the first time since a controversy over former Rabindra Bharati University vice-chancellor Pabitra Sarkars PhD degree erupted, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee spoke in his defence but avoided endorsing his claim of being a doctorate from Chicago University.																								Sarkar is an expert in linguistics and stood first-class first in MA in Chicago, Bhattacharjee told the Assembly this evening without throwing light on the row. Central to the controversy is the question whether Sarkar actually obtained a PhD from Chicago and whether he was right in adding the prefix Dr to his name.																								Name another such pundit in linguistics to match him (Sarkar), the chief minister said after Congress MLA Abdul Mannan raised the issue during a discussion on the home (personnel and administrative reforms) budget. Mannan blamed the government for inducting Sarkar to a committee that runs the Bangla Akademy.																								Replying to the budget debate, the chief minister said: You (Mannan) mentioned Sarkars name but perhaps do not know that a poet like Nirendranath Chakraborty heads the 19-member committee. 																								Early this week, the Trinamul Congress demanded that Sarkar be dropped from the panel. Trinamul chief whip Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay had said he would write to Bhattacharjee requesting him to inquire into the allegation. If he does not respond in a week, I will file a criminal case against Sarkar for cheating and forgery. 																								Sarkar said some people are trying to create a controversy. I completed my thesis and cleared the viva-voce. The doctoral committee recommended the awarding of my PhD degree in August 1975 but I returned to India with a provisional certificate because I had to join Jadavpur University immediately, he said. If not collected, the degree had to be applied for after the convocation but Sarkar said he could not do so because of other preoccupations.

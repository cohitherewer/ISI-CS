The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Seeds of disease on hospital grounds
 RABI BANERJEE				 	 A parthenium clean-up drive in progress. A Telegraph picture																								Krishnagar, June 8: Dhruva Biswas has been running a sports-goods shop near the district hospital here for over a decade. 																								About five years ago, he was diagnosed with asthma. A non-smoker, Biswas was left wondering how he got the disease. His family had no history of the respiratory ailment. 																								After several tests, doctors concluded that his asthmatic conditions had developed from a severe allergy caused by floating pollen grains that came from the flowers of a thick growth of parthenium bushes, located on the district hospital premises and right behind his shop.																								Biswas, 40, is not alone. He is among several residents of Krishnagar town in Nadia district, 85 km from Calcutta, who are suffering from parthenium poisoning. The common symptoms of the allergy are asthma and irritation in the eye and skin. 																								The spate of parthenium poisoning cases in the district town has been attributed to the sudden increase in growth of parthenium bushes in the area. 																								Doctors said morning-walkers and children were at maximum risk. These two groups are highly prone to this infection because of their daily exposure to the parthenium bushes, said deputy chief medical officer of health of Nadia, Mohan Basu.																								The problem, however, is not new. An awareness programme on the ill-effects of parthenium was started in the mid-eighties by the government when residents of Salt Lake in Calcutta began complaining of respiratory problems and eye irritation. 																								Instructions were given by then health minister Ambarish Mukherjee and his successor Prasanta Sur to uproot the whole lot of parthenium bushes in Salt Lake and other neighbourhoods in Calcutta. 																								Around four years ago, the health department was asked to destroy parthenium plants in every corner of the state. Accordingly, instructions were handed down to the district chief medical officers of health. The objective, however, was not achieved.																								It was not possible for us to take up such a huge job due to lack of infrastructure. Moreover, we feel that it is impossible to completely wipe out the plant, said chief medical officer of health Prabas Chowdhury.																								He did not rule out the possibility of hospital patients getting affected by the poisonous pollen. The hospital premises itself is a breeding ground of the parthenium bushes. 																								But chances are less because a person has to be exposed to the pollen grains for more than a month to develop allergic reactions, Chowdhury added. 																								A study we conducted showed an alarming presence of the plant, especially around the hospital and the court. Most respiratory ailments here are caused by the parthenium bushes, said ophthalmologist Imtiaj Ahmed. 																								To make residents aware of the dangers of parthenium, the medical community here has set up a forum comprising people from all walks of life. 																								Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said he would seek a report from the chief medical officer of Nadia on the spread of parthenium.

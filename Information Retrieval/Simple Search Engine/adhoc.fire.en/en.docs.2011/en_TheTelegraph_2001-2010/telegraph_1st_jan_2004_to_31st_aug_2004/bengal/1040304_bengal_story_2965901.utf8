 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Salary-starved workers jostle with HM managers 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Hind Motors (Hooghly), March 3: The Hindustan Motors (HM) factory at Hooghly was thrown into turmoil today after a large number of workers owing allegiance to the All India Trade Union Congress, the CPIs labour arm, manhandled managerial staff demanding clearance of outstanding salaries. 																								Eyewitnesses said the slogan-shouting workers jostled with about 700 managerial staff, pushing them out of the factory and into the main office in the same compound under the Uttarpara police station. 																								We did it as a token of protest against the delay in dispensing overdue salaries, said Probir Ganguly, who represents the Aituc-backed Sangrami Sramik Karmachari Union (SSKU), the dominant union. 																								According to the SSKU, the management had promised in a January meeting at Writers Buildings that it would start disbursing the outstanding salaries from March. Today they (management) told us they would not make the promised payment, after which we had no option but to register our protest, Ganguly said.																								Production in the factory was unaffected, he claimed and added we will not allow any managerial staff to enter the factory floor unless the overdue salaries are cleared first. 																								The mood in the factory apparently turned grim when Sukumar Mitra, manager of factory operations, announced that the salaries for January, scheduled for release today, would be handed out later. He did not offer any explanation, a union member said. 																								After the announcement, Mitra made himself unavailable for comment. We are not aware of any such problem, said Soni Srivastav, spokesperson of the C.K. Birla group which owns HM. 																								In a curious turn, the Citu union in the factory accused the SSKU of being a left extremist outfit and asked the management to act against those responsible for manhandling the staff. 																								They tried to prove they represent the masses through a show of strength, but ultimately failed to extract the overdue salaries. We do not support the move at all. In fact, we have asked the factory authorities to pinpoint and suspend the persons who manhandled our managers. After all, if any of our members had been involved in such an incident, they would be suspended, said Sunil Sarkar, a Citu spokesman. 																								The HM factory, with over 6,500 employees, has been facing labour problems for the past few months over irregularity and non-payment of salaries for more than a year. 																								On January 9 this year, the management had undertaken in a government-brokered deal to pay the overdue salaries in instalments over the following months on condition that production was kept above the 1,300 units-per-month mark.																								Subsequently, two instalments were cleared in January and February, with production demands met by the labour. However, salaries for those two months were not cleared.

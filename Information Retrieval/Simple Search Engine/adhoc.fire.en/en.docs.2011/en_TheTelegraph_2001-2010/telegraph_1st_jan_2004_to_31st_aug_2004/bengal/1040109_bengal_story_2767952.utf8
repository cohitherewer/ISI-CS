The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Jute strike called off
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Jan. 8: The strike  in the jute industry was withdrawn today following an agreement  ensuring an additional Rs 264 every month from February  for nearly 2.5 lakh workers. 																								The mills, however, will resume production on Saturday. Several trade unions had called the indefinite strike from December 29 demanding, among other things, restoration of variable dearness allowance on the basis of the cost of living index.																								Jute mill owners today agreed to the DA demand but forced the unions to agree on productivity-linked wages.																								Labour minister Mohammed Amin, who chaired a series of tripartite meetings to end the deadlock in the past two weeks, told reporters that the agreement would help increase productivity and benefit workers financially. 																								Apart from restoring the DA, Amin said, the mill workers would get an annual increment of Rs 10. The DA would be worth Rs 254. 																								About 50,000 workers in 59 jute mills, whose wages were reduced following flaws in the interpretation of certain clauses in the January 2002 agreement, would now be treated on a par with other workers and ensured of a daily wage of nearly Rs 160 per day at entry level, Amin said. 																								Sanjay Kajaria, the chairman of the Indian Jute Mills Association, said the agreement would ensure the industrys peace and viability. 																								He added that the best part of the settlement was linking wages with productivity. Workers can now earn more and production is expected to up. 																								An industry estimate put the additional financial commitment for a mill at around Rs 15 lakh every month.

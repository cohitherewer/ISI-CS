 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Purulia caps bird flu fears 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Purulia, Feb. 4: Authorities  here ruled out the possibility of the bird flu virus killing  nearly 300 chicks at a farm in Kashipur but formed a special  committee as a precautionary measure to keep an eye on aspects  of the epidemic sweeping through Southeast Asia. 																								A high-level committee, including the district magistrate, the police superintendent, the chief medical officer of health and the deputy director of animal husbandry, was formed on directions from Calcutta. 																								The move comes after the unusual deaths of two to four-day old chicks at a farm in Dhanara village in Kasipur block, about 320 km from Calcutta, last week. 																								Deputy director of animal husbandry Amar Shankar Patra, who is on the panel, said a veterinary surgeon in Kashipur, Ramaprasad Layaj, had told him that the persons who bought the day-old chicks from hatcheries in Arambagh and Orissa had not kept them in warm conditions. They died due to exposure to the cold. 																								Patra had also contacted the joint director of the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals in Calcutta. He explained that the bird flu virus does not affect chicks at such a young age. 																								The experts also ruled out an outbreak at the farm since the remaining 605 chicks had not been affected. The virus is highly contagious. Once it strikes, all the birds in a farm will get infected and die. But since this has not happened, flu is not the cause of the deaths, Patra said today. 																								However, an expert from the Calcutta institute is arriving tomorrow to carry out investigations. Tissue samples will be taken to the institute in Calcutta. But, in all probability, no bacterial or viral infection will be found, he said.

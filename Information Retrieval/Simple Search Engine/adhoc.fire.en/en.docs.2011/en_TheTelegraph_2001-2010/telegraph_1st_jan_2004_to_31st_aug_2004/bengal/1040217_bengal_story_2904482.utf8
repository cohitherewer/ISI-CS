 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 BSF jawan guns down mother of 3
 ABHIJIT CHAKRABARTY																								Lockma (Hili), Feb. 16: A 32-year-old mother of three was shot dead by a Border Security Force jawan while grazing her goats on no-mans land this afternoon.																								Tension erupted in the area as thousands of villagers prevented the BSF from removing the body for over four hours. They shouted slogans against the border force and dared the guards to open fire if they wanted to get close to the body. Hand over the jawan. We will lynch him, screamed the people.																								South Dinajpur police superintendent R. Shivkumar rushed to the spot, 30 km from Balurghat, to defused the tension. The people released the body only after Shivkumar assured them that the guilty would be punished. The body was taken to Hili police station and sent for postmortem around 6 pm.																								Witnesses said Lili Mahato, a mother of three minor girls, was grazing her seven goats on land owned by her family on the Bangladesh side of the barbed-wire fence. She did not come out when the gates were opened by the BSF at noon.																								The gate is opened at 7 am when villagers who have deposited their voter identity card with the BSF are allowed to till or graze livestock on their holdings on the no-mans land. The gate is opened at noon for half-an-hour to allow people to return for lunch. It is again opened at 2 pm to allow people in and then at 6 pm to let them out.																								Lili was sitting beside a banana grove around 2.20 pm when a jawan spotted her. He abused her and, after an exchange of words, shot her through the hip, said Jayanti Mahato, the dead womans sister-in-law who was working in a field nearby.

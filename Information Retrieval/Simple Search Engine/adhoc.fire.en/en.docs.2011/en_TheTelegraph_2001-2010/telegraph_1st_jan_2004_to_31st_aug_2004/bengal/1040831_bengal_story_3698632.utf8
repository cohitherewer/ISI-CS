 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 CPM sounds traffic snarl siren
																								Calcutta, Aug. 30: Left Front chairman Biman Bose today warned that traffic movement along APC Road, AJC Bose Road and Central Avenue will be disrupted on September 1 when 15 Left parties set out on a peace procession.																								He requested people going to the airport or railway stations to start early. 																								Our rally will start from Deshapriya Park around 1 pm. About 1 lakh people will join the procession and it is obvious that traffic movement will be affected, said Bose, who had questioned a high court curb on rallies in the city on working days.																								The CPM leader, however, added that ambulances and vehicles carrying patients would be allowed to move. Our activists will help these vehicles reach their destinations as quickly as possible, he said.

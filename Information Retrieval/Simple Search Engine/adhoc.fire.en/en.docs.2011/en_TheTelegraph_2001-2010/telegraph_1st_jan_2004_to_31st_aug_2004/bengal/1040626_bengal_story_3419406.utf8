The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Duo in the dock rocks Tagore cradle of peace Varsity bleeds after stab at sanctity
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sinha ducks for cover on his way to the Alipore court. Picture by Amit Datta																								Santiniketan, June 25: Waves of despair and shame rippled through the Visva-Bharati community as news of the arrests did the rounds of the campus. 																								However, anger overpowered shock at the arrest of a former vice-chancellor and an allegedly fraudulent lecturer as the varsity condemned the crime in unison. 																								There is no question of forgetting or forgiving any of the culprits, however highly placed they may have been, said a member of the academic circle. 																								The hurt was equal from the youngest student and staff member to the octogenarian ashramite as they reacted to reports of the swoop on former vice-chancellor Dilip Sinha and ex-math lecturer Mukti Deb. 																								The arrests have severely tarnished the image of Gurudevs dream abode. We had never imagined that we would have to witness such a shameful episode. We are hurt, said Supriyo Mukherjee, an ashramite in his mid 80s.																								As demeaning as it may be, most said they had anticipated the outcome and were not surprised. The incident is an insult to the values of education and academics, a resounding slap on every educated human being. Hurtful as they are, the arrests do not astound us, said Somendranath Banerjee, a Bengali teacher and an ashramite in his seventies. 																								From the discussions I had with Sinha, as well as from what I had heard of him, I have to say that if there was a person who could bring shame to the house of Tagore, it was him, he added.																								Those who regard the campus as a refuge of sanctity were outraged. This is a temple of education and culture, Mukherjee said. Whoever tries to damage the edifice of faith, the pillar of our heritage, deserves exemplary punishment. 																								The students, who are now busy with examinations, are being shielded from the storm that lashed Visva-Bharati. But it could not have spared them. If a teacher sets such an example, what are we expected to learn? asked a student of Vinoy Bhavan, the BEd and physical education section.																								Sinha had always been the focal point of discussions about scams that had shaken Visva-Bharati during his tenure. People always had a negative perception about him. The news of his arrest is not a surprise to anyone here, said another student.

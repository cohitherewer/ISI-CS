The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 Accused surrender after 10 yrs
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Alipurduar, March 13: Nineteen CPM workers who had been eluding the police for 10 years since two separate murders were sent to jail on their surrender in court yesterday.																								Police said the accused  absconding since 1994  were wanted in connection with the murder of RSP leader Kalipada Mandal and a key functionary of the Kamtapur Peoples Party.																								The sub-divisional magistrates court had earlier issued arrest warrants against all of them. Those in custody include Chittaranjan Roy, a CPM member of the Kumargramduar zonal committee, and two members of the partys Khoardanga local committee.																								Mandal was killed in 1994 when CPM and RSP activists clashed at Khoardanga in Kumargramduar over the selection of a site for sinking a well.																								KPP activist Dipak Roy was killed in 2000  allegedly by the same group  in a clash between CPM activists and KPP members over a bandh sponsored by the latter.																								Garen Roy, the secretary of the CPMs Kumargramduar zonal committee, today said the 1994 clash had erupted when RSP activists tried to prevent villagers from digging the well.																								But Mandals death is certainly a tragic one and we condemn the incident, he added.

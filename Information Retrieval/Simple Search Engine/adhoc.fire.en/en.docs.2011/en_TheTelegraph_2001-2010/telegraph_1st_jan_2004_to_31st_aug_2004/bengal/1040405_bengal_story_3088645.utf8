The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Govt flab scan half done
 SWATI SENGUPTA 																								Calcutta, April 4: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has identified more than 4,000 of its workforce as redeployable.																								In an attempt to shed flab, the government had last year begun an exercise to find out how it could achieve optimum utilisation of manpower. 																								According to reports compiled so far, at least 4,000 employees can be used elsewhere, a senior official at Writers Buildings said on Friday. Reports on 1,77,000 sanctioned posts have come in, of which over 50,000 positions are vacant.																								The official said the government has a workforce of over 400,000. As reports on less than half the total workforce has come in as yet, the picture is likely to be very different from what it appears now, he added. 																								However, one must remember that at least 20,000 positions always appear to be vacant because of transfer of files for positions that are to be filled due to retirement and/or promotion.																								The departments were asked to submit two reports, one on the actual number of employees against the sanctioned strength and the other on optimum utilisation of the workforce. 																								Departments like school education, health and family welfare are yet to submit either of the two reports. Those like land and land reforms, and finance have submitted only a part of the information wanted.																								The report on optimum utilisation of the workforce  which would put a figure on how many people are required for a departments work  was to have been submitted by all departments, directorates and regional offices by December 31 last year.																								Sources said an apex committee comprising the chief secretary, the secretary of the personnel and administrative reforms department, and the finance secretary will make recommendations on ways to use the workforce identified as redeployable.																								At least two communications were sent to each department to speed up the work as it is impossible to draw any conclusion unless the position of the entire government workforce is compiled, the official at Writers Buildings said. 																								So the personnel and administrative reforms department is thinking of sending another reminder to all the departments  nearly 15 of them  which are yet to submit complete reports.																								There is a possibility that the positions that have been lying vacant will be abolished. However, only the apex committee will decide on that and work out a policy if that is felt essential, the official said.

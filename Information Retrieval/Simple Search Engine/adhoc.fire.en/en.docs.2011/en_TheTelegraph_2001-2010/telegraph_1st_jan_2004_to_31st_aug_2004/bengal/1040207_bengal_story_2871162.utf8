																								Calcutta, Feb. 6: Indonesian industrialist Anindya . Bakrie today called on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to discuss investment opportunities in the state, especially in coal aggregation and palm oil refining.																								Bakries company PT. CMA Indonesia, the largest coal miner in Asia, is interested in upgrading coal with a high ash content to make it suitable for industries like power. We have a turnover of $1.7 billion in the sector. We can ship coal from Indonesia and mix it with the coal produced in Bengal. Our coal is low on ash content and the mixture of the two will produce quality coal, said Bakrie. The talks, he added, will be followed by a feasibility study.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Court standstill in bill protest
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 				 	 A deserted corridor of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday when lawyers began a ceasework. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta, June 23: Work at Calcutta High Court and 201 subordinate courts across the state came to a halt today with over 26,000 lawyers responding to a ceasework call given by the West Bengal Bar Council. 																								They are protesting against a government move to introduce the Block-Level Conciliation Board Bill in the next session of the Assembly. 																								Judges attended the courts as usual but the lawyers stayed away. A few advocates, owing allegiance to the Left parties, reported for work, but proceedings could not be initiated as most of the opposite lawyers were absent. 																								Council chairman Amiya Kumar Chatterjee said in the evening: Even the members of the Democratic Lawyers Association (of Left lawyers) have refused to attend courts today. The government should take a lesson. If this bill is not withdrawn, we will go for a greater movement. 																								His deputy, Asit Basu, claimed the response of lawyers was total in north Bengal, too. The ceasework was total and no activity was reported from any court in north Bengal, said the vice-chairman of the council. 																								Law minister Nisith Nandan Adhikari, however, said the ceasework call had partial effect. Many cases were heard in the courts. As far as I know, over 200 lawyers were present in the high court today. How can they (council) claim success? the minister said.																								It is very unreasonable and irresponsible on the part of the lawyers. If the bar council is the brain behind this, then the ceasework is illegal, he added. 																								The minister refused to say whether the bill would be placed. It was just a contemplation and we had sought their (the lawyers) comment a year ago, but they have not responded till date. 																								Uttam Majumdar, the general secretary of the National Lawyers Association, the largest such organisation in the state, claimed: The ceasework was total. Now the government will have to change its stand. 																								Members of the Siliguri Bar Association organised a meeting on the court premises to protest against the bill. 																								Around 400 to 450 lawyers did not work today. The ceasework was total and no activity took place in the Siliguri sub-divisional court or the consumer courts, said Arindam Mitra, the secretary of Siliguri Bar Association. 																								In Jalpaiguri, the strike was total and peaceful, said the Jalpaiguri Bar Association secretary Gautam Pal.

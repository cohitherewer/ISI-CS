 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Villagers foil train robbery
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Purulia, April 28: Villagers today salvaged nearly Rs 1.5 lakh by chasing and capturing four armed robbers who were fleeing after cleaning out the railway cash box on a passenger train.																								Around 9.30 am, nine goons climbed into the guards coach of the 422 Chakradharpur-Gomoh Passenger and pushed him and a ticket checker into the toilet.																								As the train rolled out of Gardrubeshwar station, about 270 km from Calcutta, the robbers broke open the cash box and took out 20 small leather bags full of cash, divisional railway manager K.B.L. Mittal said.																								The cash collected from various stations on the way in the Adra division of South-Eastern Railway was being taken to Kharagpur.																								The guard, however, managed to alert the driver on his walkie-talkie. As he brought the train to a halt, the robbers jumped off and ran towards the fields. Alerted by the shouts from the trains toilet, residents of nearby Metayla village in Raghunathpur block gave chase.																								The dacoits were beaten up and could have been lynched. Railway Protection Force personnel brought the situation under control, Mittal said.																								Of the 20 bags, one containing about Rs 36,000 was missing, he added. Five robbers managed to escape.

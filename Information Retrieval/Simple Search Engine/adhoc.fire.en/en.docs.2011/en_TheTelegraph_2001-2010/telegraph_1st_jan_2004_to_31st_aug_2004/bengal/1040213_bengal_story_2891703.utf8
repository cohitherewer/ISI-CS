 OUR CORRESPONDENT Midnapore, Feb. 12: A schoolteacher  was thrashed, forced to confess in writing and give an undertaking  that he would stay away from the school after a 10-year-old  girl complained of sexual harassment.																								Chintamoni Maity, a resident of Tamluk, 75 km from Calcutta, alleged that his daughter had last night complained about the harassment she had to face in school. As the news spread, hundreds of people marched straight to the Radhamoni Murari Kalua Primary School and dragged out Somenath Roy, the teacher.																								The crowd, led by CPM leader Bidyut Guchait, demanded a confession. When Roy refused, he was beaten up till he confessed and gave a written statement. 																								Asked why police were not informed, Guchait said: The teacher has given us a written statement and we have sorted out the problem. So we did not inform the police.																								Shibdas Banerjee, the officer-in-charge of Tamluk police station, said he had heard about the incident but no complaint had been lodged so far. Chhattisgarh plea																								Chhattisgarh home minister Brijmohan Agrawal has urged Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to help his state combat outfits like the Maoist Communist Centre and the Peoples War. 																								The activities of these extremist organisations are hampering development work.... They do not follow any ideology. They are anti-national forces, the minister said.

 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 BJP dilemma for Mamata
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 18: A section of Trinamul Congress has expressed opposition to the partys alliance with the BJP.																								However, Mamata Banerjee is not willing to part ways with the NDA at a time the Congress central leadership is dependent on the CPM to prop up an anti-BJP government at the Centre.																								For the party chief, who has called a meeting of legislators and office-bearers tomorrow to discuss the poll debacle, the immediate concern is putting up a fight against the Left in the municipal elections next month and preparing the party for the elections to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation next year.																								Several Trinamul nominees for the Lok Sabha are among leaders opposed to continuing their association with the BJP. Saugata Roy and Sultan Ahmed, who contested from Diamond Harbour and Katwa, believe that the party lost the minority communitys trust as well as popular support because of its alliance with the BJP. 																								The duo wants Trinamul to keep up its anti-Congress, anti-CPM stand.																								Muslims did not vote for us because of our association with the BJP, particularly after the Gujarat riots. The BJP-led governments economic policy, particularly the reduction in the interest rates on bank deposits and small savings schemes, hit common people hard. We obviously had to pay for the BJP policies, one of the leaders said.																								Sources said Mamata intends to underscore the need to continue in the NDA at tomorrows meeting. She has told close associates that Trinamul can exploit the Congress new equations with the Left at the national level to reap dividends in the state.																								The Trinamul leader has also asserted that her party continues to be the principal Opposition in the state despite its rout in the parliamentary elections. 																								But to be or not to be with the BJP is not the only issue that would be raised tomorrow. 																								Several Trinamul leaders, including city mayor Subrata Mukherjee and Ranjit Panja, who lost the general elections from Calcutta Northwest and Barasat, have alleged that sabotage led to their defeat.

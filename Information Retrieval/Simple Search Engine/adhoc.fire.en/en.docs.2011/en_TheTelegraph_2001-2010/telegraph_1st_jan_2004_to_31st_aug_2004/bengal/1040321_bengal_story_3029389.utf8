The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, March 21, 2004 				 Top cops media meet draws flak
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, March 20: Nadia superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty today incurred the displeasure of senior government officials by calling a news conference in an apparent bid to issue a rejoinder against his transfer by the Election Commission.																								The conference was called off after newspersons refused to give in writing that his entire statement would be published verbatim.																								Chakraborty was transferred by the poll panel along with North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Basudeb Bag and Malda range DIG Gaurav Dutt for alleged partisan roles.																								I wonder why Chakraborty convened a news conference. If he has any grievances against the ECs move, he can take it up with a proper forum, state chief secretary Ashok Gupta told The Telegraph. Earlier, the government had moved the Supreme Court against the ECs decision. But this time, we are not challenging its directive and will instead abide by it. I am surprised an IPS officer is making so much noise over the move when the government is ready to accept it.

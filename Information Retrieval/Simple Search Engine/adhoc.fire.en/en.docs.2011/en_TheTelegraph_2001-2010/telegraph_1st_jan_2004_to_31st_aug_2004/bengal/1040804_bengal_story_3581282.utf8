 SOUMI BHATTACHARYA																								Santiniketan, Aug. 3: Faced with only a trickle of tourists, Visva-Bharati has decided to unveil a never-seen-before collection of Rabindranath Tagores paintings to fill the stands that fell empty after the Nobel medal heist.																								The collection has 1,685 rare paintings, which have never been seen by the public and have lain for years inside a safe vault at Rabindra Bhavan.																								This precious collection will be in the reach of Tagore lovers soon. We are working on the paintings to restore them to their original glory. To start with, 1200 of them are ready for display, vice-chancellor Sujit Basu said today.																								The tourist traffic to Santiniketan has dwindled to a handful on weekends. More than 1,000 tourists used to visit the museum for a glimpse of Tagores gold medallion. But with the medal and other priceless memorabilia lost, no one comes here now, said Surajit Chatterjee, a local guide.																								With the museum closed to the public, Chatterjee now takes tourists to the railway station, where some of Tagores paintings are on display.																								But with Visva-Bharatis decision to bring out the paintings from the vault, we will hopefully get more tourists, said Aloke Choudhury, a hotel owner.The unveiling process started after the Centre gave the green signal. We have contacted the UGC for financial back-up to implement a foolproof security system , Basu said.

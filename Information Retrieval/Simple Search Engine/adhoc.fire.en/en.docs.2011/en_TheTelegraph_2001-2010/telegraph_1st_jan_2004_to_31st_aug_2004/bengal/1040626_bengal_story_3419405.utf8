The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Man dead, wife on run
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 25: A note from a man who was apparently driven to suicide by his wife made the high court refuse anticipatory bail today to a close relative of the woman.																								I am taking an out (a way out of life) because I cannot bear the torture any more. I hold her and her relatives responsible for my sufferings, read the suicide note from Saswata Ghosh.																								He hanged himself from the ceiling of his room on June 9, in a rare case of husband-bashing in times when wife-torture is frequent.																								Saswata, an accountant in a private firm at Bally, Howrah  where he lived  is said to have suffered physical and mental torture for a year since the birth of his only child, a girl, in 2003. His wife Seema and her parents, Paresh Chandra Pal and Rani Pal, are absconding.																								The division bench of Justices .A. Choudhury and A. Bhattacharya rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Dilip Kumar Ghosh, who is named in the suicide note and the FIR filed with Bally police by Saswatas brother Samir. The police investigation can thus continue.																								Asim Roy, the petitioners counsel, argued that Dilip was a responsible person and would not leave the state if granted bail. As a law-abiding citizen, my client will also help the investigating officer to reveal the truth, Roy told the court.																								Samirs FIR alleged that his brother was regularly subjected to torture by his sister-in-law and her family for money. Whenever he refused, his wife and her family members behaved badly with him.																								Opposing Dilips bail plea, additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said: Mine is an extraordinary case because never before in recent memory (has) a husband had to end his life because of torture by his wife. Article 498A offers enough protection to tortured housewives but there is nothing for tormented husbands.																								Saswata and Seema were married in mid-2001. Saswata Ghoshhad tried his best to maintain peace in the family, but in the end his equilibrium collapsed, Goswami told the court.

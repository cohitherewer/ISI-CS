 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 HC clears video hearing in alimony case
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 16: Justice Amitava Lala of Calcutta High Court today ruled that after the Supreme Courts green signal to videoconference in legal disputes, subordinate court judges had the liberty to take advantage of technology. 																								Justice Lala asked the sessions judge of Howrah to hold a videoconference in a case relating to the alimony of a woman separated from her husband who stays in the US. In his order, Justice Lala framed a guideline on videoconferencing for disposal of cases. The judge said during such a conference, video cameras should be placed at both ends so that both the deponent and the petitioner can hear each other. He also said the conference should be held at a time convenient to both sides. 																								The judge observed that after the apex court legalised the evidence of electronic machines, the courts should take the opportunity to speedily dispose cases. 																								Recently, two other high court judges had hinted during a hearing that they might allow the petitioners to deposit video clippings of a news item telecast by several channels to prove their charge against Left Front chairman Biman Bose.																								According to the petitioners, Bose had made adverse remarks on the judiciary and Justice Amitava Lala who had tried to restrict rallies in weekday Calcutta.																								The case that came up for hearing before Justice Lala today was initiated at the Howrah district judges court where Ena Bagchi had demanded an alimony of Rs 25,000 per month for her and her only childs maintenance. 																								After the case remained pending with the court for months, Ena petitioned the high court seeking an order to the district judge to dispose her case quickly. Justice Girish Gupta issued a directive asking the judge to dispose the case in two months. 																								But the subordinate judge pleaded helplessness as the respondent was a New York resident. The judge also said the husband, Amit Bagchi, was an engineer working in a responsible post and could come to India only at a time convenient to him.																								Ena again knocked the high courts doors. Hearing her plea, Justice Lala said: In this era of science, the courts are not helpless. They should not wait for respondents to come to court. Videoconference is also direct evidence. So, the district judge has no bar to call a video conference with (the) petitioners husband.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Govt snubbed for panel go-slow
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 20: A week after it came down on a committee to find causes of floods in the state for not submitting a report in a year-and-a-half, the high court rapped the government for not providing enough assistance to the panel.																								A division bench of Justice Barin Ghosh and Justice A.K. Basu directed the government to appoint a dedicated team of officials to help the committee complete its report. 																								Three members in the panel of five, who attended the court in compliance with an earlier order, said they were not being provided proper assistance, including necessary data. 																								After the court ordered the panel on March 7, 2003, the government took eight months to appoint its members. The committee started its work late. This is the cause of the delay, the panel members said.																								After hearing the allegation, an angry Justice Ghosh asked the governments counsel: Who are the persons you want to shield? Your men did not work properly at Massanjore dam and lakhs of people were affected by flood. We will not tolerate it.																								The court had wanted a study of floods in the state following environment activist Subhas Duttas allegation that some officials of Massanjore dam, under the irrigation department, were responsible for the flash flood in 2002, which affected six districts and thousands of people. 																								Dutta reminded the court last week that the panel had not yet submitted a report.																								The judges today said the government would not be allowed to doze. This is a question of life and death for thousands

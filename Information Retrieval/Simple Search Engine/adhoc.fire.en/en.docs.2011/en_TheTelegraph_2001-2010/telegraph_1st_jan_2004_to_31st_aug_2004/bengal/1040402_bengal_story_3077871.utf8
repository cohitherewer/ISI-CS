The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Tourists lost with treasures
 OUR BUREAU Santiniketan, April 1: Those  who stole the Nobel medal and other Tagore memorabilia last  week took away much more than they had bargained for  the  commerce of a town that depends largely on tourism.																								Everyone, from the jobless local guide to the owner of the deserted hotel, from the idling rickshaw-puller to the idle tourism official, is talking of the theft and the investigation. 																								They do not know if the stolen articles will be recovered, but one thing they know: a chunk of their business is gone.																								A few thousand people visit the museum during weekends and other holidays. On weekdays, they number around 500. But with the museum closed indefinitely  no one could say when it would open to tourists again  the trickle of visitors has all but stopped.																								I used to earn Rs 50-60 from every family but have found it difficult to get a decent meal in the past week, an out-of-work guide, Mohan Sil, said. 																								People flock to the museum for a glimpse of the Nobel medallion, the Samurai sword and the casket and various other pieces of memorabilia.... There is hardly anything now.																								The 70-odd hotels here have had virtually no guest, save the reporter or the government official. Occupancy is a steady 40 per cent in the off-season, manager of Manasi Lodge Prabir Banerjee said. Today, I do not have a single guest. 																								At Ma Sarada, there are two families. Both have someone studying in Visva-Bharati. If the king loses his crown (read medal), can the kingdom survive? the manager asked.

 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Relief for Nanoor seven
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, March 17: Calcutta High Court today expressed dissatisfaction over the delay in resuming the trial of the Nanoor massacre by a Suri court and asked police to release seven of the 77 accused in the case who have been behind bars for the last four years. 																								While granting bail to the seven, Justice G.C. De said it was clear the trial would not begin in the near future. 																								The 70 other accused, reported to be CPM supporters, have obtained bail from the trial court. According to the lawyer of the seven accused, his clients were not allowed to go out of jail only because they were supporters of the Trinamul Congress. 																								Eleven Trinamul activists were massacred allegedly by a mob organised by the CPM on July 27, 2000, at Puskarhat under Nanoor police station in Birbhum. 																								After the incident, two separate FIRs were filed in the police station accusing 81 persons. While four are absconding, the remaining 77 people were arrested. Of them, 70 were granted bail and the seven, reputed to be Trinamul workers in the village, remained in prison. 																								As the Suri court failed to resume the trial, the seven filed several bail pleas. But the government opposed them, saying the trial will begin soon. 																								Two months ago a similar petition was made before a division bench of the high court. Justice .A. Chowdhury slammed the state government and remarked that it was deliberately causing a delay in resumption of the trial. The division bench directed the Suri court to complete the trial as early as possible. 																								As the months passed again without any action, the seven accused moved a fresh petition before the high court, pointing out that its previous order had not been carried out. As the Suri court was yet to resume the trial, they prayed that they be allowed to go out on bail. 																								Advocate Tapas Ghosh told the court his clients were supporters of the Trinamul Congress and that was reason enough for the authorities to slap false charges on them and put them behind bars. This is also one of the key factors delaying the trial, he said.																								Public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah argued that the 70 accused, now on bail, would otherwise have had to be brought to the court during the trial. It has become an impossible task to bring all of them to court at a time to resume the trial, he said. Student suicide																								Sabyasachi Das, a Class XII student of Hare School, who was to appear for the Higher Secondary Examination this year, committed suicide at his Cossipore residence by hanging himself from the ceiling on Wednesday night. Police said he was depressed as his preparations were not going well.

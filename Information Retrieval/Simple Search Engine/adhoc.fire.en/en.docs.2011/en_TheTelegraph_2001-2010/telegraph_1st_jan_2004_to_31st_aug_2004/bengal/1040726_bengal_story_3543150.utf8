The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Mamata plays judiciary crusader 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, July 25: Mamata Banerjee today claimed that the bandh she has called on August 2 is aimed at protecting the independence of the judiciary. 																								I dont understand why any court will be offended by the bandh because we want to preserve the judiciarys independence, the Trinamul Congress chief said. 																								The tone sounded mellow after yesterdays come what may cry. I will be happy to go to jail for calling the bandh, she had said. 																								Bombay High Court has slapped a Rs 20 lakh each fine on the Shiv Sena and the BJP for enforcing a bandh last July. 																								We will stick to our bandh because we are opposing the shalishi bill (the West Bengal Block-level Pre-litigation Conciliation Bill, 2004) which, if implemented, will not allow people to go to the courts. By bringing about the shalishi bill, the CPM is trying to impose its own policy on the rural people. This is one of the most draconian bills being introduced by the ruling communists, she said.																								The state Congress today said it will not actively oppose the bandh because the party is against the proposed bill. 																								We shall neither oppose nor support the bandh. We support the issue on which the bandh has been called. The proposed bill comes in the way of the rural peoples interest. So, our men will not take to the streets to oppose it, defence minister and state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee said after a PCC executive committee meeting. 																								The meeting was convened at Bidhan Bhavan to discuss the partys strategy vis--vis Mamatas bandh, alleged starvation deaths in Amlashol village of West Midnapore and other poverty-ridden areas of Bankura, Purulia, Burdwan and Birbhum districts. 																								Mukherjee demanded that the state government should publish a white paper on the prevailing starvation-like situation in some backward areas of the south Bengal districts. 																								Reacting to the proposed bill, Mukherjee said the existing Lok Adalat system is enough to tackle all kinds of civil disputes. The shalishi bill is, therefore, unnecessary. We demand its immediate withdrawal, he said.

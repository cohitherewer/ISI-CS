The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Iron curtain on abode of peace
 							 - Walls and grilles to come up in Santiniketan, flow of visitors dries up  BAPPA MAJUMDAR AMP; PRONAB MONDAL				 	 A helicopter hovers over Santiniketan on the eve of the Prime Ministers visit. Picture by Amit Datta																								April 1: For Tagore, who wrote (in Achalayatan) Drishti jeno badha na pay (sight be not blocked), this will come as a shock.																								Stung by the sensational heist of the Nobel medal and other memorabilia from the Rabindranath Memorial Museum, Visva-Bharati University has decided to turn Santiniketan into a fortress. High walls will be built around the sprawling campus and iron grilles will stand up to intruders while closed-circuit television sets and other heavy-duty gadgets would keep watch on every movement.																								Although the decision has come as a shock  albeit not as much as the news of the burglary  to Tagores descendants, ashramites, students and everyone associated with the abode of peace, vice-chancellor Sujit Kumar Basu insisted that everything was being done with the best interests of the place in mind.																								We will have more security personnel in place and getting permission for entering the archives (for research, documentary or other films and other work) will obviously become tougher, Basu said. The work on the wall and the grille would soon get under way, he added.																								With the varsity authorities working on preventing another theft, sleuths of multiple agencies busied themselves with unravelling the recent past; not that they met with any great success.																								But officials at Writers Buildings expressed hope. Deputy inspector-general (CID) C.V. Murlidhar met director-general of police Shyamal Datta and told reporters later that he was hopeful of a breakthrough in a few days. Inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee, too, was hopeful. The probe is going in the right direction with some definite clues, he said.																								The CID has detained two persons who deal in gold jewellery from the Rajnagar area.																								CBI sleuths set up an office on the Rabindra Bhavan premises and examined the site of the crime with forensic experts. Joint director of the agency V. Dubey said: We will work on this case together (with the district police and the CID) and are ready to seek help from anyone to get to the bottom of it, he added.																								But Santiniketan is talking about the possible changes. What can wall and fences do to bolster security? asked Patha Bhavan principal Supriya Tagore. 																								Tagore believed in freedom and access to everyone, everywhere, he said. You just cannot change that.																								Gurudev conceived the character of Amal (in Dakghar) looking for the doiwala (curd-seller) sitting at Uttarayan. Nothing obstructed it then, Tagore biographer Prabhat Mukhopadhyays son Supriya Mukhopadhyay said. How can you change all that? he asked. Idols found																								The CBI team today found seven stone idols resembling Ganesh in a corner of Uttarayan. But it has not been established if the idols are part of the memorabilia stolen last week.

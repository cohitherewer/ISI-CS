 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Iskcon monks in property skirmish
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Mayapur, April 4: Monks  of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon)  led by a devotee clashed with shop owners outside the orders  premises last night.																								Eleven people, including seven monks, were injured in the fight that broke out over the construction of a shop on a disputed plot near the temple, about 100 km from Calcutta.																								Police said Uttam Haldar, a devotee who allegedly led the assault, was arrested after the traders complained against him at Nabadwip police station. Haldar was produced at the Nabadwip court this morning. 																								Iskcon is yet to approach the police. We have started a case against some devotees on the basis of complaints from the traders. We have not received any counter complaint from Iskcon, said Pankaj Dutta, the Nadia superintendent of police. 																								He said the trouble began around 9.30 last night when Iskcon devotees tried to prevent some traders from building a shop near the temple gate. They apparently showed court papers that said the work was illegal. The traders were adamant. A clash with the Iskcon devotees ensued, Dutta said.																								The traders said though they had stopped the construction, the Iskcon devotees attacked them with lathis. They ransacked 10 to 15 shops and damaged STD booths in the locality, alleged Pranesh Debnath, a businessman.																								Rabindranath Saha, who runs a hotel, said around 500 people broke the windows of adjacent shops. 																								However, the Iskcon authorities contested the traders version of the incident. They were in no mood to listen to us when we requested them to stop construction. They brought criminals from adjacent areas and attacked us with sharp weapons. Seven of our devotees are now at Saktinagar hospital, said Bedeswar Das, the temples general manager.

Calcutta, March 15: Work on the highway linking Siliguri with Nathu-la, the gateway to China, will resume following a high court order issued today. 																								Justice Subhra Kamal Mukherjee struck down an injunction placed by the court on March 4 following a petition by contractor Ratan Kumar Garg, alleging that a tender awarded to him by the National Highway Authority of India and Siliguri Municipal Corporation was handed to another contractor.																								The improvement of National Highway 31A would facilitate the trade route that lay closed when China did not recognise Sikkim as part of India.

 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 NRS report indicts slap doctor
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 7: Two days after he brutally slapped a pregnant woman, a report recommending action against post-graduate trainee Supratik Basu today reached senior health department officials, who are still undecided on the nature of the punishment. 																								I have received the report, but have not decided what action to take, said director of medical education C.R. Maiti. 																								For the second day in a row, Basu was barred from attending to patients in the gynaecology ward of NRS Medical College and Hospital, where Sandhya Mondol is recuperating after delivering a boy. 																								Around 11 am on Monday, Sandhya was wheeled into the labour room, where she was slapped by Basu, causing temporary deafness and injuries in her right ear, lips and face. Sandhyas baby weighing 1.6 kg is fighting for his life. 																								Junior doctors affiliated to the SFI are pressuring the hospital authorities to water down the report so that Basu can escape with a light sentence. 																								Principal Purnima Shau Mondol said: We took a lot of things into consideration before drafting our report. 																								During investigations, the three-member probe panel found Basu had got embroiled in controversies in the past, the latest being the attack on some apolitical doctors on the NRS campus. But each time the SFI-affiliated doctors managed to bail him out.																								Sandhyas baby is in an incubator. We are trying hard to save the extremely low birth weight boy, Shau Mondol said.

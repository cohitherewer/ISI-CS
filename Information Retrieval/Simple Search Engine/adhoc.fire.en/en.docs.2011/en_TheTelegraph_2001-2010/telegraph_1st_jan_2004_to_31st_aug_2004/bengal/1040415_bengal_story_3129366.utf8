 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Three sailors saved a day after mishap
 NARESH JANA 																								Midnapore, April 14: Three missing sailors of Genius Star, the Malaysian vessel that sank about 300 km off Haldia port, were rescued today. The captain and the third engineer are still untraced. 																								Coast Guard officials, who have rescued 15 of the 17 crew members with help from three merchant navy ships, are losing hope of rescuing Captain Hwang Hong Hsien and his colleague, Xu Dong. Though they are keeping up a brave front, Coast Guard officials fear they might have gone down with the vessel. 																								Around 9 last morning, the captain had sent an SOS to the Coast Guard in Haldia that his vessel was sinking. But little could be done to save the ship, and around 12.30 pm, it went down with its 6,000-tonne cargo of logs bound for Calcutta port. 																								The rescue operations started soon after and a passing Korean vessel picked up five sailors floating in the sea with life jackets on. By evening, 12 sailors had been rescued. 																								We have not lost hope and we are continuing our efforts to find the missing duo. The vessel, it seems, was old and we are now trying to find out when it was manufactured, said R.K. Wadhwa, the Coast Guard commandant.																								One of the rescued officers, How Hong Ying, said the vessel ran into inclement weather yesterday and the strong ropes holding the logs snapped. One log hit the hull, breaching it. We tried in vain to plug the hole, but it was too big for us to do anything other than put our life jackets on and jump into the sea, Ying said.																								In their hurry, no one saw what the captain did, Wadhwa said. 																								The Coast Guard has warned all ships to steer clear of the accident spot, which is strewn with debris and logs.

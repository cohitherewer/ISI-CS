The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Buddha Assembly poll rival now plays admirer
 A STAFF REPORTERBuddhadeb (top) and Madhabi																								Calcutta, April 11: Three years ago, she was Mamata Banerjees soldier deputed to take on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								Today, actor Madhabi Mukherjee turned to Bhattacharjee for what she described as inspiration to fight the BJP, Mamatas principal ally in Bengal. 																								There is no feel-good despite a countrywide campaign by the (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee government. We are not keeping well at all. Instead, we look up to the chief minister, who can give us directions on how to keep well, Madhabi said this morning. 																								She was sharing dais with Bhattacharjee at a programme organised by the CPM-controlled Paschim Banga Ganatantrik Lekhak Silpi Sangha at Sisir Manch to mobilise support for Left Front candidates in the Lok Sabha elections. 																								Besides Bhattacharjee and Mukherjee, an array of names from film and theatre addressed the gathering.																								Madhabi was invited to speak ahead of Bhattacharjee, who listened with rapt attention, and probably a tinge of fun, the veteran actor bashing the BJP-led coalition at the Centre. 																								She also demanded that the NDA, of which Mamata is a partner, be ousted from power. Only the Left Front can remove it, Madhabi said. The CPM supporters cheered.																								In his turn, Bhattacharjee congratulated Madhabi for telling the truth. Madhabidevi is right. None of us are feeling well. I dont think there is any reason for us to be happy and feel good, Bhattacharjee said. The CPM supporters hollered.																								Go to Durgapur, you will find so many closed factories and thousands of jobless workers. The Vajpayee government has shut down at least three central public sector undertakings. About 2.28 lakh workers are now fighting for survival. Where is the feel-good factor? he asked.																								It is unfortunate that the followers of Nathuram Godse are running the government in Delhi these days. The RSS only intention is to convert India into a Hindu state. The BJP is acting on this hidden agenda. They are not strong enough to translate their dreams into reality....																								As Madhabi listened, Bhattacharjee accused Mamatas party of ushering the BJP into Bengal. The BJP was nowhere in our state. But the Trinamul Congress invited it and helped it strengthen base here.

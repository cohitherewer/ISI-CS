 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Extortion charge on Citu over Falta office 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, May 4: Workers engaged by contractors in the Falta Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in South 24-Parganas, nearly 70 km from Calcutta, today strongly resented forcible collection of subscriptions by local activists of the Citu, the labour arm of the CPM, for building the trade unions new office there. 																								The workers, whose daily wages range between Rs 50 and 100, complained this morning they they are being forced to surrender a days earning to the Citu members. If any one of us fails to pay the subscription, he invariably faces either intimidation or torture from local Citu workers, said Khalil Sheikh, one of the affected workers. 																								We do not get work every day. We get work for a maximum of three to four days a week at the rate of Rs 50 per day. If a worker is compelled to part with a days income, how can he purchase food and other daily necessities for his family members? asked Sheikh. 																								According to Sheikh, if any worker expresses his inability to pay or seeks a reduction in the subscription amount, he is beaten up by Citu activists. Very few of them have the courage to protest against the atrocities as Citu men note down their names when they join work. At the end of the day, when a labourer heads for home with the meagre amount he has earned, he is invariably caught by Citu members who force them to pay the subscription, he said. 																								When local Citu leaders attention was drawn to the plight of the contractors workers, they denied using force to collect the subscriptions. 																								There is no question of forcible collection of subscriptions. We are simply raising funds for building a new office. We have been issuing proper receipts signed by the president and secretary of the Falta Special Economic Zone branch of our union. Everyone has donated money out of his free will and there is no question of extortion, said Suprakash Gupta, district working member of the Citu. He alleged that the Trinamul Congress was trying to make it an issue before the Lok Sabha polls. 																								However, local Trinamul leader Arumoy Gayen said he has received several complaints about forceful collection of subscriptions and reported the matter to the sub-divisional police officer of Diamond Harbour, Mehmood Akhtar. It is surprising that the Citu has not cared to seek permission from the Special Economic Zone authorities for constructing its office here, he said. 																								When contacted, Akhtar admitted having received some complaints regarding forceful collection of subscription from contractors workers. We are now examining the matter and will be able to tell you when the investigation is complete, he added.

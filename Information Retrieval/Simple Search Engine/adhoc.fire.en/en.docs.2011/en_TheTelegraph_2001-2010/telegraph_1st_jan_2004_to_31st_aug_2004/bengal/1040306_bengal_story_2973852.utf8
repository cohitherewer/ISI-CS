 OUR BUREAU																								Midnapore/Chinsurah, March 5: A Madhyamik candidate today finished the test and went to attend the funeral of her father who had dropped her off at the Chandrakona centre just before the examination started.																								Tanusree Kars father was crushed by a speeding bus when he was cycling home after dropping his 16-year-old daughter at Ramjibanpur Babulal Institute on the first day of the examination. Tanusree is a student of Sandhiput Netajinagar High School in Chandrakona, 180 km from Calcutta.																								Kalipada Kar, 45, was cycling home along Arambagh-Khirpai road when a bus travelling at high speed hit him from the rear, police said. He died on the spot.																								Residents of the locality raised an alarm and personnel of the Khirpai police outpost intercepted the bus half a kilometre away. The bus driver has been arrested. The police have taken the body for post-mortem.																								Additional superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the bus was heading towards Mayapur in Nadia with tourists. 																								Some persons at the accident site, who were also parents of Madhyamik examinees from the same school, identified Kalipada, an employee at a co-operative society. They told police from the outpost that Kalipadas daughter was appearing for the examination and gave them his address.																								Kalipadas elder daughter, Banasree, is a candidate for the higher secondary examination that begins next month.

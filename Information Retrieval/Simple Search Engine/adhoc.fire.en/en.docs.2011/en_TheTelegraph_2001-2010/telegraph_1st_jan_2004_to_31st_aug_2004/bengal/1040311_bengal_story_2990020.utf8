 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 SC monitor punches govt on tea deaths 
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, March 10: The seven-member team of the Indian Peoples Tribunal (IPT), which is probing charges of starvation deaths in the closed and abandoned tea estates of the Dooars on the instruction of the Supreme Court, today accused the government of falsely denying knowledge of such deaths. 																								The governments attempt to start developmental schemes in the estates only after being prodded by the apex court more than a year after the gardens stopped operations also came under fire. 																								The team, which arrived here last Saturday, spent the past three days visiting the closed gardens and hearing and recording the statements of planters, representatives of trade unions and NGOs, workers and the district administration.																								Justice Hosbet Suresh, the leader of the team and a retired judge of Bombay High Court, said: In the course of investigation, we found that the government did nothing to mitigate the workers problems until the Supreme Court instructed it to do so. The government should play a better role. 																								Samar Nath Chatterjee, member of the IPT panel, said: The government, as instructed by the Supreme Court on January 16, filed an affidavit on January 29 stating that there has been no death due to malnutrition or starvation in the tea gardens.																								On January 16, however, the Coordination Committee of Tea Plantation Workers, an apex body of trade unions, had submitted a memorandum to the chief minister (Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) in Siliguri, clearly stating that deaths due to malnutrition and starvation were on the rise, he added.																								The district administration, trade unions and planters also came in the firing line for not using their powers to alleviate the woes of the workers of closed and abandoned estates. The panel also advocated cent per cent auction of tea as the only way to weed out middlemen who eat into the profits of the industry.																								Trade unions and the Tea Board have done little to to use their powers to lessen the problems of the workers of the closed gardens Cent per cent auction of tea is essential to prevent middlemen from eating into the profits, said Manash Dasgupta, a panel member.																								The tribunal said it would file a PIL in the Supreme Court after preparing an interim report based on its findings. 																								Harsh Mandar, the IAS officer who started an NGO after the Godhra killings in Gujrat, is also in the team.

 AMIT UKIL Purulia, Jan. 18: Misconceptions  about AIDS have led to a partial boycott of a village in  the Kenda police station area of Purulia, with inflamed  reports in local newspapers worsening the situation.																								The ostracisation of Dhoboni village, 19 km from here, was sparked off by the death of Duryadhan Mahato on January 7. His family had learnt that he had been infected with HIV. Other residents of the village heard of it a week before the 30-year-olds death.																								Comments heralding the boycott started doing the rounds once the news spread to the adjacent villages. 																								Wash the glasses with boiling water, they are from that village, said the owner of a stall in Noyagarh, 2 km from Dhoboni, after two youths from that village had tea there.																								When a Dhoboni resident boarded a bus for Jamshedpur, the conductor initially refused him entry. After much persuasion, the man was given a corner seat at the back.																								Duryadhan left his village in his teens, said elder brother Ramachandra. In Jamshedpur, he ended up driving a trailer truck. He returned in November, suffering from bouts of diarrhoea and fever. Duryadhan had been to Calcutta, where tests confirmed his HIV status. 																								He was admitted to the Sadar hospital here for two days and finally came home to die, said Ramachandra.																								His wife of a-year-and-eight months was taken to the School of Tropical Medicine for tests, though the Purulia Sadar Hospital has a counselling and testing centre.																								Duryadhans family members and elderly local homeopath Lakhikanta Mahato blamed reports in local newspapers for the situation.																								The reports had said the barber, the washerman and the grocer had stopped visiting the village. People from other villages, the newspapers said, had stopped trading with the residents of Dhoboni.																								There was some initial hesitation by the barber, Phatik Paramanik. But we persuaded him and bought him new razors. He even carried out the ritual shaving of Duryadhans two brothers, said Lakhikanta.																								Some of the boycott reports were exaggerated. The reporter from one paper did not even visit this village, he said. But, after the reports were published, outsiders reduced their visits to Dhoboni. 																								The panchayat leaders and block medical officers of Puncha and Chakaltor are now holding meetings and conducting awareness campaigns in the surrounding villages.

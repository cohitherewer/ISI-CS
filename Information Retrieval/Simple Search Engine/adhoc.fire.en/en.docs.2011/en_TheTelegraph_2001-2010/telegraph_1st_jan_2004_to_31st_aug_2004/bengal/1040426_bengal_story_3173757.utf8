 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Chief judge nod to more courts
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 25: The chief justice assured representatives of three lawyers bodies tonight that their demands would be met and appeared to have averted a boycott of his court.																								Representatives of the Bar Association, the Bar Library Club and the Incorporate Law Society met Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court A.K. Mathur this evening.																								The association had called for a boycott of his court from Tuesday to press for various demands, including improving the amenities in the high court building and setting up more appeal courts. 																								The demand for more appeal courts was discussed today. The chief justice apparently agreed to set up more writ appeal courts. At the moment, there is one such court presided by the chief justice himself.																								After the meeting, general secretary of the Bar Library Club Shibdas Banerjee said there is no reason now to stand by the boycott call. 																								However, association president Sardar Amzad Ali said a general meeting of its members tomorrow would decide whether it should be called off.																								Once informed about the boycott threat, Chief Justice Mathur inspected for himself the problems that lawyers, litigants and clerks were allegedly facing in the high court building. 																								After inspecting the building with senior officials, he announced among other things that toilets would be renovated, pure drinking water would be made available and a room would be allocated for members of the Bar Association. Visva-Bharati																								Four members of the committee set up by Visva-Bharati University to suggest ways to beef up security on the campus arrived in Santiniketan today. 																								Four others on the panel, who are from the varsity, have already started working on the report. The committee was constituted following the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal and other memorabilia last month.

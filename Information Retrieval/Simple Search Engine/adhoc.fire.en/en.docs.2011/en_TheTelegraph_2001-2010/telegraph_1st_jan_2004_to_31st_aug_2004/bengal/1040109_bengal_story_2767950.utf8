 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Bangla link to fake notes ring
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Jan. 8: Sleuths from the Criminal Investigation Department and district police have stumbled upon a fake currency racket that allegedly has its roots in Bangladesh.																								Raids at Purbasthali here, 200 km from Calcutta, and Krishnagar and Santipur in Nadia, both about 80 km from the city, have led to the arrest of five people in the past two days and the recovery of Rs 46,000 in fake notes. One of those arrested is a Bangladeshi citizen.																								 The police said the forged notes came from Bangladesh in phases and expressed fear that thousands of them may be in circulation already. A search is on for the rackets kingpin.																								We arrested Arai Sheikh, suspected to be a key member of the gang, last evening. He had come to Bibirhat at Purbasthali, which borders Nadia, to buy two buffaloes. Sheikh paid 88 Rs 100 notes for the buffaloes. All the notes were fake. The buffalo dealers doubted the notes as they were new, crisp and minus the thin strip in the middle. Local traders confined him and called the police, said Burdwan superintendent K.C. Meena.																								On the basis of information provided by Arai, the police raided several places last night.																								The Bangladeshi, Khurshed Alam, was arrested on Tuesday evening when he tried to pass on a fake Rs 50 note to a betel shop owner at Santipur in Nadia. The police recovered about 20,000 fake Rs 50 notes from him. The police said Khurshed was a resident of Mailberia in Bangladesh. 																								The CID, too, had been investigating fake note rackets and joined the police in the raids last night. A joint team swooped down on several places in Krishnagar. Qutubuddin Sheikh was arrested from Bangalji village and false notes of Rs 50 and Rs 100 denomination to the tune of Rs 30,000 was found on him. Jamaluddin Sheikh and Mintu Mondal were later picked up from from Bangalji and the Krishnagar Kotwali area.																								Qutubuddin told us during interrogation that Bangalji was a centre for stocking fake notes, which were supplied to Burdwan and Nadia through agents. About 10 days ago, Qutubuddin and Jamaluddin had smuggled Rs 60,000 in fake notes. We recovered Rs 46,000, said an official.																								Inspector-in-charge of Krishnagar Kotwali police station Shanti Chowdhury, said the racket with deep roots in Bangladesh was active for quite some time.

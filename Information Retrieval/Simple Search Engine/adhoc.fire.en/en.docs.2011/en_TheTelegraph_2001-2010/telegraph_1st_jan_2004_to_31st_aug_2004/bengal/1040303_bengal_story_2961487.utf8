 KUHELI CHAKRAVORTY																								Siliguri, March 2: Eight people were duped into buying the same property, spanning 6 cottahs near the highway, by a real estate agent who ran away with nearly Rs 70 lakh before the last buyer blew the whistle on the fraud. 																								Thirty-two-year-old Uttam Pal was having a ball till his last victim, Asit Kumar Basu, sniffed a rat and conducted a search of the land deeds to know the status of the property.																								Basu had paid his agent Rs 8 lakh as instalment on February 15, a day before the registration of the house. As he waited the next day at the land registration office, Pal did not turn up. A search of the land deeds revealed that the single-storey house was registered under eight different names with the land registration department. 																								After three days of futile attempts to contact Pal, I went to Bhaktinagar police station on February 18, said Basu. Several other duped buyers followed suit. The police said Pal was assisted by wife Bulal, brother Amol and friend Gopal Mahato. 																								The resident of Palnagar on the outskirts of Siliguri is now absconding, the police said.

 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Ghost school duo in court
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 13: A high court judge today asked the education department why it had not paid salaries to two teachers appointed by the School Service Commission (SSC) to a school that does not exist.																								Tapas Mondal and Vijan Sikdar moved court when they were not paid even once since being appointed three years ago to a non-existent North Dinajpur school.																								Justice S.K. Mukherjee has asked the education department to provide the duo jobs at some other school in two months. The court also sought a report from the department on the North Dinajpur school and asked how the SSC appointed teachers there.																								In their petition, Mondal and Sikdar said SSCs north zone selected them in August 2001 to teach at DSG Junior High School at Dumuria. Both of us went to Dumuria but there was neither a school building nor any student. However, we later discovered that a man who claimed to be the school secretary was present. We recorded with him our joining and returned home, they said.																								Their lawyer told the court that they were not paid salary and the SSC and education officials would not let know why.																								Justice Mukherjee had earlier asked the directorate of school education to file a report on the schools status. But instead of filing a report, the director told the court that the secretary of the education department could provide more information.																								When the court asked the departmental secretary to file a report on the school, he submitted an affidavit saying the secondary education board had been asked to cancel its registration. But the court was not satisfied. 																								The judge said the demand for the duos salary arrears was justified and expressed surprise about the SSC recruitment for ghost schools.

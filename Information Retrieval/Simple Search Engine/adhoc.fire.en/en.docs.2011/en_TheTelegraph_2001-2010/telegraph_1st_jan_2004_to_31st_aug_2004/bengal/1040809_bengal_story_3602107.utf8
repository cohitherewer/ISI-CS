 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Mamata and Anil: jabs to gesture 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 8: Mamata Banerjee today averted a possible showdown with the CPM by putting off a Trinamul Congress law violation on September 1, when the Marxists will rally for world peace in the heart of the city.																								It is a courtesy we have shown to the ruling communists by deferring the law-violation programme. I want the CPM to reciprocate in future, Mamata said tonight.																								The CPM brass could not help praising Mamata for once. State party secretary Anil Biswas said: It is good that she (Mamata) has changed the date of her law-violation programme. I also want her to change her mind. There is no reason for law violation at the moment.																								However, Trinamul will go ahead with the programme on September 6.																								Biswas said: Even non-political people know that the Left parties observe Anti-war Day on September 1, but the Trinamul leaders were probably unaware about it and called the law-violation programme. I am happy that they have changed the date.																								However, sources in Trinamul said Mamata deferred the law violation more out of fear of a poor turnout than courtesy towards her arch rivals. Who will dare join a law violation when the CPM has announced a peace rally. We didnt want our rally to be lacklustre, said a Trinamul leader.																								Mamata was peeved with the CPM rally in favour of the block-level pre-litigation conciliation board bill on August 2, the day she had called a 12-hour bandh in protest against the proposed legislation. She had planned to get even with the CPM by organising the agitation on September 1, when the Left Front had lined up an Esplanade rally. 																								However, if the postponement was indeed a show of political courtesy, it was not a first from Mamata. When Jyoti Basus wife died, she went to Indira Bhavan and then to the crematorium. 																								A Trinamul source said the party does not want a confrontation with the CPM now. We are maintaining a low profile since the jolt in the Lok Sabha elections. The turnout in the CPM rally was likely to be much bigger than ours.

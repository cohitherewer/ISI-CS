 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 UGC seeks college status reports
 MITA MUKHERJEE																								Calcutta, May 16: The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked Calcutta University to furnish details of the infrastructure at the undergraduate colleges affiliated to it.																								However, CU is not the only one. The UGC circular says all universities across the country are required to provide information on the number of teachers in colleges under them, sanctioned teaching posts and the number of part-timers at work. 																								A department-wise break-up of the number of students and the status of affiliation of the colleges have also been sought. Calcutta University has been asked to confirm how many colleges are being run on temporary affiliations. A UGC official said the move is part of a nationwide drive to review conditions in the colleges registered with it.																								We have sent a circular to all universities asking them to start collecting information from the colleges. The universities are expected to send their reports as soon as they finish, said Ratnabali Banerjee, an official of the UGCs regional office. 																								Calcutta University officials feel collecting and collating such detailed information on its 200-odd affiliated colleges would be additional work. We have not received the circular yet but it would be a troublesome job. The UGC has not sought such information in several years, said Shyamal Kumar Sarkar, secretary, CU undergraduate council. 																								Sources in the higher education department said the UGC had last directed universities to provide information on colleges in the mid-1980s. 																								However, given that the last review was held about 20 years ago, the UGC felt it essential to update the information, especially in view of the increasing demand among students for new courses.

Purulia, May 6: Air force helicopters will ferry poll personnel in the region bracing for the May 10 elections in the shadow of a Naxalite scare.																								Personnel for several booths in Bandwan, Joypur and Jhalda blocks of Purulia and many others in West Midnapore would be airlifted from the block offices to the polling stations to escape landmines and assault.																								The Peoples War and the Maoist Communist Centre have been active in parts of Purulia, West Midnapore and Bankura over the past year. Several security personnel have been killed in ambushes and landmine explosions since October when the officer-in-charge of Bandwan was killed.

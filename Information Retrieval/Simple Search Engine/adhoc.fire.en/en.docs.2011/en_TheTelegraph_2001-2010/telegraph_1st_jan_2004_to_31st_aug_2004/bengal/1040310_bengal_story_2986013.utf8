 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Basu tells cadre to unite in Dum Dum
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, March 9: Jyoti Basu today pleaded with party members to bury differences to ensure a CPM win in the Dum Dum Lok Sabha seat.																								Addressing a party meeting at Belghoria, Basu emphasised hard work to ensure the BJPs defeat. 																								Tapan Sikdar had triumphed in the constituency, once dubbed a CPM stronghold, twice in a row, thanks to alleged divisions in the CPM ranks.																								Basu told the cadre this evening: Sink your differences and put up a united fight so that we can retrieve the seat from the BJP. 																								Last month, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee addressed his first election meeting at the Dum Dum Central Jail ground. Going by indications, it is clear that the CPM is serious in its efforts to wrest the seat. 																								The CPM leadership had admitted in a post-poll survey that factionalism and sabotage were two major reasons behind the defeat of its nominee in Dum Dum in 1999. Sikdar had then bagged maximum votes in the Belgachhia East Assembly segment, which is represented by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. 																								The transport minister had faced flak within the party after the polls. The CPM candidate from Dum Dum this time, Amitava Nandi, is known to be anti-Chakraborty.

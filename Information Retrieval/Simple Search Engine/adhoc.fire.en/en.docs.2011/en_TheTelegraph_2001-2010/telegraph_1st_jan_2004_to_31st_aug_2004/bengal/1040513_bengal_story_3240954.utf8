 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Father vs son over daughter
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, May 12: Dhananjoy Maity thought he was being practical. When his daughter-in-law delivered three daughters  sisters to three children, two of them twins  he gave away one to a childless couple. 																								But his son, Kartick, a rickshaw-puller in Basanti, South 24-Paraganas, is furious. He has lodged a complaint with the police against Dhananjoy and the nursing home. 																								Kartick said in his complaint his father had no right to give away one of his daughters. He also said the nursing home had no right to allow it. Kartick has demanded that his father trace and bring back his daughter immediately, said an official of Basanti police station. 																								Dhananjoy is unrepentant. Who will feed them? My son earns a meagre sum by pulling a cycle-rickshaw. I think I have done the right thing, he said. 																								A spokesman at the nursing home said the clinic had no role in the matter. It was the babys grandfather who gave her away. We are in no way involved or responsible, he said.

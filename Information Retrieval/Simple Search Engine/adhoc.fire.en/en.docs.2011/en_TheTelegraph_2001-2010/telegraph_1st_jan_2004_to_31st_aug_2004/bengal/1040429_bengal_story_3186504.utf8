The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Crash children lie in neglect, families seethe
 KUHELI CHAKRAVORTY				 	 The mattresses where the injured children lay. A Telegraph picture 																								Sushrutanagar, April 28: Angry at the authorities apathy towards children injured in yesterdays bus crash, relatives all but assaulted the superintendent of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital this morning.																								Policemen from an adjacent outpost lathi-charged the mob and drove it out of the premises in the nick of time to save J.B. Saha.																								Sadhan Chettri, 15, succumbed to his injuries today. Three others were said to be unconscious.																								A few hundred people had converged on the hospital to see the children, many of whom were made to lie in a stinking corridor for hours. 																								Twenty-six children had been admitted to the hospital. About 30 others were denied beds. The hospital authorities claimed that they had been released after first-aid but the relatives were refusing to take them home.																								Out of about 40 children referred to the hospital by government clinics in Jalpaiguri, Binnaguri and Banarhat, half-a-dozen got admission. The rest lay in the corridor. 																								The children were going to school to collect their results when a passenger train hit their bus at an unmanned level-crossing. Three boys and the drivers helper died on the spot. 																								Suman Thapa, whose sister was among those injured, today said: There is no food, medicine or even drinking water (at the hospital).																								Some of the relatives also alleged that the authorities were not letting them take the children away. They would not let us take our patient anywhere else for treatment. Nor would they let us procure medicines from outside. We are helpless. They are doing nothing, said Sabir Ali, who was desperately trying to get a release order for his brother Sadique. 																								Even those admitted were allegedly not provided drinking water. There isnt a drop for the patients. The hospital staff members told us to collect water from the tap at the toilet, which is hot, the relatives said.																								Four hours after Sadhans death, his uncle was waiting with the body for the formalities to be over.																								The hospital employees said they are waiting for the police to complete the paraphernalia. We wanted to take the body back to Diana Tea Estate in Jalpaiguri for funeral but it seems impossible now. The authorities said no postmortem would be conducted after 4 pm, said Ganesh Sharma.																								Saha brushed aside the charges. No written complaint has come to me yet. What you are talking about? Twenty-six patients are admitted at this hospital and we are treating them to the best of our capacity, he said. 																								Some of the relatives gave Saha a chase down the corridor. He managed to run into his room and lock it from inside.

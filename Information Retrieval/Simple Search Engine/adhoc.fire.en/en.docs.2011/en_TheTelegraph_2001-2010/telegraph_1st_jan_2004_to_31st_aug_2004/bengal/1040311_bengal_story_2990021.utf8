 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Medical college hope for Malda 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, March 10: The government is planning to set up a medical college in Malda with assistance available under the medical education expansion scheme funded by the World Bank. 																								Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra told the Assembly a proposal has been sent to the Centre requesting it to take up the matter with the global donor agency. 																								The World Bank used to provide funds for different projects, including improvement of health services. Now, they have introduced a scheme for improvement of medical education. To avail of this opportunity, we have planned to set up a new medical college at Malda. Once we obtain a green signal from the World Bank, we will work out the detailed report, Mishra said. 																								Immediately after the announcement, the Opposition Congress and the Trinamul Congress threw uncomfortable questions at Mishra about the governments failure to set up a single medical college in the state during its long tenure. 																								Mishra said the government has been exploring all possibilities to set up new medical colleges and nursing institutions as well as increase seats for post-graduate courses. 																								But we have certain limitations. The government cannot set up medical institutions or increase intake in the existing colleges without approval from the Medical Council of India (MCI). You know we are waiting for more than a year to get the MCI approval for setting up undergraduate medical colleges in Midnapore and at SSKM hospital in Calcutta, he said. The MCI has given the letter of intent on setting up colleges, but did not give the final approval, he added. 																								The minister pointed out that the government has set up a dental college at Sodepur in North 24-Parganas and introduced post-graduate courses in nursing and pharmacy. 																								Health department officials said if the MCI approves the Midnapore and SSKM proposals, the state government would have to bear the cost. But if approval for the proposed Malda college is obtained from Delhi, the funds would come from the World Bank. 																								Apart from Malda, there is a proposal for setting up a medical college in the city with private funds.  Privilege motion 																								The Speaker rejected a privilege motion brought against the chief minister by leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee of the Trinamul Congress over his comments that the party had secret links with the Peoples War.

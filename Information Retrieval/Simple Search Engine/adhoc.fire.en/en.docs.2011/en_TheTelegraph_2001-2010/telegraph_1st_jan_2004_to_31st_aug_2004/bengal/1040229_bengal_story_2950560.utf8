 Sunday, February 29, 2004 				 Train collision toll rises
 MEHEDI HEDAYTULLAH AND SAROJ SINHA																								Kanki (North Dinajpur), Feb. 28: The toll in last evenings collision between the Kanchenjunga Express and a minibus rose to 11 with 25-year-old Avdish Ram Rishi succumbing to injuries at the MGM Medical College and Hospital at Kishengunj this morning.																								Hospital authorities said the toll in the accident at an unmanned railway crossing near NH 31 could rise as the condition of 10 persons is extremely critical. Most of the 40 injured have sustained wounds on their heads and upper parts of their bodies, hospital sources said.																								Ten people had died when the Guwahati-bound train hit the bus packed with members of two marriage parties returning to Purnea in Bihar. Eight people travelling in the bus, which was flung to the left of the speeding train, died on the spot. Rescue operations ended early this morning, but the struggle to save the lives of those injured in the mishap continues in the hospital.																								We may shift some of the injured to Calcutta and the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital if their condition does not improve in the next few hours. Our college students have already donated blood for the victims, said Dr Dilip Kumar Jaswal, chief administrator of MGM Medical College.																								The Katihar divisions railway safety commissioner, Balbir Singh, has ordered an inquiry into the incident. Senior railway officials today said the fault lay with the bus driver. Some of those who were on the bus today alleged that the driver was drunk and that the vehicle was travelling at break-neck speed.																								We had repeatedly requested the driver to slow down, but he did not heed our plea. He must have overlooked the approaching railway crossing altogether, recounted Tiku Rishi, 25.																								Residents of the area demanded that the railway ensure no such accident occurs in future. We have three schools near the unmanned crossing. Who would guarantee the safety of our children? asked Majlishpur resident Tapan Biswas when the Katihar divisional railway manager reached the spot this morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Mamata stir threat over coal base shift
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 30: Mamata Banerjee today threatened to launch a statewide agitation in protest against the proposed shifting of Coal Indias headquarters from Calcutta to Ranchi.																								The Trinamul Congress chief will leave for Delhi tomorrow. She will meet Chief Election Commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy and inform him how the CPM-led Left Front rigged the polls in Bengal.																								Mamata came down heavily on coal minister Sibu Sorens plan to shift Coal Indias headquarters.																								I have very good personal relations with Sibu Soren, but we will simply not allow it. The infrastructure of Coal India that has developed in Calcutta over the years should not be removed from here. The move is unjust and improper, she said.																								Mamata said Trinamul workers would demonstrate in front of the Coal India headquarters here tomorrow to press for withdrawal of Sorens statement. She, however, parried a question on whether she would call a bandh in support of her demand.																								I want to ask Soren, can we demand the shifting of central undertaking offices from Jharkhand to Bengal? A hasty step should not be taken only with an eye on the vote bank, said Mamata.																								She also alleged that there was a conspiracy to shift the head office of another central PSU, Hindustan Copper Limited, from here. We will not allow any move to shift any infrastructure from Bengal, she said.																								Mamatas critics in the party, however, said she was fighting a losing battle. Senior CPM leaders at the national level have already objected to Sorens plans.																								So, when the Leftists are supporting the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre and have heavily influenced the common minimum programme, it can be said that no step will be taken on this score without the sanction or approval of the communists, a Trinamul functionary said.																								All-India Citu president M.K. Pandhe opposed Sorens move here today. We will take up the matter with the Centre, he said. 																								CPM central committee member Somnath Chatterjee said in Bolpur that he would appeal to Soren to abandon his plans.																								In another development, Mamata appointed Nirbed Roy, MLA, as the new Trinamul spokesman. She also appointed legislator Ratna Nag as the chief of the Trinamul womens wing in place of councillor Mala Roy.																								Madan Mitra will take over as the president of the Trinamuls youth wing, replacing Sanjoy Bakshi. Bakshi will contest as the partys nominee for the Assembly by-poll in Jorabagan following Sudhanshu Seals electoral victory from Calcutta North-west. 																								Sultan Ahmed takes over as the chairman of the partys minority cell and Radhika Ranjan Pramanick has been appointed chairman of the panchayat cell.

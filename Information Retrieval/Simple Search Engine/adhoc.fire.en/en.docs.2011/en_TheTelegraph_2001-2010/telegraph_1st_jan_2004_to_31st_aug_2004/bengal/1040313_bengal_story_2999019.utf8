 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 HC greenflags fun park in Santiniketan
 OUR LEGAL REPORTERCalcutta, March 12: The high court today approved the construction of an amusement park in Santiniketan. 																								The park had become mired in controversy as a clutch of eminent authors, film-makers, actors, artistes and painters said it would pollute the university town, spoil its serenity and destroy its ecology.																								A bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee today heard the petition filed by author-social activist Mahasweta Devi and 46 others alleging that the Sreeniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority had handed over a large plot at Lahabandh to a private promoter for the park.																								In its interim order, the court allowed the construction after the authority submitted that the park would not encroach on the Lahabandh lake.																								The petitioners, including actor Soumitra Chatterjee, film-maker Aparna Sen, film critic Chidananda Dasgupta, singer Suchitra Mitra and painter Jogen Chowdhury, had alleged that the park was being built by filling up parts of the water body.																								They argued that the authoritys move was against the cultural environment of Rabindranath Tagores abode of peace and would tell on the ecological balance of the area. The petition had prayed for a court order preventing the promoter from constructing the park.																								Appearing for the authority, Anindya Mitra told the court: We will not allow any one to destroy the environment. You can record my submission that no encroachment will be made on the water body during the construction of the park.																								Mitra said the authority had no interest other than promoting tourism in Santiniketan. The proposed park will attract tourists from across the country and abroad, he claimed.																								After hearing the arguments, the chief justice remarked that the construction of the entertainment park would increase the tourists attraction to Santiniketan. He wanted to know from the petitioners why they were opposing the venture.																								A large number of people were in the courtroom when the case came up for hearing today. It will be heard again six weeks later.

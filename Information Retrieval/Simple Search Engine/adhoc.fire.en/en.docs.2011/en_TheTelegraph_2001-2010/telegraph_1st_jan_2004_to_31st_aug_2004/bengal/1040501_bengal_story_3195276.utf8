The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Petitioner behind bars in bid to frame top cop
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 30: The high court today sent a petitioner to jail for trying to implicate a superintendent of police in a land-grab case.																								The court charged Narendra Kalyania with distorting facts and framing South 24-Parganas superintendent of police D.K. Ganguly.																								Justice Barin Ghosh also fined the petitioner Rs 50,000. The money will be deposited in the bank account of the police officer. Not just that, Kalyania will also have to pay Rs 1,000 each to four respondents whom he had made parties to the case.																								Kalyania had alleged last week that a group of hooligans was trying to grab his land at Bishnupur, about 40 km from Calcutta, at Gangulys behest.																								He had complained to the court that the local police station was not agreeing to register a case against the culprits despite repeated requests. The district police chief, Kalyania had alleged, was also refusing to initiate action against the trespassers.																								On the basis of the petition, the court had passed an interim order asking the officer-in-charge of Bishnupur police station not to allow the alleged culprits, including the superintendent, to enter Kalyanis plot.																								The court had virtually asked the officer-in-charge to keep watch on his boss movements in the area. 																								After hearing the arguments today, Justice Ghosh held that the allegation against the Ganguly was baseless and motivated. The SP (superintendent) against whom unjust and reckless allegations were made shall be paid a cost of Rs 50,000 by the petitioner, the judge said. 																								Justice Ghosh also observed that Kalyania had suppressed facts and was not the actual owner of the land. 																								The land is not possessed by the petitioner and he did not go to Bishnupur police station to lodge any diary, Justice Ghosh said, dismissing the writ petition.																								Holding the petitioner guilty, Justice Ghosh called for the high court deputy sheriff and asked him to arrest Kalyania. Picked up from the courtroom, he was sent behind the bars. 																								Ganguly was glad that truth prevailed.

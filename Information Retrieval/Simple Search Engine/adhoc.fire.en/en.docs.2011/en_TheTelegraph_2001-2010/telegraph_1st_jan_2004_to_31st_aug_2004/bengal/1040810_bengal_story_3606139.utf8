 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Aug. 9: The brute majority the CPM enjoys in the South Dum Dum Municipality is posing a problem for its North 24-Parganas district leadership in selecting members of the chairman-in-council. 																								The party has retained Sreehir Bhattacharjee as chairman, but is yet to form the board as there are several claimants to the six posts of members of the chairman-in-council. 																								In the 35-member municipal body, the CPM has 28 members, the RSP and the CPI two each, while one seat went to another Left Front partner, Forward Bloc. Among the Opposition parties, the Trinamul Congress and the Congress won one seat each in the polls held on May 16. 																								Bhattacharjee took oath as the municipalitys chairman on July 24 but could not nominate the other members of the board due to differences among the party commissioners. 																								We are discussing the issue with other Left Front partners and hope to finalise the matter very soon, presumably by the end of this month, Bhattacharjee said in reply to questions about the delay. 																								Several members have put much in stake for a slot on the board and are unwilling to settle for anything less. 																								A CPM functionary, Kajal Guha, had resigned as secretary of local committee number four to contest the municipal elections with the fond hope of becoming a board member. She won from ward 16. 																								Rabi Sarkar, secretary of another local committee and a former member of the chairman-in-council, did not contest this time. But his wife Anindita romped home from ward 13 a a CPM candidate. Now Sarkar, as well as some local CPM functionaries, are lobbying for her inclusion in the new chairman-in-council. 																								Rathin Dutta and Jana Sarkar, two other CPM commissioners, are also believed to be aspirants. 																								The inordinate delay in constituting the municipal board is affecting work in some departments. Building plans are not being sanctioned and mutations of many buildings have also been held up, a senior municipality official said.

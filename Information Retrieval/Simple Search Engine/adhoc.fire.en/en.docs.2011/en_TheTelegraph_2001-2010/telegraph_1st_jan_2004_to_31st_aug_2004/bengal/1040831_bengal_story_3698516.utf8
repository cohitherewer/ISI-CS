 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Sinha secures bail, at last
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER		 Sinha: Third time luckyCalcutta, Aug. 30: After 68 days in custody, former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Dilip Sinha secured bail from the high court today on health grounds. He will be released from Bolpur jail tomorrow.																								Sinha was arrested from his Ballygunge home on June 24 for allegedly attesting fake certificates of Mukti Deb, who was appointed lecturer of applied math at Visva-Bharati during his tenure as vice-chancellor. Arrested two days before Sinha, Deb is in jail custody.																								Sinha sought the bail today saying he ought to be released for better treatment. On two earlier occasions, the same division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice Pranab Kumar Deb had rejected his petition.																								The court accepted the argument of Sinhas counsels that lack of medical facilities at Bolpur in Birbhum district was affecting his health. 																								The judges said: Considering the long duration of the petitioners stay in jail, we are allowing his prayer.																								Moving the bail petition, lawyers Jaymalya Bagchi and Kallol Mondal alleged that after having failed to chargesheet Sinha within 60 days of arrest the investigators brought a fresh charge to keep him behind bars for another month. 																								First, Sinha was charged with allowing a lecturer to get a job at Visva-Bharati, where he was vice-chancellor. That could not keep him behind bars for more than 60 days without a chargesheet being filed. When the investigating agencies could not prove their charge, they brought a fresh charge showing him as a co-accused along with Mukti Deb, who allegedly withdrew government money by furnishing fake documents, Bagchi said.																								The lawyer added that Sinha underwent bypass surgery a year ago. He needs specialised medical care, which the Bolpur jail authorities have failed to provide.

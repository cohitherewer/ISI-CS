The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 CPM moves into poll mode
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Jan. 11: With the Lok Sabha elections round the corner, the CPM brass has instructed leaders to gear up the organisational network.																								The zonal and district committees have been asked to settle disputes within the party in a month. We have decided to gear up the organisation right from the grassroots so that we can win more seats this time, Jyoti Basu said tonight.																								The former chief minister said he would attend the four-day politburo and central committee meetings in Hyderabad beginning January 28. The meetings assume great significance this time as we will have to decide our electoral strategy. Our main objective is to ensure the defeat of the BJP and its allies, said Basu, now a politburo member.																								He added that the party would extend issue-based support to the Congress. We shall have to decide our strategy in the wake of the coalition politics being propounded by the BJP and the Congress, Basu said. 																								(Party general secretary Harkishen Singh) Surjeet has already discussed the issue with Sonia Gandhi. We are keeping a watch on the developments and will take a decision after the Hyderabad meeting, he added. 																								Aware of the possible impact of Mamata Banerjee bagging the Union coal and mines portfolio, the CPM has asked its Burdwan unit to stem dissent within and speed up development work in the Asansol-Ranigunge coal belt.																								Trinamul is the main Opposition party despite its steady erosion in some areas. But there is no complacency and we will have to fight her tooth and nail, said a key CPM functionary. 																								As part of its electoral strategy, the CPM has asked its units to reach out to the villagers and hear their grievances. We have to hold meetings in almost every household in all the villages across the state and listen to the problems the people face. We have to unveil our plans before the villagers and at the same time admit failures, state party secretary Anil Biswas told a meeting at Alimuddin Street on Friday.																								The CPM today ruled out any immediate downsizing of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees ministry. The party is likely to finalise the names of the ministers to be axed at its meeting on January 21 but insiders said the government will not implement the decision till the elections. Sources said Iva Dey and Nemai Mal from Hooghly and Anju Kar from Burdwan were likely to be dropped.

 Saturday, May 08, 2004 				 Gorkhaland ghost in Ghisingh alliance: CM
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 7: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee perceives a threat to the nations unity in Subash Ghisinghs alliance with the Congress in Darjeeling. 																								A separatist movement demanding Gorkhaland would again raise its head in the Kurseong, Kalimpong and Darjeeling subdivisions if the Congress wins the seat in the hills, the chief minister said at the Calcutta Press Club.																								In a surprise decision, Ghisingh announced on Sunday that the GNLF would back Congress candidate from Darjeeling Dawa Narbula in the May 10 polls. 																								Till then, the CPM was counted among the parties courting the Gorkha leader. The GNLF had boycotted the last three Lok Sabha elections, virtually paving the way for CPM wins.																								Bhattacharjee said: The Congress nominee in Darjeeling has started saying he will raise the demand for a separate land for the Gorkhas in the hills in Parliament if elected to the Lok Sabha. I wonder how the Congress can allow one of its candidates to make such an irresponsible demand.																								He was also convinced that they have a separate game plan. That is why the party is encouraging a separatist movement in the Darjeeling Hills.																								Asked why the Left Front had been accused of pampering Ghisingh, Bhattacharjee said: We never pampered the GNLF. We recognised the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) as it was formed for the development of the people in the hills. 																								The DGHC was set up in accordance with a tripartite agreement involving the Centre, the state government and Ghisingh. 																								According to the agreement, the chief minister said: We had to provide all sorts of support to the council. We have done the job for the benefit of people in the hills. To buttress the point that there was no tacit understanding between Ghisingh and the CPM over the years, Bhattacharjee said: We never support separatist forces and that is why we discouraged the GNLF agitation in the eighties tooth and nail.																								Bhattacharjee predicted a majority, though thin, for the BJP-led NDA at the Centre. However, the Left and other secular democratic forces will explore all possibilities to form a government, he said.

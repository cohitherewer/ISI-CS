The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Naxalite fear prompts force SOS
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Durgapur, April 22: Authorities of Bankura, Purulia, Burdwan and Birbhum today sought additional central forces for polling day in the wake of heightened threat from Naxalites. 																								At a meeting with special observer Afzal Amanullah, the district magistrates said outfits like the Peoples War and the Maoist Communist Centre are active in all the districts bordering or near Jharkhand. 																								We suspect that the Naxalites may resort to subversive activities in remote pockets on the day of the polls,said Purulia district magistrate G.P. Gopalika. 																								We will have a good election here, assured Amanullah. A few days ago, he had bracketed Bengal and Bihar, saying there must be some specific problems as special observers had been appointed in the two states.																								The district officials also pleaded for better equipment to tackle the guerillas.

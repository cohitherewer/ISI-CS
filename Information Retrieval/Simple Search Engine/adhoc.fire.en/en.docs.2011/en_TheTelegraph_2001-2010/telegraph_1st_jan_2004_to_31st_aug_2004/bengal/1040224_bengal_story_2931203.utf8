The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 CM tough talk and tact
 AMIT UKILKuilapal (Purulia), Feb. 23: Polls round the corner, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today entered the heart of Naxalite turf, amid unparalleled security, to warn the Peoples War that violence would achieve nothing in West Bengal.																								We are in complete peace, with people from all regions and religions coexisting. The Peoples War extremists have come from Jharkhand to foment trouble. They can go back, he told a rally at the Kuilapal Subal Singh High School grounds, 280 km from Calcutta.																								If their friends or supporters are here now, please tell them this. The poor villagers will not benefit if you kill leaders or policemen. Do not be misled and support separatist movements. Give up guns and come back, we will help you, he said.																								The rally venue was 25 km from Kantagora forest in Bandwan, where last October a Peoples War action squad set off a landmine and ambushed a police patrol, killing Bandwan police station officer-in-charge Nilmadhab Das. Naxalite-infested Raniband, Banspahari and Bokdubi, too, were close by.																								Bhattacharjees remarks came a week after PWD minister Amar Chowdhurys public appreciation of the extremists fight for the poor and landless labourers in Bengal. The senior RSP leader had said he felt the government should initiate talks with the rebels to help them return to the mainstream.																								As about 3,500 security personnel  including policemen from five districts, the BSF, EFR, RAF and the Intelligence Branch  scanned the area, the chief minister addressed the deficiencies the Peoples War posters had pointed out before and after Das killing. 																								He said the villagers must get good rates from the sale of kendu and sal leaves and babui grass ropes. Ive told the block development officers, the subdivisional officers and the district magistrates to ensure that proper rates are maintained. If the market cannot provide this, the government will.																								Violence and separatism will ruin everything, Bhattacharjee said at the rally called to celebrate the inclusion of Santhal language in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.

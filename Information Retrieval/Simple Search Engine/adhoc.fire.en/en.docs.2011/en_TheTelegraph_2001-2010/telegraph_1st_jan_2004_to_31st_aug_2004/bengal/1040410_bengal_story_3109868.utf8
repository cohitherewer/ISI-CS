 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Santiniketan, April 9: Groping for clues in the Nobel heist probe, both the CBI and the CID are waiting for the battered Tagore researcher to step out of hospital and provide leads. 																								The condition of Kamal Bhattacharya, who was found bruised and bleeding from his wrists on Thursday, worsened early this morning. He was on oxygen for most part of the day at a hospital in Bolpur. 																								He was complaining of breathlessness and pain in his chest and we therefore decided to take the necessary precautions, said an attending doctor.																								During interrogation earlier, Bhattacharya had made inconsistent statements. There is a big question mark over some of the academic credentials obtained by the researcher from abroad. We are at the moment checking all his antecedents, said a senior CBI official.																								Doctors found traces of an anaesthetic gel on Bhattacharyas injured wrists and neck. The gel is normally applied so that a person does not feel pain. 																								The investigating agencies are looking at two possibilities. One, that Bhattacharya wanted to commit suicide and two, that he was being threatened by someone who did not like the fact that he was talking to the CBI for the past few days. The injury was inflicted in a way that it appears Bhattacharya wanted to commit suicide.																								During a brief questioning in the hospital last evening, Bhattacharya could not tell where he was between 6 pm on Tuesday and 11 am on Thursday. The question is if Bhattacharya wanted to commit suicide, he wouldnt have walked down the street with medicines in hand. We hope that he has all the right answers, said a senior police officer.																								The sleuths believe that Bhattacharya, who had taken voluntary retirement from a bank and apparently devoted time to research on Tagore and astrophysics, had met some people interested in knowing more about Tagores Nobel medal and citation, which had been his area of work lately. The police are now trying to locate the people he was meeting in Santiniketan over the past few years.																								Hotels in the varsity town are being scanned and records of people who checked in a week before the heist are being looked into. We are exploring all possible angles, including the insiders role. The investigation will take some time, said a senior CBI official.																								Vivek Sahay, the CID special superintendent, arrived here today to oversee the police probe into the heist.

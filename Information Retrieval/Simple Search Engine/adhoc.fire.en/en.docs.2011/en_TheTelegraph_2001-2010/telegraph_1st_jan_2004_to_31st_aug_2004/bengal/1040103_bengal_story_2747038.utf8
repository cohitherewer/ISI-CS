The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Citu conflict at home spikes meet with CM
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Jan. 2: Opposition  within the Citu has forced its Asansol-Durgapur unit to  shelve a plan of presenting a memorandum to the chief minister  tomorrow.																								The CPMs labour wing in the industrial belt was banking on meeting Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during his Durgapur visit tomorrow to tell him about the closed factories and the plight of the workers.																								The Burdwan unit of the union, however, shot down the idea as it  along with the local CPM  is backing Bhattacharjee and his lieutenant, industries minister Nirupam Sen, in their bid to showcase Bengal as a favourable industrial destination. Sen is from Burdwan.																								Senior Citu leaders in Burdwan believe Bhattacharjee might dislike meeting the delegation because he had refused to see any trade union team on his Durgapur visit in 2001, after he became chief minister.																								The Citu in the industrial belt had prepared a list of the closed units, including several central public sector undertakings, and of workers who had died of starvation.																								Though the local union leaders agreed that the Left Front government had little scope to rehabilitate the workers as many of them belong to central units, they had hoped for an audience. We wanted to make the chief minister aware of the wrath and criticism we are facing from the working class for ignoring their plight, a Citu leader of Durgapur said.																								Not only were they planning to get Bhattacharjee to help the affected families, they also wanted to convince him that the Citu and the CPM were fast losing ground in the industrial belt because of their passive role.																								Bhattacharjee will tomorrow address a public meeting at Gandhi More in the steel city. The last time, he had inaugurated a private engineering college.																								Some of the closed CPSUs in Durgapur are Mining Allied Machinery Corporation and Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation, from both of which the Centre has decided to withdraw Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel. The jawans there to protect the expensive machines lying unused, which may now become the target of local anti-socials. 																								Bharat Opthalmic Glass Limited in the industrial town is on the verge of closure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Damodar tap turns against farmers 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Aug. 9: At a time when farmers are still reeling under the consequences of a delayed monsoon, water supply from the Damodar Valley reservoirs is being limited. 																								With rains continuing to elude Jharkhand, the Damodar Valley Reservoir Regulation Committee today reduced release of water by another 2,000 acre-feet from the Maithon and Panchet reservoirs. 																								Last Friday, the daily discharge was cut from 16,000 acre-feet to 12,000 acre-feet. The water is meant for irrigation in Burdwan, Bankura  hit by deficient rain  and Hooghly district.																								Today, we reviewed the situation and told the Bengal irrigation department officials we will not be able to release more than 10,000 acre-feet of water from the two reservoirs as their levels have gone down drastically, a committee official said on phone.																								Yesterday, the water level at the Maithon reservoir stood at 138.96 metres. It was at 120 metres at Panchet, the minimum level that has to be maintained. In Maithon, it is only seven metres above the minimum required level. 																								We will review the situation daily. We were forced to take the decision as rainfall in Jharkhand is not at all significant, the official said. 																								Scanty rainfall since July has affected transplantation of aman paddy in Bengal. Though over 50 per cent of the transplantation in over 34 lakh hectares has been completed in the south Bengal districts, the agriculture department fears deficit production.																								We are taking feedback from the districts daily and we are also getting reports of rain from Bankura and West Midnapore. We are still optimistic, said agriculture secretary Sukhbilas Barma.																								Agriculture minister Kamal Guha has called a meeting of officials of his department in the districts on August 17 to assess the situation. 																								Officials at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore held out hope, saying the monsoon condition in south Bengal is now normal. They said widespread rains are expected in the next 24 hours. 																								The monsoon trough line is in a normal position passing through Gangetic West Bengal and Jharkhand. So we expect a comparatively better situation with fairly widespread rains in south Bengal, said K.K. Chakraborty, chief of the weather section in the Alipore office.

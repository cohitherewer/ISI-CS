The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Boy pushed out of women bogie
 OUR CORRESPONDENTChinsurah: July 22: Niraj Prasad, a 14-year-old boy who sold maize on trains, was pushed out of a ladies compartment this morning when he hurried onto it having missed an adjacent coach.																								A resident of Ram Sita Lane in Serampore, Prasad is now fighting for life at Chinsurahs Imambara Hospital. 																								The Katwa local bound for Howrah was leaving Kuntighat station in Hooghly, 60 km from Calcutta, when the boy with a heavy bag full of maize was thrown out.																								He fell on trackside bushes and that probably saved him.																								At the hospital, Prasad, his familys only bread earner, is frequently losing consciousness. Niraj (Prasad) suffered critical injuries in his back, shoulder, head and left foot. He is so shocked that he is losing sense frequently, said Dr Ashis Mondal.																								When the train stopped at the station after Kuntighat, Tribeni, a section of passengers and hawkers got into the ladies compartment and started beating up a woman, Shanti Roy, accusing her of pushing Prasad. The police rescued her and took her into custody.																								I requested the didis not to throw me out, but they didnt listen. I could not make it to the next compartment because of the heavy bag, Prasad said between bouts of senselessness.																								Railway employees at a Kuntighat station cabin who spotted Prasad falling from the train prevented him from rolling over on the tracks.

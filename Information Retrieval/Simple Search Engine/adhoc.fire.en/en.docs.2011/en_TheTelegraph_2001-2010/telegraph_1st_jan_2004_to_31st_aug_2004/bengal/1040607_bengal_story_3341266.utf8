 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Sikkim silk route onus on Centre
 VIVEK CHHETRI																								Darjeeling, June 6: The change of guard at the Centre has left the Sikkim government unsure whether it can keep its July date with Nathu-la.																								The Pawan Chamling-led Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) regime, hesitant to commit a new date for the reopening of the route for trade, said it was now up to the new government at the Centre to take the initiative.																								The opening of the trade route, early or late, will depend on the Centres initiative, said the chief minister. 																								He was quick to add that any delay in opening the trade route would be Indias loss.																								The BJP-led NDA government, which the SDF supported, had said Nathu-la would be opened for trade in July 2004.																								The reopening of the trade route to China will not only benefit Sikkim but also the rest of the country because this is one of the shortest routes to Lhasa, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, Chamling said.																								Though the Sikkim government has always worked closely with the party leading the new dispensation in Delhi, political observers believe that with the Congress being the main Opposition party in the state, it is unlikely that Chamling would share with the party the rapport he enjoyed with the NDA brass.																								When asked, Chamling maintained that he would always try to work closely with the government at the Centre for the benefit of Sikkim.																								The silk route, as Nathu-la is better known, was the preferred trading trail between Sikkim and China till it was closed in 1962 following the Chinese aggression. Infrastructure upgradation  construction of warehouses and setting up industry  is either in progress or in the pipeline but Chamling believes that Sikkim would be able to handle the initial trade, which is expected to be on a small scale, with the facilities already available.																								Though the state government can bring a legislation and restrict trade with China within Sikkim to protect local business, Chamling said his government was not planning to do so.																								We have no plans of restricting trade within the state, Chamling said, adding that his government deserved credit for the reopening of Nathu-la.

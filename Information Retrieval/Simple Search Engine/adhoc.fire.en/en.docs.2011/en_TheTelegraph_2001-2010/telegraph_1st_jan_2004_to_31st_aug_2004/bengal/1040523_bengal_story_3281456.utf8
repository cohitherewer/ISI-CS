 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Extortionists strike at cyber cafe 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, May 22: Three extortionists barged into a cyber caf in Bally this afternoon and shot at the owner for not paying up. 																								Rajiv Gupta, 30, was rushed to a local nursing home after the gang, yet to be traced, shot at his chest and struck him with a chopper repeatedly. His condition is stated to be critical. 																								The driver of the taxi in which the miscreants fled has been detained for interrogation. 																								Preliminary inquiries show Gupta was attacked because he refused to give in to the gangs demand. There is a tacit understanding between shop owners and extortionists that those who run their businesses will have to pay them to keep them in good humour, an official of Bally police station said. 																								Police said a few days ago, the three had raided Guptas shop. When he refused to pay, they snatched Rs 10,000 and his mobile phone. They possibly gave him a weeks time, the reason why they attacked him today, the police said. Gupta had been receiving threat calls. 																								Policemen on duty near the cyber caf heard the shots, but could not chase as the miscreants hurled bombs while escaping. But a patrol vehicle followed them and detained the taxi driver at Belur station.

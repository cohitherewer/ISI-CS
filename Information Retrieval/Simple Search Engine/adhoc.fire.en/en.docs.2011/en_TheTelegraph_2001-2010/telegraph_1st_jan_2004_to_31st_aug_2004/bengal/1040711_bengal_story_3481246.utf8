The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Twin demons turn new road into nightmare
 A STAFF REPORTER  A police jeep torched  by protesters after the accident. Picture by Soumen  Bhattacharjee 																								Calcutta, July 10: Little Rituparna Adhikary was crushed to death six days after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattcharjee inaugurated the 12-km Rajarhat-New Town Road. In all, 21 accidents have taken seven more lives in the four months that vehicles have been zipping on it. 																								Calcuttas newest road has turned into a death zone, thanks to speeding and police apathy. Our record book shows seven persons (have) already died after being hit by speeding vehicles on the 12-km stretch of the road, said an officer of the North 24-Parganas traffic department. 																								During inquiries after Rituparnas death, senior officials found that policemen are usually not posted on the road. Today was no exception. 																								Todays incident took place only a few yards from the VIP Road. The intersection of the new road and the Baguiati-Rajarhat Road is one of the busiest crossings. Traffic policeman should have been deployed there from 8 am to 8 pm, said an official. 																								The entire stretch has become a death trap. Vehicles can ply easily at a speed of 80 km per hour. Monitoring both vehicular and pedestrian movement on such high-speed thoroughfare should be given high priority. But no policeman is seen even at the important intersections of the road, complained Tanmoy Mandal, MLA from Rajarhat. 																								Moreover, no policeman is seen at the junction of the township connector and VIP Road. 																								The district police admitted that traffic management on the entire VIP Road is becoming poorer by the day. 																								Traffic snarls at Kestopur, Baguiati, Dum Dum Park and Tegharia have become a regular event. We are aware of it and trying our level best to sort out the problem, said superintendent of police Praveen Kumar. 																								Some measures are being taken to prevent accidents. We have removed all the broken railings from the divider of VIP Road. New sets of railings are being installed with the help of the public works department. After the completion of this work, we will be able to control pedestrian movement, said an official of Gouripur traffic guard.

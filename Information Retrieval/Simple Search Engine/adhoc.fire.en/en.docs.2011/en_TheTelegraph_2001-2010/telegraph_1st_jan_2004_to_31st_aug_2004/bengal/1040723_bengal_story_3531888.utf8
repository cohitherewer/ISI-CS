				 																																	Calcutta, July 22: Sankar Ari, an RSP leader at South 24-Parganas Gosaba, was beaten up last night following the death of a 12-year-old girl whom he allegedly got pregnant. 				 																																	Ari, 32, the brother of panchayat pradhan Bejoy, had apparently been dodging her parents requests to marry her. He threatened Khagendra Mandal and his wife when they warned him that they will go public with their charge.				 																																	Yesterday, Ari allegedly took the Class VII student to a quack, Satyen Dhara, for abortion. The girl died on the quacks operation table. Aris men then rushed the body to the burning ghat. By the time the pyre was lit, the girls family arrived with police. The body was taken for post-mortem. 				 																																	Additional superintendent of police (rural) B.C. Mondal said the girls parents were not aware that Ari was married twice. We are looking for the quack. We will arrest Sankar, Mondal said.				 																																	Calcutta: A 70-member Chinese delegation will participate in a business conclave in the city on August 6. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the team will comprise government officials and industry representatives. Opportunities in sectors like chemicals, plastics, machine tools and power would be discussed at the meet.				 																																	Krishnagar: Three people died of gastroenteritis and 50 others were afflicted at Nadias Chapra in five days. Contaminated drinking water is said to have led to the outbreak. Fifteen residents of Muslimpara, about 140 km from Calcutta, were admitted to the block hospital on Monday.

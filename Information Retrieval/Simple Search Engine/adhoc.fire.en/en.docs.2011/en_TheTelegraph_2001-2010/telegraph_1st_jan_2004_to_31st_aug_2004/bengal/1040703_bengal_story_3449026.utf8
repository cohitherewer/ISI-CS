File pictureNew Delhi, July 1: Cigarette company ITC entered the hotels business barely 30 years ago, but it is getting ready for a centenary bash.																								Confusing? Not really. Fortune Resort Central in Darjeeling, a heritage hotel that was established in 1905 and managed since 1999 by Fortune Park Hotels (an ITC hotel brand that has been around for less than a decade), is preparing for a yearlong celebration.																								Yes, we are getting our act together to celebrate the 100 years of the hotel. We are planning some exciting events, said Mandip S. Lamba, president of Fortune Park Hotels, a midprice hotel segment.																								Company officials said ITC hotels would spend a significant sum on the yearlong event. After all, we have been associated with the property and it is a matter of pride for us, too, he said. The celebrations, scheduled from January next year, would be marked by programmes and ceremonies each month.																								We are looking at plans to celebrate a local festival and conduct a marketing exercise for this property. We have yet to formalise our plans, Lamba said. The hotel is toying with the idea of a food festival, a possible arrangement with the railways (likely involving the toy train) and a tea-tasting exhibition.																								Built in 1905, the hotel belonged to a Britisher. It was sold to J.S. Madan, a Parsi, in 1912. The property was acquired in 1985 by M.P. Aggarwal, who subsequently tied up with Fortune Park Hotels to market and manage the hotel.																								It essentially has two buildings. The main structure has nearly 25 Fortune club rooms or heritage rooms priced at Rs 5,000 a night, including meals; the adjoining annex built in 1972 has another 15 standard rooms with contemporary styling that cost Rs 4,000 a day, with meals.

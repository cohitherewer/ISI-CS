 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Fire in apparel shop next to Firpos
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 31: A fire broke out at a clothes shop on Chowringhee around 10.30 tonight but could not do much damage as 10 fire tenders controlled the blaze within an hour. 																								There were no casualties but a fireman was injured by shards of glass when the main entrance to the shop was being cut open.																								Fire brigade personnel cut through the shutter of Mega Shop, where Tiger Cinema once stood, within minutes and doused the flames that had engulfed the cash counter, located just inside.																								Owner John Mantosh, who arrived at the shop at 11.30 pm said the cause of the fire was external. He added that his security guards had told him that the fire originated from an electrical fault from a signboard in front of the shops concrete awning.																								I just flew in from Hyderabad and I am satisfied that the fire brigade did a good job in cutting open the gate and preventing the huge stock of clothes from catching fire, Mantosh said.																								Shop owners from neighbouring Firpos Market, which was devastated by a fire on April 23 last year, rushed to the spot panicking that the blaze might spread. 																								We did not know what will happen when we saw the smoke billowing out, said Imran Moin, the owner of a large garments shop at Firpos.Fire brigade officer U.N. Adhikary said the first fire tender reached the spot from the Free School Street fire station at 10.45 pm. A large police contingent stood by during the fire fighting operation, trying to control a huge crowd that had converged there.																								Sumit Mondal, a bystander and a New Market shop employee, said the thick smoke emerging from the shop seemed serious. I could not leave the spot as I thought that it would be a repetition of the Firpos fire. We are lucky that it was not that bad, he said.

 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Boys turn killers for Rs 10000
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Basirhat, June 10: They were four, and in their teens. And they bumped off a trader for Rs 10,000. 																								Bhaskar Roy, Deepankar Das, Amit Das and Jayanta Bose are Bengals real-life parallels to Bollywood masala where boys kill at will for small change. 																								North 24-Parganas police have arrested the quartet after their first shot at contract killing  a Baduria-based liquor dealer. 																								Bhaskar, whose father is a senior bank employee and mother a school teacher, was set to write next years higher secondary examinations from the local Rajballavpur High School. Amit is a Class XI student in another institution. The other two had dropped out of school recently and developed a strong friendship with Bhaskar and Amit.																								They killed the country liquor dealer after being promised money by a rival businessman. The youths followed the order to the last detail and were planning to flee with the supari (contract) amount when we caught up with them, said district superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.																								Around 8.30 pm on May 20, the quartet led by Deepankar arrived at Manik Das liquor shop at Baduria. All four were regulars at the joint and Manik did not sniff trouble.																								Deepankar, who helps out his family business in medicines, pulled out a revolver and aimed at Maniks chest. Before he could wink, three bullets were pumped in. Job done, they walked out, hopped onto two motorcycles and disappeared in the darkness.																								When the police probe began, the four were absconding. 																								Investigations revealed how a local trader, whom the police refused to name for the sake of inquiry, approached Bhaskar with an offer to eliminate Manik. 																								The trader, who is now absconding, had told them how Manik on several occasions had extorted huge sums from him and other traders, said a senior police officer associated with the investigation.																								Apparently fed up with Maniks clout with hardened criminals who used to haunt the liquor joint, his rival trader roped in the boys eager to make a fast buck. The friends were a perfect choice as Manik, who was usually careful about possible threats, could not apprehend that boys who had no criminal background could actually pull the trigger in cold blood, the district police chief said.																								Investigations revealed that after accepting the supari, the boys chalked out a blueprint of the murder at Bhaskars house and conducted at least three recces of the liquor shop. 																								Everything went according to plan but some local criminals apparently gave away their secret hideout to the police. All four have confessed to the crime and have named the trader now on the run.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Strategy meet to sting lifters 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Aug. 21: Wary of losing your wallet during shopping? This Pujas, just take a deep breath and peacefully plunge into retail therapy. 																								Sleuths are putting together a super-surveillance mechanism that would keep a watch on lifters in the guise of shoppers. Moreover, if you suspect someone, just inform the shop owner and there would be help at hand from the local police in a flash. 																								The police brass today met shop owners and their representatives to brief them about ways to prevent crime during the pre-Puja buying spree. While the thrust was on tackling both kleptomaniacs and thieves, police also took time to discuss the norms of fire-fighting inside the shopping complexes. 																								The shop/mall owners were given the mobile numbers of the officers-in-charge concerned to ensure quick contact. 																								The representatives were informed about the different types of shoplifters and provided with their details, including a photocopy of their pictures. The idea was to keep the owners informed about the professionals and help them identify them as soon as they stepped in, said Subrata Ghosh, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station. 																								Apart from thieves, the meet also discussed compulsive lifters  from well-to-do families  who take anything from handbags to jewellery. 																								The meeting was prompted by a string of recent arrests pointing to a new trend women in smart outfits and expensive jewellery moving from mall to mall lifting what took their fancy. One of those arrested had picked a bag from a mall on Camac Street before moving on to another on Elgin Road, when she was caught. 																								The police also asked the shop/mall owners to nominate people who could be sent for a days training with the fire department. They were also asked to submit suggestions on handling the problem of car parking. 																								Among those who attended were representatives from Pantaloons, Westside, Vardhan Market, Metro Plaza and Tanishq.

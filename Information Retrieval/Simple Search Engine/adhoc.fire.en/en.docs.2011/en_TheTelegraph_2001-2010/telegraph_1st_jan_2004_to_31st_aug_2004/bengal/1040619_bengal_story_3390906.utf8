 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Minister quits after a twist
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 18: Upset at being made to quit his post as part of the cabinet downsizing exercise, irrigation and waterways minister Amalendra Roy kept everyone guessing about why he had met chief minister Buddadeb Bhattacharjee today.																								Roy, an RSP member, refused to say if he went to Writers Buildings after weeks to submit his resignation and would not comment on why he met Bhattacharjee. Instead he went to his antechamber and refused to see anyone.																								Earlier this morning, Roy had said: I am still a minister, please allow me to work. I am very busy and I dont have a minute to spare.																								Even after spending more than half-an-hour in the chief ministers chamber from 4 pm, the minister would not say what transpired. Ask the chief minister, he said.																								The air of mystery was cleared only when Bhattacharjee, before leaving for the day, said: He (Roy) offered his resignation today.																								Roys name figured among the ministers the chief minister said would be dropped to abide by a Supreme Court order that the size of a cabinet cannot exceed 15 per cent of the Assembly strength.																								The ministers apparent refusal to submit his resignation after the RSP had decided to sacrifice him angered Bhattacharjee and the CPM as neither had asked Roy to quit. Fruit-seller at college doorstep																								Sanjit Naskar, a fishermans son, had to clear JEE thrice to come anywhere close to pursuing his dream to be a doctor. 																								The 20-year-old from Bishnupur in South 24-Parganas, who sells fruits at Bhowanipore and ranked 39 this year, had cleared the test twice before but could not afford to study. 																								Naskar was today handed a cheque of Rs 10,000 by the State Fisheries Officers Association and promised Rs 10,000 more by Benfish officers.

 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Boy stabs classmate to death over clash of love interest
 OUR CORRESPONDENTBarasat, July 1: Subrata Biswas, an eleventh standard student, stabbed classmate Subhajit Raha to death yesterday because he had an affair with the girl he wanted.																								Tinku Saha (name changed) was also a student of Haripur Sanskrit Siksha Niketan at Ashokenagar in Barasat, about 40 km from Calcutta. 																								Police said Subrata had tried to forge intimacy with the girl a class his junior.																								Subhajit Raha, 18, used to have an affair with Tinku. Subrata, his classmate, was also interested in her, said a Habra police station official.																								When Subhajit left school for home with two friends yesterday afternoon, he did not know what Subrata and two of his friends were up to.																								With one of the friends, Subrata went to a nearby playground. The other went to Subhajits house to call him. He apparently told him that their dispute had to be settled. 																								Subhajit wanted that as well and agreed on a meeting at the ground behind Ashokenagar post office, about half-a-kilometre from the school.																								When he reached there, Subrata asked Subhajit to terminate his relations with Tinku. Subhajit was firm. He wanted Subrata to stay away and not create trouble in their affair. An argument broke out as both blamed each other for coming in their loves way. 																								Suddenly Subrata left the place for a corner of the field and summoned Subhajit for a private discussion. A seething Subhajit went there only to turn down Subratas last call to sever his links with Tinku. Subrata whipped out a razor and stabbed Subhajit, said Parveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police.																								As Subhajit slumped to the ground, Subrata fled. Subhajits friends, who were waiting in another corner of the playground, rushed him to a health centre. He was later shifted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he died at 11 pm. 																								Subhajits family members went to the police. His friends revealed the motive behind the attack.																								Kumar said: Subrata and his accomplices are absconding. But we are looking for them. The investigation is on. We will also interrogate the girl.

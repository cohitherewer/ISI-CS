 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Convocation in shadow of heist
 OUR BUREAUSantiniketan/Calcutta, April 18: Over 2,000 youngsters lined up for their degrees and diplomas at Visva-Bharati today as the convocation was held two years late, in the shadow of the Tagore memorabilia theft.																								As sleuths chanced on a likely link between the heist and the missing lock at Uddyan Vibhag, vice-chancellor Sujit Basu called for an effort to safeguard the ideals of Rabindranath Tagores dream institution.																								We are meeting here at a time when grief has overtaken every one of us, he said.																								... vested interests should not only be despised but be strictly driven out of the precincts, Basu told the gathering that included chief guest I.G. Patel, a former RBI governor.																								Bolpur police found during the interrogation of Pradip Bauri, arrested in the theft case, that he knew Abhay Mahapatra, the gardening superintendent held for the Vibhag lock-break. Gardening department employee Sheikh Akhtar was arrested today for allegedly stealing the sandalwood tree from Malancha in January.

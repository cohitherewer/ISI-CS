 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Police wives protest charity
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, March 2: Policemen here got their wives to protest against a directive to donate a part of their salary for the families of colleagues who died in an explosion last Wednesday. 																								West Midnapore superintendent of police Praveen Kumar had sent a circular asking policemen and employees of the department, homeguards and members of the National Volunteer Force to donate a days salary for eight months for the welfare of the bereaved families of two officers and five Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans. 																								They were among eight people killed in the landmine blast triggered by Peoples War militants at Nundhola in the Belpahari forest.																								Wives and relatives of about 100 policemen assembled at the police lines here and demanded that the circular be withdrawn. 																								Members of policemens families said there was no point in serving the circular after the government had decided to compensate the relatives of those killed. Moreover, they argued, it would be difficult for the homeguards and the volunteer force personnel who work on a no-work-no-pay basis to cough up a days wage for eight months.																								The volunteers and homeguards earn a paltry sum. How can they pay a days wage for the next eight months. This is a very unjust demand on the part of the superintendent, said a policemans wife. 																								Senior police officials said the circular was issued as a gesture of solidarity with the families of the dead policemen and EFR jawans. 																								We wanted the entire force in the district to show its togetherness with the families of the bereaved. This is a unique gesture, said Kumar. He added that if Calcutta police could collect funds after sergeant Bapi Sen died fighting eve-teasers on the night of December 31, 2002, what is wrong if we ask our employees to donate a days salary for eight months for the welfare of policemens families. 																								However, Kumar denied receiving a memorandum demanding withdrawal of the circular.																								The protesters appeared determined to continue the agitation till the circular is withdrawn. If necessary, we will write an open letter to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee requesting his intervention, one of them said requesting anonymity.																								Another said it was unfair to make the payment mandatory. We are fully sympathetic towards those who were killed. But this does not mean we have to be forced to go on paying a days salary to their families.																								An officer said when the force is feeling the heat of militant strikes, such protests would do no good to the morale.

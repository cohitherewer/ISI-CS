The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Probe into brain fever casualties 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Burdwan, March 25: The state health authorities today ordered a probe into the deaths caused by an unknown disease in Resalatpur village in Jamalpur, 180 km from Calcutta. 																								Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee asked the district chief medical officer of health Santosh Sarengi and his deputy to rush to the village and collect blood samples to find out the cause behind the disease.																								Four persons have died over the past 24 hours and several others have been afflicted with the disease, suspected to be encephalitis. About two dozen persons with high fever and suffering from convulsions and constipation have been admitted to the Jamalpur health centre and Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, said district health officials.																								From symptoms, it appears to be encephalitis. But we can only be sure after we examine the samples of blood collected from the patients. Three patients are now admitted in the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, said Chatterjee from Calcutta.																								The deaths have spread panic among the villagers of Resalatpur and its adjoining areas. Sarengi and other senior officials have collected blood samples from a number of people showing the symptoms. Villagers claimed that there have been six deaths over the past three days and over 100 people have been afflicted.																								Sarengi later said the symptoms also matched those of malignant malaria, but the disease cannot be identified until the blood samples are tested.

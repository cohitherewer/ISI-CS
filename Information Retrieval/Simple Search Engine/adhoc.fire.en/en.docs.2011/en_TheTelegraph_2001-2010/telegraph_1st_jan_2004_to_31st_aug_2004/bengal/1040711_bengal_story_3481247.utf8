 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 10: Ami was 12-year-old Ashikul Islams 20-minute take on life  his own and that of 11 other orphans in a home and their dreams. His vision has won hearts and the grand prize of best picture in the Kids for Kids International Film Festival in Athens, Greece.																								Ami was screened on June 20, the third day of the four-day film festival that featured more than 323 films from 40 countries. 																								Our film was part of the 45 films selected for the final rounds. I am still thrilled at the success, said a beaming Ashikul, an inmate of Muktoneer, run by the Free the Children-India. 																								Ashikul and 11 other residents of the home featured in and directed Ami. The film, a showcase of their dreams, was produced by Gaurang Films and travelled as the official Indian entry in the festival. 																								Ashikul was to travel with his Ami to Greece but ran into hurdles as he did not have the necessary travel documents. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee read about Ashikul and rushed to the aid of a boy who once used to roam the streets. He not only accompanied his film to Athens but also became a part of the jury. 																								Organised by the International Center of Film for Children and Young People and the European Children Film Association, Ami was liked by all. On June 21, the jury announced its triumph.

 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Suicide after girl-child woe
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Nabadwip, Aug. 28: A 23-year-old set herself and her nine-month-old daughter on fire this morning, unable to bear torture and humiliation almost daily for giving birth to a girl child.																								A probe has been initiated to ascertain whether Sabita killed herself and Madhuri or somebody had set them on fire, said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh. Sabitas husband Hari and mother-in-law are absconding.																								Sabita and her daughter were found in flames at 9 am. We tried our best to save the two but failed. By the time we doused the flames, the child was dead. We rushed them to the Shakti Nagar State General Hospital, where Sabita succumbed to injuries at noon, said Gita Das, a primary school teacher and Sabitas neighbour.																								As the news spread, several residents of the area converged on the home of the deceased at Bamun Para village in Nabadwip, nearly 100 km from Calcutta.																								The villagers demanded that those responsible be arrested and criticised police for failing to trace Hari and his mother.																								Sabitas mother, Malati Debnath, complained to the police that her daughter was subjected to physical and mental torture when the girl child was born.																								Suvra Banerjee, one of the neighbours, told police that Sabita and her husband often quarrelled over the birth of the child.																								We heard them quarrelling till midnight almost every day, but did not protest as it was their family affair, she said.																								Banerjee said Sabitas mother-in-law Amburi disliked her as she used to take time out to teach some boys of the area.																								Amburi wanted her to help in the familys weaving business. Sabita was tortured as she refused to join the family business, alleged the neighbour.

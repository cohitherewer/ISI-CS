 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE 																								Barasat, July 15: An iron net has been installed to seal off all entries and exits at the Regional Transport Authority office here, except one through the chamber of the office chief. 																								The step was taken by North 24-Parganas additional district magistrate, P. Siddiqi, the highest authority in the RTA, to curb corruption. It is intended to stop the entry of middlemen, who act as a conduit between some officials and customers. 																								The net also prevents the RTA officials from stepping out during working hours to meet outsiders. The Regional Transport Officer can now keep an eye on the employees coming in and going out as they have to pass through his chamber. 																								A new staircase is being built within the fencing. We took the decision to enable the officials to go upstairs without having to come out of the office. We had received some complaints about middlemen frequenting the RTA office, said Siddiqi. 																								He decided on the net after a driver, who needed to renew his licence, told him how he was being turned away for two years as he could not cough up a bribe. 																								Sources in the office said files and documents often went missing or were tampered with. 																								Recently the police seized a truck from South 24-Parganas for carrying illegal goods. It was found that the trucks permit was issued by the RTO, North 24-Parganas, but no record could be found in the office, said a police official.

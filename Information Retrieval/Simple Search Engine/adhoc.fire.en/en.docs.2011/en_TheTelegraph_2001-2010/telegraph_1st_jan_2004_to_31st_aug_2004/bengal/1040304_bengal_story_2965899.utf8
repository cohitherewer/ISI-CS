 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Wrecking rallies to blocking roads
 															- Former SP steps towards politics OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Rallyists hold up traffic on the national highway at Bally. Picture by Nabakumar Patra																								Howrah, March 3: He spent the bulk of his career chasing rallyists off the streets. Today, in a role reversal, he was back on the roads, blocking traffic to make a point. 																								Former Howrah superintendent of police Sultan Singh began his transformation from a man of law to a politician by appearing in a rally that blocked National Highway 6 at Bally to protest against the closure of the Bally Jute Mill. 																								Singh harbours hopes of being nominated as the Congress candidate from Howrah for the Lok Sabha polls.																								I have always striven to protect the constitutional rights of the people of this state, whom I have served throughout my career as an IPS officer. This time, too, I intend to carry on along those lines, albeit as a representative of the common people, Singh said, in his new avatar as a leader of people. He served as Howrah superintendent from 1982 to 1985. 																								While Singh slipped almost seamlessly into his new role, the policemen who hovered around to maintain order were utterly confused: should they defer to their former burra saheb or act against a man who was leading a road block? 																								Singh addressed a huge crowd, mainly made up of mill workers and supporters of the Congress-backed Intuc union who had gathered to protest against the abrupt closure of the jute mill yesterday. The mob blocked the highway for more than one-and-a-half hours, crippling traffic movement. 																								The mill workers also burnt an effigy of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								Reminded of the days when he used to break up such mobs, Singh said: If this is the way to protest against what is wrong, then they are right in protesting for their livelihood. 																								Playing the part of a political leader to the hilt, Singh uttered the right words in a marathon speech. These atrocities should stop. The masters should not throw out labourers who provide the owners with their daily bread. 																								Singh expressed solidarity with the Congress and said that he hoped to file his nomination papers at the request of Somen Mitra, former pradesh Congress president. From now I would act according to the instructions of the superior leaders of the party, he added.

 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Off court against misbehaviour
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, April 26: The Bar Association here today decided to boycott the judges court and the subdivisional court till May 7 demanding action against misbehaving magistrates.																								Secretary of the association Abu Bakkar Siddiqui alleged that the magistrates were not showing due respect to the learned advocates. 																								They (magistrates) sometimes even misbehave with our members and do not bother to hear our cases. Instead, they spend time gossiping. We are left with no option but to cease work to lodge our protest against the humiliation, said Siddiqui. 																								He also alleged that despite repeated appeals to the authorities for some amenities in the court building, nothing changed. They (the authorities) are simply not bothered. There is no arrangement for even drinking water in the building. 																								Bar Council sources in Calcutta said the battle between the bench and the bar at Behrampore started when a woman magistrate misbehaved with Ashit Chowdhury, a senior lawyer. 																								The association protested the misdemeanour of the magistrate towards Chowdhury. They also took exception to the manner in which she wrote to Chief Justice A.K. Mathur saying she was feeling insecure, the sources said. The Chief Justice had issued a suo-motu contempt notice against Chowdhury. 																								A senior member of the association said representatives of the bar led by council chairman Amiya Chatterjee called on the chief justice on April 7. He promised us that a senior official would be sent to inquire into our allegation. But none from the high court went to Behrampore.Ministers court call																								A Howrah court has issued an arrest warrant against minister of state for health Pratyush Mukherjee for not appearing before it. 																								Suspected Trinamul Congress supporters had attacked Mukherjee on January 7, 2001, and the court wanted to hear his version of the incident.

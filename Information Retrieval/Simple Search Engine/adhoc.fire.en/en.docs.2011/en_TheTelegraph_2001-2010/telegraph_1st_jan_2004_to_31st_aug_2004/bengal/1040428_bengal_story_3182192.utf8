 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Warning that went unheard
 AVIJIT SINHA Jalpaiguri, April 27: Raybahadur Rai stares in disbelief at the shards of glass and mangled metal near the railway tracks. 																								None of this would have happened had the driver heeded my warning. It happened so fast, there was nothing else I could do to prevent the accident, he said, struggling to blot out the deafening crash and screams that echo in his ear.																								When the Siliguri-Alipurduar train rammed into the bus carrying schoolchildren near Red Bank Tea Estate, Rai was standing guard at the gardens gate 168, a few metres from the level-crossing.																								I could see the train coming, and a moment later, the approaching bus. I frantically waved my hand to alert the driver and prevent him from attempting to cross before the train. But he drove on. I knew he would not make it, Rai said.																								The locomotive that hit the bus on the rear end sent it flying several feet. It came to rest after rolling down a ditch by the tracks. 																								I saw the children playing and singing when the bus crossed me. A moment later, I heard the crash, Rai said. 																								People in the vicinity rushed to help, but Rai, who watched helplessly as the tragedy unfolded, stood in disbelief. The scene will haunt me for the rest of my life, he said.																								Only when police called him to narrate the sequence of events and register a complaint did he pluck up the courage to go to the edge of the ditch. 																								The driver never takes this route. He was forced to because the road has been dug up on the route he follows, Rai said.																								Kalyan Raut, a Class VI student of Adarsh Vidyamandir, Banarhat, said they were going to collect marksheets from school. We had almost crossed the tracks when the train hit our bus. I faintly remember being torn from my seat and flung into the air and thrown about. A pain shot up my arm and I screamed. Doctors here said I have fractured my right arm. I feel lucky, he said from his bed at the Jalpaiguri hospital.																								Sandip Nayak surprised rescuers when he crawled out of the bus with minor wounds. He couldnt tell how it felt.

 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Police, PWG trade fire in Salboni forest
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								West Midnapore, Feb. 18: A gun battle between Naxalites, suspected to be Peoples War Group activists, and police continued till late in the night in the dense Champainagar forest at Salbani from the afternoon. 																								Deputy inspector-general (Midnapore range) Sadhan Mondal said the encounter is still going on. Innumerable rounds have been fired from both sides. But we are not sure whether anybody has been injured. Nothing can be seen due to the darkness and till the day breaks, nothing can be said definitely.																								A big police force led by district superintendent of police Praveen Kumar has surrounded the forest, along with BSF jawans, and is pushing back the extremists. 																								Police acted on a tip-off by some women from nearby villages who had gone to collect wood from the forest around noon and noticed some men moving about suspiciously. 																								The women ran back and told the men, who alerted officer-in-charge of Salboni police station Susanta Rajbanshi. He rushed to the forest where the Naxalites started firing. At first the policemen were outnumbered, but reinforcements were soon rushed in.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Jatras grab Dhananjoy formula 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Aug. 21: The death of Dhananjoy Chatterjee has given a new lease of life to the jatra, a form of entertainment ebbing under an assault from television and multiplexes. 																								The tale of the convict, hanged early on August 14 for raping and murdering teenager Hetal Parekh, is now grist for the story mills of the jatra companies, most of them bunched in Chitpur. Cash-strapped and running out of ideas, these outfits believe they have a hit formula in their hands because everyone is talking about it (the hanging). 																								Some groups have begun full-fledged preparation, investing several lakhs of rupees, engaging eminent artistes and even accepting advance bookings. The jatras are likely to be staged in the city and across rural Bengal from October. 																								Sukumar Tung of Digvijay Opera, who is directing Phansir Manche Dhananjoy, said he did not want to let go of the opportunity. Jatra industry is in a sorry state. This subject has brought fresh hope. We are hoping that staging the hanging would help boost our business. It will surely sell and break all our recent records.																								Manik Saha, producer of Natya Niketan, another jatra company, who is preparing to stage Dhananjoyer Phansi, said: The hanging is now much talked about. We are trying to present the real story. It means we will stage the crime he committed as well as focus on the punishment he got as a result, said. 																								Tung is expected to be at Indpur in Bankura, not far from Dhananjoys village, on October 24, where he will stage the first show. Our preparations are on in full swing. Most of the organisers contacting us for advance booking are from Bankura, where Dhananjoy lived, he said. 																								The director assured there was no intention to distort facts or tarnish the image of the government. We are using a caption in our advertisements saying Dhananjoys hanging represents the effort to set up a corruption-free society, Tung added. 																								The first show of all the performances would be watched. If we find that facts were distorted, we will ask the agency concerned to change the distorted portions before staging it the second time, the home secretary said.

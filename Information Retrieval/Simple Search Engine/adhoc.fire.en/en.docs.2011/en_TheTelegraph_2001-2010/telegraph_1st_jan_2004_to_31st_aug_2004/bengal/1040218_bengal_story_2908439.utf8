The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Airstrip custodian roughed up
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMalda, Feb. 17: An official of the Airports Authority of India was badgered by residents when he tried to oppose the construction of a road that runs close to the districts unused airstrip.																								How can we allow a 200-m road stretch to be laid so close to the aerodrome when the Union government is planning to get the place functional once again, said Biplab Mitra, who is responsible for looking after the airport property here. 																								Work on the road, however, came to a halt after police intervened following a complaint lodged by the authority at the Englishbazar police station.																								Mitra alleged that he was rounded up by residents, who hurled abuses and threatened him. The provocation for the attack was his opposition to the construction of the road. 																								He added that the row has been reported to Calcutta and senior officials are expected to arrive tomorrow.																								Unable to contact either the district magistrate or the police superintendent, I spoke to additional superintendent of police Manoranjan Saha on his mobile phone. He sent his men and stopped work, Mitra said.																								The 900-acre Malda airport, which has been defunct since 1987, has many encroachments, including permanent houses, within its limits. A probe revealed the municipality had even cleared building plans on the land belonging to the civil aviation ministry. Those laying the road, Mitra said, had even uprooted pillars.																								Brick and mortar houses have come up on about 1.39 acres at Jhaljhalia while at Maheshmati, nearly 5 acres have been encroached upon. 																								Sources said the airports authority has already filed cases in the district court to reclaim this land. We have been repeatedly telling the Englishbazar municipality not to allow construction of multi-storeyed buildings in the immediate vicinity of the airport but they have not listened, Mitra said.																								He claimed that the labourers working on the road had even uprooted some of the boundary pillars of the airport.																								Inquiries revealed that the road under construction skirted a nearby graveyard providing right of way to the residents of around 45 houses, who previously travelled through the graveyard. The cemetery had been walled up recently and that restricted movement. 																								This is the same place where Congress MP A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury inaugurated a rest room yesterday. 																								When contacted about the road, zilla parishad sabhadhipati Gautam Chakrabarty said he was unaware of the development. 																								I do not know anything about this. I will have to find out more before I can comment, he said. Officials of Englishbazar municipality as well as local residents have also declined to comment on the matter. 																								There have plans to resume commercial flights from the airport with engineers from the civil aviation department already submitting a Rs 29-crore revival package to Delhi after conducting surveys here last year.

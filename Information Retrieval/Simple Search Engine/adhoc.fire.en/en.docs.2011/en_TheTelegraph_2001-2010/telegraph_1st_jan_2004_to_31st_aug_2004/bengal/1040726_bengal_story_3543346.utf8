				 																																	Chinsurah, July 25: A 21-year-old woman was held after her mother-in-law, 55-year-old Milan Bala Dey, was burnt last night at Bamunari under Dankuni police station and blamed her daughter-in-law in her dying statement. 				 																																	Shakti Ranjan Dey, Milan Balas husband, told police he had gone out and returned around 8 pm to find a crowd outside his house and smoke coming out of it. Sabita, who was arrested, was apparently telling neighbours that Milan Bala accidentally caught fire. 				 																																	Burdwan: Residents of Bamunpara in Burdwan, about 140 km from the city, went on a rampage at a local pathological clinic on Saturday night after it gave a wrong blood report. The laboratory had diagnosed jaundice but another test showed the patient was suffering from typhoid. 				 																																	Darjeeling: The GNLF-affiliated Himalayan Plantation Workers Union has called a strike on August 4 and 5 in tea gardens. The rival Darjeeling Dooars Terai Chai Kaman Mazdoor Union, affiliated to the CPR-M, has also called a strike on August 5.

 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 A life lost, Northeast students regroup
 SUNANDO SARKARCalcutta, Feb. 22: Living far from home and learning to answer to calls for a Nepali can make everyday problems seem insurmountable. 																								Thats probably what happened with Anthony Sugaijam from Manipur, who took his life at a BE College hostel a few days ago after an unsuccessful stab at a relationship.																								The depression-induced death has had a fallout; it has made students from the Northeast, a growing population here with insurgency claiming their educational institutions as victims, more resolved to avoid a repeat.																								The northeastern students associations in the city  one for each community  have decided to work over-time to fill the void caused by the absence of families. From helping out with accommodation to counselling on the areas to be avoided, from talking someone out of a relationship-related mood-downswing to calling up home if things get out of hand, the associations have decided to do everything for the newcomer lost in the big city.																								They are not lonely hearts clubs, say members, but caution about the extra pressure over and above the blues that a teenager faces at home. These problems can crop up in a safe place like a classroom or a canteen, member of the Sikkim Students Association and history student at Presidency College Jigme Wanchuk said.																								Students from the hills take time to adjust to the man-beat-man-to-Metro-seat world, said Kuki Students Association member and second-year student of Scottish Church College Thenlal Haikop. We have our own pace at home, the student from Manipur explained.																								Besides these, there are some more specific problem-areas like the language barrier that creeps into the classroom. Many classes are conducted in Bengali, a spokesperson of the Naga Students Association said. Initially, even falling back on classmates is difficult as relations take time to develop, she said, recalling how desperate efforts like pleading with teachers were unsuccessful.																								When you are away from home, the usual problems take on menacing proportions, she said, adding: You tend to invest more in special relationships and, when they, too, are of no help, getting driven round the bend is not unnatural.																								The solution, members of these associations say, is talk, talk and talk. Besides the freshers welcomes, which are big events, we have (not virtual) chat-sessions, philosophy student at Presidency, Gulshan Singh from Manipur, said.																								There are two other medicines, say his friends: Sports and the church. Both are antidotes to loneliness... 																								Another help is the directory each association has comprising details of families staying here and the important help-lines.

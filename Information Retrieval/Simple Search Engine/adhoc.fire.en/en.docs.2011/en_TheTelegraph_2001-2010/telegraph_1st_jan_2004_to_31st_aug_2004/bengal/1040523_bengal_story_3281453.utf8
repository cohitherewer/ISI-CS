The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Snakes a turn-off, not wildlife welfare
 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA				 	 The Kids for Tigers ambassadors pose with Bhattacharjee. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Calcutta, May 22: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may be terribly afraid of snakes, but they can still find a place in his heart. 																								It is another departure from the methods of Jyoti Basu, whose hands are allegedly smeared with the blood of a jackal (and her unborn child) that had once howled outside his window. 																								Bhattacharjee showed his commitment to nature in an interaction with school children at Nandan today. Kids for Tigers ambassadors handed him a book of 200,000 signatures collected to save the Royal Bengal Tiger, after which he headed to a conference hall where he fielded questions from students. The evening, to mark International Biodiversity Day, was organised by Aranyak, an NGO in which daughter Suchetana is an active member, and the Association for Social and Environmental Development. 																								While clearing the students concerns, the chief minister kept an eye on the television that was showing the swearing-in of Manmohan Singhs ministry. 																								I want (Priya Ranjan) Das Munshi to become minister; he is my batchmate, bantered the relaxed Bhattacherjee with an associate. 																								Soon Suchetana arrived with a request. 																								Baba, last ekta jinish (Just one more thing).																								Bol (Tell me).																								Era tomar shathe ekta chhobi tulbe (They want to take a picture with you).																								Shanp na niye eley holo (As long as they dont bring a snake with them).																								Das Munshi had been sworn in; the mood was holding. 																								I was walking by a canal one day when a snake jumped out and chased me, Bhattacharjee said to explain his fear. But it would not stand in the way of greater good. Register your organisation and start work, and the (forest) department will help you with the rest, he promised. 																								Amendments to the law to ensure poachers spend at least five to six years in jail, speedy trial at the Jalpaiguri and Midnapore courts and community committees to mobilise involvement and sensitisation of state departments were some of the initiatives Bhattacharjee assured would be taken.

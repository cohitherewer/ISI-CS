The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Biswas spews venom at astrology
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Aug. 9: Murli Manohar Joshi introduced it, Arjun Singh is apathetic to it, Bengal will have none of it. 																								The communist government in Calcutta today lashed out at astrology as a subject in colleges. We shall vehemently oppose if attempts are made to introduce astrology, school education minister Kanti Biswas said. 																								The course made its debut in universities under the patronage of the BJP government. Singh, who has been at the forefront of a drive to purge history books of the changes brought about by predecessor Joshi, has thrown up his hands, saying that if people want to study the subject, they can go ahead. 																								The Supreme Court ruled that there is nothing in the statutes to prevent the University Grants Commission from introducing astrology in universities. 																								We shall convey our reservations to the Centre on this score, Biswas said at a news conference before leaving for Delhi to attend a meeting of the newly reconstituted central advisory board of education ministers tomorrow. He is Bengals sole representative on the board. 																								I will raise the issue in the meeting and urge the Centre to abandon the unscientific proposal, he added.																								A few years ago, Biswas had opposed the chanting of the Saraswati Vandana before an education ministers meet in Delhi and led a walkout in the presence of Joshi. 																								Today, he said: We are not against teaching astronomy, which is very much a branch of science. But our government under no circumstance will allow any of our state-aided universities in Bengal to teach astrology. 																								The government of Tripura and other northeastern states have apparently decided to follow Bengals lead in the issue. 																								Biswas said the board, revived by Singh, will advise the Centre on all matters pertaining to education at all levels.

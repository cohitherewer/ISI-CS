 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Bail for missing case trio 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 17: The Alipore court today granted interim bail to three of the four persons arrested in connection with the disappearance of Sushmita Dhar, but they were not released as the relevant documents could not been submitted within office hours. 																								Debanjan Das, Rajiv Chowdhury and Suparna Banerjee got bail, but Suparnas father Sachin Chandra Banerjee, a retired bureaucrat, was left out as he failed to produce the documents needed for bail. 																								The three were detained at Bhavani Bhavan. While their family members, who had come with food packets, returned without even being allowed to meet them, police continued interrogation. 																								After day-long questioning, the CID believes the information they have gleaned would lead to at least three more arrests. 																								The leads come almost nine years after Sushmitas mysterious disappearance from a seaside cottage at Chandipur, Orissa, in 1995. 																								The CID believes the missing links in the girls disappearance were deliberately left unsolved after pressure from different quarters. 																								Earlier in the day, the court granted three of them bail and asked the CID to submit the case diary on Sushmitas disappearance on July 22. 																								Senior officials took turns to interrogate the three friends after they were not released on bail. 																								Initially we questioned them individually. After recording their statement, we called the trio in a room and asked them to answer our queries. We then interrogated them again and clearly proved the differences in their answers, said a sleuth.

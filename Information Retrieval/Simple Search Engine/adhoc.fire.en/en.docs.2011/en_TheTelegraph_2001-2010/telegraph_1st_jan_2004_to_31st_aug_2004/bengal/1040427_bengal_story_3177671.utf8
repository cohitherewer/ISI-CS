 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Spike gang in net after shootout
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, April 26: Police gunned down a dacoit and villagers awakened by the early-morning burst of shots thrashed two others of a gang that used to plant spikes on the highway and loot vehicles stuck with flattened tyres.																								As the police engaged the band in the shootout at Barol village off Delhi Road in Hooghly, about 85 km from Calcutta, villagers chased about six other gangsters. Five were caught. Two of them had to be hospitalised after the beating. 																								Acting on a tip-off, officer-in-charge of Polba police station Sukomal Das led a team of two armed constables. We heard them planting the spikes and knew that it was the same gang against which we had received several complaints, said Das.																								Superintendent Ajay Kumar later said the gang was active on that stretch of Delhi Road.																								Das said: I asked them to stop and heard bullets whistling past. The dead dacoit was identified as Shahid Alam. Mohammad Babu, who was hospitalised with a bullet in his leg, was nabbed by the villagers some 8 km from Barol. 																								Extremist threat: Alleged Naxalites have pasted posters threatening to kill a CPM local committee secretary of the Borokumari region in Purulias Manbazar-I block. Party leaders in Hooghly had been threatened earlier.

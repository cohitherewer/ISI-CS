 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Age distortion costs job and pay of 25 years 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER  Calcutta, Jan. 14: A Murshidabad  woman lost her government job of 25 years today when Calcutta  High Court set aside her appointment given in April 1979  on the ground that she was underage when she joined. 																								The court also asked her to refund the entire amount she received as salary during these years to the government. Basanti Basu Sarkar, 40, is left with no alternative but to declare herself bankrupt. 																								Her tragic tale begins with the untimely death of her father, a peon in the Murshidabad Judges Court. As he died in harness, she was offered the job of a typist there. 																								Before joining, Basanti submitted her Madhyamik examination admit card to the authorities where her date of birth was given as April 15, 1961. 																								After joining, in her written declaration she gave a false statement that she was born on April 15, 1960, and not 1961. If she had said the truth, she would not have got the job because she was not above 18 years at that time. 																								Her trauma began soon after when the authorities found out the discrepancy between the Madhyamik card and the declaration she had given. A departmental proceeding was started against her. 																								Basanti filed a petition before the district judge in Murshidabad, demanding that the proceedings against her be quashed. 																								The court of the district judge, after hearing both sides, struck down her appointment in 1980 and asked her to leave the job.																								She filed an appeal in Calcutta High Court against the ruling in the same year. Soon after the case was filed, the high court ordered an interim stay on the ruling of the district judge and fixed the matter for final hearing. The stay order helped Basanti continue with her service. 																								During the last 24 years, the case was heard only 13 times. After a long wait, the matter came up last December before Justice Barin Ghosh. 																								Justice Ghosh heard all the parties, including the state government, and said Basantis appointment was unjust. He vacated the earlier stay order of the high court and upheld the order of the Murshidabad district judge.																								Justice Ghosh also said the petitioner should refund the money she had received as salary from the government during the period of her service.

				 																																	Purulia, June 16: A couple was killed last night by their uncle and his family after a quarrel over the construction of a septic tank at Adra, about 280 km from Calcutta. Seven persons have been arrested.				 																																	Sankar Prasad Sau, 54, a railway employee started digging for the tank, but his nephew stopped him as it was next to his kitchen. Around 10 pm, Saus family went over to the 35-year-old Lalans house to negotiate. A quarrel ensued and Saus family hacked them with sharp weapons they were carrying. Lalan died on the spot, his wife on the way to hospital. 				 																																	Calcutta: Three miscreants were rounded up from different parts of Calcutta and the Rs 68,000 they had snatched from an employee of a jam and jelly manufacturing unit were recovered. They had knocked cold Amrita Lal Chatterjee, 56, when he was passing by Hazi Mohammad Square on the way to a bank at Mullickbazar and fled with the money. 				 																																	Calcutta: The government plans to introduce a bill restricting the indiscriminate tapping of underground water and filling of water bodies in the next session of Assembly starting June 30. The water table in some areas of Calcutta hovers between six to 11 metres below the sea level. The state water investigation directorate will now closely scrutinise all applications for use of submersible pumps and restrict their rampant use.				 																																	Durgapur: Two police officers and a dacoit were injured in an encounter in Belunia forest in Ranigunj on Wednesday night. As soon as police reached on a tip-off, the robbers started firing and hurling bombs, forcing the police to return fire. The three have been admitted in hospital.

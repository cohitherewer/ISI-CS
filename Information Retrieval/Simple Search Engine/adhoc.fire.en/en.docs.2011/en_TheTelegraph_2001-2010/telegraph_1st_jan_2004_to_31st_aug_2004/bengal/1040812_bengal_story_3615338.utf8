The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Sourav asked to bat on a green top
 OUR CORRESPONDENTJalpaiguri, Aug. 11: If the Jalpaiguri Mancha has its way, Sourav Ganguly could soon be batting on a new wicket.																								The apolitical body spearheading the movement for an alternative alignment of the East-West Corridor has decided to seek the help of the Team India skipper to add steam to its campaign. 																								The decision to tap Sourav came after the captain and his deputy, Rahul Dravid, distributed leaflets yesterday calling on people to protect the forest resources of the region. With pacer Irfan Pathan, the duo was in Siliguri to open a sports gallery at the Kanchenjunga Stadium. 																								At a programme on bio-diversity awareness, Dravid appealed to love, protect and conserve the bio-diversity of north Bengal... home to the endangered red panda, tiger, elephant and the one-horned rhino.... Please ensure that when we go abroad to play we can with pride cite the example of north Bengals unique bio-diversity, our national wealth. Sourav made the same appeal in Bengali. 																								The Mancha had been insisting on an alternative alignment of the East-West corridor, an arm of the Golden Quadrilateral connecting the Northeast with north India, instead of the one that will pass through wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. 																								What the skipper said vindicates us. His appeal indicates the importance of the rich bio-diversity of this region, said a Mancha official.

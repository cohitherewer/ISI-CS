The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Association value education for teachers
 MITA MUKHERJEE 																								Calcutta, June 20: The CPM-controlled schoolteachers body has come out with a book of values to fight loss of ideals among teachers bunking classes and busy with private tuition.																								In its attempt to indoctrinate teachers with the spirit of dedication and sacrifice, the All Bengal Teachers Association released Acharya Kahini (Tales of Scholars) this morning.																								The compilation of short stories and essays on commitment of teachers of yesteryears is ABTAs first attempt to educate members in the values of the noble profession. 																								 Twenty stories by legendary figures of Bengal who dedicated their lives to education have found place in the book. Each writing speaks highly about the nobleness of the profession. They also tell a lot on how teachers of those days had spread the light of education despite innumerable obstacles, school education minister Kanti Biswas said after unveiling the book. 																								The collection includes Gurubhakti by Vidyasagar, Mastarmoshai by Rabindranath Tagore, Panditmoshai by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay, Headmaster by Tarashankar Bandyopadhyay, Teacher by Manik Bandyopadhyay and Headmistress by Narendranath Mitra.																								An official of the teachers body, which assists the government in framing and implementing school education policies, said the book contains stories that highlight the contribution of teachers till the middle of the last century. The second volume will cover post-Independence teachers and the third the contribution of modern teachers. 																								It is regrettable that schoolteachers are no longer honoured the way they used to be. The general opinion is that the profession has become ignoble and there is no doubt that teachers engaged in private tuition are responsible for that, said Prasanta Das, an ABTA spokesman.

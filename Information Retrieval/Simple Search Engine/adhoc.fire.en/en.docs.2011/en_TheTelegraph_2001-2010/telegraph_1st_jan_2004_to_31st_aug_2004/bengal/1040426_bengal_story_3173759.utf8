 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Allegations and anger rock hospital 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, April 25: A mob converged on the district hospital here within minutes of the death of a new-born and went on the rampage. 																								Police were prompt in preventing the situation from spinning out of control but a guard was beaten up by then.																								Hospital sources said Monica Pande was admitted on Wednesday with pain in her abdomen. Gynaecologist Ranjit Roychowdhury examined her and said it would take three more months for delivery. She was released. However, Monica experienced labour pain on Friday morning and had to be readmitted. A girl was born the next morning but with complications. Monicas husband Bikash was then apparently sent looking for a child specialist. He could not find any in the hospital. 																								Bikash said: If the hospital had arranged a specialist, my baby wouldnt have died. He also alleged that the guard tried to shoo him away, saying it was not the visiting hour and he could not enter the ward.																								The Murshidabad chief medical officer of health said an inquiry has been ordered.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, August 30, 2004 				 Sky-roof school 
																								More than 250 students of a primary school at Kandi in Murshidabad are attending classes in the open for over a week as the owner of a plot through which they used to go to school has erected a brick wall around it.																								The five teachers of Jibanti Primary School, 220 km from Calcutta, have asked the children to attend classes on a ground beside a bamboo grove. The students, who have been told to bring plastic sheets to sit on, are braving rain clouds and occasional showers.																								Sweta Chandra, the district primary school council chief, said: We are aware of the situation. But she did not suggest a remedy. Picture by Jhunjhun

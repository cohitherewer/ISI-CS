 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, April 15: The Congress is keeping its options open on seeking help from the Left to form a government at the Centre after the Lok Sabha polls.																								The partys working committee member and state chief, Pranab Mukherjee, said if the Congress does not secure an absolute majority but is in a position to stake claim to power, it will not be possible to ignore the communists in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. 																								In that case, it will not be possible for us to set up a platform at the national level without the three states. But such a post-poll situation is yet to arrive and it is too early to comment, Mukherjee said.																								A candidate from Jangipur in Murshidabad, Mukherjee said the party has forged pre-poll pacts with several parties, including the DMK in Tamil Nadu, the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar, the Nationalist Congress Party in Maharashtra and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. We do not have any plan of entering an alliance with the Left parties, he said, and added in the same breath that there is little possibility of his party getting a majority on its own.																								Reacting to state CPM secretary Anil Biswas statement earlier this week that the party would consider a post-poll alliance with the Congress if it alters its economic policy, Mukherjee said: The Congress has always formulated the national agenda. Other parties have followed it. 																								Biswas said the formation of a government in Delhi would depend neither on the Congress nor the BJP. Regional secular parties will be the main force and the CPM and the Left parties will play a major role.																								In his reaction to Mukherjees claim that the Congress has always been the lead policy-maker, Biswas said: Regional parties are controlling Indian politics since 1985-86 because the Congress lost its grip in national politics. Before that, it deprived states where it was not in power. 																								The CPM leader welcomed BJP state president Tathagata Roys statement that the party will file a habeas corpus on the disappearance of Manisha Mukherjee nine years ago. The then deputy controller of examinations of Calcutta University, Manisha was known to be close to several top CPM leaders. 																								We welcome his decision. We will be grateful to any party or individual who helps us or the government trace Mukherjee, Biswas said.

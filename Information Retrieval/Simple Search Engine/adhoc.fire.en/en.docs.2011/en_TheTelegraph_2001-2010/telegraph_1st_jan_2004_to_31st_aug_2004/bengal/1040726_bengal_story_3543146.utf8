 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Arm-twist slur on CPM 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 25: A candidate for the post of typist in a district court has moved Calcutta High Court, alleging that the ruling CPM had forced the judge to recruit its nominees for the vacancies. 																								Mahesh Chandra Roy has contended that a powerful leader of the partys North Dinajpur district co-ordination committee used his political influence to force the district judge to appoint his daughter in the fast track court. He has furnished documents to back his claim. 																								Early this year, the North Dinajpur district judge asked the employment authorities to send names of SC/ST candidates to fill up the posts of a stenographer and a typist at the court. The employment exchange sent up 27 names and a written test was held to select two. 																								Sonali Biswas and Pradipta Biswas, the children of CPM leader Pradip Biswas, were selected. 																								As the posts were being filled up on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls in April-May, the chief election officer directed the district judge to postpone the appointments. Accordingly, the judge announced that the appointments would be made after the elections. 																								In the meantime, a section of employees of the district court and members of the district bar association raised their voice against the selection and demanded an inquiry. 																								On July 7, the district judge was replaced. The new judge declared only two of the 27 candidates had cleared the test  Sonali, who scored 16 out of 20, and Bithika Mondal, who got seven. 																								The district judge mentioned that the other candidates failed to score and issued appointment letters to the two. 																								The petitioner claims he has definite information the CPM leader met the new judge soon after his appointment and compelled him to appoint Sonali. Roy has sought an order for a thorough inquiry into the matter. 																								The entire judicial system may become politicised if such practices are not stopped, he said.

 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Bio fuel to run trains
 KUMARESH GHOSH AND NARESH JANA																								Midnapore, June 24: Bio-diesel locomotives will run in Bengal soon, a move that could help save Indian Railways a large sum on fuel consumption.																								Shakeel Ahmed, the newly-appointed divisional railway manager of Kharagpur division, said the railway has signed a memorandum of understanding with Indian Oil Corporation in Delhi to extract bio-diesel from the seeds of the jatropha curcas plant, which is plentiful in the dry and arid regions of West Midnapore.																								Ahmed and a former member of the railway board said: This will revolutionise the cost structure of running locomotives in the country. We have just planted over two lakh saplings of the plant in the region to help us get bio-diesel.																								Naresh Kaushik, a scientist from Haryana Agricultural University who is here, said the seeds of the plant, locally known as jamal gota, have a high carbon content, which matches the fuel quality of fossil diesel.																								The oil is extracted from the seeds and than chemically treated in a plant to provide high quantity of diesel, he added.																								At present, the railway runs 4,400 locomotives on diesel while 2,800 engines are electrical.																								The proposed move envisages 78 bio-diesel locomotives comprising goods trains and some passenger trains running on the Kharagpur section. The exact distance and the routes of the trains are yet to be finalised, a senior official said.																								Railway authorities have also decided to set up a special extraction and esterification plant inside the diesel shed at the Kharagpur railway workshop.																								The Kharagpur division will be the first in the country to run long-distance trains on bio-diesel, Ahmed added.																								The cost of producing a litre of bio-diesel is Rs 15, nearly half that of refined diesel (Rs 32 for a litre).																								We have already carried out a trial run of the diesel locomotive (Swarnajayanti Satabdi Express) and have been satisfied with the eco-friendly behaviour and pollution-free nature of bio-diesel, said a mechanical engineer from Aligarh University who is involved in the project.

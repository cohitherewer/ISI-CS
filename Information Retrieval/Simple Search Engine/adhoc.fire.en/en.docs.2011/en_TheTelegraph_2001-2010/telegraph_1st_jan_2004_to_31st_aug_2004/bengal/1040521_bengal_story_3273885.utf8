 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 No-entry amp; horror tales greet rights boss at home
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 20: On a surprise visit to the home for destitute women at Howrahs Liluah, Shyamal Kumar Sen was denied entry for being an adult male.																								Senior officials recognised the state human rights commission chairman, retired judge Shyamal Kumar Sen, and led him in. But what he saw inside left him appalled. 																								We hear that one inmate of this home flees every month. A dozen women escape from this place every year? he asked the officials, who groped for an answer. Last year, about a couple of dozen women fled the home, about 10 km from Calcutta.																								After a round of the complex and its two-storeyed building, Sen said: The premises is unhygienic and it is unimaginable how the girls stay here. 																								The home can accommodate 300 inmates. 																								Accompanied by five rights panel officials, Sen spoke to over 50 of them and heard their horror tales and allegations against the authorities.																								Nandita Meher, who was rescued by police last year when she was about to be sold off, told the rights panel chief that they were not given adequate food. They torture us physically and mentally. Often in the name of mental treatment, they make us take sedatives that keep us drowsy through the day, she said.																								Another inmate, Sangita Iyer, echoed Nandita. She stole a glance at a couple of attendants and said: They will beat us once the babus leave.																								Sen saw the overflowing drains and suffered the stench. Bleaching powder was generously sprayed minutes before Sen saw them but that could not cover up the squalour.																								After a meeting with the officials, Sen said he would submit a report to the government and recommend action.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Suri (Birbhum), Feb. 10: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today called on teachers to be conscientious and do justice to their high salary.																								Addressing a rally after unveiling an indoor stadium here, 210 km from Calcutta, Bhattacharjee said teachers did not enjoy the same facilities and honour during Congress rule. 																								Teachers were a neglected lot in the Congress period. But these days, they are most honoured and respected. So, I want teachers to attend classes regularly for the sake of students, he said.																								The chief minister also referred to the handsome salary schoolteachers get.																								He advised them to lay emphasis on primary education. Teachers should keep it in mind that primary education is a foundation for a student to build his future, said Bhattacharjee. 																								He regretted that nearly seven lakh children do not get elementary education in the state. We have to build up a situation in which every body gets elementary education, he said.																								The chief minister announced that the government would set up two more medical colleges. We have already applied for permission but are to get the nod from the Medical Council of India, he said.

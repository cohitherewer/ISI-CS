The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Salary freeze on doctor duo
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, March 9: Salaries have been withheld and showcause notices slapped on two doctors of Katwa Subdivisional Hospital for alleged dereliction of duty. 																								Milan Modak and Somnath Ghosh have been barred from drawing their salaries for February. Hospital superintendent Gautam Ghosh said: We showcaused the doctors after an inquiry into the charges against them but they failed to reply in time. We are now proceeding against them according to rules. 																								Ghosh and Modak were deputed to the hospital from Calcutta and Barrackpore as practising surgeon and medical officer about eight months ago. Sources said they were allotted quarters at Katwa, but stayed in Calcutta most of the time. 																								Both the doctors were accused of working in nursing homes during hospital duty hours. Modak was also charged with neglect after a child died of tetanus following an operation on his fractured arm. 																								Modak could not be contacted, but Ghosh said he had intended to give a verbal reply to the showcause. But the authorities did not give me a chance. All that I can say is that the allegations are not true, Ghosh added.

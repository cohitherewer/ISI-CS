				 																																	Calcutta, Aug. 16: A committee formed as part of the delimitation exercise has chalked out the size of Assembly constituencies according to the 2001 census.

Darjeeling, the Dinajpurs, Malda, Murshidabad and Nadia will gain seats while Hooghly, West Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura, Burdwan and Birbhum would lose. 				 																																	Calcutta: Power cuts continued on Monday as the shortfall in the state electricity board-served areas shot up to 250 MW in the evening. The deficit in the city and its neighbourhood was about 150 MW. A 60-MW CESC unit at Titagarh, North 24-Parganas, is shut since Saturday. A 210-MW unit in Bandel has collapsed and Kolaghat is generating less.

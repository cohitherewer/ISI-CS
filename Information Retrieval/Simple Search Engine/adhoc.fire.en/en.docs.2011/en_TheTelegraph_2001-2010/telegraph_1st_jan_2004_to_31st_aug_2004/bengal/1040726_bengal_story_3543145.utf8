The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Bengal learns to speak the language of business
 SWATI SENGUPTA Calcutta, July 25: Money talks. And for money, Bengal is speaking Chinese. 																								When a 70-plus delegation from China  the largest ever to India  attends the India-China Business Conclave here on August 6, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will give his quest for investment in the state a new idiom. 																								Sources said he is likely to say a few words in Chinese as a gesture of warmth. Besides, the chief ministers speech, which he will deliver in English, will be translated. 																								Above all, the governments presentation showcasing Bengal would be in Chinese. 																								I have been asked to prepare the governments presentation, which would then be translated to Chinese. Professional interpreters from a well-known language school will be engaged for translating the presentation. There is still some time left and the details have not been worked out we should be ready with it by August 3 or 4, said Gopal Krishna, the managing director of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC). 																								The presentation contents are different every time. However, we do highlight some broad areas about the state, where we are strong and sectors in which we want to do business with the country concerned. We are likely to highlight sectors like iron and steel, plastics, food processing, leather, gems and jewellery, tea, jute and so on for China as well, he added. 																								Bhattacharjee and vice-governor of Chinas Yunnan province will jointly inaugurate the conclave, being organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Businessmen and government officials from across India and several provinces of China will attend. 																								The main presentation of the government  likely to be 10 to 12 minutes long  would be presented by someone who is very comfortable in Chinese, said Krishna. A senior government official will present it simultaneously in English. 																								The WBIDC chief admitted the government is now increasingly focusing on the language business. It doesnt take much time to prepare a translated version, but creates a much better impact, he said.																								It is best to speak in the language of those you want to reach out to, rather than leaving them with information that makes them struggle to understand the language they are not comfortable with, Amitav Khosla of CII said. 																								Serious thought is being given only now, but it is not the first time the state will speak a different tongue. The first time a presentation was made in a language other than English was possibly about two years ago, when a Japanese delegation was in town, Krishna said. 																								Last year, when Bhattacharjee went to Italy, all the promotional matter was in Italian. 																								Commenting on the benefit of speaking the investors language, a government official said: This helps in relating to the investors and definitely has some impact.

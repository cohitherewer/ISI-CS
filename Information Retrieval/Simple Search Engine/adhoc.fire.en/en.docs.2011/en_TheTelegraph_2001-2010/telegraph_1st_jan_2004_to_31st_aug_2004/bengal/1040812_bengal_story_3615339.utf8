The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Sterilisation at hand for food exporters
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Calcutta, Aug. 11: Exporters in Bengal and the rest of the eastern region dealing in perishable edibles and healthcare products will no longer have to go to Mumbai for sterilising their goods by radioactive treatment (atomic irradiation). They can do it closer home and send bacteria-free shipments abroad from here.																								A city-based group has set up the regions first commercial atomic irradiation plant at Dankuni, 15 km from Calcutta. For Hooghly, the district where the plant will be located, the estimated investment of Rs 10 crore is one of the largest in recent years.																								Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee will commission the plant on August 21. Also present will be the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Anil Kakodkar.																								Sanjay Sureka, MD, Sureka group, said the Dankuni unit  the fourth in the country after the ones in operation in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore  has been set up with assistance from the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology of the department of atomic energy. The unit, named Organic Green Foods Limited, has the capacity to sterilise 20 15-kg boxes an hour. It will cost about Rs 200-250 to sterilise each box.																								Food items, medical and surgical equipment, medicine, synthetic nipples for feeding bottles and other items have to be sterilised and made absolutely bacteria-free if they are to be exported. Through this atomic irradiation process, this kind of irradiation is possible, Sureka said.																								At present, ethylene oxide is used in this part of the country. They (the Centre) have already issued a circular banning use of ethylene oxide as sterilising agents from 2005, Sureka said.																								Apparently, the advantage of radioactive sterilisation is that it does not affect freshness and nutritional value of fruits, vegetables and other edible items. 																								Besides, sterilisation by irradiation increases the shelf-life of packed foods.

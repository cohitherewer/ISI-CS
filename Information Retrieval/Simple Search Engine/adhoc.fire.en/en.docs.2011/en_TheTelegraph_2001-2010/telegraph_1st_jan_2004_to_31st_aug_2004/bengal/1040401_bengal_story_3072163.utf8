The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Pranab, Mousumi get contest nod 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, March 31: State Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee, who holds the record as the longest-serving member of the Rajya Sabha, is seeking to make his maiden entry to the Lok Sabha. 																								After weeks of uncertainty over his candidature, the party high command finally gave him the nod today to enter the fray from Jangipur in Murshidabad, a seat held by the CPM in the dissolved Lok Sabha. 																								Though Mukherjee wanted to fight the election from Jangipur, it had appeared that he might not be fielded as party chief Sonia Gandhi was keen on his presence in Delhi to manage the partys poll efforts at the national level. Sonia has, however, bowed to Mukherjees wishes. 																								Mukherjee, the partys chief whip in the Upper House, is the senior-most leader to contest as, barring Sonia, most of his colleagues in the party leadership have virtually developed cold feet about entering the fray. 																								Besides, Mukherjee from Jangipur, the central leadership also named nine other candidates for Bengal. The star attraction on the list is Bollywood actress of yesteryears Mousumi Chatterjee, who will take on Nationalist Trinamul Congress veteran Ajit Panja in his Calcutta Northeast constituency. 																								Mousumi, who joined the Congress recently, is the second star candidate the party has pitted against Trinamul. It has already thrown up a challenge to Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee in Calcutta South in former Miss India Nafisa Ali. 																								The other candidates are Jadavpur University faculty member Om Prakash Mishra for Jadavpur, Tapas Banerjee for Asansol, Kitendra Mohan Sahu for Contai, Dawa Narbula for Darjeeling, Nripen Hawladar for Nabadweep, Syed Mohammad Nizamuddin Ali for Basirhat, Prof. Manoranjan Haldar for Mathurapur and Tapas Majumdar for Dum Dum. 																								The party had earlier named nominees for 27 of the 42 Bengal seats in two instalments. The party will not field candidates in five seats. While it has extended support to rebel Trinamul leader Sudip Bandopadhyay in Calcutta Northwest, two seats have been left for Saifuddin Chaudhurys Peoples Democratic Front and one each for the Nationalist Congress Party and the Republican Party of India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Girl children toil more for less
 SWATI SENGUPTA Calcutta, March 21: More girls than boys in Bengal roll bidis, lift bricks, break coal or stone, sow rice and wash plates to earn a livelihood.																								A sharp increase in girl child labour has come to light in the State Plan of Action for Children 2003, a report compiled by the states social welfare department and the Unicef.																								The report says there has been a decline in incidence of children (5-14 years) in work for male children but a very sharp increase in the case of female children between the two rounds (of National Sample Survey Organisation).																								The first round in 1993-1994 had registered 2.91 lakh girls of age 5-14 engaged in work, and 4.83 lakh boys. The 1999-2000 survey showed a sharp rise to 4.38 lakh for girls with the figure for boys down to 3.48 lakh.																								This rise in girl child labour is disturbing because the total increase in child labour has been little in comparison, an official associated with the report said. The reasons are not very clear to the government. It does not appear that more people are now sending their sons to school and engaging daughters in work, the official said.																								But the report says: They (children) are engaged within familyThis pattern is very common in rural areas, especially among girl children, where they are engaged in looking after their younger siblings and attending to domestic chores for which they are not paid any wages.																								It is also possible that the girls are either paid less, though that is illegal, or because women at work are more docile and less unionised, the official added.

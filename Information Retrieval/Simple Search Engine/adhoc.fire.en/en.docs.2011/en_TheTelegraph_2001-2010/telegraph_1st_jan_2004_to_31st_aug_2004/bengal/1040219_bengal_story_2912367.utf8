The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Furious Mamata snubs Sudips wife 
 BARUN GHOSH 				 	 Nayna: Humiliated 																								Calcutta, Feb. 18: Trinamul Congress rebel Sudip Bandopadhyays actress-turned-legislator wife Nayna is undecided on her next course of action as her attempt to broker peace between her husband, who seems set to contest from Calcutta Northwest against his partys wishes, and Mamata Banerjee last night left her humiliated. 																								I will have to campaign for my husband if he enters the fray as an Independent but at the same time I dont want to quit the Trinamul Congress with which I have been closely associated. I love Didi (Mamata) so much that I cannot bear the thought of parting with her. I feel harassed and also very humiliated. I dont know what I should do at this moment, Nayna said this evening. 																								Minutes before offering puja after a day-long fast on the occasion of Shivaratri  a festival to pray for ones husbands well-being, Nayna said she is concerned about Bandopadhyays welfare. As a wife I would like to share my husbands ordeal, she said. 																								Breaking her silence on the controversy centring on Bandopadhyay, Nayna last night stepped in to broker peace with Mamata. I telephoned her to explain how we are still close to her as we were in those days. But Didi is furious and refused to hear anything from me. Believe me, I was so humiliated that I could not request her to think again about Sudips re-nomination from his old seat, she said. 																								Nayna, Trinamul MLA from Bowbazar which falls within Calcutta Northwest, felt it was unjust of the leadership to ask Bandopadhyay to contest from Raiganj with which he is not even remotely connected. I dont know what Sudip will do ultimately but several party workers in my Bowbazar constituency are demanding that he be re-nominated from the old seat. He has to seek re-election from the old seat at least to oblige the electorate, she added. 																								Trinamul leaders said Nayna risks disciplinary action if she shares the dais with Bandopadhyay in the event of his contesting from Calcutta Northwest as an Independent. 																								Bandopadhyay was feeling equally humiliated as the party did not answer his second letter requesting that he be allowed to contest from the seat he won in 1999. Those at the helm of affairs in the organisation do not have the courtesy to write back to me. This is an insult, he said.

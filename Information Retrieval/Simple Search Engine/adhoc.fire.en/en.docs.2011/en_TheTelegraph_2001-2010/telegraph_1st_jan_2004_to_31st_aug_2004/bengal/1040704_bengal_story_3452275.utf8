The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 No-entry signal to trucks
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 3: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today made it clear that trucks would not be allowed to enter the city to ease traffic congestion and reduce pollution. 																								At present, entry and movement of trucks within the city limits is restricted between 9 am and 9 pm on working days. 																								Nearly 50,000 trucks enter the city daily and if we can stop their entry and relocate wholesale markets from the city, then traffic congestion will definitely be eased. Besides, auto emission will also be reduced to a certain extent. This will help people of Calcutta get a pollution-free life in the city, Bhattacharjee said.																								He was inaugurating the Dhulagarh truck terminal, one of the largest in the country, off National Highway 6 in Howrah. 																								The terminal, a joint venture between the government and the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation, has been built on 100 acres at a cost of about Rs 40 crore. Apart from provision to accommodate 7,000 trucks, all basic amenities are available in the complex. 																								Bhattacharjee said six more truck terminals are coming up at Rajarhat, Dakshineswar, Dankuni, Budge Budge and Kona. 																								The chief minister added that slow-moving vehicles like trams are causing traffic congestion. Time has come that we should opt for modern, sophisticated mode of speedy transport in the city. Vehicles like trams are outdated mode of transport as they block a major portion of roads causing inconvenience to commuters, he said, in presence of transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and other senior officials. 																								We are opting for speedy vehicles which will cover less road space and benefit a majority of the people, he said. 																								The chief minister said five foreign companies have shown interest in introducing different types of modern modes of transport and the government will soon float a global tender.																								Traffic congestion in the city is a major cause of concern for the government as the number of vehicles is rapidly increasing but there is virtually no scope to construct new roads or widen the existing ones. 																								Bhattacharjee said two townships, one at West Howrah and another at Shibpur, are coming up in Howrah. A foreign firm has shown interest. I am holding meetings with the executives on July 7 and a final decision will be taken there.

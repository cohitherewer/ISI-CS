 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Report sidesteps judge molest slur minefield
 TAPAS GHOSH AND SWATI SENGUPTA 																								Calcutta, March 17: The report of a probe into the molestation charges against Dibakar Das, the chief judicial magistrate of the Malda district court, has avoided any conclusive remark, saying no final comment ought to be made when police are conducting an inquiry. 																								However, it does contain some adverse comments on Das conduct, quoting several people who know him. 																								The report of the probe conducted by high court registrar, judicial services, Arunava Bose, at Malda will be placed before a full bench of Calcutta High Court next week.																								Portions of the report have sparked a controversy among judges in the high court and the judicial services officials in Writers Buildings. 																								Many judges feel departmental proceedings should not be initiated against Das because once a step is taken against him by the high court, the normal police investigation reports would no longer carry weight. Others feel the court must set a precedent in taking departmental action against him if Boses report finds that the allegations are true or if it makes adverse comments on his conduct. 																								Let police continue with their investigation. Why should it be influenced by any action taken by the administrative section of the high court? a senior official at Writers Buildings said. 																								Two WBCS probationers undergoing a year-long training in administrative and legal procedures at Malda filed separate complaints at Englishbazar police station on February 21, charging Das with molestation. 																								One of them said an inebriated Das had held her in an embrace against her wish and the other said he had passed lewd comments at her. 																								The high court had sent Bose to Malda last month to probe the charges and asked him to submit a report to the courts administrative section. 																								The West Bengal Judicial Services Association, however, is now primarily focused on the fact that Das was picked up by the police and kept waiting at Englishbazar police station for nearly five hours. Police officials have spoken in two voices, once saying Das was arrested and released on bail and again that he was merely detained. 																								This aspect of the report is crucial to us because it will make it clear whether police have the right to detain an official of the judicial services without prior permission from higher authorities, a member of the association said.

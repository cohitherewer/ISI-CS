The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Oil fire doused after 70 hours
 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 																								Rajbandh, June 6: The fire in a petrol tank at the Indian Oil Corporation installation here was put out today, 70 hours after a bolt of lightning triggered it.																								The town around the terminal, about 180 km from Calcutta, trudged back to its regular chores and firemen wore a relaxed look after what was for many of them the most demanding assignment ever.																								The crisis period is over and now there is no chance of either the tank collapsing or an explosion. However, the cooling process should continue for a day or two before normal activities can be taken up, IOC spokesman S.K. Tripathi said in Calcutta.																								Residents of Rajbandh and neighbouring Monikara, Gopalpur and Panagarh, who had fled after the fire broke out, are coming back. People have started returning home. We are thankful to the fire-fighters who fought against all odds risking their own lives since Thursday evening, said Osman Ghani, the Durgapur subdivisional officer.																								I will send an officer of the rank of deputy magistrate to inspect the accident site and the safety measures at the oil terminal tomorrow. We would also provide suggestions to the IOC authorities about the safety measures that need to be taken up at the installation to avoid a disaster in future, Ghani said.																								The IOC spokesman said: Supply of petrol from the terminal would take a few days to resume. But I must thank all those who helped us during the disaster. We will hold a news conference in Calcutta tomorrow regarding the incident. 																								The West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association allayed fears of a fuel crisis in the region. Its spokesman Biswadeep Roychoudhury said: There is no crisis in the steel township and we are getting fuel from Hindusthan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and other companies. There is enough fuel at the pumps.																								Sikha Das, who fled with her two daughters anticipating an explosion, was home last night. I went to my relatives at Shyampur and came back last night once I came to know that there was no risk anymore.

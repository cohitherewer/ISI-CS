The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 After Shah push, CU takes a step
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								Calcutta, March 15: Ticked off by governor Viren J. Shah, Calcutta University has begun a process that will lead to the trimming of teachers representatives on governing bodies of undergraduate colleges affiliated to it.																								The universitys highest policy-making body, the syndicate, has set up a panel to examine and give effect to a recommendation of the council for higher education to curtail the number of teachers on the college bodies.																								We are going to formulate our approach only after obtaining the opinion of the committee that the syndicate has set up, vice-chancellor Ashis Banerjee said. He did not explain the delay in implementing the recommendation made in 2000. 																								The council had urged the university to reconstitute the governing bodies by reducing the number of teachers and non-teaching employees representatives. However, the varsity did nothing lest compliance with the recommendation offend a large CPM support base  teachers.																								Council chairman Subimal Sen today said it had expected the varsity to respond to the recommendation earlier. It (the recommendation) was made much before I took over... They should have responded earlier. We could not do anything about the delay because we can recommend measures for education reforms but cannot punish a university for not accepting them, Sen said.																								Shah, the university chancellor, raised questions on the fate of the councils recommendations a few weeks ago. He (Shah) had asked the university what it had done about them, an education department official said.																								A college now has four teachers, two non-teaching employees and a student in its governing body. The council recommended that the number of teachers be brought down to two and non-teaching employees to one. 																								Council member Shyamapada Pal said they wanted the governing bodies to be compact so that they could take prompt decisions. There are many colleges with 10 to 15 teachers. If four of them are elected to the governing body, the students suffer as they get busy attending meetings rather than classes, Pal said. 																								The council had also suggested that the university representative in the governing body be a retired teacher.																								University and college teachers feel that the moves will hurt their fraternity. A move is afoot to keep working teachers out of governing bodies, said a senior leader of the CPM-controlled West Bengal College University Teachers Association. Two representatives for about a hundred teachers, which many colleges have, would be odd.

 															- Sourav gives for hospital, gets academy reins OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Sourav Ganguly meets Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings. Picture by Pradip Sanyal 																								Calcutta, Feb. 18: Sourav Ganguly and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today authored a perfect partnership, a la Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman, albeit off a cricket pitch. 																								During a meeting at Writers Buildings this afternoon, the chief minister unveiled plans to set up a cricket academy in Calcutta with the Team India captain as the driving force behind it. 																								And Sourav handed over a cheque for Rs 70.87 lakh  he had raised the money by auctioning his cricket gear  for a new paediatric intensive care unit at the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children at Beliaghata. The new unit  being constructed at a cost of Rs 1 crore  will be named after Sourav. 																								We have asked Sourav to take charge of the cricket academy we have planned. We have not yet decided on the site. It may be in Salt Lake or Behala. We will decide on it after discussing it with Sourav, said Bhattacharjee. 																								Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, who was present at the meeting, said this evening that the academy would be set up in Salt Lake on land given by the government. A branch would be opened in Behala and, at a later juncture, in north Bengal. 																								A cricket buff himself, Bhattacharjee held discussions with Ganguly about the national and international cricketers who could be involved as coaches. 																								Sourav has already spoken to Greg Chappell about it. I did not know that the great off-spinner Erapalli Prasanna is in Calcutta now. We will contact him. We will also approach some other famous cricket personalities at the national and international level, said the chief minister. 																								He said the Indian skipper also had several plans about the academy. Whenever Sourav will be in Calcutta, we will discuss with him to take our project forward, he added. 																								Bhattacherjee said his government decided to construct the ICU at the B.C. Roy hospital following a tremendous rush of patients from across the state to the speciality clinic. 																								At the time we were thinking of expanding and upgrading the hospital, we sought financial help from various quarters, including the Centre. When we did not receive adequate response, I asked Sourav one day whether he could do something about it. He immediately agreed and auctioned his bats, gloves and other cricketing gear to raise the money, said the chief minister, expanding on the government-Ganguly partnership.

 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Sens harmony sermon to employers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 17: Industrial harmony can be achieved only if employers stick to the rules on paying basic minimum wages and benefits, industry minister Nirupam Sen said today.																								There have been reports that in some units, workers are even denied the basic minimum wages and other benefits to which they are entitled according to (the) law of the land, he said at the 103rd annual general meeting of the Bharat Chamber of Commerce.																								Productivity, Sen said, is two-way traffic and denial of workers basic rights would hardly help build a congenial industrial atmosphere.																								The government has unequivocally declared its belief in responsible trade unionism and said opportunism of any kind could not be allowed to hinder industrial development.																								Sen, however, said it is up to the management to create congenial conditions for workers. Workers have to feel they are working not only for the interests of the unit and the employer, but (also) for themselves.																								Urging chambers of commerce to ensure their members comply with the norms regarding wages and benefits, Sen said the government was taking a serious look at the issue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Mother who shielded and teaser son denied bail
 OUR LEGAL REPORTERCalcutta, March 11: Sayantani Pathak, who was to appear in this years higher secondary examinations, was fed up with relentless pestering by a boy a class junior to her. She slapped Aditya Das. His mother sprang to his defence and humiliated her to an extent that Sayantani committed suicide.																								Calcutta High Court today rejected the bail prayer of Aditya and his mother Indrani. The mother-son duo was arrested following a complaint lodged by Sayantanis family on February 27. 																								Aditya had proposed Sayantani, a bright student of Krishnagar Brajabala Balika Vidyalaya. He was slapped on the face when, after days of taunt, he dared to block her way.																								On February 27, Indrani stopped Sayantani on her way to a coaching class and threatened dire consequences if she did not apologise to Aditya.																								That night, Sayantani consumed pesticide. The next day, she died at Krishnagar Sadar Hospital. Her family went to the police. Aditya and his mother were arrested on March 5.																								Their counsel told the court today that they had been falsely implicated in the case. It is a case of suicide and the petitioners have no connection with the death, he said. Some local people, the counsel added, have influenced the family members of Sayantani. Aditya never knew her, let alone propose. 																								Appearing on behalf of the state, Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee told the court that the police had definite information that Sayantani was regularly harassed by Aditya, who had virtually threatened to kill her if she refused his proposal.																								Chatterjee added that Indranis harsh words prompted Sayantani to commit suicide. It has become a trend for school-going boys to tease girls on the streets, Chatterjee said.

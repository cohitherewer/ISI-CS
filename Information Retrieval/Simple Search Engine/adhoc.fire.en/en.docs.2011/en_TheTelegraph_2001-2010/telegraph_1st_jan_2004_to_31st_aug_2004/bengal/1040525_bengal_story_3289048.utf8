The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Ray asks governors to step down
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 24: Former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray today demanded the resignation of all governors appointed by the earlier NDA government across the country after the Congress-led coalition assumed power in Delhi.																								I was appointed governor of Punjab in 1986 by the then Prime Minister late Rajiv Gandhi, but quit the post when the latter lost the elections in 1989. I want state governors to resign following my example, the Congress leader said at a news conference at his south Calcutta residence.																								At least 10 governors, including that of Bengal, all BJP appointees, are losing sleep for fear of losing their chairs. Viren J. Shah, who was appointed governor of Bengal in December 2000, was learnt to have cut short his holiday in Darjeeling and returned to the city today.																								To another question, Ray said the CPM could be ousted from Bengal only if the Congress sunk its differences and put up a united fight. Without naming Mamata Banerjee, he said those who had left the mainstream and tied up with the BJP should return to the parent body. Unless you are united, the communists will reign here for years.																								Asked if he would rejoin active politics, he replied in the negative. I am already 84 years old. But I would be happy if the Congress is able to form a government in Bengal by ousting the communists, he added.																								In another development, several Trinamul Congress leaders have started sending feelers to the state Congress leadership expressing their wish to return to the party. In a meeting last week, several Trinamul leaders, including Sultan Ahmed and Sougata Roy, criticised party chief Mamata for continuing in the NDA even after the poll debacle.

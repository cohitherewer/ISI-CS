 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 College axe on ransack girls
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Howrah, Feb. 2: Eight students of Bijoy Krishna Girls College  all members of the Students Federation of India  have been suspended after they went on the rampage for being disallowed from appearing in the Part II examinations in April.																								On December 24, the eight, including two senior leaders of the CPMs students wing, ransacked the college building and damaged official documents.																								They were protesting against the authorities decision not to allow them to appear in the B.A, B.Sc and B.Com Part II examinations as they did not have the requisite attendance. 																								We have taken serious note of the incident involving some our members of Bijoy Krishna Girls College and ordered an independent probe. A meeting has been convened on Wednesday to discuss the situation, said Sudip Sengupta, the president of the SFIs state unit.																								CPM sources said the suspension has come as a major embarrassment for the SFI leadership at a time when it is advocating imposition of strict discipline in colleges across the state.

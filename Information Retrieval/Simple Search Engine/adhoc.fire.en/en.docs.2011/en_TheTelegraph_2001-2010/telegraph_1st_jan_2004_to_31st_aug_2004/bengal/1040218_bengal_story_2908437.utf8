 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Citu power threat off
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 17: The Citu today called off its work-to-rule agitation at the State Electricity Board from tomorrow.																								Union leader Shyamal Chakraborty, who spoke to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, was apparently assured that the government would look into the unions demands and investigate its charge of sabotage against some bureaucrats.																								A day after the agitation was announced, several hundred Citu supporters demonstrated in front of Vidyut Bhavan this afternoon. They wanted to submit a memorandum to the board chairman, Sanjoy Mitra, but he was in Malda. The boards secretary, Sunil Kumar Gupta, was also not available.																								Angry Citu leaders then met power minister Mrinal Banerjee. Both the chairman and the secretary knew since January 27 that we are going to submit a memorandum today. But none of them was present. So we had no alternative but to meet the power minister, said Prashanta Nandi Chowdhury, a Citu leader in charge of the unions affairs in the power sector.																								He said a five-member delegation met Banerjee and complained to him about the absence of the board brass despite prior notice.																								The Citus main demands were induction of 1,500 technical assistants to run the boards substations replacing workers on contract and an upgraded pay scale for the technical employees. The Citu had also charged a section of officers in the board and the power and the finance departments with suppressing facts and resorting to power cuts in the rural areas to sell electricity outside Bengal.																								The work-to-rule had threatened power supply across the state as most generating stations have Citu unions and the possibility that they would extend moral support loomed large.																								The minister, however, said the allegation of selling power at the cost of rural Bengal was not true. There must have been a communication gap between the government and the Citu and the matter will be solved through talks across the table, he said. Banerjee also admitted that some of the unions demands were legitimate. He said the state was selling power to other states mostly during off peak hours but a some of it had to be sent during the peak hours as well.																								With the boro season on, farmers use pumps for irrigation in a big way and the demand for electricity shoots up. The peak-hour supply to other states has to be maintained. So, a marginal shortfall in the districts cannot be avoided. If there is a major deficit, we take additional supplies from the central power plant in Farakka, an official said.

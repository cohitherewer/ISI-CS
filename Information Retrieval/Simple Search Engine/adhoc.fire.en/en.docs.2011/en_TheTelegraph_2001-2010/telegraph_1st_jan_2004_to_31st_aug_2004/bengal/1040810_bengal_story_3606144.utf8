The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Writers watches PWG talks
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta, Aug. 9: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is keeping an eye on the peace talks in Andhra Pradesh but, for the time being, there will be no let-up in operations against Naxalites. 																								The government is not averse to a dialogue, but we are yet to take any administrative decision, the chief minister said at Writers Buildings this afternoon. 																								We are awaiting the outcome of the dialogue which the Andhra Pradesh government has begun with the Peoples War Group and other extremist groups, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said. 																								Deb, along with director-general of police Shyamal Dutta, attended a meeting in Delhi on August 5 to discuss Naxalite activity in Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Andhra.																								We have announced rehabilitation packages for the Naxalites. But talks are possible only when they give up arms, Deb said. 																								The secretary added that the government would implement the Andhra model if Hyderabad was successful in bringing the extremists to the mainstream through talks. 																								In the meantime, the state will set up a special operations group to infiltrate the PWG network and pick up information about their plans. The state has increased allocation under the head of secret service to the police in the affected districts.

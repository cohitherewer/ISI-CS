 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 27: Sonia Gandhi today cleared Sudip Bandopadhyays return to the Congress.																								Once Mamata Banerjees lieutenant, Bandopadhyay was expelled from Trinamul Congress after he defied the party chiefs diktat and decided to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Calcutta Northwest as an Independent. Neither Bandopadhyay nor Trinamuls Subrata Mukherjee won the seat. The CPM did. 																								On August 20, Bandopadhyay will return to the party he deserted in 1997. The Congress had backed him in the Lok Sabha polls.																								He met Sonia today and sought a date for the homecoming. His return will coincide with the 60th birth anniversary of the late Rajiv Gandhi.

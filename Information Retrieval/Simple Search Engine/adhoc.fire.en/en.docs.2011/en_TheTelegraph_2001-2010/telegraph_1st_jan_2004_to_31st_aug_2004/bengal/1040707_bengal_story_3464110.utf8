The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Sinha signature quicksand
 							 - Ex-VC attested Muktis gas and credit card papers: Police A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 6: It was not marksheets alone. Dilip Kumar Sinha had attested Mukti Debs other documents as well. 																								The former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor has been accused of attesting Debs fake marksheets and clearing her appointment as an applied math lecturer of the university on their basis.																								CID investigations have revealed that Sinha, then a professor at Science College, had known Deb from her days as a student of Bangabasi College. 																								The acquaintance apparently prompted him to put signatures on many of Debs applications, from that for a cooking gas connection to those for credit cards.																								After Deb secured the job, Sinha attested her salary slips required for certain applications, the sleuths said. 																								Facing interrogators, Sinha said: The lady cheated me. 																								The CID brass grilled him for more than three hours today. 																								Besides digging into Sinhas association with Deb, the CID has decided to check with the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education whether her HS marksheet is genuine. All her certificates from BSc to MPhil have been proven forged. 																								We have sent a letter to the council seeking its reply on whether Deb had cleared the higher secondary examination, said R.K. Mohanty, the additional director-general of police (CID). Debs poor marks in HS math prompted the CID to cross-check the marksheets authenticity.																								She scored 97 out of 200 in mathematics. With such a poor percentage, how she applied for her honours is something that has to be checked. To begin with, we are verifying her HS marksheet, a CID officer said.																								Police said after her alleged forgery came to light, Deb wrote a confessional letter to her mother saying why she had taken the dubious path and how everything was aimed at helping the family. The letter was penned immediately after the Visva-Bharati authorities asked Deb to justify why she should not be sacked. 																								The CID has sent a team to Delhi to collect documents detailing Debs University Grants Commission (UGC) fellowship. 																								Besides grilling Sinha on Deb and his alleged involvement in the affiliation scam, the CID questioned him on Tagores stolen Nobel medal. 																								Sinha apparently named some university employees and said they were aware of the medal. It seems these are deliberate means to mislead us. The persons he named are known to be close to present vice-chancellor Sujit Basu. We are not jumping to conclusions, said a CID source.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTCalcutta, May 28: The Congress has accepted its peaceful co-existence with the Marxists at the Centre as a hard reality and has directed its Bengal unit to explain the partys new equations with the Left to grassroots workers and urge them not to dilute their anti-CPM stand.																								Congress leaders will tour the districts to explain the partys post-poll relationship with the communists at the Centre, state party president Pranab Mukherjee said here today.																								In the present political scenario, the partys contradictory stand vis--vis the CPM is a reality. But, in Bengal, the CPM is our principal rival and our workers will have to fight it tooth and nail, the Congress leader said at a news conference at the party office.																								Mukherjee, on his first visit to the city as defence minister, said the CPMs support to the Congress-led government would not stand in the way of the partys anti-CPM movement in Bengal.																								We will have to fight the CPM in Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura, despite our understanding with them at the Centre. We have to strengthen the organisation at any cost.																								The Congress leader said it was necessary for the party to join hands with the CPM as it was a political need to remove the BJP from power.																								In 1996, both the Congress and the Leftists had extended support to the H.D. Deve Gowda government at the Centre. Even way back in 1970, the late Indira Gandhi had to depend on the communists to run the government, he said.																								But those equations did not deter then firebrand student leaders like Somen Mitra, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Pradip Bhattacharya to step up movement against the CPM.																								Behrampore MP and Murshidabad district Congress chief Adhir Chowdhury said the party would take on the CPM in rural Bengal.																								There is no compromise with the CPM, come what may. The CPM has a political compulsion to extend support to the Congress-led government. What is the alternative left with the CPM other than backing our government? he asked.																								State Congress general secretary Manas Bhuniya came down heavily on Left Front chairman Biman Bose for describing our party as cobra. Bose should keep in mind that the Congress has helped the CPM by taking the initiative in ousting the BJP from power.																								Mukherjee said he would soon quit as state Congress president to make room for a fresh incumbent. Congress president Sonia Gandhi will shortly appoint a new PCC chief, the defence minister said.																								Congress sources said Mukherjee wanted former state party president Somen Mitra to take over the reins once again. Mitra, who quit the post in 1998 when the Congress lost miserably to Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress, is learnt to have declined the key post.																								Sources said Mitras rival, Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, is lobbying hard to install Pradyut Guha as state party chief.

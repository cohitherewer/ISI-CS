 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Ghisingh behind Cong after turnaround
 OUR BUREAU																								May 2: Trust Subhas Ghisingh to spring a surprise. 																								After fuelling the guessing game for the past few weeks, the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) chief today announced that his party would support the Congress in the May 10 polls.																								The GNLF had boycotted the last three Lok Sabha elections to the Darjeeling seat, which made the task easy for the CPM candidate, and led detractors to allege a tacit understanding between the two parties. 																								In a press release issued in the afternoon, Ghisingh urged the hill voters to press the button with the Congress hand symbol. 																								The decision has created ripples in political circles as the Congress has joined hands with the Peoples Democratic Front  a five-party Opposition alliance  which is at loggerheads with the GNLF. The front includes the GNLF (C), a bitter Ghisingh critic, and the BJP. 																								Political observers said this is precisely the reason why the press release does not mention the name of Congress candidate Dawa Narbula, who has been targeting Ghisingh in his campaign. Lets forget the face of the candidate and instead remember the party, the release said. 																								The announcement took all, including leaders of Ghisinghs party, by surprise. Earlier in the day, Bimal Gurung, president of the GNLF unit at Singamari-Tukvar Valley, a party bastion, urged people at a rally not to vote. You can go on a picnic that day, he said.																								Analysts said Ghisingh was probably forced to take the decision keeping in mind the DGHC elections, which are scheduled for later this year. A victory for the Congress, with support from the PDF, would have sent the wrong signals to the hill voters before the council polls.																								Congress president Sonia Gandhi spoke to Ghisingh in the evening and welcomed his stand.

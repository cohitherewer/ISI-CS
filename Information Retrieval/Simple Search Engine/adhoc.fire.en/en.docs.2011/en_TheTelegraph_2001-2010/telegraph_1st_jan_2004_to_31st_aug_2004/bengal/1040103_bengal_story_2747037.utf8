 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, Jan. 2: The chief medical officer of health who went on an unsanctioned leave when the district was struggling to cope with diarrhoea deaths and a severe shortage of saline has resurfaced, making the zilla parishad sabhadhipati see red.																								Gautam Chakraborty has sent a message to health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, asking him to transfer chief medical officer of health Ashok Bandopadhyay out of Malda.																								I spoke to the health minister yesterday and asked him to promote the deputy chief medical officer of health to the post. The minister told me he would send someone. When I returned to Malda, I learnt that Bandopadhyay, who had deserted the hospital at a time of crisis, had returned. This is unacceptable, said Chakraborty. The sabhadhipati has made it clear that the zilla parishad would not cooperate with Bandopadhyay. 																								We will not allow him to function here, said an angry Chakraborty. He added that Bandopadhyay had called on him today but was driven out.																								How can I allow a person who went missing when the district was going through a crisis to remain here? There was a huge shortage of saline bottles and medicine during that period. In the past two months, 86 people have died of enteric diseases in this district and we did not even know where he was. I did not find it proper to have a conversation with him today, Chakraborty said. 																								A team of experts from Calcuttas School of Tropical Medicine had visited the district and conducted tests, which showed that the people died not of simple enteric diseases but cholera, the Congress leader said.																								When the chief medical officer disappeared two months ago, district magistrate Ashok Bala wrote to the director of health services and the health minister saying the unauthorised absence was not acceptable. He reminded Writers Buildings that no senior official could leave the district without notifying the magistrate and the sabhadhipati. 																								But though the district administration showcaused the chief medical officer, the government did not. Chakraborty today alleged that health department officials were trying to protect Bandopadhyay. Otherwise, how is it that the department sends back the same person against whom I personally complained to the minister, he said.																								Bandopadhyay said: I have done nothing wrong. I had taken permission before going out of station for treatment. He did not say who gave the permission.

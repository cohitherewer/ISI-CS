 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Man kills wife and child, flees 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, Aug. 24: A hunt has begun for a man who murdered his wife and four-year-old son last night at Hatinagar village in Murshidabad, 210 km from Calcutta. 																								Deputy superintendent of police Shahabul Hossain said Buddheswar Bed might have fled to Bangladesh after slitting the throats of 33-year-old Baby and Debashish. He had migrated from that country with his family and settled in Hatinagar five years ago. 																								We suspect he has escaped to Bangladesh after committing the twin murders as we have information he is in the habit of frequenting that country, he added. 																								Neighbours said Bed suspected his wife of having an affair with his eldest sons father-in-law and often quarrelled with her. 																								Babys mother, Sukhi, alleged that Bed often beat up his wife. 																								I took my daughter home last week after she was beaten up by her husband. Yesterday, Buddheswar came and took Baby home. Never in my dreams could I think that he would murder my daughter and grandson, she said. 																								Bed was home last night with Baby and his youngest son. Two other sons, Tapas and Prasenjit, were staying with relatives in the same village. This morning Tapas came home to find his mother and younger brother lying dead in a pool of blood, said a neighbour. 																								According to the police, another man, Arup Singh Roy, had murdered his wife Ruma and nine-month-old child in the same village six years ago. He has been sentenced to death, but he has challenged the order in Calcutta High Court.

 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Santiniketan duo faces fresh charges
 OUR BUREAU																								Aug. 17: The criminal investigation department has framed fresh charges against former Visva-Bharati University vice-chancellor Dilip Sinha and ex-applied math lecturer Mukti Deb after having failed to file chargesheets against them in the marksheet scam within the stipulated 60 days. 																								Sinha was arrested for allegedly attesting Debs fake certificates and appointing her a lecturer during his tenure as vice-chancellor. The trial court as well as the high court had rejected their bail petitions.																								Today, they were accused of drawing government money by furnishing fake documents. CID officials said as the fresh charges may lead to a life term, investigators will have the liberty to file charges within 90 days instead of 60. The new charges have been framed under Section 467 of the IPC.																								Sinha and Deb were arrested on charges of forgery. According to rules, an accused can be detained for only 60 days and not beyond that. The duo has already spent 58 days in custody but the police have failed to file a chargesheet. So, their release is imminent. At this juncture, they have drawn up fresh charges against my client in a bid to give a twist to the case, said Tapas Ghosh, the lawyer for Deb.																								A petition seeking bail for Deb was moved in the high court today. A division bench of Justice A. Talukdar and Justice P.K. Deb adjourned the hearing of the petition till August 20. 																								Sinha, Deb and former registrar of the university Dilip Kumar Mukherjee will be produced in the sub-divisional magistrates court in Bolpur tomorrow.																								Ghosh said: The trial court allowed the investigating authorities to frame fresh charges against the accused, but I will ask the court for a stay order on the decision.																								Jaymalya Bagchi, the counsel for the former VC, said he was waiting for a copy of the fresh charges. I will move court. It cannot allow the police to detain a person for more than 60 days after arrest, Bagchi said. Sinha, he added, should be released on health grounds. He underwent a bypass surgery last year.																								The investigators declined comment. We shall plead our case in the court when it comes up for hearing tomorrow, said an officer.																								The public prosecutor at Bolpur subdivisional court, Ashir Nazim, said he had heard about the fresh charges but did not see the details and could not comment.

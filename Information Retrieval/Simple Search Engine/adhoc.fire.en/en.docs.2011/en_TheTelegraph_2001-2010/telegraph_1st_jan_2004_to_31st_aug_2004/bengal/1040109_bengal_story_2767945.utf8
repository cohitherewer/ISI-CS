 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Rail cops punished after robbery
 AMIT UKIL																								Purulia, Jan. 8: Eight Railway Protection Force and six Government Railway Police personnel have been suspended following a dacoity on the 2802 Down New Delhi-Puri Puroshottam Express on Tuesday.																								The action comes in the wake of a series of such incidents over the past six months.																								The gang, which boarded an unreserved compartment around 1.10 am posing as passengers, robbed belongings and valuables worth more than Rs 50,000. The dacoits armed with knives and daggers assaulted passengers who tried to resist the heist between Purulia and Biramdih stations, about 370 km from Calcutta.																								A little after the train passed Biramdih, not a scheduled halt for the express, the dacoits pulled the alarm chain and escaped.																								Security personnel arrived with sniffer dogs and a search was launched but none of the dacoits could be traced. Two bags and some of the belongings were recovered close to the tracks. 																								The railway confirmed the suspensions but refused to give details. This is the fourth time in six months that passengers on the express have been looted in the Adra division.

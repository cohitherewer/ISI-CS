 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Court knock to go-slow govt
																								Calcutta, June 21: The high court today stepped in to do what the chief ministers do-it-now slogan could not. 																								It issued a stern order to the government to pay compensation for a plot acquired in Howrah for a hospital. If the director of health services does not appear in the court with the money by Monday, the hospital would be demolished, the court said. 																								A fortnight ago, the property had been ordered for auction by the court as the government had failed to pay compensation to the original land owners.																								Police will demolish Contai second primary heath centre with bulldozers if the government does not pay up, Justice Barin Ghosh said.

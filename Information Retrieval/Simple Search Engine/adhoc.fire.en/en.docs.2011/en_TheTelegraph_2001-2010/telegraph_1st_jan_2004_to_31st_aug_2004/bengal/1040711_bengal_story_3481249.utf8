 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Scam stink in co-op bank 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Howrah, July 10: Denied their money for six months, about 4,000 account-holders of a co-operative bank in Howrah went on the rampage after being turned away today despite assurances from the authorities to hand over their deposits amounting to about Rs 1 crore. 																								The bottled-up anger of the customers burst out and they smashed windowpanes and furniture when the authorities hung a notice that the Ramraja Co-operative and Credit Society Ltd has been closed indefinitely. 																								A section of the mob also ransacked two houses of Ajoy Chowdhury, a former chairman of the society. The patrons suspect a scam and alleged that some members of the societys management are involved. 																								As the situation worsened, policemen from the nearby Chatterjeehat police station intervened and arrested society director Prasanta Das, chairperson Krishna Moitra, adviser Pashupati Dutta and secretary Sitangshu Banerjee. Chowdhury is absconding. 																								A complaint has been lodged with Chatterjeehat police station and efforts have been launched to trace the prime accused, Ajoy Chowdhury, and the money, said police superintendent Mihir Bhattacharya. 																								The account-holders complained that for the past six months, the society has been turning down their pleas to let them withdraw their deposits. They smelt a rat when some depositors found that cheques drawn on their accounts were bouncing. 																								When we inquired with the authorities they refused to comment, said Haradhan Dutta, an account-holder. 																								When the depositors confronted the management on June 27, they promised the dispute would be settled on July 10. Today, the indefinite closure notice proved to be the flash point. 																								When we turned up this morning we saw the notice. Curiously, there was no proper signature on it. How can the society decide to remain closed for an indefinite period on its own? asked Chandrasekhar Dey, an account-holder. 																								The society has also not been paying its staff for the last three months.

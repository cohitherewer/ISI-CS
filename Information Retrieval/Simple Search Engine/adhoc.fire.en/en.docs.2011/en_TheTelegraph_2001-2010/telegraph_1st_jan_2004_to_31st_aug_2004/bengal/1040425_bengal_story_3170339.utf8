The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Team probes sterile seeds crisis
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Cooch Behar, April 24: A five-member team today visited the villages where farmers have complained of sterile seeds supplied by the agriculture department. 																								The seeds were given with pesticides and fertilisers as part of the governments mini-kit to the farmers. 																								Ironically, the villages, where the complaints have surfaced, are in the Dinhata constituency of agriculture minister and Forward Bloc leader Kamal Guha.																								As a show of protest last Sunday, a farmer of Sadialerkhuti village set his field of wheat on fire after the seeds failed to yield a single ear of corn. Complaints have also come in from Chanderkhuti, Hokadaha and Khatamari villages. 																								Bhaskar Roy, the district agricultural officer who heads the team, said: Several farmers have complained that the plants grown from the mini-kit seeds have not given any yield. We are trying to find out what could have gone wrong with the seeds. As the first step, we are visiting the villages from where the complaints have come. 																								In the Bloc, some pointed out that this issue would embarrass the ruling Left Front.																								With polling scheduled for May 10 in the state, the Congress and the Nationalist Trinamul Congress have lost no time to make the crop crisis an issue. This is not for the first time that farmers have suffered because of the poor quality of seeds supplied by the agriculture department. Yet, Kamal Guha has chosen to sit on the issue, alleged Rabindranath Ghosh, Trinamul district president.																								All India Congress Committee member and leader of the partys womens wing Sabita Roy said: It is Guhas agriculture department that is to blame for the predicament of the farmers. The officials are repeatedly supplying farmers useless mini-kits and pushing poor farmers deep into debt and despair. 																								Amar Roy Pradhans Forward Bloc (Subhas) is also cashing in on the crisis. Once a close friend of Guha, Roy is now demanding compensation for the farmers. Innocent farmers have been made to suffer for no fault of theirs. The government must compensate the farmers suitably. We will take the matter up with the chief minister. 																								Guha refused to elaborate on the issue. You are free to write whatever you want. But, I will not make any comment till the elections are over. You will get your answers only after the polls, he said.

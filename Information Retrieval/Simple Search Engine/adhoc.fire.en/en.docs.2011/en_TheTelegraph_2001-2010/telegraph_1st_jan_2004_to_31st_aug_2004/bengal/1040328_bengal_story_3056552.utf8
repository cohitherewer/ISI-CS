 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 Housewife foils dacoity
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhadiyara (Burdwan), March 27: A housewife foiled a robbery attempt late last night by armed dacoits who were later lynched by residents of the area.																								Seven persons wielding firearms and bombs targeted Champa Porels house in Bhadiyara in Burdwan district. The dacoits had been lured by the news of Champas husband, Jayanta, stumbling upon a gold coin while bathing in a pond a year ago. This was the third attack on the Porel home, 200 km from Calcutta.																								The miscreants nabbed Jayanta and Champa when they were sitting at their doorstep, said Burdwan superintendent of police Kailash Chandra Meena. While Jayanta was forced to enter the house at gunpoint, his wife was held captive in the courtyard.																								Jayanta was severely beaten up by the miscreants who asked him where the gold coin was hidden. As soon as the dacoits entered the house with her husband, Champa pushed aside the one standing guard and fled, he said. It was her courage and presence of mind that helped her escape. As she sounded the alarm, villagers came to their rescue and accosted the dacoits. The dacoits hurled bombs and fired at the villagers, but were soon outnumbered. Five fled, but the other two were lynched by the villagers.																								We chased the dacoits and caught up with two of them. The rest fled under the cover of darkness. The two, who were mercilessly beaten up by the villagers, died later, said Sanjay Nandi, a neighbour.																								Meena said police have started investigations but have not been able to identify the dacoits killed. We have alerted the neighbouring police stations and hope the other five culprits will soon be nabbed. We are also going to tighten security in the area, said the police superintendent.Left plea on poll officer																								The Murshidabad district unit of the Left Front has requested chief election officer Basudev Banerjee to withdraw the sub-divisional officer of Berhampore, Ashish Mukherjee, from election duty, reports our correspondent from Murshidabad.																								District Left Front leader Nripen Chakraborty said the party doubted Mukherjee would conduct his duties impartially. We think he is unfit for the post. So, we have requested the CEO to withdraw him from duties concerning the elections, he said.

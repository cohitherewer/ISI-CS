 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Medal and meal missing
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SOUMI BHATTACHARYA																								Santiniketan, April 11: They never saw Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal and, till the other day, did not care much. 																								But over a fortnight after it was stolen, hawkers who used to do brisk business here are realising its worth  the closed doors of the memorial museum have made eking out one decent meal a tough ask.																								Ram Avatar Rai, a man in his fifties, used to earn about Rs 300-400 every day from his fast-food stall till two weeks ago. With the Uttarayan complex closed to visitors and virtually no tourist coming since the news of the burglary broke, his income has dipped to zero. 																								Maine kabhi medal to nahin dekha, magar ab pata chal raha hain ki woh kafi kimti tha (I never saw the medal, but can now understand it was costly), said Ram Avatar, a resident of Goalpara on the outskirts of Santiniketan. I have five mouths to feed and have decided to take up the job of a daily wager. 																								Tapan Ghosh of Ratan Pally earned about Rs 800 everyday selling handicraft. He now earns about Rs 15. Eto din to ekhane achhi, kintu medaltai dekhini (I have been here so long, but have not seen the medal), Ghosh said, his nine-year-old son Manik staring blankly from behind his shoulders. 																								Satyajit Dutta, 40, who sold clay objects and made about Rs 500 everyday, now earns Rs 5. I have two children and an ailing mother to attend to and no money to spend on medicines, says Dutta.																								The likes of Dutta and 15-20 other hawkers who used to sell their wares outside Uttarayan do not know when they will reopen their kiosks. 																								Bapi Das, 30, of neighbouring Surul village was also doing well selling images of Tagore and Swami Vivekananda among other clay items. He got married recently. I never thought that from Rs 600 a day, things would turn so bad. I now sell some of my stuff to students who take pity at me, Das said.

 OUR BUREAU																								Jan. 20: Railway minister Nitish Kumar strove to bury the ghost of Gaisal as he launched the national project for installation of the anti-collision device at Bihars Kishanganj, not far from the site of one of the worst ever rail disasters.																								Kumar said the Konkan Railway-invented device, dubbed Raksha Kabach, an amulet guarding against danger, would be installed along 52,000-km of tracks in five years.																								Laying the foundation stone for an overbridge at Dalkhola in North Dinajpur later, the minister said the railway had been trying to come up with a device that would check accidents since the Gaisal tragedy. 																								In August 1999, the Brahmaputra Mail had rammed into the Awadh-Assam Express near Gaisal station, killing 285 people and injuring more than 300. A report, on the causes of the accident, found faults with the railway employees and the system of working in the Katihar division of Northeast Frontier Railway. 																								I had seen the devastation there (Gaisal) and, since then, the railway has been working towards accident mitigation, the minister said. 																								The devices, he added, would ensure continuous communication between trains, stations and personnel at level-crossings. 																								Kumar claimed that his ministry has already replaced tracks along an 8,000-kilometre stretch and built 2,700 new bridges. 																								We set up the Railway Safety Fund in 2001 and upgraded the signal equipment in 13,000 stations across the country, the minister said.																								In the first phase, the railway plans to install the anti-collision device along 1,736 km of track within the Northeast Frontier Railways territory by the end of this year. The microprocessor-based global positioning system-linked device would be fitted to engines, the guards bogie, stations and level-crossings. The Indian Railways has allotted Rs 50 crore for the Northeast project.																								Most accidents occur because of mistakes made by drivers or other railway employees. We hope to eliminate these errors with the installation of the anti-collision devices, Kumar said. 																								Railway Board member S.P.S. Jain said 44 per cent of rail bridges in India are more than 100 years old and have to be replaced at the earliest.

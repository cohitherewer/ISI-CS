 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Maoists mount border offensive
 							 - Militants destroy Nepal govt offices, open covering fire from India VIVEK CHHETRIPashupati Nagar (India-Nepal border), April 8: Around 3,000 heavily armed Maoist guerrillas stormed the border town 36 km from Darjeeling last night and set ablaze all administrative offices in the area. 																								Two policemen were killed in the offensive on Pashupati Nagar, which besides having key Nepal government offices, is also a trading hub with several businessmen of Indian origin having set up shop there. 																								About 45 policemen were on duty at the post in the Ilam district town when the rebels, who divided themselves into several groups, swooped on the town around 10.40 last night. 																								A couple of groups took on the policemen at the outpost, the others torched the offices, which included those of the Border Administrative Branch, Nepal Rastriya Banijya Bank and the customs. All the buildings are within a kilometre of the border, with the Nepal police station a mere 15 metres from the Indian checkpost.																								Some of the Maoists entered Indian territory to provide covering fire to their comrades who were engaged in a shootout with the Nepalese securitymen. The five unarmed policemen at the Indian foreigners checkpost were held hostage by the armed rebels. Only one of the five was carrying arms and could therefore do little. 																								Inspector-in-charge of Pashupati Nagar police station Praju Kumar Rai and havildar Suresh Shrestha were killed in the attack. Rai was first shot and then hacked by the Maoists. 																								The rebels are said to have abducted 42 policemen. About a dozen policemen are safe while the rest are still missing, said a spokesman for the Nepalese police. We have sent reinforcements and a search is on.																								The attack bore the stamp of a typical Maoist offensive executed with precision. Rawati Ghimere, who is in charge of the post office here, said: I was near the office when they began firing. I overheard some people shouting that they should also torch the post office but one of them said it was not part of their plan. The post office near the bank was spared.																								Nearby shops belonging to Nepalese citizens of Indian origin were not so lucky. The guerrillas, who have targeted properties owned by Indians over the past few days, broke into the shops and ransacked them. 																								Residents reported that at least 15 Maoists were injured in the attack but none was left behind. The rebels were equipped with stretchers and first-aid. 																								They did use vantage points in Indian territory during the attack. We will talk with higher authorities to increase police and Special Service Bureau personnel, said north Bengal inspector-general of police B. Mishra.

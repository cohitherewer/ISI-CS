The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Shattered Bharati at church
 REZA PRADHAN				 	 Kohli at Bagdogra airport on Tuesday en route to Punjab. A Telegraph picture																								Kalimpong, July 27: Bharati Das found answers to the questions tormenting her, but does not know what to make of them.																								He (Maninderpal Singh Kohli) told me he is innocent and that he had been framed by the British police, said Bharati, who met her husband, the prime suspect in the Hannah Foster rape and murder, at Kalimpong Subsidiary Correctional Home twice yesterday.																								Bharati had eloped with Kohli, whom she knew as Mike Davis, on June 17. Kohli had thrown a reception soon after to celebrate their wedding.																								He told me yesterday that he would marry me in court once he is proven innocent. He also said he would ask his brother and father to take me to Punjab soon, she said, her tone giving away the emotions buffeting her mind.																								Perhaps it was the knowledge of Kohlis dark past, or the trauma the Foster family had to suffer, that prevented Bharati from taking the man with many faces at face value. I have a soft corner for them and feel sorry for what they had to go through, she said.																								Bharati, who has been staying with a friend, today visited a church on Rellie Road. I have been living a nightmare since he was arrested. Some newspersons stalked me while others, who did not even meet me, wrote whatever they wanted to, but I feel better after visiting the church, she said.

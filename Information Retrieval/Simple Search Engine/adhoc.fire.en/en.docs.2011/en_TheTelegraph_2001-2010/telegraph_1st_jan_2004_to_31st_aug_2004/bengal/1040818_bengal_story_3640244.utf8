 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 MNC queue for food hub
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Siliguri, Aug. 17: Multinationals have lined up to invest in the proposed food processing zone here, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said today.																								The chief minister was addressing a workshop on the development of pineapple cultivation in the region. My government has drawn up a road map to make Siliguri a pineapple-based processed food centre. It will be a one-of-its kind food park and export zone in the country, he said.																								The day-long session organised by the state food processing department and the central processed food export development authority was aimed at working out ways to revive the now defunct pineapple orchards, many of which have over the years been replaced by illegal tea gardens.																								Bhattacharjee said an Italian firm and Bangalore-based Calypso Industries will soon set up multi-crore food processing units in Siliguri. I had a detailed meeting with Calypso CEO Debasis Mitra and have asked the Jalpaiguri district magistrate to complete formalities to hand over the required land to the multi-national company within seven days. Discussions are on with six to seven other MNCs for setting up units in Siliguri.																								The government has chalked out a multi-pronged plan for the park that includes research and development of high-yield seeds. North Bengal University scientists will conduct the R amp;D in collaboration with those from Bidhan Chandra Roy Krishi University. Fruit and vegetable growers will be trained in scientific cultivation. Setting up processing units and marketing the produce are also part of the package. 																								Officials said not just MNCs but local entrepreneurs will also be encouraged to set up processing plants. An export zone for the processed products will also be set up.

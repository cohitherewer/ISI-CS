 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, July 30: Veteran communist leader Hiren Mukherjee is dead. He was 97.																								Mukherjee was admitted to SSKM Hospital after having fractured a femur bone in a fall at his south Calcutta home on Sunday. He was responding well to treatment but suffered a heart attack this morning after he had a cup of tea. He left behind his wife, son and daughter.																								A strong supporter of euthanasia, the former parliamentarian and academic had decided against surgery on his leg. 																								He was a rare politician who never allowed dogmatism to dominate over his liberal outlook. His regard for Marxism-Leninism did not prevent him from speaking highly of Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru or Subhas Chandra Bose. His books on the three leaders  Gandhiji: A Study, The Gentle Colossus and Blow of Burning Gold: A Study of Subhas Chandra Bose bear testimony to his respect for those who did not endorse his brand of politics. 																								Communalism hurt him and he wrote to Atal Bihari Vajpayee on June 5, 1989, three years before Babri Masjid was pulled down, urging him to rethink the BJPs temple agenda. . Like you, Atal bhai, I have been born and brought up in a Hindu home. Like you, I am proud of my Hindu heritage. But I am far prouder  let me shout from the housetops  of my Indian heritage the letter read. 																								Mukherjees repeated pleas for the unification of the CPI and the CPM remained unrealised with the Marxists rejecting the idea on ideological grounds. 																								Born in Calcutta on November 23, 1907, Mukherjee went to Presidency College. A first-class post-graduate in history from Calcutta University, he also studied in Oxford University and Lincolns Inn. Mukherjee taught in Andhra and Calcutta universities and joined the undivided Communist Party of India. He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1952 from Calcutta Northeast and won five successive terms. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee described him as a pioneer of the communist movement in India. Mukherjees body was taken to Peace Haven, a mortuary in central Calcutta, and will be kept there till Sunday. From there, it will be taken to his home at Saptaparni and then to the state CPI headquarters.

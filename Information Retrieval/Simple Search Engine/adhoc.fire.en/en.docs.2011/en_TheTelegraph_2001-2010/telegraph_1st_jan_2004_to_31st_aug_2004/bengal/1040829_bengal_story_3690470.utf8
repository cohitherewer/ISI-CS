 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 SC stays off pension squabble
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Aug. 28: The Supreme Court has declined to interfere with a state government order not to recommend pension for members of the West Bengal Freedom Fighters Organisation.																								It is not possible to interfere with the state advisory committees decision not to recommend to the Centre the members of the organisation for pension as the panel has come to a conclusion on the basis of available material, said a division bench of Justices S.. Variava and G.P. Mathur in a August 20 judgment.																								The court, however, recorded the statement of Bengal counsel Janaranjan Das that, according to a recent decision of the central government, all applications of persons claiming to have been interned in jails in territories now in Bangladesh will be forwarded to the Centre, the judges said.																								State governments were expected to forward names of freedom fighters for pension. But an advisory panel formed by the Bengal government to verify the cases had on February 4, 2002, rejected all applications by members of the freedom fighters organisation.																								The organisation had appealed in the apex court that in a matter like this, the court should not look at technicalities but must look at the substance of the petition.																								The decision of the committee (rejecting pension applications) cannot be said to be perverse or one that no reasonable person could arrive at. We, therefore, see no reason to interfere, the judges said.																								However, under the new policy of the central government all pension claims of freedom fighters would be forwarded, said Janarajan Das.

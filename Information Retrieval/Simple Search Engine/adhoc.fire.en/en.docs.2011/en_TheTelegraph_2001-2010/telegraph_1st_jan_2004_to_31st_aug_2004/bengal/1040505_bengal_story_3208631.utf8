 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar (Nadia), May 4: Confusion surrounds the failure of a fuming Union minister Shatrughan Sinha to turn up at a public meeting in Nadia this afternoon. 																								The ministers aides blame an uncooperative district administration for failing to locate the venue of the rally Shotgun Sinha was to address; the administration says it was not contacted for directions.																								Satyabrata Mukherjee, BJP candidate from Krishnagar, said at a news conference that Sinha had to order his helicopter back to Calcuttas Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport this afternoon after trying in vain for nearly an hour to locate the rally venue. 																								The rally was scheduled for Majdia in the Krishnagunj police station area, about 110 km from Calcutta. 																								Mukherjee said Nadia district magistrate Kanwaljeet Singh Cheema refused to disclose the exact location of the meeting for which Sinha had come all the way from Patna, stopping at Calcutta to take a helicopter. 																								On storming back to the state capital from Krishnagar, a furious Sinha headed to Deshapriya Park in south Calcutta where Atal Bihari Vajpayee was addressing an election meeting to drum up support for Mamata Banerjee. 																								Piecing together the chain of events from early afternoon, Mukherjee said: The central minister could not be contacted over the mobile phone as he was hovering in the sky. The pilot contacted the airport authorities in Calcutta to find the exact location. The authorities there contacted the district magistrate to find the place where his helicopter could land. But the district administration did not help the central minister. 																								Sinha hovered in the sky for almost one hour, looking for the place where he was supposed to land but after getting no response he returned to Calcutta to join the Prime Minister, the BJP candidate said. 																								But the Nadia district administration denied receiving any calls from airport authorities over Sinhas landing. Cheema said: The allegation is baseless. Neither me nor any senior officer in the district administration received any telephone call from the airport authority in Calcutta. Sinha, being a central cabinet minister, can never get treatment of this sort from the district administration. 																								The Airports Authority of India also denied receiving a call either from Sinha or any of his party functionaries. 																								Backing down somewhat after Cheemas statement, Mukherjee said: I cannot react to the DMs remark as I have no proof that airport authorities contacted the DM here. All that I have said is based on the information I received from my party functionaries in Calcutta and from Sinhas personal assistant.

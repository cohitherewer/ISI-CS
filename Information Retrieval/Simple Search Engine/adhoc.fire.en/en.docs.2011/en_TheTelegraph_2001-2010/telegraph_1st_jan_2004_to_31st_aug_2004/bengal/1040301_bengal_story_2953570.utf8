 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 Hospital probe after neglect
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Siliguri, Feb. 29: North Bengal Medical College and Hospital has ordered an inquiry into the death of nine-year-old Deepak Roy following allegations of negligence against hospital employees in another tale of horror healthcare dogging the state.																								Deepak, who was suffering from septicaemia, was brought to the hospital yesterday morning. He had been referred to the hospitals emergency section by the Jalpaiguri district hospital. 																								Deepaks uncle, Prashanta Roy, said a group-D staff asked him to go to the out-patient department as there was no doctor at the emergency ward. 																								After waiting at the OPD for an hour-and-a-half, he was told to return to the emergency. As Prashanta rushed, he realised that his nephew was no longer breathing. The hospital authorities subsequently declared him brought dead.																								Angry relatives later staged a demonstration in front of the office of the superintendent. We have received the complaint. We will conduct an inquiry into the allegations, said J.B. Saha, the hospital superintendent. 																								Head of the department of forensic medicine Saibal Gupta said: We will send the viscera of the boy to the pathology department for a confirmed diagnosis. 																								My nephew was referred to the emergency ward of the hospital in a critical condition. Both his legs were swollen and he was having trouble breathing. When we went to the emergency, a group-D staff turned us away saying there was no doctor. He asked us to go to the out-patient department, said Prashanta. 																								We took Deepak to the OPD, which is in a different block, and waited for one-and-half-hours for a ticket. Then we were told to rush him to the emergency. By the time we reached there, Deepak was dead. We had done as the hospital told us with the belief that he will recover, Prashanta said. Deepaks father, Hembram Roy, earns his living as a vegetable vendor.

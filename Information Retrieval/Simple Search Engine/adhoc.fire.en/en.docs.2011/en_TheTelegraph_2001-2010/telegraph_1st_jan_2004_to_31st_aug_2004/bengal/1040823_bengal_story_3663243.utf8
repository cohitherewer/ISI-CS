 A STAFF REPORTER Ramadoss : Ducking ? Calcutta, Aug. 22: Three  events in a day appear a bit too hectic for Union health  minister Anbumani Ramadoss, who will be here tomorrow. 																								On his second visit to the city since becoming minister, Ramadoss was invited to share the dais with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital for the inauguration of a special unit for cancer patients. 																								But his office informed the organisers that the minister would be busy with the inauguration of MBBS courses at SSKM Hospital and a meeting with Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute officials. 																								We heard that he wont be able to make it. We expected him to come as the entire Rs 1.5-crore grant for buying the machine was provided by the Union government (during the NDAs tenure). We thought the central ministers presence at the inauguration would be apt, a senior medical college official said.																								Director of medical education C.R. Maiti confirmed that Ramadoss was invited but opted out becasue of a hectic schedule. 																								Officials at Writers Buildings, who are used to organising three-four programmes in a day for the chief minister or the health minister, expressed surprise that three short programmes were too heavy for 35-year-old Ramadoss. 																								One more reason why the medical college was eager to host the minister was to ask him about the Rs 100 crore upgradation project. About a year-and-a-half ago, then Union health minister Sushma Swaraj had announced that the Centre would upgrade one city hospital to the standards of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.																								Weeks before the general elections this May, a health department team was here from Delhi to carry out a feasibility study for upgrading several departments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Shourie certificate to Buddhas IT regime
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Shourie: Wow Buddhadeb																								Chennai, March 23: No, Arun Shourie hasnt converted to communism, hes embraced Buddh-ism.																								As in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  not Gautam Buddha.																								Just because it is a communist government, Shourie lamented, Bhattacharjees excellent work in information technology has not caught the medias fancy.																								Hear, hear, Chandrababu Naidu, who is always hogging the limelight.																								Shourie was not speaking in Hyderabad, but he was in Naidus neck of infotech woods all right. The infotech and disinvestment minister took Bhattacharjees message down south, the acknowledged IT hub.																								Bengal is the only state yet to declare infotech a public utility, Shourie said here, addressing the anniversary programme of a business daily.																								Captains of industry in the audience also heard the Union minister praise the Bengal governments pioneering reforms in the power sector. Shourie mentioned better collection of dues and the drop in transmission and distribution losses. 																								Yet, these things are not reported by the media, just as much as Bengals economic stagnation in the previous 13 years went largely unreported, he said. 																								Another glaring instance of under-reporting, the Union minister added, was Madhya Pradesh, where former chief minister Digvijay Singh was hailed as a great economic manager only to be suddenly told later that there was no proper infrastructure development in his state. 																								Shourie said 80 per cent of Indias IT exports now happen from the 35 software technology parks and in them lay a lesson in what the public-private partnership could achieve in the country. The parks would be among the focus areas for the Centre after the Lok Sabha elections, said Shourie. 																								Indias economic reforms in the first phase was by announcement, the minister said to a roar of laughter. The government then would only announce abolishing of this regulation or that. The next phase will have to do more with anticipating and preparing for the impact of events (globally) that are round the corner, Shourie said.

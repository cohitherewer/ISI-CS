The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Atal or none: Trinamul
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A child counts posters that he has to deliver. Picture by Pradip Sanyal 																								Calcutta, April 27: The Trinamul Congress today made Atal Bihari Vajpayees re-election as the Prime Minister a precondition for its continuation in the BJP-led NDA. 																								We feel there is no alternative to Vajpayees leadership in the situation prevailing in the country. He is the only leader who can serve as an able Prime Minister in coalition politics. We want his continuation in the highest office in the interest of national unity and stability, the Trinamul election manifesto says.																								Political observers said Trinamuls stand on Vajpayee is an indication of the partys reservations about deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani replacing him as the Prime Minister in future. 																								Significantly, Advani, who will be in the state tomorrow, will address election rallies only for BJP candidates  in Midnapore, Durgapur and Balurghat.																								Vajpayee, who will be in the city on May 3, will address a rally at Deshapriya Park in south Calcutta in support of Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee. 																								Mamata had earlier earned the deputy Prime Ministers displeasure by stalling Sudip Bandopadhyays entry into the Union cabinet. Bandopadhyay was eventually denied a Trinamul ticket for the Calcutta Northwest constituency and has been forced to contest as an Independent. 																								Releasing the manifesto, Trinamul legislator and general secretary Partha Chatterjee said the party is against privatisation of public sector units and slashing of interest rates in small savings and provident fund. 																								We will continue to raise our voice of protest on these issues in future, he said.																								Trinamul spokesman and leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Pankaj Banerjee reiterated that the party has allied with the BJP only to resist the CPM and not for any ideological reason. 																								Our sole aim is to defeat the CPM. We intend to prevent a split in anti-CPM votes and have, therefore, forged an alliance with the BJP, Banerjee said.																								The party also sought to reaffirm its secular credentials. The manifesto says Trinamul would not compromise on the interests and security of the minority community.																								Our main fight is against the CPM. We will spare no efforts to reduce the CPMs political clout in Delhi, he observed.																								The manifesto also describes the Congress as the CPMs B-team. Banerjee said: We will urge the people not to vote for the Congress candidates....																								The party called for a CBI probe into several shady financial deals undertaken by the Left Front government.

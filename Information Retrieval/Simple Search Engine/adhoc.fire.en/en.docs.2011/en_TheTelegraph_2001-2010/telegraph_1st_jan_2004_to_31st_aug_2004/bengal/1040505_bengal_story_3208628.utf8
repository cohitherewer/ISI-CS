 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 CM rakes up ISI slur on Cong candidate
 SAROJ SINHA AMP; MEHEDI HEDAYTULLAH																								Chopra/Karandighi (North Dinajpur), May 4: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today claimed that Subash Ghisingh had once branded Congress candidate for Darjeeling Dawa Narbula an ISI agent and wondered how the Gorkha National Liberation Front could back him. 																								I cannot understand why Ghisingh, in spite of telling me all this, announced that the GNLF was going to back the Congress. He is ushering in violent times with a renewed call for Gorkhaland, Bhattacharjee said after addressing a rally at Karandighi in support of the CPMs Raiganj candidate, Minati Ghosh.																								The immediate provocation for the allegation was Ghisinghs announcement two days ago that he would back the Congress, an ally of the five-party Peoples Democratic Front. The surprise move set at rest speculation that he would boycott the polls a fourth time and ensure an easy win for the CPM. 																								Narbula to ISI hai. Is bar humko ISI ke against me larna hoga (Narbula is an ISI agent. This time I have to fight the ISI), the chief minister quoted Ghisingh as telling him during a one-on-one meeting at Richmond Hill in Darjeeling earlier this year. 																								Ghisingh had even told me that there were other leaders in the PDF who had active links with the ISI. How can he then support a person who has no problem siding with our enemies? Bhattacharjee said.																								In Calcutta, Left Front chairman Biman Bose admitted it would be difficult for the party to win the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat this time as the GNLF had thrown its weight behind the Congress. 																								We have to work extra hard in the three hill subdivisions of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong because of Ghisinghs decision to support Narbula. However, our organisation is strong in the plains, where we will try to get maximum votes, Bose said at a news conference.

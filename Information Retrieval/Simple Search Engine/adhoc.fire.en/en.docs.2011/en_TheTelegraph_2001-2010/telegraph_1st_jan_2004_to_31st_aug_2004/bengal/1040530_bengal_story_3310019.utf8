 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 Lax publishers delay HS syllabi overhaul 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, May 29: The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education today deferred introduction of the new syllabi to next year because publishers have failed to bring out textbooks on time. 																								The new syllabi  as announced by the council a few months ago  was supposed to come into effect from the academic session starting this July.																								The council, which met at its Salt Lake office this afternoon, said non-cooperation of the publishing houses assigned to print the textbooks was the reason for the councils decision. 																								Not a single publisher has submitted draft copies of the revised textbooks to us till date. Less than two months are left for commencement of the new academic session. It is impossible for us at this stage to introduce the new syllabi as the publishers are yet to submit the draft copy of any textbook. We have no option but to postpone our move for a year, said council president Jyotirmoy Mukherjee. We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience caused to lakhs of students and teachers by our decision, he added. 																								The council has carried out an extensive exercise over the past few years to introduce major changes in the higher secondary syllabi. One of the main objectives was to establish parity between the courses offered by the council and the equivalent courses taught by some major Delhi-based boards  the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations and the Central Board of Secondary Education  to which over 300 schools across the state are affiliated. The proposed changes also intended to bridge the existing gap between the syllabi taught at the Madhyamik and higher secondary levels. 																								Sources in the council said a pre-condition set for the publishing houses was to submit draft copies of the textbooks to the council. It would have granted the right to bring out a particular textbook to a publisher after scrutinising the drafts. The publishers were to get a particular text book (TB) number which would entitle them to print the books on a large scale. 																								 At present, publishers engaged in printing higher secondary textbooks do not need the number. The new system was introduced this year to check a tendency among the publishers to incorporate unnecessary topics in the textbooks. 																								The council, according to the sources, has decided to appeal to the government to take appropriate action against the publishers for the delay. 																								The new syllabi were given to the publishers last year. They were supposed to submit the draft copies in December. The deadline was extended again and again as they failed to prepare the draft copies. We will urge the government to take stringent measures against them, said an official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, March 21, 2004 				 Biman plea on IPS transfers
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, March 20: Left Front chairman Biman Bose today urged the Election Commission not to take steps on the basis of motivated reports on the states law and order, a day after former chief minister Jyoti Basu reposed his partys faith in the neutrality of the panel that ordered the transfer of three IPS officers.																								We will expect the Election Commission not to indulge in activities which may affect the morale of the state administration. We hope it will try to help the administration do its duty without succumbing to any kind of pressure from interested quarters out to influence its decisions, Bose told journalists.																								But the CPM leader emphasised that the party has no intention of confronting the poll body. The state government has already implemented the Election Commissions order. But we will consider the commissions remarks and actions as unjustified if these are taken on the basis of motivated reports.																								Boses statement, issued after a Left Front committee meeting today, reflected the CPMs tough stand taken to prevent similar steps against other IPS officials.																								The statement drew flak from Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee. What does he mean by motivated reports? All political parties, including Left Front partners like the RSP and the Forward Bloc, met chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy individually. Who can say these parties did not make specific complaints? Besides, the Election Commission has its own machinery to verify the complaints, she said.																								The CPM has obviously been shaken by it. The party will find it difficult to survive if police officers who used to help it rig elections and murder or implicate its political opponents in false cases are removed from their posts.																								Mamata accused the Marxists of doublespeak. The CPM had welcomed the Election Commissions decision to transfer blacklisted police officers in Rajasthan before the Assembly polls. But the party is unhappy when similar steps have been initiated in Bengal before the Lok Sabha elections, she said.																								Bose hoped the poll body would take all necessary steps to maintain its neutrality and follow a uniform policy all over the country.

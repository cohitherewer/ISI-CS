The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Truck strike threat to essentials
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 20: Supply of essential commodities across the state may be seriously hit with truck owners and other goods vehicle operators going on an indefinite strike from dawn tomorrow.																								The strike, called by the All India Motor Transport Congress  the apex body of truckers and transporters  is aimed at pressing for reduction in service tax, motor vehicles tax and toll tax, increasing security to curb highway robberies and withdrawal of the governments decision to scrap old vehicles.																								We know people will suffer because of the strike, but are helpless. We were compelled to resort to it as neither the Centre nor the state government paid heed to our demands, union general secretary J. M. Saxena told The Telegraph from Delhi.																								The strike is likely to bring to a stop supply of essential items from other states, leading to a crisis of LPG cylinders, petrol, diesel, kerosene, cement, sugar, eggs, fish, oilseeds, pulses and vegetable oil. Power plants might also be affected if the supply of coal by road is snapped.																								Every day, about 50,000 medium and heavy goods vehicles enter the city  either from the districts or Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Orissa. Wholesale traders in Burrabazar generally maintain two days stock of essential commodities. 																								Vehicles carrying medicines and oxygen cylinders have been left out of the strike that is also likely to affect exports to Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.																								We are not observing the strike for any financial gain, but only intend to save transport industry, Saxena said. The governments, he added, should not have hiked taxes without assessing the financial status of the sector.

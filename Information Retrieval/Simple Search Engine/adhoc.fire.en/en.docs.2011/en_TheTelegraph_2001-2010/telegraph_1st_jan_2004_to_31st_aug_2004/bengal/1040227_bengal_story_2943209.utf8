 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Schoolboy suicide after V-day flower tick-off
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, Feb. 26: A boy committed suicide apparently after he was reported to parents by his school for his affair with a classmate.																								Tapas Pal, a student of Class VIII in Raidighi Narendrapur Milan Vidyapith, was found hanging from a tree this morning in Raidighi, South 24-Parganas, 70 km from here.																								The boy from Patharpratima and Jayanti Naskar of Garia, both of whom stayed in the school hostel, were said to be close to each other.																								Tapas was taken to task by headmaster Mahadeb Pramanik on Valentines Day after he offered flowers to Jayanti in front of others.																								Pramanik informed his father, Chittaranjan Pal of Digambarpur village, after he found the girls photograph in a book belonging to Tapas. This apparently upset him and he withdrew from close friends and hardly talked to them over the past few days.																								He was friendly and used to mix with everybody quite freely. Yesterday, we were extremely surprised when we found him depressed and keeping a distance from us, a classmate said.																								Today, early in the morning, when villagers were going to the market, they found the body hanging from a tree, Diamond Harbour subdivisional police officer M. Akhtar said. The boy was long dead when the body was brought down, he added.																								The officer said the headmaster, the girl and both sets of parents would be questioned.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 31: The West Bengal University of Health Sciences will soon come under the purview of the University Grants Commission (UGC) making medical, dental and nursing colleges in the state entitled to central funds worth crores.																								There are four undergraduate medical colleges in the city and one each in Bankura, Burdwan and Jalpaiguri. Besides the seven, three dental colleges, two nursing institutions and several homeopathy, ayurvedic and unani colleges affiliated to the health science university will benefit. 																								Officials said today the proposed UGC assistance would be utilised for infrastructure development in the colleges.																								The UGC gave its preliminary approval to bringing the university under its jurisdiction at a meeting of our apex body here last week. We are awaiting the final approval, vice-chancellor M.M. Chowdhury said. The UGC, Medical Council of India, Indian Council for Medical Research and government representatives attended the meeting.																								The university was set up two years ago to bring all medical, dental and nursing colleges under one umbrella. It is now solely dependent on funds provided by the state government. 																								Institutions need to fulfil certain norms to claim UGC funds. Ours being a new university, we had to develop adequate infrastructure before demanding inclusion, Chowdhury said.

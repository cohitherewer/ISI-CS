 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Jailbird kin boost to Adhir show
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, May 8: Arit Majumdar, the Murshidabad Youth Congress chief, was arrested in a murder case. 																								But that does not stop him from consulting with the party cadre over cellphones and planning brother-in-law Adhir Chowdhurys campaign for the constituency of Behrampore.																								An ailing Majumdar was arrested on April 17 in connection with the murder of a DYFI member in September, 2001. He was produced in court on April 29 and remanded in jail custody for a fortnight. But he was removed to the Behrampore New General Hospital a week ago. Hospital sources say the door to Majumdars ward is locked from outside with two armed policemen on guard. But that does not stop his partymen from supplying Majumdar with cellphones through two windows. 																								We find Majumdar using one mobile phone for a couple of hours before being replaced by another, says a hospital official. He also instructs his partymen who wait on the other side of the windows on the north and west of the ward. This is highly illegal. How can an undertrial, who has been brought to the hospital by a court order, use cellphones like this... he asks.																								Hospital superintendent Indranath Chatterjee denied involvement of his staff and said it is the responsibility of policemen. District superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh, however, has said he was unaware of the incident. I did not about it. I will inquire into the matter, he said.

 Sunday, March 21, 2004 				 Three held for cable theft
 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA 																								Siliguri, March 20: A raid at an aluminium factory in Agham Singh Nagar has indicated the existence of an illegal nexus between employees of the state electricity board and local aluminium factories.																								The proprietor of Siliguri Aluminium Industries, Sujit Kumar Agarwal, was arrested this morning along with two workers Shyam Sarkar and Tara Chand after police seized from the factory premises about 2.5 tonnes of aluminium cables that had been stolen from the West Bengal State Electricity Board.																								The cables, which are used by the board to supply power to households and are not available in the market, were to be melted to manufacture utensils. The workers were caught melting the cables at the factory near Salbari.																								Acting on an information, we raided the factory premises and seized about 2.5 tonnes of aluminium cables. We have not yet measured the large quantity of aluminium that has already been melted. The real cause for worry is that the cables are a fresh lot, that have been shifted here from a godown and not stolen from electricity poles as one is likely to believe, Siliguri deputy superintendent of police C.S. Lepcha said.																								Police sources said Agarwal revealed during interrogation that a contractor of the electricity board had sold the lot to him at Rs 75 per kg.																								We are searching for the contractor who has been named by Agarwal. His arrest will take our investigation further and help prove the illegal nexus between the board employees and aluminium factories, if any, Lepcha said. The board has not registered any complaint with us about any theft in their store so far. In any case, we will be contacting it once we have arrested the contractor.																								The police officer said similar complaints had been made against about four more aluminium factories in Siliguri and its outskirts.																								Some of those factories are situated in Jalpaiguri district. If our investigations lead us to those factories, we will raid their premises, too, Lepcha added.																								Electricity board officials could not be contacted for their comments.

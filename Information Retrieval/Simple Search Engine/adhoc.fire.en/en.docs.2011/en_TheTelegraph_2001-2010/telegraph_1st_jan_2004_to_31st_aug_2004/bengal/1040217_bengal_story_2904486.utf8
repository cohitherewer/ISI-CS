The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Sudip purrs after roar
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Feb. 16: In a  last-ditch effort to broker peace with Mamata Banerjee,  Trinamul Congress MP Sudip Bandopadhyay today wrote to a  party panel urging it to allow him to seek re-election from  his Calcutta Northwest seat.																								Following Mamatas directive, this time I have sent the letter to the partys election committee with the request to renominate me from Calcutta Northwest and choose someone else for the Raiganj seat. If this plea does not evoke any positive response, I will have no other option but to enter the fray (from the city seat) as an Independent, Bandopadhyay said.																								If denied a ticket, Bandopadhyay felt, the party would be harmed more than him and the CPM would get a handle to launch a motivated campaign against Mamata. 																								A day after he issued a virtual threat to contest from his seat as an Independent if denied a renomination, Bandopadhyay appeared somewhat on the defensive. I still hope that good sense will prevail on the leadership, he said, adding: Mamata should intervene to settle the issue instead of passing it on to others. 																								However, Mamata is learnt to have directed Trinamul councillors in Calcutta Northwest to maintain distance from the rebel who angered her by hobnobbing with central BJP leaders when her relations with the party went sour.																								Trinamul MLA from Jorasanko Satyanarayan Bajaj did not invite Bandopadhyay to the unveiling of two community halls last week. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee was invited instead, signalling that he could replace Bandopadhyay.																								No party MLA, councillor or even ordinary worker is with Sudip these days following his frosty relations with Didi, claimed Bajaj. If Bikram Sarkar can agree to shift to Howrah from Panskura, why would Sudip not contest from Raiganj, as desired by Mamata, he asked. 																								Rashtriya Janata Dal parliamentary party leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh today said over phone from Patna the party would not offer two seats to the CPM in Bihar unless it left Calcutta Northwest for our nominee. The CPM, which has a seat in Bhagalpur, is asking for another, Singh said.

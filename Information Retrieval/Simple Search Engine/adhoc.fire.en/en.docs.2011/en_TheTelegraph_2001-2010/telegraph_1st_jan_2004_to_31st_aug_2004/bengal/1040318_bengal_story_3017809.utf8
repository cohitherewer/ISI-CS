The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, March 18, 2004  Cong support for Sudip
 - Rebel skirts hand symbol to swing Trinamul votes  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Friends: Bandopadhyay  (top), Mukherjee  Calcutta, March 17: The  Congress will back Sudip Bandopadhyay in his attempt to  seek re-election from his Calcutta Northwest seat as an  Independent after being denied a ticket by the Trinamul  Congress.  We have already held a preliminary  discussion with Sudip and a final decision on this score  will be taken as soon as possible, said state Congress  president Pranab Mukherjee. The Trinamul rebel is yet to  write to the party formally seeking its support, he added.  Asked if he had set any condition  for his support, Mukherjee replied in the negative. The  only thing is that an Independent candidate must not join  any party after the elections if he or she is elected. I  believe Sudip is aware of this, he said.  Earlier, the Congress was insisting  on a written statement from Bandopadhyay accepting Congress  president Sonia Gandhi as his leader and criticising the  BJP-led NDA. Some state leaders also wanted him to promise  that he would not enter into any truck with Mamata Banerjee  after the elections.  Bandopadhyay said this afternoon  that he was happy with the Congress gesture.  I shall officially seek the Congress  support in a day or two by calling on Mukherjee and other  PCC leaders. I think the Congress support will help me  retain the seat, he said.  Bandopadhyay is, however, unwilling  to fight with the hand symbol and has approached state  electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee for another. Congress  leaders said the Trinamul rebel was hoping to mop up Trinamul  votes by not taking the Congress symbol.  The Congress support has not  come to Bandopadhyay as an unmixed blessing because state  leaders will target the Vajpayee government in rallies where  he will share the platform with them. We will highlight  the NDA governments failure in Sudips presence. Vajpayee  is definitely our main target, said Somen Mitra, a former  state unit chief.  Reacting to the Congress decision,  Trinamul spokesman Pankaj Banerjee said: It will only split  the anti-CPM votes and has vindicated our contention that  the Congress has been serving as the B team of the CPM.  He said the party would initiate disciplinary action against  Bandopadhyay once he files his nomination.  Trinamul has put up mayor Subrata  Mukherjee from the seat and had offered Raigunj to Bandopadhyay.  Nayna, Bandopadhyays actress-turned-legislator  wife, welcomed the Congress decision. The Congress is  an all-India party and its support will definitely help  Sudip sail through in the polls, she said.  Replying to another question,  the Trinamul MLA from Bowbazar said she has not yet decided  whether to campaign for her husband.  I shall shortly meet Didi (Mamata)  to discuss what I should do at this juncture. I am hurt  by some party leaders attempt to corner me ever since Sudip  decided to contest from his old seat as an Independent candidate.  Is it my fault that I got married to Sudip? she said.

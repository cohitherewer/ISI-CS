 SUNANDO SARKARCalcutta, Feb. 29: The possibility of fewer jobs for the minority community in the government sector, after the decision to recruit madarsa teachers through the School Service Commission, has elicited sharp reactions. 																								The West Bengal Madarsa Teachers Association, which, besides working as a CPM front, shares Alimuddin Street as its headquarters, alleged betrayal and charged school education minister Kanti Biswas with conspiring to take away from the states educated Muslims the only jobs for which they could aspire.																								Earlier, Biswas announced that all teaching posts in madarsas would be filled from a panel created by the School Service Commission. The states 508 government-approved madarsas provide the most jobs to educated Muslims, who comprise a large chunk of the teaching cadre in these institutions.																								For Muslims with any education, teaching in a madarsa is the safest option if they aspire for a government job, general secretary of the association Nurul Haque said today. With the number of government-sector jobs for the community being as it is, the huge class of educated Bengali Muslims had only this route to look forward to.																								Till the last School Service Commission recruitment drive, applicants for teaching jobs in madarsas were told to fill up separate forms. They were marked differently  10 marks used to be reserved for an interview that comprised questions on Islamic culture and education  and this used to be enough for educated Muslim youths to get most of these jobs.																								Around 80 per cent of about 5,000 jobs in the aided madarsas are now with Muslims. 																								Biswas declaration has opened a floodgate of complaints that even Haque, who regretted that the association had put in 26 years of work for the party (CPM), and his association are being forced to take seriously.																								How do we defend the government when we are feeling betrayed? Haque asked. We are very sorry to say this but it looks like just another ploy to rob educated Muslims of their bread and butter, he said																								Associations leaders said meetings are being lined up with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Left Front chairman Biman Bose. 																								However, school education department officials said the government is decided on routing madarsa appointments through the commission. We are suffering from a crunch and this will save us the trouble and expense of setting up a different panel for madarsa recruitments, a senior official said.

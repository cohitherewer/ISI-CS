The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Calcutta to lose 11 Assembly seats
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 26: Calcutta will soon have 10 Assembly seats, instead of the 21 at present, once the commission formed to reconstitute boundaries of the constituencies completes its work, officials said today.																								North and South 24-Parganas will together have nine additional seats, said the officials.																								The idea behind the delimitation exercise is to have Assembly segments of roughly the same population, state chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said.																								The last such exercise was undertaken in 1976 based on the 1971 census and the present operation will be based on the 2001 census, he said.																								The delimitation will also leave Purulia, West Midnapore, Bankura, Burdwan and Birbhum with fewer seats. Malda, North and South Dinajpur, Darjeeling, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri in North Bengal, which together now have 49 seats, will have 54 seats after the exercise is completed. 																								Banerjee said he had already received from the commission a draft list of the changes to take place.																								Though the delimitation exercise might lead to changes in the number of Assembly seats in individual districts, the total number of seats in the state will remain unchanged at 294.																								The population in Calcutta has not changed much, while north Bengal and districts around Calcutta have had a rise in population  the main factor contributing to the change in the number of seats in the districts, Banerjee said.

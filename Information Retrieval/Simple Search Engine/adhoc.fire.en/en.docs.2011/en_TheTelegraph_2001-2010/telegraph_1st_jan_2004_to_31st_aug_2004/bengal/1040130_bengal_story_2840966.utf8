The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Consultants line up for Great Eastern 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 29: At least seven companies have expressed interest in acting as consultants for the Great Eastern Hotel. 																								The government has decided to revamp the 150-year-old hotel, struggling to cope with competition and an overbearing workforce, with funds from the British Department of International Development (DFID). But the process cannot be initiated unless a consultant is roped in. 																								Tourism minister Dinesh Dakua said: The situation is such an advertisement cannot be published in newspapers to further work in the reconstruction process. Though the industrial reconstruction department is handling the files, the details have to be worked out by a consultant.																								 Seven consultants have shown interest. This includes some foreign companies, Dakua said.

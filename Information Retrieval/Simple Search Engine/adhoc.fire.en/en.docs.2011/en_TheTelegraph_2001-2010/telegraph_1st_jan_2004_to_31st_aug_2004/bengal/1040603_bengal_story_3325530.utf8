 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Civic polls ahead, Trinamul cries terror 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 2: Trinamul Congress supporters demonstrated in front of Dum Dum police station last night in protest against the CPMs alleged attempt to force several Trinamul and Congress candidates to withdraw their nominations for the June 27 municipal polls. 																								During last years panchayat elections, Trinamul and the Congress complained they could not field candidates in 20,000 and 4,000 seats respectively due to CPM-sponsored terror. 																								CPM cadre has unleashed a reign of terror in several wards in the two municipalities (of Dum Dum and South Dum Dum) and threatened Opposition candidates with dire consequences if they did not withdraw nominations. We have lodged specific complaints with Dum Dum police station and urged them to take action, local Trinamul MLA Arunabha Ghosh said today. 																								He has given the names of two CPM-backed criminals who are threatening candidates to the police. I have information that the police are trying their best to maintain law and order before the elections, but are receiving threats from local CPM leaders, he added.																								Ghosh plans to write to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee within a day or two, seeking his personal intervention to stop the CPM-sponsored terrorism in several pockets under the two municipalities.																								Former CPM councillor Tapan Ghosh has also lodged an FIR against CPM-backed anti-socials who threatened his family members and asked them to convince me to withdraw my candidature. 																								He is contesting as an Independent from ward 24 under the South Dum Dum municipality.

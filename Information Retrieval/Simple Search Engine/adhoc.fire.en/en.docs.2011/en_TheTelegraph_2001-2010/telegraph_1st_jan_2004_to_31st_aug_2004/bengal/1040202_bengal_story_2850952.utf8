The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, February 02, 2004 				 Feel good fails CM reality check
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 1: The Centres feel good campaign has no relation with reality, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said today.																								If anything, they (the NDA) are milking it (the feel good) with an eye on the Lok Sabha elections, the chief minister said on returning from Hyderabad, where he had been to attend the CPMs politburo and central committee meetings.																								Virtually kicking off the Left Fronts election campaign, Bhattacharjee said there is nothing to feel good about  factories are closing, workers are unhappy. The Centres faulty economic policies have led to the closure of several public sector undertakings and jute mills, he added. 																								The economy of the country and the states, in general, is going downhill. But we are hearing a term every day  feel good. What does the Centre mean by feel good? How can workers feel good when their units are closed? In Bengal, central public sectors units like MAMC, NTC (National Textile Corporation) mills and jute mills have closed down. Central units like Burn Standard, Braithwaite and Jessop are on the verge of closure, Bhattacharjee said after inaugurating an industrial trade fair at Baruipur, 25 km from here. 																								Lok Sabha MP from the area Krishna Bose and local MLA Arup Bhadra, both Trinamul Congress leaders, were not present at the opening of the first such fair in South 24-Parganas. A leaflet distributed by chairperson of the Trinamul-led Baruipur municipality Ira Chatterjee said they were not formally invited. 																								CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty, the president of the fairs organising committee, said Chatterjee was part of the panel and Bhadra had been called. No MP was among the invitees. Trinamul leaders had been invited but they did not turn up.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, Jan. 4: An inquiry committee set by the Congress-led zilla parishad here to probe charges of corruption during the CPMs tenure has kicked up a storm.																								CPM district secretary Jiban Moitra slammed the Congress move as illegal and said it violates the norms of the panchayati system. 																								The present board is violating all rules of governance. The panchayat act makes it mandatory for the zilla parishad to hold a general body meeting every three months. The Congress-led parishad has not called a single meeting since it came to power six months ago and now suddenly it has set up a board to probe charges of corruption during our tenure, Moitra said.																								Parishad sabhadhipati Gautam Chakraborty said the board has already come across three instances of graft. A case the committee is bent on probing involves former CPM sabhadhipati Shefali Khatoon, who allegedly misused funds meant for the Indira Awas Yojna.																								The CPM was routed by the Congress here in this years panchayat elections. We, the Opposition, were kept in the dark all these months about the happenings in the parishad. Complaints lodged with the district magistrate, the executive officer of the parishad, were of no help. The probe team is illegal because it was formed without our knowledge, Moitra said. A probe into corruption is conducted by officials, not politicians. 																								The Awas Yojna is centrally-sponsored and a beneficiary committee decides on who should get the funds required for renovation of the houses. The scheme is run by administrative officers and the sabhadhipati has nothing to do with it, Moitra said in Khatoons defence.

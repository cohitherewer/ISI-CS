The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 No end to vehicle bar row
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 9: With the election officials and the administration making conflicting statements, confusion persisted on the eve of polling day on the movement of two- and four-wheelers near polling booths.																								While special observer Afzal Amanullah maintained that a blanket ban had been imposed on all vehicles approaching polling stations, chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said he knew nothing about such an order.																								As far as I am concerned, two-wheelers and cars will not be allowed within 100 metres of the polling booths in the city and within 200 meters in the fringe areas and districts, Banerjee said today. I cannot comment on what other people (read Amanullah) have to say on this. There is no blanket ban and as I am authorised to make official statements, I would have known if there was any blanket ban.																								Banerjee said all vehicles, irrespective of the number of passengers, would be stopped and the people frisked if patrol personnel suspect anything wrong. Therefore, all vehicles that seem remotely suspicious will definitely be checked anywhere in the city.																								Old and sick people would, however, be allowed to take their vehicles near polling booths, he said.																								A blanket ban has been issued on the use of cellphones inside the booths from 7 am to 5 pm. Except poll observers, no one will be allowed inside the polling booths with cellphones. Any voter caught trying to enter the booth, even with his phone switched off, will be barred from voting, Banerjee said.																								The city police commissioner had earlier announced a bar on five or more people riding two-wheelers together till 5 pm on Monday.

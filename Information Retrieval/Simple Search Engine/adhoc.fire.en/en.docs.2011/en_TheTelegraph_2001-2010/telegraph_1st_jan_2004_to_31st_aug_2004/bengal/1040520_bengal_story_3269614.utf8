 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Murder stink in CPM
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Hariharpara (Murshidabad), May 19: Investigations into the murder of the CPM womens wing chief of Hariharpara has led to a manhunt for Abdus Samad, secretary of the partys local committee. 																								Forty-year-old Sangeeta Roy was burnt on the night of May 9 when her husband was out of town. She was admitted to hospital in a critical condition and succumbed to her injuries the next day. The incident was registered as an unnatural death case. 																								Pradip, Sangeetas husband, lodged a complaint on May 14, saying Samad had killed his wife. He alleged Sangeeta was murdered as she had come to know about some inner secrets of the CPM local committee. 																								We have started an investigation but the motive is not clear. We have been raiding Samads house every night but he has been evading arrest, deputy superintendent of police Sahabul Hossain said today. 																								The murder seems to be a fallout of Samads private affairs. We have begun an internal probe as the partys name is involved, said a district CPM leader. 																								Party sources said the CPM, which lost all three Lok Sabha seats in the district, is desperate to come clean. 																								It seems Samad and Sangeeta had an illicit relationship that might have led to the murder. He started frequenting her house in the name of discussing party programme after his wife, suffering from cancer, died last year, said an official probing the case.

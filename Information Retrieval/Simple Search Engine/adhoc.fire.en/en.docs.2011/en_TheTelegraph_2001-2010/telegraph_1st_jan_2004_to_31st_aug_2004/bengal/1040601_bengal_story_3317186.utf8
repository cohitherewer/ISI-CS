 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Tragedy rerun in child-death zone
 OUR CORRESPONDENTLalgola, May 31: Four children, between seven days and four years of age, have died of a mystery fever and at least 40 others have been taken ill here over the past week.																								Residents of Nashipur, about 260 km from Calcutta, put the toll at six.																								More than 40 children from Nashipur and neighbouring villages had died last year of what doctors initially called mystery fever. Tests later showed it was simple influenza and the children could be treated adequately with the infrastructure available in Murshidabad.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had visited the affected areas in the wake of an Opposition uproar and two doctors were suspended. The high court had ordered the government to pay Rs 10,000 to each of the aggrieved families responding to a petition moved by district Congress chief and Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury. 																								A team of district health department officials now camping at Nashipur said four children have died in the past week. 																								The viral fever, which has not been identified yet, has claimed Sarbina Khatun, 4, Mousumi Khatun, 9 months, Masjida Khatun, 4 months, and a 7-day-old boy, said Sachchidananda Sarkar, the districts chief medical officer.																								I have visited the village and the medical team is working day and night to bring the situation under control. Several blood samples have been collected in the past 48 hours and sent for pathological examination, he added.																								Sarbinas father Fajen said: My daughter was taken ill on Thursday. She had high fever in the morning and I thought of taking her to the doctor in the evening but she started shivering a few hours later and died.																								Masjida, her grandmother Dilfaraz Khatun said, was refused admission at Krishnapur Rural Hospital. She died on way to the subdivisional hospital, without any treatment.

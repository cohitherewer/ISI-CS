 OUR BUREAU																								April 3: Villagers in the Bandwan area of Purulia and Belpahari region of West Midnapore pass each day of their lives in fear.																								Police raids on the one hand and the intimidation and coercion of extremist elements on the other are affecting their livelihood, besides endangering their well-being and causing mental trauma.																								Following attacks by members of the Peoples War and other Naxalite factions on patrolling police personnel, security forces  including those deployed by the Centre  have been combing the areas and detaining villagers for questioning, sometimes for two to three days.																								There have also been reports of high-handedness by some of these personnel, instilling fear among the villagers.																								A joint raid by Belpahari police and Border Security Force personnel at Chhurimara village on Monday evening left five villagers injured, one of whom had to be admitted to the Midnapore district hospital in a serious condition.																								Belpahari panchayat samiti sabhapati Sudhir Mandi said about 40 BSF personnel and some police officers surrounded the village, situated about 250 km west of Calcutta. They picked up four youths, beat them up and shoved them into their vehicles. When some women protested, they too were assaulted, Mandi added. But they managed to free two of the young men, while Priyanath Hansda and Chunaram Sardar were arrested.																								Led by officer-in-charge of Belpahari police station Sailendranath Biswas, the raiding team of BSF jawans and state armed police personnel were searching each of the villagers homes when they came upon Ramesh Majhi, who had recently been released from jail, and started questioning him. Suspecting that Majhi would again be taken away by the police, some of the women in the village protested.																								Police sources said the raid was conducted after receiving information that a group each of the Peoples War and the Maoist Communist Centre had gathered in the jungles near Chhurimara. 																								When the team reached the village, they were attacked with sticks and stones and were forced to retaliate.																								West Midnapore district magistrate said he had received news that the BSF personnel had used canes to suppress some angry villagers. I have sought for more details.																								Meanwhile, villagers from Gurpana, Lakaishini, Jhontijharna and Kantagora in Bandwan block of Purulia have stopped going into the forests for fear of being picked up by the police and security forces. After last nights raid in the forests, led by Purulia superintendent of police V.K. Goyal, and the subsequent encounter with Peoples War activists, the police and the BSF are continuously searching these villages and surrounding areas.																								We dont have the courage to enter the forests to collect kendu and sal leaves, said Sahadeb Hansda, a resident of Lakaishini. We are unable to gather the leaves and our livelihood is being affected, more so because this is the season for collecting these leaves.																								The leaves are used for various purposes and sold to merchants in Bandwan and Purulia towns. We dont have any land to cultivate, and we have to rely on these leaves to fill our stomachs, said Hansda.

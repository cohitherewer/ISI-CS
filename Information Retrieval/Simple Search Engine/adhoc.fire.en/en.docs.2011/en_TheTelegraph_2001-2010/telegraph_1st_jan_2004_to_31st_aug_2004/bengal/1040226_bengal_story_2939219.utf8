 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Chandan widow still awaits health job
 RABI BANERJEE 																								Krishnagar, Feb. 25: Doctor Chandan Sen was murdered exactly a year ago. On humanitarian grounds, the health department promised to give his widow a job. 																								Bidisha and her 10-year-old son Debayan are still waiting for the letter that will bring some stability to their shattered lives. 																								On February 26 last year, Chandan Sen, who was attached to the Ranaghat sub-divisional hospital, was killed, allegedly by a group of doctors and staff members for raising his voice against misappropriation of hospital funds. His body was found next morning in a pond, about 12 km from the hospital.																								Following the unfortunate incident, health department officials promised Bidisha a permanent job so that she could provide for herself and Debayan. 																								Every one had behaved very sympathetically with me, including all my husbands friends and colleagues in the health department when he died. But till date, I have not heard from the health department. I desperately need a job for me and for my sons education and upbringing but the promises made to me are still on paper only, she said. 																								Bidisha sent her medical report to the health department last month, along with a police verification report. But I am still in the dark as nothing has been communicated to me yet from the department concerned, she added.																								State health Asim Burman said in Calcutta this afternoon that he has cleared the file concerning Bidishas job. Its true that it has taken a long time to clear the file but she will be soon absorbed, he said. Trains held up 																								Train services on the Burdwan-Howrah main section were disrupted from 10.30 pm after a goods truck was stuck on the railway track near Memari level crossing on G.T. Road. Several long-distance trains were delayed.

 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Driver reckless, students bleed 
 							 - 21 children injured as speeding school bus turns turtle  A STAFF REPORTER Prosenjit Saha, with bruises and stitches on his nose, in Apollo Hospital; (above) Pratim Mukherjee lies in bed with his arm in a sling. Pictures by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta, July 31: The usual ride to school turned into horror for 30 students when the private chartered bus carrying them overturned near Karunamoyee in Salt Lake around 11 this morning. 																								At least 21 students of Bidhannagar Municipal School, mostly studying in classes V and VI, were injured, of whom five were admitted to Apollo Hospital and another two in Suraksha clinic. Fourteen students were released after first-aid. 																								In the evening, all the students went home, except Pratim Mukherjee, who had an elbow injury. 																								Police arrested the helper of the bus but the driver is absconding. 																								After preliminary investigation, we found that the bus was moving at high speed on an empty road. The driver lost control while taking a turn and the vehicle overturned, said North 24-Parganas district superintendent of police Pravin Kumar, who rushed to the spot after the incident. 																								Salt Lake municipal chairman Dilip Gupta, who, too, went to the mishap site with other municipality officials, said the bus was hired by guardians and the school authorities were not involved. 																								We had almost reached school, chatting and singing along the way as usual, when the bus swerved and turned turtle. I was thrown out of my seat and felt a sharp pain in my arm. When the bus stopped moving, everyone was screaming around me, some were trapped under the seats, Pratim said from his bed in the emergency ward of Apollo Hospital. 																								The 11-year-old is a student of Class VI. 																								The driver of the bus was speeding unnecessarily though some of the children had protested, said Sraboni Ghosh, whose 10-year-old son Abhishek was lying on a bed next to Pratims. 																								The helper of the bus and the school authorities were very helpful, as were the Bidhannagar municipal representatives who informed all the parents of the victims, said Pratims father, Partha Mukherjee. 																								The bus company takes Rs 310 per month for the service, but has been negligent, he complained. 																								The cries of the trapped children caught the attention of locals and pedestrians, who rushed to their rescue. They broke the windows of the bus, pulled out the students and took them to hospital in ambulances and private vehicles. 																								Sabyasachi Dutta, the Trinamul Congress councillor of ward 10, demanded more traffic police personnel at important intersections of the townships roads.

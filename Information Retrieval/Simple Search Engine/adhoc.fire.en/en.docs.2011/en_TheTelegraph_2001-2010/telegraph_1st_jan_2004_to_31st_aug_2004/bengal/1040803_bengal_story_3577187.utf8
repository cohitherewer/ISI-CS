The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Caught in strike net, distress sale of hilsa
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Hilsas in Calcutta: Before the bandh brunt																								Midnapore, Aug. 2: The bandh afternoon may have made scope for a sumptuous meal for many but the same babus might lament the loss of about 150 tonnes of hilsa because of it.																								Fresh fish that were to head to Calcutta from Digha had to be sold at dirt-cheap prices to hoteliers in the seaside town because of the shutdown.																								Fish traders in Digha incurred a loss of about Rs 4 lakh today. Hilsa lovers may argue that they lost more. In a season hit by irregular monsoon and a crunch of the delicious silver-scaled delight and other varieties of fish, the bandh might lead to a price spiral. 																								Wholesale traders were forced to sell fish at half the average price in Digha as there was no transport to cart them to the marts. The hilsas, each weighing over a kilogram on an average, which cost around Rs 130 a kg till yesterday, sold at Rs 75. The Digha Fishermen and Fish Traders Association said retail traders did not buy fish as they could not transport them. Only those who had storage facilities purchased the hilsas from wholesalers. 																								The bandh resulted in a huge loss for us, said association secretary Barun Maity. During the day, wholesale traders waited in Digha with 150 tonnes of hilsa. More trawlers are on their way and we do not know what will happen, Maity said.																								In the last four days, on an average, 200 tonnes of hilsa came to the Digha market every day. Eighty per cent of this fish was transported to Calcutta. The rest went to markets in Midnapore town, Kharagpur, Haldia, Siliguri, Durgapur, Asansol and Burdwan. 																								Hilsas from Digha go to the Baithakkhana wholesale market in Sealdah and Patipukur in north Calcutta. Hilsas could not be sent to these markets today because of the bandh, said fishermens association chairman Pranab Kar. He was wary of what might follow because of the cascading effect of the lapse in supply chain.																								Subesh Maity, who owns a trawler, said he lost Rs 50,000 today. Nearly 2,000 trawlers comprising at least 10 fishermen each from Digha are in the sea to net hilsa.

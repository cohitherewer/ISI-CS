 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Land rights after 29 years
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 30: A woman today won rights to her own land after nearly three decades.																								Ratna Dutta, 53, had purchased a plot in a remote North Dinajpur village when she was 24. Today, her wait for possession of the 5.5-acre plot ended when the land revenue officer of North Dinajpur handed over the registration papers.																								In 1974, when Ratna discovered that the plot, about 500 km from Calcutta, was not being registered in her name despite repeated pleas to the district land revenue officer, she turned to the high court. She had complained that the officer was making her run around for nothing.																								That year itself, the court ordered the officer to complete the formalities. Even then Ratna had no justice coming her way. The district land revenue officer told her to go to the block land revenue officer.																								For the next two decades, Ratna was made to shuttle between the two. In 1995, she again moved the high court alleging harassment. Last year, she filed a contempt petition.																								Today, both officers told the court her papers were ready.

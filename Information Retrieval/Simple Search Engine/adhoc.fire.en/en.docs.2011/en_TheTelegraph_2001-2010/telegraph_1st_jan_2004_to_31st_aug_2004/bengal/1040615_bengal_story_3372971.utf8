The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Nexus behind felling amp; freebie
 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN				 	 Tree stubs near the Farakka barrage. A Telegraph picture																								Ahiran (Murshidabad), June 14: When the forest department is distributing saplings, greenery around Farakka barrage is fast depleting amid allegations of the involvement of sections of the forest department and police.																								Residents alleged that full-grown shishu, akashmoni, arjun and shegun trees, lining a 14-km stretch along the barrage, are being felled and the police and forest officials are conniving with the smugglers. 																								One of them, Najimul Haque, said: Trees which are about 25 years old are being cut down at night and taken away. The police and forest officers turn their backs to the felling for a fee  Rs 300 for a tree. 																								Murshidabad district magistrate Manoj Panth said he is aware of the racket. During a recent visit, I noticed stubs of fully-grown trees that had been cut down. I immediately asked the forest department and the police to conduct an inquiry. I also asked them to identify the guilty officials and bring them to book, Panth said.																								But a police officer in charge of the area, Kabir Sheikh, said manning highways was their only job here. It is not our duty to see whether trees are being smuggled out of the area. 																								Echoing Sheikh, additional divisional forest officer of Nadia and Murshidabad Rana Dutta said: Everyone knows that trees are being felled but I am not answerable to anyone.																								A meeting of senior district, forest and police officials called by Panth recently decided to form a joint forest management committee and step up awareness drives. Officials said the police would be aided by Central Industrial Security Force jawans in tightening security around the area. Saplings would be planted by the panchayats and residents would be involved in the drive. A representative of the villagers was also present at the meeting. 																								The barrage authorities, however, shrugged off responsibility of the tree theft. It is the forest departments lookout to maintain the greenery and make security arrangements in the area, said an official. 																								He added: We have received complaints saying that trees are being smuggled out. The general manager had called the forest officials but when they did not turn up, he wrote to the district magistrate.

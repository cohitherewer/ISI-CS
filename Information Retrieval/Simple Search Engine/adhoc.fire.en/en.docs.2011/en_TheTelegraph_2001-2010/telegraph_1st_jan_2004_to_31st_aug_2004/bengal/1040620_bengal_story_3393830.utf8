The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, June 20, 2004 				 Cloud on sex abuse cells 
																								Calcutta, June 19: The National Commission for Women has pointed out that the committees formed by the state government to deal with complaints of sexual harassment at the workplace do not meet the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court. 																								The guidelines mention that each committee must have more than 50 per cent female members and include a representative from a non-governmental organisation. The government panels do not have NGO members. 																								The NCW members told us that this almost amounts to not forming committees at all. So we have promised to reconstitute them and include representation from NGOs in all of them, a senior state official said.

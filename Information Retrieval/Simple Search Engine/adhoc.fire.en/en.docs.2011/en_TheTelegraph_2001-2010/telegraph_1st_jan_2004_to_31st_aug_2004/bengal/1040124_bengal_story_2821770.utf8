				 Buddha in Babudom for Marx and moneybags

 A STAFF REPORTER
				 	 Buddhadeb: Bullish 
																								Calcutta, Jan. 23: Buddhababu is raiding Chandrababus lair. 
																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will spend the last few days of January in the Andhra Pradesh capital to sell Bengals business potential. 
																								And if its politics  with the CPMs politburo and central committee meetings  on the centrestage, behind the scenes it will be business for Bhattacharjee, who is decided on mixing money matters with Marxist discussions. 
																								The highpoint of Buddhababus business agenda in Chandrababus showcase city will be the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) organised roadshow on January 30, where the Bengal chief minister will meet corporate chieftains and address them on investment opportunities in the state. We have already sent invitations to the leading industry houses in Andhra Pradesh and neighbouring states for the meeting and expect a good turnout, said Sanjay Budhia, the eastern region chairman of the CII. 
																								Not just addressing a gathering of CEOs, the CII secretariats in Calcutta and Hyderabad are busy scheduling one-on-ones for the chief minister with the heads of companies like Satyam, Dr. Reddys Laboratory, Apollo Group and Visakha Industries. 
																								The chief minister has plans to pursue a business agenda vigorously despite politics being the main reason for his Hyderabad visit. He will devote at least a few hours everyday to scout for investment in Bengal apart from attending the party meetings on business sessions, said a senior government official. 
																								Besides the CII, meetings for Bhattacharjee are being planned at Writers. According to a senior government official, Bhattacharjee will visit the Satyam headquarters and a few other IT facilities in the city. He will also call on Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu before returning to Calcutta on January 31. 
																								The chief ministers first roadshow with the CII in Mumbai last June was a huge hit and renewed interest in Bengal. Its true that people have started talking positively about the state. We hope the exercise in Hyderabad will add to the interest thats already been created, said Budhia.
																								Satyam, the countrys fourth largest IT company, is in the final stages of its negotiations with the state government over opening its city office and Visakha Industries, a leader in cement-asbestos sheets, has made a modest beginning in Bengal. Apollo has drawn up plans to upgrade its city hospital into a regional hub of excellence. 
																								With Satyam headquartered in Hyderabad and a host of other infotech companies like Infosys and Wipro having their offices in the city, promoting Bengals advantage in IT will be the focus of the chief ministers speech. But he will also highlight investment opportunities in other areas like agriculture, pharmaceuticals and healthcare and how the state has removed the negative perception, said Budhia. 
																								Industries and commerce secretary Sabyasachi Sen will make a presentation on resurgent Bengal during the meeting. 
																								Today, Andhra Pradesh is regarded as one of the most aggressive states in terms of attracting investment. If Buddhababu can woo some investors from Chandrababus state, it will send out a clear signal that Bengal has turned around, said an industry observer.

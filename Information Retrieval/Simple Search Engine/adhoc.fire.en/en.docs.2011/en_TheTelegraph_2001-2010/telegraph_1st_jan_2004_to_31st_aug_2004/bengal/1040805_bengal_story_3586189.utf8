The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Farmers rain hope dashed 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Aug. 4: Farmers in the rain-deficient south Bengal districts who had hoped yesterdays low pressure over northwest Bay of Bengal would slake their lands were disappointed. 																								The low pressure has caused rains in south Orissa and in south Bengal. But the rains over south Bengal districts were not heavy. We can only describe a rain to be heavy when rainfall exceeds 60-70 mm at a time, said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.																								Swadesh Mishra, meteorologist of the agricultural directorate, said the amount of rainfall caused by the impact of the low pressure was negligible. Between 8.30 am on Tuesday and 8.30 am on Wednesday, some of the most parched districts received rainfall between 1.8 mm and 4.1 mm. 																								We can only describe this rainfall as scanty and it is inadequate for transplantation of aman paddy (for which) we need widespread and heavy rainfall at the same time, said Mishra. 																								Officials at the agriculture department said messages have been sent across the districts to speak to the farmers about the types of alternative crops in case aman paddy cannot be transplanted.

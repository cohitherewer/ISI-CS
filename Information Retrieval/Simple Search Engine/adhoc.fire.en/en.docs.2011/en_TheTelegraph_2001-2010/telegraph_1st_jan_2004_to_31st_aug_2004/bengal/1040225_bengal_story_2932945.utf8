The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 10-year girls missing
 OUR CORRESPONDENTKrishnagar (Nadia), Feb. 24: Forty-eight hours after two 10-year-old girls went missing here on their way back from school, guardians accused the police of following the wrong track.																								Silpi Das and Suparna Mandol, both Class V students, went to school at Kulgachi, about 85 km from Calcutta, on Sunday for a programme where union minister of state for chemicals and fertilisers Satyabrata Mookerjee and local MLA Shibdas Mukherjee were the chief guests. The Union minister was at the school to scrutinise development work financed by his local area development funds. 																								The parents said the children went to school in the morning but did not return home. After searching for them in vain, they went to the police yesterday and filed a missing diary.																								Silpis father Gopal Das said a youth of the locality had been disturbing his daughter regularly, but added that he was not sure if he had a role in the incident. Suparnas father Sukumar Mandol said: My daughter is only 10 years old. It is just not possible that she had relations with a boy and may have run off.																								Both the fathers said their daughters must have been kidnapped but the police did not agree. The police said it did not look like a case of kidnapping. They had detained the youth mentioned by Gopal for questioning and after speaking to him, they concluded that the girls were not kidnapped. 																								It appears that they fled on their own. Some people in the town saw them together at a jewellery shop hours after they left school. We have interrogated people in the locality and intimated the other police stations, said the inspector-in-charge of Kotwali police station, Shantimoy Chowdhury.																								Two years ago, two minor girls were kidnapped from the same area. They were later rescued from a brothel in Mumbai. But the police failed to nab their kidnappers. In this case, too, the police have been insensitive, said Mukherjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Unpaid teachers put on poll duty 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 24: The state government has put thousands of schoolteachers, yet to be paid for March, on poll duty. 																								The teachers, who have been empanelled as polling and presiding officers, are undergoing training for the May 10 Lok Sabha elections in Bengal.																								Teachers organisations have objected to this, saying the government has no right to pressure the teachers to conduct the polls.																								Today is April 24 and we are yet to get salaries for March. We have information that we will not get salaries before April 27 or 28. Has the government any right to force us to accept poll duties when it is yet to pay us our March salaries? asked Kartick Saha, a Bengal Primary Teachers Association leader. 																								About 175,000 primary school teachers and 150,000 teachers from secondary and higher secondary institutions are yet to receive their March salary. Sources in the school education department said the salaries of teachers and non-teaching employees will be cleared by Tuesday.																								The government had earlier promised to pay the teachers salaries between the 15th and 19th of the next month. But this time the government has failed to pay the teachers salaries till today, Saha said.																								The government claims it is very serious about paying salaries to its employees on time. The state government employees are getting their salaries on a fixed date every month. But the government is neglecting us, said Ratan Laskar, a Secondary Teachers and Employees Association leader.																								Moreover, the government had promised to pay our enhanced dearness allowance (DA) pending from January this year. But till date we have not received a single instalment, Laskar said. 																								Saha and Laskar said the government could not expect the teachers to concentrate on poll duties when they had not been paid. It is not just the problem of a particular month. The government has never been able to pay salaries to the teachers between the 15th and 19th day of the month as promised by it. Is this not a major lapse on the governments part? leaders of the teachers bodies asked.																								But the CPM-controlled All Bengal Teachers Association does not agree. We face a problem in getting salary every March and April as it is the end of the financial year. But we will certainly take up the irregular payment of salaries with the government if the problem persists after April, Rita Sen, the ABTA treasurer, said.

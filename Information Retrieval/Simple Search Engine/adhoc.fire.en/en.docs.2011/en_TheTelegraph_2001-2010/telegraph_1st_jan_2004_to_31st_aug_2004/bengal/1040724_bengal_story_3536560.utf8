The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Ruler over regulator
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, July 23: The government today said it will issue a directive to the state electricity regulatory commission next week on easing the burden of tariff for small consumers in CESC-served areas but did not divulge details.																								The revised tariffs proposed by the commission will come into effect from August. The changed tariff structure (in CESC areas) will burden consumers using 300 units or less every month. These consumers will also have to pay arrears for the past four years. We will direct the commission next week to provide some relief, power minister Mrinal Banerjee said in the Assembly lobby.																								Asked if the government had the authority to issue a directive to the regulatory commission, the sole arbiter in fixing power tariffs, Banerjee said it could do so on policy matters. He also added that there are some legal problems in issuing a directive that may lead to another revision of tariffs even as the government went into a legal huddle.																								Power department sources said the government can issue a directive on subsidy by exercising its special powers but it cannot ask the commission to revise its tariff structure.																								Sources said the government is toying with twin measures. First, to request the commission to spread the payment of arrears over five or six years instead of two. Second, a partial exemption of the duty consumers pay to the government, the sources said. Banerjee said the government is exploring several alternatives. 																								Earlier, replying to the discussion on the power budget, Banerjee said the government had set a 2007 deadline for 100 per cent rural electrification.

 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, May 11: The government has deferred the appointment of the secretary and some senior officials of the new southeast zone of the School Service Commission, casting a shadow on its ability to conduct the recruitment tests for teachers in July.																								The zone was created to decentralise the operations of the commission that conducts the tests to recruit teachers in government and aided schools. The new zone was meant to cater to candidates from Nadia and North 24-Parganas. 																								About 45,000 candidates have applied from the two districts for the tests scheduled to be held across the state on July 18.																								School education minister Kanti Biswas said: We are not in a position to recruit the secretary and other key functionaries for the new zone because of the Lok Sabha elections. But we will work on a war-footing to fill the posts and render all possible help to the zone to conduct the July 18 examinations. 																								Speculation is rife that the administration, which had a run-in with the Election Commission before the polls, would not want to incur its wrath by making key appointments before the election process is over.																								The new zone chaired by Amiya Modi is headquartered in Barasat, North 24-Parganas. 																								But the office is virtually paralysed in the absence of a secretary and even telephone connections.																								Though the government has promised all help, officials at the Barasat office are not sure if they would be in a position to hold the examinations.

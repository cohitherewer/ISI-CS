 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Village thirsts for bachelors
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Cooch Behar, March 22: The wait for wedding bells to ring has rolled into its fourth year.																								Marooned in an enclave with a skewered gender ratio on Indian territory, women of marriageable age in Chhit Karala are finding it impossible to get grooms.																								Though an official census has never been conducted here, residents said the 2,500-strong population consists of more than 1,500 women.																								There are no more bachelors left in our village. In fact, all the young men have more than one wife, said Azgar Ali Mian, a resident of the enclave.																								We had come to terms with living without an identity. We accepted being refused entry into our own country. We had learnt to live without voters or ration cards and tolerate the border guards. But how can you expect us to watch and do nothing when our daughters are in danger of remaining spinsters? he asked.																								Desperate to tide over the social malaise plaguing the enclave, residents said they were planning to approach the deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh.																								We are not Indians, but live on Indian soil. We are Bangladeshis, but our country does not want us. The border guards do not let us enter our country and throw us into prison if we are spotted outside the enclave. We cannot go to other villages to look for prospective grooms, Mian said.																								A village elder, Sailen Burman, said there was a time when they would cross over to Bangladesh or enter proper Indian villages, scout for grooms, and get their daughters married.																								But that was a time when the laws were not so stringent and the guards understood our misery. Once that stopped, we were forced to find suitable boys from our village, he said. When the shortage of grooms was first felt some five years ago, parents had no choice but to marry off their daughters to married men, he added.																								As the trend grew, the grooms parents began demanding hefty amounts as dowry. Instances of marital discord mounted. Young women then began resisting their parents efforts to get them married off to men who were married.																								Girls like me are scared, Minati Burman, 22, said.																								Some 50 km away, residents of Natkobari enclave are facing a similar problem.																								We have heard about the problems faced by Chhit Karala. Though the situation is not that bad here, we fear we are heading in the same direction, said Abdur Rehman, a village elder.

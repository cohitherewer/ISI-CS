 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Four days to hanging, Nata bargains
 DEBASISH CHATTERJEECalcutta, June 20: Days before rapist and murderer Dhananjay Chatterjees execution in the early hours of June 25, hangman Nata Mallik is making his presence felt  with a demand for stipends for his assistants. 																								Mallik, 83, is demanding formal acknowledgement and monthly stipends for three men, including his son, who will assist him in hanging Chatterjee. 																								Earlier, he wangled a regular job for his successor, grandson Prabhat, instead of the pay-per-execution system. 																								Conducting a hanging requires a robust physical and mental make-up. Above all, it is experience that counts, besides the skill, the expertise and the ability to take the psychological pressure. You dont get a professional hangman easily. For instance, I am working from the time I was 16 and there has not been a second person in the state since, Mallik argued. 																								Mallik is a third generation hangman. He has assisted his father in 35 executions and his own count is 24. On Friday, Chatterjee will add to his score. 																								This time I have been promised Rs 10,000 for hanging Chatterjee but on earlier occasions the payment was not as much. I am not an opportunist, all that I ask for is a stipend and recognition for professional hangmen as is the case for all professionals in their respective fields, he said. 																								He has requested jails minister Biswanath Chowdhury to look into his demands. The minister assured me at Writers Buildings that he would try and get the proposal approved by the government, Mallik said. 																								Each of the four persons in the hanging team is equally important, he said. 																								If we fail to hang the man, the court would be forced to release him. So each one of us is important. While one person brings the convict to the scaffold, others tie his legs and hands  all this requires skill. After my assistants make him ready, I put on the black shroud, Mallik added. 																								The knots should be tied in such a manner that they do not come loose or it might prove to be a major hurdle at the time of hanging. The rope should also be set up very carefully so that it does not snap when the man is hanged, he said.																								Malliks son Mahadeb said inspector-general of police (prison) Joydeb Chakraborty would visit Alipore Central Jail tomorrow to inspect a trial hanging with a sandbag of the same weight as Chatterjees. My father will personally request Joydebbabu during his visit, he said.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 12: A desi Viagra will come to town if the plans of a Hyderabad-based company to cultivate safed musli and other medicinal herbs here bear fruit.																								Nandan Agro Farms will enter into an agreement with the government tomorrow for a demonstration plot where farmers will be trained in growing the herbs. Once convinced about their ability and the market, the company will set up a unit.																								The demonstration plot spread over 10 acres will also be used to study the range of medicinal plants that can be grown in the state. Director of Nandan Agro B. Jaya Kumar said: Farmers in many other parts of the country are making profits worth lakhs every year producing safed musli. The company has asked for a larger plot near the city for commercial production. 																								The chief minister was very encouraging. He said this is a priority sector for the government, a company official said.																								Chlorophytum borivilianum, which the company described as a wonder medicine, is being branded as Indian Viagra and marketed in the form of dry roots. It will soon hit the market in the tablet form, Jaya Kumar said. 																								If a tablet of Viagra costs about Rs 200, this will cost Rs 15, he added.

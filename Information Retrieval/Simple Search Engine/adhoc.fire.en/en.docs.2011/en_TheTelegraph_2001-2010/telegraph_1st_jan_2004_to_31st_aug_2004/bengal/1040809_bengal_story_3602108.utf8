The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Bird camp to boost tourism
 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA 				 	 A Himalayan bird. Telegraph picture																								Siliguri, Aug. 8: Increasing queries on the avian fauna in north Bengal has prompted the local travel industry to promote birdwatching. 																								To begin with, the Association of Conservation and Tourism (ACT) is set to train local people on birdwatching. As a first step, a two-day training programme for would-be guides will be kicked off tomorrow at Gorumara Jungle Camp in Jalpaiguri. 																								Sujan Chatterjee, an ornithologist from Calcutta, will train them on the techniques of identifying birds so that they can guide visitors interested in birdwatching. 																								Bengal has the highest number of bird species, yet birdwatching has not developed here. Our idea is to promote tourism through birdwatching, so good local guides is the need of the hour. We will also distribute books on birds found here among the people, Chatterjee said.																								He was the chief co-ordinator of two earlier surveys on birds in the region. The survey team included ornithologists Bill Harvey, Bikram Grewal and Sumit Sen. 																								More than 250 species were spotted in the first survey in November 2002 in north Bengal. In the second survey next year, 342 species were sighted in Sikkim and north Bengal. 																								Densely forested Gorumara, Fulbari barrage (which hosts a large contingent of migratory birds in winter), Gajaldoba, Lava, Sandakphu, the Mahakal trail and Pelling in Sikkim are some of the places rich in rare bird species.																								A large section of foreign tourists is interested in birdwatching and going on tours to regions abounding in birds. In Europe, tour operators have special packages for them. The region is a treasure house of rare and fascinating birds, and tourists are taking an interest, said Raj Basu, the vice-president of ACT.																								He added: In Bharatpur, which is the most popular birdwatching haven in India, every local resident, even rickshaw-pullers, can identify birds. If the same is done here, our region, too, will become a popular destination. 																								Training residents, Chatterjee said, will work in two ways. First, it will help people earn some money by working as guides. Second, they will become sensitive to the issue of conservation.

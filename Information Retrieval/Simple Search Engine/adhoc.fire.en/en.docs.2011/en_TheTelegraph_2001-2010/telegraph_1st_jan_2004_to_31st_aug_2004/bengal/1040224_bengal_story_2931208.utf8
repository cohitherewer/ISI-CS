The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 New town amp; industry hub on table
																								Calcutta, Feb. 23: The government will discuss proposals to acquire land to develop a township in Jalpaiguri and expand the industrial belt in Ranigunj at Thursdays cabinet meeting, says a staff reporter.																								A township is likely to spring up over 504 acres in the north Bengal town. The land would be acquired and used to develop a residential complex and other related facilities like approach roads. 																								An official said the area would be primarily developed as a Central Reserve Police Force base. The government was particularly interested in the CRPF setting up base in north Bengal as there is none in the region. The township will give a boost to the economy, the official said. 																								The government is also planning to aquire 128 acres through the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority at Mangalpur in Ranigunj. The satellite township there is fast growing as a hub for medium- and small-scale units.

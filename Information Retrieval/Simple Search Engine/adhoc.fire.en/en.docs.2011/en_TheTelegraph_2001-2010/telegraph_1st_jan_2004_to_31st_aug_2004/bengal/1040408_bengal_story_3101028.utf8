 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 History setback sparks suicide
Durgapur, April 7: Mahua Mondal, a higher secondary examinee, committed suicide by consuming poison after she could not perform up to her expectations in the history examination. 																								A resident of Kumardih, about 210 km from Calcutta, Mahua went into acute depression after the Monday test. That same night, the student of Ukhra K.B. Institution swallowed poison.																								Her parents found out at dinnertime and rushed her to hospital. She breathed her last on Tuesday night. 																								I never scolded her for not doing well.... When I saw her depressed, I made inquiries from other students and got to know that the question paper was a bit tough for mediocre students. I do not know why she took such a drastic step, said her sobbing father.

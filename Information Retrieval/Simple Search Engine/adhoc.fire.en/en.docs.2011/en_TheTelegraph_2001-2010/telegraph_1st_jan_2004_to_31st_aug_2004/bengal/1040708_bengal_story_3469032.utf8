 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 5 die as Sumo slides off slush 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT The mangled remains of the Sumo. (AFP)Sevoke, July 7: The first landslide of the year has claimed five people. The accident occurred around 10 last night when the driver of a Tata Sumo failed to negotiate the debris left behind by the avalanche of slush and boulders that had swamped NH 31-A near Coronation Bridge, around 22 km from Siliguri.																								The vehicle skidded off the road and hurtled around 500 feet into a gorge by the Teesta, the impact crushing it. 																								Among the dead was Devendra Puri, assistant director of the Sikkim education department. Inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said in Calcutta: One of them, Devendra Puri, 50, was rescued from the car. He died after he was taken to hospital. 																								Four bodies were recovered from the mangled vehicle this morning after a nightlong search by police, the fire department and NGOs.																								One of the bodies was identified as that of Amit Puri, 23, Devendra Puris son. The driver, who also owned the vehicle, was identified as 35-year-old Md Kaifuddin of Tadong, Gangtok. 																								Two bodies are yet to be identified. 																								Landslides are an annual phenomenon in the hills and an expert committee was formed to chart ways to reduce the destruction in their wake. The recommendations are yet to be implemented.																								Senior police officers present at the accident site said preliminary investigations showed that the landslide had occurred before the vehicle passed the spot. It seems that the driver lost control trying to drive the vehicle through the debris, an officer said.																								The Puris were heading home to Rhenock, in Sikkims East district, from the New Jalpaiguri railway station. They had hired the Sumo (SK 04 5740) on share with two other passengers.

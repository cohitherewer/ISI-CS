 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Youth burnt
																								Krishnagar, April 5: A bash this weekend proved to be Subir Roys last.																								The 20-year-old unemployed youth burnt himself to death after being scolded by his mother on Sunday night for not shouldering the familys responsibility.																								He dropped out from school and was indifferent about earning a livelihood. Instead, he always tried to help others in the locality and organise programmes, said father Subhash, a resident of the township, about 50 km from Calcutta. Subir succumbed to severe burns this morning.

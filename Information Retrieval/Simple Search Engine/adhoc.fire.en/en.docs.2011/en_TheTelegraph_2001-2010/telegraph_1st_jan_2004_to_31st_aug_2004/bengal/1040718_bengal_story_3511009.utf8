 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 CM retreats on peace oasis claim
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 17: Oasis of peace, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had claimed not so long ago. Today, he expressed concern over rising crime against women in the state and urged police to sit up. 																								Addressing IPS officers this afternoon, the chief minister said crime against women was on the rise and rapped officers for their occasional slackness in reacting to such complaints. 																								Bhattacharjees statement comes at a time when the Opposition has been screaming about deterioration of law and order. 																								Last month, the National Commission for Women had pointed at rising crime against women in Calcutta and the state. 																								An introspective Bhattacharjee lashed out against officers on corruption among seniors, saying such reports were tarnishing the image of the police. 																								Corruption in police would not be tolerated at any cost. Those guilty  both the higher and lower rungs  would be punished, sources quoted him as saying. 																								The chief minister, also in charge of the home portfolio, suggested that the advisory committees, set up at all police stations to increase interaction with the public, should meet at least once a month. 																								Police should reach out to the people and try to fathom their demands and aspirations, he added.

 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Buses from wedding drive into loot trap
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Munshirhat (Howrah), Feb. 26: Ten dacoits, two of them women, looted half a dozen vehicles, including two buses returning from a wedding reception, here last night.																								The driver of a van carrying potatoes was the first to screech to a halt at the sight of logs spread across Munshirhat-Pero Road at Jagatballavpur, 80 km from Calcutta. It was around 2 am.																								The driver was beaten up and Rs 4,000 taken away. Two other potato-laden vans met the same fate. A truck came next. Its driver was beaten up and robbed of Rs 5,000. 																								An hour later, the two buses returning from a wedding at Sarsuna on the southern fringes of Calcutta arrived. The dacoits surrounded them, broke windowpanes and wrenched the doors open. They beat some of us and pointed revolvers at the rest. We watched on, helpless, said Tarun Pandit, who was in one of the buses. The dacoits mopped up about Rs 50,000 and nearly a kilogram of gold and silver jewellery from 92 people. 																								The women handed over their ornaments without resistance. We did not have an alternative, said Sunita Das. 																								The men alleged that some of the dacoits misbehaved with the women. Srimanta Das said: When we saw that they were trying to molest our women, we resisted and received more blows, but it worked. After the plundering, they ran across an open field. It was 4 in the morning.																								The police suspect the gang was from Gopalnagar in North 24-Parganas. They came here four days ago for a recce, said Howrah superintendent of police Mihir Bhattacharya. Five people were later arrested from Domjur and Sealdah. Bhattacharya said they were part of the gang.																								Last week, passengers of a bus returning from a wedding reception were looted at Bhangar in South 24-Parganas.

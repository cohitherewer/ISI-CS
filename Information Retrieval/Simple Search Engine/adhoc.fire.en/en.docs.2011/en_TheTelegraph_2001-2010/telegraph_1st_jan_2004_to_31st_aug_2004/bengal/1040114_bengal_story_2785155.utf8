The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Queen of tracks shown the red card
 															- CHIEF GUEST PT USHA ACCUSED OF HELPING HOME-STATE ATHLETES AT SCHOOL MEET AVIJIT SINHA				 	 fULL throttle: PT Usha in her prime. File picture Jalpaiguri, Jan. 13: Once  known for setting the tracks on fire, Sprint Queen P.T.  Usha walked off the sports complex here today  possibly  in tears  after being accused of trespassing.																								Invited as the chief guest to the all-India school games, Usha was told by the organisers to restrict her movement inside the ground as she had, allegedly, stepped onto the tracks where no one, except competitors, are allowed.																								Kavita Roy Choudhury, the vice-president of the School Games Federation of India that organises the event, said: Usha was helping the participants from Kerala (her home state). There are four athletes from her coaching school who she was guiding. She was even fixing the nails of their blocks on the tracks. We feared that other states would object to this and asked her to stay away from the tracks. 																								Around 2.30 pm, accompanied by husband Srinivasan, Usha was seen coming out of the field, blaming the games officials for organisational problems. Two officials rushed behind her, apologising and clarifying why she was being requested to keep off the tracks. 																								As you are crossing the tracks repeatedly and helping out the participants from Kerala, federation officials have instructed us to inform you not to go to that area. Please dont take it otherwise, one of them told her.																								Unconvinced, Usha said: I am not standing on the tracks. Im also not roaming the places where the events are on. Spotting journalists around, she stopped speaking and stood by the tracks, behind the officials near the finish line.																								After a while, she was seen wiping her eyes, and left the ground with her husband.																								Officials said Usha had expressed disgust and anguish over the delay in staging the events and the inadequate arrangements for the athletes refreshments. She was quoted as saying: The schedule prepared is not congenial for the participants and it is tough for them to maintain form as the events are going on at a very slow pace. To the media, however, she would only say: No, there is no problem at all.																								Roy Choudhury admitted to failure to keep up the timings of the events. 																								As this is a mega event with 29 teams participating in various categories, there was some backlog. We do admit that it is a fault on our part. But we feel that we would be able to clear the backlog, she added.																								If games officials are to be believed, there have been difficulties of a different nature also. Wherever she is moving inside the ground, autograph hunters are following her. Some people are also posing with her for photographs. This has created a problem for us, an official said.																								It may only be a coincidence, but the girls from Kerala today overtook their Bengal counterparts in the medal tally with a 11-gold haul.

 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 The best of six for VIP Road
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE																								Calcutta, July 18: Peak-hour congestion, 34 accidents, eight of them fatal  the traffic situation on VIP Road that connects the city to Dum Dum airport has proved to be an embarrassment for North 24-Parganas police in the past year.																								Finally, they are out with a plan to regulate movement of vehicles on the six-km stretch. 																								District superintendent of police Parveen Kumar said suggestions were sought from all officers before the traffic department shortlisted six points and decided to implement them immediately. We received several suggestions from the officers but zeroed in on six of them. They will be put into effect as soon as possible, Kumar said.																								The traffic lights on the stretch and at important junctions, put up only a couple of years ago as part of the Green Channel Project, are not functioning. A prime objective of the police is to get them repaired at the earliest. 																								The first job is to make both the manual and the automatic traffic lights operational, a traffic department officer said.																								We will publicise the existence of the Pelican signal, meant to be operated by pedestrians  who will have to push a button to turn the light red before crossing the road  at Golaghata. The fatal accidents have taken place on the stretch between Golaghata and Sribhumi and this spot needs to be attended to immediately, the officer added. 																								For smoother traffic movement at Baguiati, Keshtopur and Teghoria, the traffic department has proposed building subways for pedestrians. 																								With the EM Bypass New Town Connector off VIP Road open, the number of vehicles during peak hours has jumped and congestion is a scare for airport-bound commuters. That is why we are thinking of pedestrian subways, the officer said. 																								Unlike the current plan, in which three officers of the rank of inspector man the VIP Road, one senior officer will take charge. More traffic constables will be deployed and road rules, which will be displayed on signboards at intersections, imposed strictly on pedestrians.

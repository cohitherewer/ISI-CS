The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Buddhas anti-Cong rhetoric
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 26: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the Left parties will strive to stitch an alternative government at the Centre with support from Laloo Prasad Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav and the Asom Gana Parishad.																								But we will not seek support from the Congress to form a government at the Centre. We had never supported the Congress, nor will we support it in future, Bhattacharjee said at an election rally called in support of CPM nominees Rabin Deb and Sujan Chakraborty.																								Accusing the Congress of pursuing a faulty economic policy, Bhattacharjee said the party has lost ground and was responsible for the BJPs surge. 																								Bhattacharjees remarks on government formation in Delhi without having anything to do with the Congress, however, contradict statements made by politburo members Sitaram Yechuri and Prakash Karat. Both leaders had spoken about the possibility of extending support to the Congress to keep the BJP out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Buses to go on Monday strike
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 1: An estimated 17,000 private buses and minibuses are expected to stay off the roads on Monday in response to a strike called by two major lobbies to press the government for a steeper hike in fares. 																								The Bengal Bus Syndicate and the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate, which control a majority of private buses and minibuses in the state, today said they were unhappy about the government ignoring demands for what they called a substantial hike in fares. 																								In the fare revision announced early this week, the government had left the minimum fare for private buses, minibuses and state buses untouched, much to the chagrin of the unions. The fare for each subsequent stage was hiked by 50 paise. 																								Justifying the strike call, Swarnakamal Saha of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate said: We wrote to the transport minister, asking him to reconsider the fare structure. Alternatively, if the fares are not hiked, the additional burden of permit renewal fees, additional fines by police and road tax should be lifted off our shoulders. The minister didnt respond Weve written to him today announcing our token strike on July 5. 																								Minister Subhas Chakraborty said: There is no logic in their argument. I have spoken to the bus owners individually. I explained that their daily additional income on account of fare revision will easily offset the additional costs of fuel price hike. Each bus owner will make a profit out of the revised fares. Some have understood the logic and agreed with me, most havent. 																								He added: I know that the bus owners are not happy. I have also received deputation from several quarters asking not to revise the fares. I know that I cant make everyone happy. 																								Appealing to the unions to call off the strike, Chakraborty said he would employ Citu workers to obstruct the bus unions if they tried to prolong the strike.

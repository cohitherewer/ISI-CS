 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Assault on actress
																								Howrah, Feb. 19: Two youths attacked actress and animal welfare activist Ishita Mukherjee and ransacked her house in Shibpur today. 																								Ishita, who sustained minor injuries, lodged an FIR accusing her father of masterminding the attack. She said in her complaint her father Gourmohan Mukherjee had joined hands with local promoters to sell the house. They are trying to kick me out, she said.																								Police said the miscreants did not take away anything. It proves they had no intention to rob her, said a police officer. Ishita said: It was not the first attack on me. Some goons pelted stones at my house a few days ago. I informed the police but no action was taken.																								Bandh ban plea: Congress leader Idris Ali today moved a petition in Calcutta High Court demanding an order to ban the February 24 bandh called by Left trade unions. It will be heard on February 23.

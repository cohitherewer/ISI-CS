 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Card swindlers caught 
 PRONAB MONDAL 																								Calcutta, July 28: Applied for a credit card? Think twice before rattling off your date of birth on the phone to a bank official. 																								The DoB, which serves as passwords for individual card-holders, might find its way to a conman, who can then make merry while you pay. 																								Police unearthed the new crime genre in the city with the arrest of three youths. 																								The trio had got hold of a credit card applied for by businessman Subrata Mitra, activated it by finding out his DoB from him and spent Rs 38,000. 																								What they needed was Mitras DoB. Immediately after knowing it, they put a burden of Rs 38,000 on Mitras shoulder..., said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, south division. 																								With the help of an owner of an electronic goods shop in Burrabazar, they purchased articles against the card and re-sold it to the shop-owner to get liquid cash. The shop-owner was paid a commission. We will examine him, said Sharma. 																								Officials of Karaya police station swung into action after receiving a complaint from Jitendra Lakhotia, the agent of a courier company assigned by the bank to deliver the card. 																								During the course of investigation, we came to know the card was hijacked in transit. We arrested Vinay Gupta, an employee of the courier company who was asked to deliver the card, said Sharma. 																								After interrogating Gupta, police learnt he had given the card to Moloy Banerjee of Bally. He handed over the card to Sudipta Pal in nearby Uttarpara. Pal used to work for a foreign bank till a year ago. 																								Acting on the information, a team of four policemen raided the houses of Banerjee and Pal early this morning. 																								Police said after getting the card, Pal contacted Mitra pretending to be a bank employee. An unsuspecting Mitra answered all his queries, including one on his date of birth. 																								Pal called the bank, identified himself as Mitra and asked for the card to be activated. 																								Bank authorities asked him three questions  the card number, the mailing address and the DoB. Pal had all the answers. 																								It seems it is not first time they have committed the crime. We hope more cases will come out soon, said Sharma.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 CPI turns budget screws
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 3: Four days before P. Chidambaram unveils the first budget of this Congress-led government, a key ally made threatening noises over benefits for farmers and senior citizens. 																								A.B. Bardhan, the general secretary of the CPI, today warned of countrywide agitation if the budget did not address the problems of weaker sections, like poor farmers and retired citizens. 																								On a days visit to the city, Bardhan said his party has spelt out its expectations to the United Progressive Alliance government. It is expected that peoples aspirations will be reflected in the Union budget this time, he said. 																								Asked what his party would do if the budget did not live up to its expectations, he said: Though we shall not withdraw support on the government, party workers and supporters will hit the streets across the country as a mark of protest. 																								He added: We hope the budget will provide relief to poor farmers who struggle with their debts. Besides, the budget should provide real concessions to pensioners and senior citizens. 																								Bardhan welcomed the decision to remove four governors appointed by the NDA government, but expressed satisfaction over Bengal governor Viren J. Shah, also appointed during Vajpayees regime. 																								All four governors served the interest of the BJP-RSS combine by allowing their supporters to use their official bungalows. Shah is not an RSS appointee he is a good industrialist and thats why we have no objections about Shah functioning as the governor, Bardhan said.

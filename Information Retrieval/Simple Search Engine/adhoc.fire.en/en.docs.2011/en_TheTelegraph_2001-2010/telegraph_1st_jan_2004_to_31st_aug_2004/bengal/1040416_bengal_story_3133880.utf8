 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 15: The biggest lawyers body in the state has threatened ceasework demanding, among other things, morning courts in four districts most oppressed by summer.																								General secretary of the West Bengal Lawyers Association Uttam Majumdar has written to Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court A.K. Mathur threatening the strike. 																								We have made repeated appeals to Justice Mathur to direct the administrations of four districts  Burdwan, Bankura, Birbhum and Purulia  to hold morning courts during the summer. The chief justice had assured us that he would consider the demand. But till date we have not heard from his office. The lawyers of these districts are pressuring the association to start a movement if the demand to hold morning courts is not met, Majumdar said today.																								Lawyers owing allegiance to the state bar council had struck work for 45 days in November-December 2002 against enhanced court fees, virtually paralysing the judiciary. The Supreme Court outlawed strike by lawyers that very year.																								Majumdar said that over 125 posts of judges are lying vacant in subordinate courts. A delegation from the association met the chief justice a month ago. He assured that the matter will be taken up with the government but not a single vacant post has yet been filled, he said.Sister in court																								Justice Barin Ghosh of Calcutta High Court today directed police to submit a detailed report on the allegation of Dipika Roy, who had complained that her brother was torturing her old parents and sister with the connivance of the police in Madhyamgram. 																								Her brother Susanta, Dipika said, was after their fathers property. The judge asked her parents Suklal Roy, 72, and Gitarani, 65, to come to the court on April 22 to narrate their plight.

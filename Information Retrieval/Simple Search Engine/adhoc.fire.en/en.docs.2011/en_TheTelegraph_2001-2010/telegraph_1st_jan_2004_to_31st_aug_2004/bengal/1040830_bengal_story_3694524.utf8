The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, August 30, 2004 				 CM sit-up for sleeping cops
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, Aug. 29: Policemen who sat for more than a year-and-a-half on a missing complaint filed by the parents of a 16-year-old girl got cracking at the mere prod of the chief minister.																								On the night of February 17, 2003, Keyabithi Sarkar was abducted at gun-point from her home in Nadias Nakashipara, 130 km from Calcutta. Her parents had identified the leader of the kidnappers as local goon Bikash Biswas. 																								When we tried to prevent them, they pressed a revolver against my husbands head, said Shobha Sarkar, the mother. An FIR was lodged the next day. But they did nothing, saying my daughter had fled with someone, she said. 																								Keyabithis father Mantu, a fruitseller, went to the human rights commission where officials said they could not interfere as a police probe was underway. Then we went to the CID. We were told that the local police had to handle the case. Finding no alternative, we wrote to the chief minister, said Shobha.																								Following a letter from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees office to district superintendent Benoy Chakraborty, the police initiated investigation afresh and four people were picked up almost immediately. 																								The main accused, Bikash, is still missing but Keyabithi has been traced to Orissa.																								 Chakraborty said he has sought an explanation from the officer-in-charge of Nakashipara police station.																								After receiving the letter from the chief ministers office, I asked the local police to investigate the case. Some arrests have been made and we are looking for Bikash. We have traced the girl to Orissa and a team of officials will be there soon, Chakraborty said.																								But the arrested quartet is out on bail and the Sarkars have left their house at Rameswar Pally for adjacent Khidderpore village fearing a reprisal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Alert ahead of Maoist assault
 ANUPAM DASGUPTA 																								Siliguri, April 18: Almost a month before Maoist guerrillas stormed the border town of Pashupati Nagar, a Union home ministry directive had stressed the need to deploy more Sashastra Suraksha Bal (SSB) personnel along the borders with Nepal and Bhutan in north Bengal and Sikkim. 																								The directive  dated March 12, 2004  came following information about heightened Maoist activity on the Indian side. 																								The SSB, known as the Special Services Bureau earlier, had come under fire from a section of Nepal government officials as the extremists who mounted the Pashupati Nagar strike were reinforced by Maoists operating from the Indian side. 																								The directive had also emphasised the need to conduct checks on movement across the border, especially after the Royal Bhutan Army offensive on Indian militant groups operating in its territory in December. 																								It had also called for a complete revamp of the Area Wing, the SSBs intelligence arm. 																								Deputy inspector-general of the force Tsering Namgyal said: We had received the directive, which takes full cognisance of the volatile situation along the India-Nepal border. Plans are afoot to deploy more battalions on the Nepal border. The Centre has also given the final go-ahead to SSB deployment patterns along the India-Bhutan border. 																								Over the years, the Maoists have managed to set up safe houses and are using the Siliguri corridor for shipment of weapons. Mohan Baidya, the third in the Maoist hierarchy, was recently arrested from a Siliguri nursing home where he was admitted to undergo a cataract operation. 																								SSB sources said the Centre has agreed to raise about 20 new battalions of the para-military force. At present, two battalions of four companies each, are deployed along the 100-km India-Nepal border in Bengal and Sikkim.

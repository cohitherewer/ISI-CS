 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Citu sizzles on power tariff order
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 2: The Citu will gherao the office of the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission in Salt Lake on June 10 in protest against its order last week increasing power tariff for domestic consumers. 																								The move by the CPMs labour arm follows power minister Mrinal Banerjees criticism of the commissions order. 																								Banerjee wrote to Union power minister P.M. Sayeed on Friday that his government would soon propose amendments to the electricity act of 2003, particularly on fixing tariff and cross-subsidy. 																								Citu supporters working with CESC, the Calcutta power utility, and the state electricity board (SEB) will jointly organise the protest. 																								Citu vice-president Prasanta Nandichowdhury, who looks after the units in the CESC and the SEB, said the decision was unnecessary. The issue has been included in the common minimum programme... Naturally, it is unwise to issue the order regarding restructuring of power tariff at this moment. We feel the order will evoke severe public agitation, he added. 																								Before the May 10 Lok Sabha elections, the Citu had organised movements against the SEB, alleging that it was supplying power to neighbouring states during evening peak hours neglecting the demands of rural Bengal.

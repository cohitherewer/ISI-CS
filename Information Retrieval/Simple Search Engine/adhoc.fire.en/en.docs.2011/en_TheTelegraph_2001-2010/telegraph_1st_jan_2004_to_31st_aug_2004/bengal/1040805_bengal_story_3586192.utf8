 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, Aug. 4: A woman died of heart failure after hearing that her familys only source of income, a mango orchard, had been washed away in Panchanandapur last night. 																								Vinti Chowdhury, 47, died at 9 pm on Tuesday after receiving news that the four-bigha orchard had been swept away by the Ganga, said husband Chandramohan. We could not even take her to a hospital.																								The Ganga began eroding huge chunks of land last evening and, according to irrigation department executive engineer Pundarikakshya Roy, the river has washed away 9.6 hectares of land since yesterday. 																								It was on July 20 that we lost our home to the river and have been staying in a rented house. We used to earn around Rs 40,000 selling mangoes. Now we have no source of income left, lamented Chandramohan, who has to fend for his three minor sons.																								Irrigation department sources said with the water level of the Ganga rising since yesterday, there was bound to be renewed erosion in the Panchanandapur area. They said since last night the Ganga had advanced 300 metres in the direction of the Panchanandapur bus stand.																								Roy said last year, the erosion had begun in similar fashion in August and on September 5, the river had gobbled the irrigation departments bungalow, Ganga Bhavan. He indicated that this year, the worst is yet to come.																								The block development officer of Kaliachak II, Pijush Goswami, agreed that the situation was not good. 																								Yesterday, the erosion continued till midnight, and is still advancing. The people of the area, however, had shifted out. It seems that the village of Sukullapur will be washed away this year, Goswami said. 																								The officer added that the way in which the erosion was taking place this year, there were chances that the area where the Panchanandapur bazar stands, might turn into an island with water surrounding it on all sides. 																								Over a thousand people who have left their homes to escape the fury of the river are staying along the state highway. 																								In last nights spell of erosion, around 170 huts in Sukullapur were washed away and more than 250 mango trees were damaged by the waters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Shops razed
																								Calcutta, May 24: A fire broke out at Simla Street in the Jorasanko area at 7 pm today, razing two shops and damaging portions of three adjacent buildings, says a staff reporter.																								Twenty fire engines took more than three hours to douse the blaze. Officials said no one was seriously hurt though many residents of the area had to be given first aid because of the thick pall of smoke.																								The buildings are all old, and most of them do not have proper infrastructure for fire prevention, a fire brigade official said while pointing out why the fire spread fast.

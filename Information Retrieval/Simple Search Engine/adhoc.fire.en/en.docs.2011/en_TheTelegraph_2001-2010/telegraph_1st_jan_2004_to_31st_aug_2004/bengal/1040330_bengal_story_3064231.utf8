 Signature of the person to be verified by policeCalcutta, March 29: Wiser after allegations of paper leak in this years Madhyamik, the higher secondary council today announced measures to prevent recurrence of such lapses in the HS exams beginning April 1. 																								We are taking all possible measures so that the untoward incidents that marred the Madhyamik exams do not occur here. We are working overtime to make it hassle-free for the HS examinees, secretary of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education Dibyendu Chakraborty said today. 																								Early this month, mistakes in the Madhyamik English paper and charges of mathematics paper leak had sparked a furore. 																								In Cooch Behar, an employee of the treasury office, where Madhyamik papers for the region are stored, tore off a packet containing questions for the additional biology test a fortnight before the exam.																								Criticism from the Opposition prompted education minister Kanti Biswas to make a statement in the Assembly. Secondary board president Dibyendu Hota, too, regretted the lapses and promised action against those responsible. 																								Chakraborty has been barred from examination-related work as one of his relatives is appearing in the HS finals.																								Official sources said the council has drawn up a series of plans to prevent a Madhyamik repeat. The moderators and paper-setters assigned to give final touches to the question papers have been asked to submit in writing that they will be held responsible if there are mistakes. 																								Though we had rules to punish paper-setters and moderators for mistakes in question papers, we were not serious enough to implement them. But mistakes in some Madhyamik question papers have prompted us to be strict, said a council official.																								To minimise chances of a leak, the question papers would be double sealed. For the first time, the packets containing the question papers will bear the warning: Not to be opened, the official said. 																								Names of the entitled to open the packets will be on the cover. Besides, attested copies of signatures of the officials assigned to open the packets will be kept at the local police station. At the time of opening of the packets, copies of the signatures will be sent to the examination venues for verification, said an official.																								Council officials did not rule out delay in the publication of the results as a few thousand teachers would be on election duty. 																								Though the examination process will be completed by April 26, teachers and our employees will be busy till May 13, when the election results will be announced. Besides, many schools will be taken over for election-related work, a council official said.

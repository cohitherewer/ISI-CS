 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Naxalite threats hoax: Top cop
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, April 28: Director-general of police Shyamal Dutta today said most threats issued in the name of Peoples War have turned out to be fake.																								He said a man arrested last week from Santoshpur on the citys southern fringes would be released after an inquiry proved allegations about his Peoples War links to be wrong.																								Every threat allegedly issued by the extremist groups is being investigated by the local police as well as the intelligence branch. After such inquiries made by a special team of the IB, it is clear that most threats have no link with PW (Peoples War) activists, but have been done by some people for personal vengeance, Dutta said at Writers Buildings.																								He said the police do not expect any major threat during elections, but did not mention other instances where threats have been shown to be false or those where Peoples War links are not being ruled out.																								Earlier, chief secretary Asok Gupta met the district magistrates and police superintendents of North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, Nadia and Murshidabad.																								There is no special reason for calling the DMs and SPs of these six districts. Actually, election arrangements with all DMs and SPs are being discussed in phases, Dutta said. 																								Apart from the director-general of police, home secretary A.K. Deb and inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee were present at todays meeting.																								Duttas remarks about false threats are significant considering Peoples War and Maoist Communist Centre activists had been spotted on the citys southern fringes as well as in Arambagh, about 150 km from here, and Durgapur.																								A CPM district secretariat member in Hooghly is reported to have received a threat over telephone saying his and Jangipara CPM zonal secretary Arup Basu Mullicks days were numbered.																								A joint Naxalite unit allegedly held a secret meeting at Jangipara, about 40 km from here, a fortnight ago and some leaflets were reportedly distributed at Rashidpur near Jangipara, warning people not to vote.

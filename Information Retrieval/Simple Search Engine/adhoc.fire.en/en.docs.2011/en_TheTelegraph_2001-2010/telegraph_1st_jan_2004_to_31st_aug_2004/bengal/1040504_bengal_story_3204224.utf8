The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 CPM guns for Cong
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Siliguri, May 3: The CPM today accused the Congress of trying to divide Bengal by playing the Gorkhaland card, curiously sparing the GNLF that yesterday declared support for the Congress candidate from Darjeeling.																								Calling the development a conspiracy hatched by the Congress high command, urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said the party wanted to fuel a separatist movement like the Gorkhaland agitation that rocked the hills in the mid-eighties. 																								Addressing a news conference here, Bhattacharya charged the Congress with trying to turn the region into a tinderbox. The party has dangled the Gorkhaland carrot in front of Ghisingh to secure his support for the Lok Sabha seat, he said.																								 The party will have to pay a price for instigating such anti-national feelings. Till now it was the PDF which accused us of having a tacit understanding with the CPM but what can it say now, questioned Bhattacharya who has been leading the partys campaign in Darjeeling constituency.																								He also reminded the reporters that it was a Congress government at the centre when the violent Gorkhaland agitation took place. The Congress is again instigating the GNLF to revive the Gorkhaland issue, playing the dangerous separatist card, he added.																								In a single veiled attack at the GNLF, the minister said: Despite allegations of corruption brought against the GNLFs style of running the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, we looked the other way to bring stability and peace in the hills. 																								The target of his jibes was, however, clearly the Congress.																								The Congress will only fuel another round of violence in the hills. The party is playing with fire. It is a dangerous move that will only encourage militant activities in the region, said Bhattacharya.																								He, however, added that the CPM, which has been winning this seat for the past three elections as a result of the GNLF vote boycott, would not be afraid to fight the new alliance. 																								The senior CPM leader also talked about a change in the campaign strategy of the CPM in the backdrop of the turn of events. 																								Till last evening, our poll campaign was development-centric. From tomorrow, the focus will shift to the Congress-GNLF pact and the intention of the national party to split the state by using separatist politics, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Cricket verdict stumps district
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Raiganj, July 29: Not a ball was bowled and yet the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) declared two schools here district champion and runners-up of a competition that was never held.																								CAB joint secretary Bablu Koley said the declaration was made only after receiving a report from the North Dinajpur district sports association. The CAB provides funds to the district associations to hold the competitions after which the state-level tournament takes place. We will inquire into the charge if other schools lodge a complaint with us, Koley said in Calcutta.																								The controversy revolves around two prominent boys schools here, Raiganj Coronation School and Ramakrishna Vidya Bhavan. Coronation School, which was declared champion, had even attended the prize distribution ceremony at Eden Gardens on July 25.																								Ibrahim Ali, the games teacher at Ramakrishna Vidya Bhavan, said the district sports association did not organise any school cricket tournament in two years. We received a letter from the CAB but as no tournament was held, we did not go to Calcutta to collect our trophy, he said.																								Anil Burman, the games teacher at Coronation School, admitted that his institution became champion without having played a match. The district sports association sent us to Siliguri to participate in the state-level championship since we were the district champions in February 2003, Burman said. The school was knocked out in the first round of the competition held in Kanchenjunga Stadium.																								Burman also said: Yes, we went to collect the certificate and medal. Why should we let such a chance pass by?																								However, district sports association secretary Subhasis Chanda said that there was a tournament. Officially, it was held. I will have to see why the schools are claiming, as you say, that no matches were played.

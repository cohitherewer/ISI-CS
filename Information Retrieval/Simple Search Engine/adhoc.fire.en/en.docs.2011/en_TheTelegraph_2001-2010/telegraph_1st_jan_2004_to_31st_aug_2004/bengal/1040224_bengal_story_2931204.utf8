 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 Reservation connects opponents
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								Calcutta, Feb. 23: CPM and Trinamul Congress councillors of South Dum Dum municipality have joined forces to oppose the reservation of 12 out of 35 wards for women, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates.																								North 24-Parganas officials said trouble began after a circular on the reservation was issued on January 16. The district administration gave the councillors 15 days to file their objections, if any. 																								Trinamul leader Bhim Ghosh led delegations of councillors from his party, the CPM and the Congress to additional district magistrate Shankar Mandal thrice last month. 																								We are unhappy at the way the administration has hurriedly reserved some of the wards for women and SC/ST candidates. This costs us a lot, said Mriganka Bhattacharjee, a Congress councillor. 																								The councillors alleged that the reservation did not match the demography of the area. District magistrate H.K. Dwibedi said: We followed procedure. The councillors may move court.

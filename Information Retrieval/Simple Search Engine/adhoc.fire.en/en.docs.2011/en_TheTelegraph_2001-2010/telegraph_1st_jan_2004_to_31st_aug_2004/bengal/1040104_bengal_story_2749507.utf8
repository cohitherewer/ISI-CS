The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Troupe tormentor arrested 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Haldia, Jan. 3: Suresh Karan, a local CPM committee member, was arrested today on charges of masterminding an attack on theatre artistes from Calcutta on December 28. Members of Ujaane had gone to Haldia to stage a play against imperialism, globalisation and Marxism. 																								Suresh was picked up by police from his residence early this morning and produced in court, which remanded him in judicial custody, police officials said. 																								Ujaane convener Raja Sarkhel had lodged a complaint against Karan, alleging that the CPM member had led his party cadre to assault troupe members. 																								Sarkhel said the activists used sticks to assault the actors and actresses, including a pregnant woman. She was pleading with them to spare her, but they did not listen, said Sarkhel. 																								We were locked in a room for several hours after the assault. They threatened to continue torturing us if we did not leave Haldia, Sarkhel said in his complaint, in which he has named five more CPM members. 																								But police havent been able to trace them. It appears that they have fled the area, but we are looking for them, an officer said. Those named in the FIR will be arrested in a day or two.

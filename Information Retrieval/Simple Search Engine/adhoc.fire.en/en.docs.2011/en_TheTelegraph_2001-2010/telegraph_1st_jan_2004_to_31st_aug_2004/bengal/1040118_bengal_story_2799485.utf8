 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Doctors face govt ire
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranaghat, Jan. 17: Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra announced today that 30 doctors from across the state would be suspended as they have been found guilty of carrying out private practice illegally.																								The doctors will be served with suspension notices in a day or two as they have been proved guilty by the health department inquiry committee and district health officials who had been asked to look into the matter after we received several complaints from various quarters, Mishra said.																								Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said later this evening that he would discuss the matter with the minister tomorrow. Doctors engaged in private practices have to be firmly dealt with. And this is part of our move to revamp the states health care system, he said.																								Mishra was in Kalyani today to inaugurate a school and inspect the Kalyani Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital. He said the present generation of doctors was not responsible enough and not fit for their profession. They have changed the definition of health. They have turned it into a business and are hand in glove with private medical firms to take advantage of the ignorant.																								Most of the doctors passing out from medical colleges have taken up the profession to mint money. They are not dedicated and cheat the poor to make money. I never took up a government job, instead, I went to remote villages and treated the poor after I became a doctor, Mishra added.																								The minister also said the state health department would soon recruit 900 doctors as there were 230 vacant seats at the medical colleges and nearly 1,500 in the district hospitals. We will appoint 900 doctors on emergency basis through the public service commission as too many seats are lying vacant. The process has started and appointment letters have been issued to most candidates.																								Speaking on plans to set up medical colleges in Kalyani and Midnapore, Mishra said: The work is yet to start as we have not received an affiliation from the Indian Medical Council. We approached them many times and are continuing with our efforts to get the affiliation soon.

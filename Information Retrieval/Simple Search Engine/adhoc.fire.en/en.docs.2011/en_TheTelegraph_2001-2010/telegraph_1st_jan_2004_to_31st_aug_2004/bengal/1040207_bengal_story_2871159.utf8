The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Panel suggests college fee hike
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 6: Administration of higher education will undergo drastic changes and institutions would have to prepare for competition from foreign universities if the government heeds the recommendations of one of its committees.																								The state council of higher education headed by Satyasadhan Chakraborty, the higher education minister, has said that considering the global scenario, the government should stop upholding some of its ideological commitments and should not make undue concessions to undeserving students by trying to provide cheap education. 																								The recommendations are part of a wide range of suggestions to the government and have been compiled into a booklet, Higher Education in the Next Decades  Policy for the State of West Bengal. The observations are the outcome of a series of discussions and seminars organised by the council, said officials.																								A substantial portion of the 38-page booklet deals with suggestions to the government on the need for an attitude change towards funding of undergraduate colleges. The council has voted for decentralisation of higher institutions and feels there should be an upward revision of fees in colleges, which should increasingly try to be self-sufficient.																								The institutions, the council says, should not have to depend on the government to pay salaries and allowances to teachers. All categories of colleges will be asked to augment their fund by various means like donations and utilisation of land and water resources, where they exist.																								Colleges in underdeveloped areas, where raising funds may not be easy, will also have to stop depending on government aid. They will also have to undertake some responsibility of payment of salaries and allowances of teachers. 																								The council is also opposed to government aid for an institution eager to open a new college.

 Thursday, July 22, 2004 				 Snap check on college truants
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 21: Calcutta University today decided to run regular checks on the day-to-day academic functioning in about 200 undergraduate colleges. 																								The move follows reports that many affiliated colleges were not following the guidelines on student attendance and maintenance of attendance registers. 																								We have been facing problems as many students are disallowed to sit for their final examinations for not having requisite attendance. We are determined to stop the mess, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic). 																								He said the university will reintroduce surprise visits. Inspection teams would land at the institutions without prior notice and check the attendance registers. 																								The decision was taken at a meeting of the undergraduate council this afternoon.																								Das said there were some untoward incidents last year involving those not allowed to sit for final examinations after failing to meet the attendance requirements. The university rules stipulate that a student must have minimum 60 per cent attendance to be able to take the final examinations. 																								If we are able to stem the rot at the beginning by carrying out intensive checks on colleges, the heads of the colleges will be careful about students regular attendance. At least this will help us avert untoward incidents involving aggrieved students, said a senior varsity official. 																								The council also decided to make it mandatory for all undergraduate colleges to enrol students for the Part II course within a month from the date of publication of the Part I results. The colleges will also have to start Part II classes within the same period.

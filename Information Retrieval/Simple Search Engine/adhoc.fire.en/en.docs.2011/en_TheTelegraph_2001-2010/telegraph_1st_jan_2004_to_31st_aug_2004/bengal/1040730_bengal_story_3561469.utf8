 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 No mercy left in cheated Bharati 
 REZA PRADHAN Bharati with her mother on ThursdayKalimpong, July 29: Bharati Das no longer harbours illusions about the future of her marriage or the character of her husband, Maninderpal Singh Kohli. 																								After Kohlis confession yesterday that he had raped and murdered British schoolgirl Hannah Foster, Bharati is hoping to pick up the pieces and move on.																								Those who visited her at her parents Upper Cart Road home said she appeared unsure of how to react to the development.																								I feel cheated, was her refrain. My father told me about Kohli having confessed. As our television is out of order, I did not see it. Someone had called up my father and told him about the confession. I did not want to believe what I heard. I did not know what to do, said Bharati.																								Kohlis confession has shut out the last ray of hope for Bharati. She had met him in the correctional home here and he said he was innocent and was being framed.																								Bharati had eloped to marry Kohli, whom she knew as Mike Davis till he was rounded up for the rape and murder. 																								Mike had also told me that he would send his brother and father to meet me. After his confession, I feel cheated. Let him get what he deserves, said Bharati.																								He committed the crime and me and my family are having to suffer...fate..., she said, flanked by her parents who are still in shock over the turn of events.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Hospital uniform code
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 10: The state government today said it would provide uniforms to group D staff in state-run hospitals.																								Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, however, ruled out the possibility of a dress code for patients in the hospitals. Patients are not prisoners that they must be given dress codes. If any patient intends to leave the hospital, theres not much we can do, Mishra said at Writers Buildings, after a meeting of the state health department that was also attended by public works department officials.																								Patients do wear uniforms when they are taken to operation theatres, pointed out the health minister. That should be enough, an official said.																								The discussion comes in the wake of a senior health department official recently claiming that the government was planning to have dress codes for patients in state-run hospitals.																								On the uniform for hospital staff, Mishra said: Earlier, the group D staff were offered Rs 300 for uniforms. But that was insufficient. Now, we have allotted Rs 420 for them to wear uniforms in one colour  navy blue.																								The need for hospital staff  including doctors, nurses and group D staff  to wear identity cards and uniforms was also stressed.																								At todays meeting, superintendents and principals of all teaching hospitals, as well as Lady Dufferin and Sambhu Nath Pandit hospitals, were asked to interact with PWD officials and submit reports on January 19 on the renovation needs at their institutes.																								The funds would be provided out of a Rs 72-crore Hudco loan.																								The renovation might include construction of new structures or repairing old portions of buildings, lifts or electricity lines. Hospital authorities have also been authorised to repair hospital furniture and other equipment such as trolleys and stretchers.																								Todays meeting was called to review the administrative reforms and measures the government has implemented from time to time in the health sector.																								Mishra also reviewed the implementation of other measures such as monitoring the quality of food served to patients and the functioning of blood banks.																								Mishra added that the government would not allow any unauthorised car inside hospital premises. Only cars that have stickers would be allowed to be parked inside.

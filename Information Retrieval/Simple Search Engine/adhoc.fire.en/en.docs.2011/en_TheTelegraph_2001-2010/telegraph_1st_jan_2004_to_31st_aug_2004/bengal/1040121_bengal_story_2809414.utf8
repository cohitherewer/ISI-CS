 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Fatal fall from hospital bed
 Behrampore, Jan. 20: A  patient fell from his bed at the sadar hospital here this  evening and died of suspected brain haemorrhage, reports  our correspondent.																								Rabindranath Biswas, 39, was hospitalised on Thursday with chest pain and stomachache. Doctor Debashish Ghosh had tied him to the bed after he showed symptoms of convulsion three days ago. The fasteners were removed this morning. 																								But his condition deteriorated in the evening. We repeatedly pleaded the doctors to discharge him. But they snubbed us and said he is alright, said Biswas brother Jibananda. 																								The relatives later alleged that Biswas died because of the negligence of hospital employees. Superintendent Ranjan Majumder said a haemorrhage in the brain probably led to the death. A departmental inquiry has been ordered. Custody death																								An undertrial lodged in the Hooghly district jail died this morning after a heart attack. 																								Sitaram Panchali, 34, was arrested on charges of murder on December 21. Jail sources said no doctor was around when he first complained of chest pain around 1.15 am.

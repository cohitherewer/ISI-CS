 BAPPA MAJUMDAR				 	 Ashwini Rana: Breaking barriersCalcutta, June 10: Burning the midnight oil, a blacksmiths son has ranked 25th in this years Joint Entrance Examination, for which he appeared with 34,000 others from the state in the medical category.																								Ashwini Ranas impressive rank in the general category, results for which were published on Tuesday, guarantees him a place in the MBBS course at numero uno Calcutta Medical College. The 19-year-old is also an automatic choice at SSKM Hospital, where undergraduate courses are slated to start this year, subject to Medical Council of India approval this month.																								Ashwini, a resident of Pingla village in West Midnapore, would travel to Calcutta and stay overnight at a private tutors house while preparing for JEE as he did not have money to travel. 																								The results cameas a big surprise to me. I never expectedI would secure such a high rank, said the teen, whose father Ashok earns a meagre Rs 25-30 a day to support his family of five.																								With such meagre earnings, any thought of accomplishing anything in life remains a dream. But circumstances and destiny perhaps have brought me to a stage where I can make a decent living if I can carry out the good work forward, Ashwini said. 																								The teens life changed five years ago when childhood friend Subrata Dey died in front of his eyes of a cardiac ailment. 																								At our village, we did not have a decent doctor and we ran from one place to the other looking for a cardiologist, but no one was around. It was that very moment that I realised if I have to become somebody in life I have to become a cardiac surgeon, he said.																								The boy notched up a 698 score in the Madhyamik exams by relying on borrowed books and photocopied notes. He ran up a 784 aggregate in his Higher Secondary tests.																								But studying medicine remained an impossible dream till a local teacher suggested Ashwini approach Calcutta-based tutor A.K. Maiti. Luck smiled on him for Maiti, impressed by his credentials and zeal, taught him for free. Ashwini now wants to support his two younger siblings who are all brilliant students.

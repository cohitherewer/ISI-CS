 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 New Market union in court 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 26: The Calcutta Municipal Corporations reported decision to allow New Market shop owners to keep their establishments open till 7 pm on Saturdays has been challenged in court.																								The Citu-led Shramik Karmachari Union, representing employees working in New Market stops, today moved Calcutta High Court demanding an order asking the authorities to revoke the decision.																								Justice G. Gupta admitted the petition and directed the corporation and other respondents to file affidavits to clarify their position. There are more than 1,200 shops in New Market, employing more than 1,500 people.																								Opening and shutting of market gates and power supply come under the direct control of the corporation, which owns the complex. The scheduled working hours for shops selling non-perishable items are 10 am to 7 pm on weekdays and till 2.30 pm on Saturday. The market remains closed on Sunday. Of late, some shop owners have started keeping their shops open till 7 pm on Saturdays.																								Moving the petition, the counsel for the shop employees told the court that every city shop came under the shops and establishment act. According to the law, no owner has the right to force an employee to work for more than 48 hours a week.																								The decision of the authorities to keep the shops open till 7 pm on Saturdays is against the interests of the employees as then they will have to work for more than 48 hours in a week, the lawyer said.																								Civic deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh pointed out that the CMC has nothing to do with this case since it is a dispute between the shop owners in New Market and their employees.

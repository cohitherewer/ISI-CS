 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Court clears Salt Lake plot transfer
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Jan. 5: The high court has passed a judgment that may prod the government to re-examine the rules governing the transfer of leased land. 																								Justice Amitava Lala has asked the urban development department to mutate a land in favour of the petitioners whose uncle had bequeathed it to them. The petitioners had alleged that even after a probate was made in the court in their favour, the urban development department refused to mutate it in their names. 																								The verdict said as there is no provision in the law or bar in the will agreement, the department has no right to stop the recording of the petitioners names as true owners of the plot in Salt Lake. The judgment might become a precedent for a number of similar cases now pending in courts.

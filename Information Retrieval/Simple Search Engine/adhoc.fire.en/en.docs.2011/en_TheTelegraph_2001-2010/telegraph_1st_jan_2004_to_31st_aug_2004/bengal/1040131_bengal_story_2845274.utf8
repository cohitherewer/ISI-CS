The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 First Pak President lived here once
 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN				 Crying for care: Iskandar  Ali Mirzas house in Murshidabad. Telegraph picture 																								Behrampore, Jan. 30: Relations with Pakistan are being cemented but the ancestral home of the countrys first President, Iskandar Ali Mirza, is still in ruins. 																								It can still be told that the pillared structure in Murshidabad town was once palatial. But time, encroachers and lack of concern have taken their toll.																								Muslim League leader Mirza became the President of Pakistan in 1958. Born in Murshidabad, he had studied in the Nawab Madarsa  now called Nawab Bahadur Institution. His father Fateh Ali Mirza was buried at Golapbag, not far from the town.																								The house near the historical Hazarduari palace of the nawabs, 220 km from Calcutta, can be developed into a tourist spot, said some residents.																								There have been demands from various quarters that Iskandar Ali Mirzas house be taken over by the government and renovated. The house is now a Wakf property and there are technicalities that have to be looked into before we acquire it. I have sent a detailed report to the government, said subdivisional officer Balai Chand Mukhopadhyay.																								Chairman of Murshidabad municipality Biswajit Dhar said: We came to know about the existence of Mirzas ancestral house a year ago, while preparing for the celebration of 300 years of Murshidabad town. The civic authorities are celebrating the towns tercentenary this year.																								Requests for the renovation of Mirzas house are pouring in. We are giving it a thought. A number of tourists from Pakistan come to see the relics of the rule of the nawabs in Murshidabad, said Dhar. 																								The more-than-a-century-old building on a premises spread over an acre is known locally as Nawab Mahal. Fateh Ali Mirza was better known as Nawab Mirza. But roofs of most of the late nawabs rooms have caved in and the few that remain may collapse any moment. 																								The encroachers have not moved into the house fearing a cave-in. At least four families now stay on the premises.																								District land and land reforms department sources said according to records, the house was transferred to Iskandar in 1935. But its historicity remained buried in myths till the civic authorities dug the facts out during their preparations for the tercentenary celebrations.																								Local historians said Mirza had left for higher studies in Bombay with his mother and had joined the British army. Later, he left the army for a political career. He settled in Pakistan after Partition.

 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Schools-turned-camps stare at testing times
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMidnapore, Feb. 19: When the annual examination starts a month or two from now, students at 14 schools in West Midnapore may have to sit outside as police have set up camp inside for nearly a year.																								The annual examination is about to start from March-April, but we are unable to conduct classes, said Bidyut Mahato, the secretary of one such school in Kalaimuri.																								The district police administration, however, does not appear bothered as they have failed to shift the camps  from the primary and secondary schools  set up in April, especially in Naxalite-infested Jamboni block.																								The school authorities at Salboni, Goaltore, Garbeta and Belpahari are resentful because they believe the need for the camps is long over. 																								Those days (of Naxalite violence) are gone and peace has been restored. So why should the camps occupy the school buildings, causing serious obstruction to studies? asked Kirti Bhusan Deb Singha, the teacher-in-charge of Kalaimuri Netaji Subhas High School.																								According to the school authorities, the buildings were booked by the district police for the period between April 26 and May 9, 2003, to contain militant activities.																								It is about to be a year that the camps were set up on the school premises, said Bishwanath Tudu, the assistant headmaster of the school.																								He cited the instance of the Rautara primary school, where students sit inside a shamiana as the two classrooms are occupied by the police. We have already asked the district inspector of schools about the matter. But nothing has been done.																								The district inspector of schools, Nurus Salam, said he was concerned about the problem and promised early action.																								If the camps are causing trouble for the residents and the students, we will shift them as early as possible, superintendent of police Parveen Kumar said. But he claimed that no one filed a complaint, which would have helped initiate prompt action.																								A nightlong raid on several Naxalite hideouts at Jarka, Champinagar and Bagildoba in Salboni turned up a huge cache of explosives, arms and ammunition, Kumar said. The haul included sophisticated landmines, grenades and gelatine sticks.

 OUR BUREAU																								Jan. 5: Three more deaths have been reported from south Bengal, which is in the grip of a cold wave, taking the toll to 12.																								Purulia  the worst-affected district  recorded a minimum temperature of 3.9 degree Celsius at 4 am today, down from 5.5 yesterday. The town was colder than Sikkims capital Gangtok, which recorded 4 degrees.																								A cold wind blowing in from the northern plains throughout the day made matters worse.

In West Midnapore, where the temperature was 7 degree Celsius, two railway employees were killed when they were hit by a train at Panskura station early this morning. Officials said Arun Mukherjee, 24, and Suresh Kumar, 28, were run over while repairing the signalling system. They could not spot the train because of the fog, the officials said. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem.																								The mercury dipped to 5.5 degree Celsius in Durgapur, the lowest in five years. S. Sinha, the local observer for the regional meteorological centre at Alipore in Calcutta, said the industrial town experienced severe cold since morning.

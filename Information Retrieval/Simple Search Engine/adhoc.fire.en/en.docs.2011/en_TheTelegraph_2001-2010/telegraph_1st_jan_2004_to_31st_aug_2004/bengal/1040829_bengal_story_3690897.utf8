The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Spy eye on defence postings 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Aug. 28: Data downloaded from the computer of Ali Bhai, the suspected ISI agent arrested from Bowbazar on Thursday, shows he was collecting information about officials in key posts and their responsibilities and capacity. 																								The intention was to provide the ISI information on the nature of officials posted in the eastern sector and give an assessment about their strengths and weaknesses, a senior police official said. 																								During interrogation police learnt Ali watched the Republic Day parade on Red Road, possibly to meet armymen without arousing suspicion. 																								Two months after he returned to Calcutta from Karachi after attending a training session there, he went to the parade, that too for the first time in his life, the official said. 																								He was asked to pass on information about the human resource departments of the armed forces. And it seems he had developed contacts in army and air force to collect information, said a sleuth. 																								Police suspect Ali might have passed on some information. He was keeping a close watch on the transfer orders of army and air force officials, said the sleuth. Officers of the military intelligence wing are interrogating him. 																								Ali has also told police he went to Karachi from Dhaka after crossing into Bangladesh by bribing BSF jawans at the Ghojadanga border near Basirhat in North 24-Parganas.

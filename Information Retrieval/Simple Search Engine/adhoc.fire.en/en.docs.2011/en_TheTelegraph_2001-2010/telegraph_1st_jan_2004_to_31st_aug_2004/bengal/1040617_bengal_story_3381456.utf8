 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Judges fear framing in in-camera rape cases 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 16: The rape charge brought against the judge hearing in-camera the Dhantola loot-and-rape case in the Ranaghat fast-track court has made his fraternity nervous. 																								Judges of lower courts today told the acting chief justice that they were feeling shaky about taking in-camera confessions of women in the wake of the FIR against Shyamal Sengupta. 																								A three-member delegation of the West Bengal Judicial Services Association (WBJSA)  of which these judges are members  led by president Justice (retired) A.M. Sinha conveyed the nervousness in a meeting with acting chief justice A.. Roy. 																								The delegation explained that after what happened in Nadia, it would become increasingly difficult for judges to meet women alone in their chambers. We often have to take confessional statements from women under section 164 of the IPC. Now we will feel insecure about it. Any of the women may come out of a judges chamber and scream rape. What do we do then? said a member of the delegation. 																								Association spokesman Swapan Dhar, who was present in the meeting, said they also demanded adequate security for the judges of the lower courts. The role of the police in many cases is not transparent and, particularly in the Ranaghat incident, the police are not following the norms of investigating a case against a judge, he claimed. 																								The association requested Roy to take necessary steps for another inquiry, other than the police, to bring out the truth in the Ranaghat case. The Supreme Court has a clear direction in this regard. The high court should hold a separate inquiry into the case, Dhar said. 																								Dhar said the acting chief justice assured them that he would issue a circular to the administration about the Supreme Court guidelines on dealing with a case where a judge is an accused. 																								Earlier, the association members met two judges who are members of the high courts administrative committee. The judges assured the delegation that rights of the members of the judicial services would be protected. 																								There should not be any scope for harassment. In the present system, the lower court judges are being humiliated regularly both by the police and the common people, alleged a member. 																								A source in the high court said Roy, in response to a letter by the home department, has asked the government to instruct the police to start proceedings against the accused judge.																								In its letter, the high court had also attached a copy of the apex court judgment outlining the conditions to be followed while investigating cases filed against judges of the lower courts.

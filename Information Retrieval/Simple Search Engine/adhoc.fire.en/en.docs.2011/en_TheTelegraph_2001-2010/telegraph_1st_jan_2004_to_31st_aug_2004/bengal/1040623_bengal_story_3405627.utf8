 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Party families fall prey to party tormentors
 DEBASISH CHATTERJEE Falta, June 22: Eight families owing allegiance to the CPM have been rendered homeless by a section of party workers who extorted money from them several times in the past six months. 																								The victims include a member of the CPMs Falta local committee. Seven of the affected families are from Beledanga village under Falta police station, about 70 km from Calcutta, the other belongs to Shyampur village in Usti, 65 km from the city.																								The hapless CPM supporters, who have been running pillar to post for justice, are now staying with relatives in adjoining Mograhat and Diamond Harbour or Calcutta. Neither police nor local CPM bosses have been able to ensure their homecoming. 																								One of the victims, Noor Ali Mollah, said some CPM workers accompanied by local goons had come to him several times for money. They extorted money from us, either on the pretext of raising funds for a particular occasion or meeting the expenses of a rally, Mollah said. 																								 The sums demanded were between Rs 2,000 and 10,000. There wasnt a month, Mollah said, when they were not served the party goons wish list. 																								Regular intimidation hounded us out of our ancestral houses and we had to seek shelter elsewhere. We dont know when we will be able to return home, Mollah added.																								Another victim, Ajma Bibi, a 55-year-old housewife, made similar complaints. 																								We would often be woken up from sleep by a rustling sound in the dead of night. We would see sword blades piercing the thatched roof and know that the time had come to pay up. We would often find bombs at our doorstep in the morning. It was horrible, Ajma said.																								Several complaints were lodged with Falta police station but the threats and extortion continued, forcing the families to leave their villages. 																								Distraught, they approached the Diamond Harbour subdivisional police officer and the human rights commission last week.																								District superintendent of police S.. Gupta said he has directed the officer-in-charge of Falta police station to look into the charges and submit a report at the earliest. We will try our best to provide protection to the evicted families and ensure their return, Gupta said.																								Milan Dutta, a CPM zonal committee member, admitted that he had been told about atrocities on some party workers. I have asked my men to find out if the allegations are true. If anyone is found guilty of extorting money, he would be punished.																								South 24-Parganas CPM secretary Santimoy Bhattacharjee has sought a report from Dutta.

 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Deprived of seats, BJP leaders rush to Delhi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, March 5: State BJP leaders have rushed to Delhi to complain against Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee after failing to get the Purulia and Bankura Lok Sabha seats for its nominees as part of an electoral adjustment with her party.																								We called on all-India BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan to apprise him of our grievances. We are disheartened at the way Mamata put up her party nominees for Purulia and Bankura seats when discussions on the seat-sharing deal are on, said state BJP president Tathagata Roy over phone from Delhi tonight.																								The Trinamul should have spoken to us before fielding its nominees for the seats, said the BJP leader.																								However, Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy reiterated tonight that the party would not offer Bankura and Purulia to the BJP. I dont know why the BJP is asking for the seats in which we have already put up our nominees, he said.																								The Trinamuls worries are compounded by rebel MP from Calcutta Northwest Sudip Bandopadhyays decision to contest as an Independent against the partys official nominee, Subrata Mukherjee.																								The MPs actress-turned-legislator wife, Nayana, is undecided on campaigning for her husband. I am yet to decide whether or not to campaign for my husband, she said this afternoon.																								However, Nayana is hurt about being kept in the dark over yesterdays workers meeting at Mahajati Sadan to kickstart the partys campaign in Mukherjees favour. I feel humiliated on not being invited to yesterdays meeting, she said.																								Those who are training guns on Sudip for contesting as an Independent should explain why they failed to curb such gross indiscipline? Why was I dropped from the list of invitees for yesterdays meet?																								Poll meeting																								Senior officials of the state today discussed, at a meeting at Writers Buildings, ways of keeping militant forces at bay during the Lok Sabha elections, says a staff reporter.																								Political parties would be asked to inform police before they campaign in areas where the Peoples War or the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation are active, inspector-general of police (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said.																								Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said superintendents of police would ask people who own licensed firearms to submit them with the police and these would be given back after the elections. No new licence for firearms would be issued till the elections are over.

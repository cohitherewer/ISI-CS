 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 School bosses face probe
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, May 18: A high school headmaster and the secretary of its managing committee are under investigation for appointing a Group-D employee who produced a fake high court order.																								The secondary school board here had complained to police against Prabhat Kumar Pal, the headmaster of Jadavganj High School in Ausgram, about 170 km from Calcutta, and Banshi Dhar Mondal, the secretary.																								The police said one Netai Bagdi of Ausgram arranged a fake court order when he did not figure on a list of 10 candidates shortlisted for a post by the employment exchange.																								District inspector of schools Sibaji Porel said Netai has been suspended. I have lodged an FIR against Pal and Mondal charging them with appointing Netai on the basis of forged documents, he added. 																								The forgery came to light when Shyam Mohan Bag, an aspirant, moved the high court challenging Netais appointment.																								Superintendent of police K.C. Meena said: An investigation is underway. The school authorities did not verify Netais papers, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Power board hike ruled out
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 27: Power minister Mrinal Banerjee today said tariff for domestic consumers of the West Bengal State Electricity Board would not be enhanced despite the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission not yet having announced tariff for SEB consumers.																								We are working on a tariff structure which will benefit the middle-class and not put financial pressure on them, he said.																								The power ministers comments come in the wake of the recent tariff hike by CESC for most of its domestic consumers.																								The board is working on a plan to reduce transmission and distribution losses, which are 35 to 40 per cent, and other finance charges. We want to put a plug on T amp;D losses, which will add Rs 700 crore to the boards kitty. This will have a positive impact on the tariff, the minister told newspersons on the sidelines of a meeting organised by the state electricity board on power theft.																								The minister said the West Bengal Power Development Corporation is also taking steps to reduce generation costs.																								At present, domestic urban consumers in SEB areas pay a minimum of Rs 1.60 per unit for consumption up to 75 units per month. The minimum charge in rural areas is Rs 1.55 per unit.																								Asked if cross-subsidy between domestic consumers on one hand and industrial and commercial consumers on the other would be removed, the minister said: It is a very sensitive issue and I am having discussions with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the matter. A decision has not yet been taken.																								Director-general of police Shyamal Dutta and superintendents of police were present at the meeting that discussed ways to combat power theft.

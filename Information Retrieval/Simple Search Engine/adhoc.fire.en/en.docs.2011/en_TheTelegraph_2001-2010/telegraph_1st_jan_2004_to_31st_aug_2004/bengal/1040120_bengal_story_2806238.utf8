The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Upgrade hope for crammed prison 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Jan. 19: Acknowledging the alarming overcrowding in the Alipurduar Subsidiary Correctional Home, the jail department has decided to place a proposal in the cabinet meeting later this week to upgrade it and provide for more posts. 																								Suggesting that the prison in Jalpaiguri district be made a special correctional home, the department pointed out that the jail at present houses prisoners more than four times its registered capacity. 																								The crush of inmates has increased since the spurt in extremist activities, like the Kamtapuri agitation, in the area. 																								The average prisoner population in the jail in the last financial year was 407 per day against its registered capacity of 99. 																								Inspector-general of prisons Anup Tripathi said tonight that more prisoners could be accommodated in the special jail after it is upgraded. The overcrowding was compounded at the Alipurduar jail as it could not send any inmate to the Jalpaiguri Central Correctional Home, which faces the same problem. Pushing prisoners of one overcrowded jail to another would have only worsened the problem and meant a violation of human rights by the government. 																								The proposal includes creation of 25 posts, including that of a full-fledged jail superintendent. So long, the sub-divisional officer has been functioning as the ex officio superintendent. The number of warders in the jail will also go up from 11 to 20. 																								Tripathi announced that two more sub- divisional jails are coming up at Kalyani in Nadia district and Haldia in East Midnapore district. 																								As prison population is increasing by leaps and bounds, we are planning to set up more jails across the state, he added. 																								The prison authorities have also decided to construct new buildings on the premises of Alipore central jail and Presidency jail, where high-risk prisoners like Aftab Ansari are lodged. 																								We have decided to demolish some condemned buildings to make room for the new ones, said a senior jail official.

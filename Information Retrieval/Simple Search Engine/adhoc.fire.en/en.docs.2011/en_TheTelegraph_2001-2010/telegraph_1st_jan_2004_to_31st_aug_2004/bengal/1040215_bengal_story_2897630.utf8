 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 Sudip plea to Mamata on Raiganj seat
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Feb. 14: Trinamul  Congress MP from Calcutta northwest Sudip Bandopadhayay  today urged party chief Mamata Banerjee to give him a patient  hearing before finalising his candidature for the Raiganj  Lok Sabha seat.																								I am sending a letter to Mamata requesting her to sit with me to discuss my candidature. I have heard from party sources and seen media reports that I am being fielded from Raiganj with which I am not even remotely connected, said the MP.																								However, Mamata reiterated this afternoon that Bandopadhayay was asked to contest from Raiganj in north Bengal. Mamata said she would have to heed the advice of senior party leaders.																								Indications are clear that I am not being renominated for Calcutta northwest. But I am not going to Raiganj to take on Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, sitting Congress MP from the area, he said. Basu to skip Brigade																								Jyoti Basu will skip the DYFI rally at Brigade Parade Ground tomorrow that will virtually kickoff the party campaign for the Lok Sabha elections. This is the first time during the Left Front rule that the CPM leader will not be present at such an event.																								I shall not attend the rally, but other leaders will be there to take on the BJP-led coalition at the Centre, Basu said.																								Traffic will be suspended around the Maidan area from noon till the rally, which is to begin at 2 pm, ends.																								The Brigade Parade Ground will for the first time during the Left Front regime miss Jyoti Basu when the party under the banner of its youth wing--- the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI)will tomorrow virtually kick off the campaign for the ensuing Lok Sabha elections. 																								I shall not attend tomorrows rally but other senior leaders, including Buddha (chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) and Biman (Bose, Left Front chairman) will be there to take on the BJP-led coalition at the Centre, Basu said this evening.																								Basu said he had attended earlier meetings at Brigade but this time he has decided to opt out of it on health grounds. 																								However, party sources Basu this time will not be burdened with steering the Fronts campaign. Instead, Bhattacharjee will be the star campaigner. He is also the main speaker for tomorrows rally. 																								Participants from five north Bengal districts have already reached Calcutta. The five south Bengal districts like North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and Nadia will provide most of the participants for tomorrows rally. The five districts have been asked to supply five lakh people for the meeting tomorrow, DYFI sources said.																								Asked about Basus absence from tomorrows rally, a senior leader said,  Brigade without Basu is unthinkable. But this time Bhattacharjee will steer the Fronts campaign. Though Basu will address a few rallies, he will not be involved in the sustained campaign programme, a senior CPM leader on condition of anonymity.

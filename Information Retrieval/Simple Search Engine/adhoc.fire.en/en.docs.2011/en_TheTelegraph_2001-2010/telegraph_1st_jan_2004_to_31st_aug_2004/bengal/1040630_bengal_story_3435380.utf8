 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Court acquits raped murderer
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 29: A housewife who was convicted in a murder case and sentenced to life term by a trial judge was acquitted by the high court today. 																								Ajmira Bibi and her husband Sekh Majir had been convicted of killing moneylender Abul Basar who raped her repeatedly after they failed to repay a debt.																								Besides freeing Ajmira, the court today commuted Majirs life sentence to seven years rigorous imprisonment. He killed the moneylender on March 11, 1996 when he was trying to force himself on Ajmira. 																								Majir, who had returned home after days work, was unable to keep his cool and hit Basar on the head with an axe. He died on the spot. 																								Both Majir and Ajmira were arrested on charges of committing the murder. 																								The Nadia sessions judge held the couple guilty and sentenced them to life terms. The couple from Haringhata in Nadia then moved the high court.																								The two have spent about six-and-a-half years behind bars. Majir is now likely to be released as he has already spent almost all of his prison term. 																								Representing the couple, lawyer Joymalya Bagchi told the division bench of Justices G.C. De and S.P. Mitra: Whenever Abul visited Majirs house to ask for the money, he fled out of fear. In Majirs absence, the moneylender repeatedly raped Ajmira.

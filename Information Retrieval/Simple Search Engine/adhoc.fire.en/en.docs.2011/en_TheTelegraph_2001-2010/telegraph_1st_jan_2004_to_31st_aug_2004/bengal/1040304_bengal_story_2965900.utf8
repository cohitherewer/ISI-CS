 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 State, CPM squads against Naxalites
 OUR BUREAU 																								March 3: The government today set up a special operations group comprising police and paramilitary forces to combat Naxalites in 12 affected police station areas in West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura districts. 																								There will be a team of about 50 persons armed with sophisticated weapons who will reach the affected areas in a few days and decide on the strategy and modus operandi, said home secretary Amit Kiran Deb in Calcutta. 																								The move coincided with the CPM deciding to build resistance groups against Naxalite extremists in the troubled areas. 																								With the killing of colleague Asit Santra at Pingboni in Goaltore of West Midnapore last evening, CPM supporters fear that Peoples War and Maoist Communist Centre activists would step up attacks against them as the elections draw near.																								So, we have no alternative but to set up groups for our own protection... we know how to combat the PW-MCC, said Nirmal Ghosh, district secretariat member of the CPM. Police are yet to establish that Santra was killed by Naxalites. 																								State police chief D.C. Vajpai visited the Belpahari, Goaltore, Lalgarh and Salboni police station areas and held a series of meetings with officers there. 																								In a major crackdown, the police arrested five MCC members and detained another six when they organised a meeting at Pandaveswar in Burdwan.

 Krishnagar, Aug. 12: Congress  councillor of Krishnagar municipality Dilip Biswas was arrested  today for allegedly masterminding a heist at the local Bank  of Baroda branch in which about Rs 13 lakh was looted at  gun-point.																								Biswas, a councillor for three terms, was picked up from his house in the town, 85 km from Calcutta, and remanded in police custody for a week. We are certain that he (Biswas) masterminded the crime, said Nadia superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty.																								The Congress has called a days bandh in the town tomorrow. Municipality chairman Uday Mitra said: We will not let the civic body function unless Biswas is released. We are definite he is innocent. The police have no prima-facie evidence against him. The CPM, which does not have a single councillor in the civic body, said the arrest proves that it is now run by criminals.

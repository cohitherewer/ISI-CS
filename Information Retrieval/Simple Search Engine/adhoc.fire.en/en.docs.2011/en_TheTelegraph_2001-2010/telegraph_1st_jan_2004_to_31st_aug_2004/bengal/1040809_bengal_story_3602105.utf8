The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Freeze on fake teachers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Behrampore, Aug 8: Students  of Lalnagar High School yesterday demonstrated against three  teachers accused of submitting fake marksheets at the time  of selection and threatened not to attend their classes. 																								The education department froze the salaries of Abdul Rahim, Abdul Rezzak Biswas and Mohsin Ali, all employed with the school at Hariharpara, about 230 km from Calcutta, in May. But they are still continuing in their posts. 																								All three are members of the CPM-backed All Bengal Teachers Association (ABTA). 																								Rahim claimed he passed from Krishnanath College here and joined the school in 1985 as assistant teacher. Ali joined the same year, furnishing a Masters degree. 																								Biswas joined the school at its inception in 1952 as a clerk. He later completed his BEd and joined the higher secondary section in 1995 after furnishing a Masters degree. 																								In 1985, then school secretary Ehsaan Ali sensed foul play when Rahims name did not figure on a list of students brought out by Krishnanath College as part of its 150th-year celebrations. Ali requested Calcutta University to confirm the credentials of the trio. 																								The university replied that none of them had completed their course. 																								Ali informed the district inspector of schools, Subhendu Ghosh, who barred them from drawing salaries. 																								Biswas said he had passed MA in Islamic History. I didnt collect the marksheet, someone brought it to me. On that basis, I have been drawing salary at the post-graduate scale since 1995. Authorities pardoned many such teachers after they gave up the higher scale. Why cant this be applicable to me? he asked. 																								Biswas has stopped taking classes since his salary was frozen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Low score on lady lock-ups
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 22: Out of 456 police stations in the state, only 241 have lock-ups for women and not many have women officers, the chief minister told the Assembly but could not offer a ready remedy.																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said there is no immediate solution to the problem. Most old police stations are very cramped and there is no space left to construct separate lock-ups for women. 																								But new police stations will have separate lock-ups for women and as many as 48 will be set up across the state. 																								Many of the new police stations would be located in areas bordering Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan and those prone to militancy.																								But space for women in police stations topped Bhattacharjees concern. In many cases, he said, arrested women have to be sent to the nearest police station with a separate facility for them. If even that is not available, the women are lodged in subdivisional lockups.																								The absence of women officers at most police stations in the districts is also a cause for concern. Steps are being taken to ensure that at least one woman police officer of the rank of sub-inspector or assistant sub-inspector is posted in every police station in the state, he said.																								Opposition MLAs had earlier asked the chief minister what steps were being taken to tackle the increasing number of complaints from women detainees who had to deal with male officers and share lock-ups with men.																								Bhattacharjee, who is also in charge of the police department, said all police stations in Calcutta have women officers.																								Bhattacharjee assured that officers in police stations without separate lock-ups for women would be asked to see that care is taken to ensure their safety.																								He also said that Bengal had lesser police stations and personnel than other states with similar population. 																								Among the new police stations, three would be in Calcutta  at Tallah, Sinthi and Chetla. 																								We immediately need to increase the number of police stations to ensure better vigil in the districts, particularly in the border areas and also in some places from where reports of militant activities are on the rise, Bhattacharjee said.

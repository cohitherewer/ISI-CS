The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Bengal on Italy radar 
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Boniver: Joining hands																								Calcutta, July 17: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visit to Italy last year drew a blank in terms of attracting investments. But the chief minister seems to have succeeded in creating a positive perception about the state and today, Italians are taking a closer look at Bengal and are keen to broaden the base of the bilateral relationship. 																								In a globalised market and society, Italy is looking with ever greater interest towards the peoples and the markets of Asia and Southeast Asia and of course India And we think increasing co-operation with India will be incomplete without the inclusion of West Bengal, said Italian minister of state for foreign affairs Margherita Boniver. 																								During her two-day visit to the city, she shared her views on an entire gamut of issues, ranging from the rising interest in India to the recent Union budget. Boniver, who was in Afghanistan looking after the post-war reconstruction, also rolled out a roster of Indo-Italian joint initiatives, lined up for the next six to eight months. 																								From an economic point of view that much more can be done from both sides and we are trying to do that. The initiatives include setting up of a centralised information centre in Italy and organising proper roadshows for Indian business and arts and culture in Italy. We are trying our best for bilateral promotion of ties, but it has to be done both ways, said Boniver, who is in charge of Italys relations with South and Southeast Asia. 																								Antonio Armellini, the Italian ambassador in India, accompanied the minister on her trip to Calcutta, during which Boniver met Bhattacharjee, a few of his cabinet colleagues and also the members of the Indian Chamber of Commerce. 																								Focusing on Bengal, Boniver, who was impressed with the embroidery work of artisans, said she was keen to extend the scope of association beyond leather, gems and jewellery and forge partnership in areas like fashion industry, agri-business and infrastructure development. According to her, the recent initiatives of the Bengal government were indications of a pragmatic approach.

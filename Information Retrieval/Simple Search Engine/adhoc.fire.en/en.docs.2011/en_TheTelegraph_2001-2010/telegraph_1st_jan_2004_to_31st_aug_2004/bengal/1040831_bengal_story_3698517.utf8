The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Attack on outsider aspirant workers 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Kharagpur, Aug 30: As much  as the chief minister wants the CPMs trade union arm to  behave, the Citu reaffirms its militant credentials.																								About 20 youths who turned up for an interview at the Tata Metaliks factory here yesterday were allegedly assaulted by Citu supporters opposed to the recruitment of outsiders.																								Around 157 youths from around West Midnapore had come for the interview for the post of trainee worker after receiving call letters from the employment exchange. All of them but the 20 who were attacked fled.																								The youths lodged a complaint at the local police outpost saying Citu workers blocked a 4-km stretch leading to the factory gates and prevented them from entering. Citu workers holding red flags made it clear that no outsiders will be allowed to go for the interview. When we protested, they pushed us to the ground and assaulted us. When we informed the management, they expressed inability to provide protection outside the factory, said Bimal Mahato.																								Citu had been demanding that only local boys be recruited to the Sahachak factory, about 125 km from Calcutta.																								We dont know what lies in store. We were denied the right to appear in the interview, said Samir Dutta, who came from a remote village. 																								Mihir Pahari, the secretary of the Citu-controlled coordination committee here, said: I dont know anything about the assault, but we are against the decision to recruit outsiders.																								Additional superintendent of police, Kharagpur, Manoj Verma, said a case was registered on the basis of complaints. We are looking for those named in the FIR.																								A spokesman for Tata Metaliks, which manufactures cast iron, denied knowledge of the assault. But he added: Though we give priority to local youths, we will also have to give chance to those having quality and efficiency.																								Chief works manager Debashish Mishra said the interview took place though many applicants did not turn up.

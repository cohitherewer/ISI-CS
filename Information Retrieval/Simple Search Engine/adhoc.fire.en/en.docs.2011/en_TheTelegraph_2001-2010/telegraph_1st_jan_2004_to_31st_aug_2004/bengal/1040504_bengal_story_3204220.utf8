The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 BSF boss takes on Bangla force
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 3: The BSF chief today accused Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) of non-cooperation in easing tension on the border between the two countries. 																								BSF director-general Ajayraj Sharma also said the Bangladeshis are not being helpful in flushing out Indian insurgents camping there. Sharma spoke to reporters at Dum Dum airport on his way to Delhi this morning after attending a biannual meeting with his Bangladesh counterpart in Dhaka.																								We had earlier tipped off the BDR officials about 37 camps in different parts of their country where militants and insurgents of different groups from India, even ISI militants, had taken shelter and were chalking out blueprints for disturbance here. The BDR has failed to take action against them, Sharma said.																								BSF officials who accompanied Sharma said the BDR had failed to track down 115 miscreants from India who have taken shelter in Bangladesh. Though we provided every detail about their hideouts, the BDR authorities are yet to provide information about them, said a BSF official.																								We asked them to chalk out a schedule for joint patrolling on the border to stop infiltration. But even at todays discussions, the matter was not taken up seriously, Sharma said.

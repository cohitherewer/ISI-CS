The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Closed mill count mounts
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Barrackpore, May 16: A day after Victoria Jute Mill in Hooghly was locked out, shutters came down at Auckland Jute Mill in North 24-Parganas.																								About 4,000 workers would be rendered jobless at the mill at Jagaddal, the seventh to close down in the past few months.																								Workers who came to attend the morning shift saw the suspension-of-work notice on the main gate. The notice said the mill was closed for an indefinite period. The management blamed labour problems and decreasing production for the closure. 																								Citu leader Ratan Bairagi said: That is a lie. Labour trouble is an excuse. A worker in the finishing department, Bairagi said: All of us were working hard to keep up production as that is the only way to save ourselves from starving. 																								Senior leaders alleged that the Centres decision to reduce the use of jute bags in packaging sugar and other consumer items by 40 per cent is the real reason behind the shutdown.																								The management of the Hooghly mill, too, had cited low productivity for closing down the unit. More than 4,000 workers became jobless with that shutdown.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Red Cross red in the face over volunteer
 							 - Taken in by murder suspects dedication, humanitarian organisation vows not to repeat mistake VIVEK CHHETRI				 	 Bharati Das at her parents home in Kalimpong on Sunday. A Telegraph picture																								Darjeeling, July 18: The Indian Red Cross Society now knows better than to welcome volunteers without verifying credentials.																								Maninderpal Singh Kohli had passed himself off as Mike Davis, a UN worker, and his goodwill as a dedicated doctor was his passport to participating in camps on Hepatitis-B awareness across the district.																								The Darjeeling branch of the society has admitted that it should have verified the credentials of Mike Davis, the doctor before giving him permission to work with it and said it would take precaution in future.																								K.P. Malla, the secretary of the Darjeeling branch of the Red Cross, said: Our national headquarters has taken note of the incident. Kohli was not a member of the society. All the applications were thoroughly scrutinised by the district and the state headquarters and we have found that he had not applied for membership. He worked as a volunteer and it was on goodwill alone that he was allowed to do so.																								The society is playing a pivotal role in steering the Hepatitis-B campaign in the district and had roped in Shanta Bio-Tech, a Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical firm, for the purpose. 																								The Red Cross had also informed the district administration and the health department about the various camps it had planned across Darjeeling.																								We sought help from the Hyderabad firm after verifying its authenticity and it has been helping us conduct the camps. The same should have been done in Maninderpal Singhs case, said Malla. The mistake, he added, will not be repeated. 																								Kohli met Bharati Das, his wife of one month, at one such camp. Around 50 Hepatitis-B inoculation camps have been held in the district since last October. 																								Though Kohli passed off as a doctor, he was not actively involved during the inoculation. In fact, a doctor only has to supervise the work done by paramedical staff, said Malla.																								It is difficult not to allow someone who has come to volunteer. However, we will be careful in future while allowing outsiders to volunteer, he added.																								Even volunteers, however, have to go through a 12-day training before going to the camps. Kohli managed to give the course the skip.																								We have a 12-day first-aid training as well as a one-week training in disaster management, but Kohli did not undergo any of these. His goodwill as a dedicated doctor prompted us to allow him attend the camps. We have learnt our lesson, Malla said.

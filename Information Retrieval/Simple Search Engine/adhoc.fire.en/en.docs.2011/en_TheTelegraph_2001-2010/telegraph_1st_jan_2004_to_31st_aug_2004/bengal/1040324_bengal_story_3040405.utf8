 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 CPM suspect in cattle battle
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, March 23: A Border Security Force attempt to prevent cattle smuggling today turned into a pitched battle with villagers, resulting in bomb hurling and injury to three jawans.																								CPM supporters were said to be among the goons who attacked the jawans at Bartanabad village, about 240 km from Calcutta. One of the BSF men is now at Lalbagh Subdivisional Hospital in a serious condition.																								The CPM pleaded ignorance about the incident. I am hearing about the incident for the first time from you, Nirmal Mukherjee, the partys district secretary, said. Nothing can be said without properly verifying the facts, he added.																								Trouble broke out this afternoon when the jawans went to the village to seize cows to prevent smuggling across the India-Bangladesh border, district superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh said.																								According to a BSF official, 12 jawans of the 51 Battalion of the Jalangi outpost were returning with 10 cows from the house of Shafiqul Islam, when over 80 villagers came after them. 																								After a 1.5-km chase, some from the crowd began lobbing bombs at the BSF jawans, seriously injuring three, the official added.																								Hanif Sheikh, a witness, alleged that hooligans led by Bhimrul Sheikh, the CPMs Jitpur local committee secretary, mounted the attack. He further alleged that the cows were kept in the house of Shafiqul, a local CPM worker, to be smuggled into Bangladesh.																								They (jawans) fired 50 rounds in the air to drive away the attackers, Singh said. I have asked the subdivisional police officer of Domkal to submit a report after conducting a thorough inquiry.																								In the last three months, 300 heads of cattle have been seized and more than 10 smugglers arrested by the BSF, official sources said.

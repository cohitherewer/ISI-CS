The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Mamata hospital at standstill
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, May 21: The multi-speciality hospital for coal-mine workers that Mamata Banerjee had promised when she became Union coal and mines minister appears to have run into rough weather.																								The foundation stone of the hospital  a joint-venture with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation  was laid by the Trinamul Congress chief on February 1, near the ITC hotel on EM Bypass. Three months on, construction at Mathpukur is yet to start.																								Coal India Limited sources said the coal and mines ministry is yet to give a formal clearance to the project. We have written to our ministry informing it about the joint venture project and are awaiting a response, said an official.																								Officials said Coal India has already spent about Rs 25 lakh to compensate about 74 farmer families which earned their living by cultivating about 10 acres belonging to the corporation.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said a team of Coal India officials met him before the Lok Sabha elections and told him that they were yet to get permission from the ministry and other central departments regarding participation in the project.																								I have told them to inform me immediately what they want to do. Whether they want to set up the hospital or not. Or else, I will have the vast tract of land utilised for some other purpose, Mukherjee said.																								The mayor added that if Coal India wanted to set up a hospital it will have to be a joint venture as the project had already been passed at the corporations meeting as one. Coal India should have completed its formalities before signing the MoU with the CMC. We want a reply from Coal India immediately, he said.																								Trinamul sources said it was Mamatas hurried decision to lay the foundation stone before the Lok Sabha polls that complicated things.																								Eager to get political mileage and show her performance as coal and mines minister within a short time, she laid the foundation stone. She knew only too well that it was not formally cleared by the ministry and would take time as the project will have to go through a scrutiny and viability study, said a party leader.																								The sources also said a hospital meant for miners should have been set up closer to the Asansol-Ranigunj coal belt.

 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Slap on teacher selector panel
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 1: The high court today came down heavily on the School Service Commission for alleged nepotism and favouritism.																								In an order relating to the appointment of a teacher, Justice Barin Ghosh said: The commission is changing the general rules to select its own people....																								The judge asked the commission to follow the recruitment guidelines and asked it to empanel the petitioner, whose name had been allegedly scrapped from a panel of Hindi teachers. It is a matter of shame that the commission does not have knowledge about the rules of recruitment, the judge said.																								Ajoy Prosad, who appeared in a recruitment test, had moved court alleging irregularities in the selection process. He told the court he was among 17 people empanelled after the first selection test. According to rules, this panel should be made of candidates two-and-a-half-times in excess of the total posts. As 17 were enlisted, we thought there were seven vacancies, Prosad said.																								But after the second selection, a list of 10 candidates was published. I was placed eleventh and my name was not on the list. The petitioner said the second list should have names of candidates one-and-a-half times in excess of the vacancies. If there were seven vacancies, as the eleventh candidate, my name should have been there, he claimed. 																								When I enquired I came to know that there were only five vacancies. According to rules there should be names of eight candidates in the second list.																								After going through the rules, the judge said the commission had dropped the petitioners name with a deliberate motive. The eighth and ninth candidates were enlisted in the second panel only to remove the petitioner from the queue, the court said.

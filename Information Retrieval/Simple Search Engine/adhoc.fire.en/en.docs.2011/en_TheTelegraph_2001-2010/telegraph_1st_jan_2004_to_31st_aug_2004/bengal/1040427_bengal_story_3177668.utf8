The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Dolphin shut, sharks in
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE Calcutta, April 26: A shut-down pharmaceutical laboratory near Dum Dum airport is at the centre of a storm with local CPM leaders accusing party colleagues of forcing its closure and paving the way for realtors to move in.																								A fortnight before the May 10 elections, politics in North 24-Parganas is on the boil over Dolphin Chemical Laboratories in Teghoria. District officials said the unit downed shutters early this year.																								Local CPM officials admitted that the factory shifted to Ahmedabad following labour trouble and pressure from a section of the party. Between 1996 and 1999, when trouble first erupted, the company had an average annual turnover of about Rs 30 crore.																								Contacted in Ahmedabad, Rajesh Gandhi, the owner, said problems created by the CPM and its labour arm, the Citu, made Dolphin unviable since 2000.																								Representatives of a local real estate firm said the management had sold it the 86,400 sq ft plot and work on a multistoreyed complex would begin soon.																								Asked whether he was under pressure to sell the land to realtors, Gandhi said: I sold the land to a local promoter. I do not want to recount the murky episodes (leading to it).																								In 1999, the factory had 255 workers. Half a dozen still hang around the closed gates. 																								We tried our best to prevent the closure. But could not because of intervention from some of our own party leaders, said Purna Mondal, a Citu leader. He accused Rabin Mondal, a former CPM MLA from nearby Rajarhat and president of the Dolphin Citu union, of being instrumental in the units closure.																								Mondal refused comment. Please dont make an issue out of it before the Lok Sabha elections. Come after the polls, I will tell you everything, he said.																								Even as representatives of the promoters sounded determined about going ahead with the multistoreyed complex, Purna Mondal said local CPM leaders were hand in glove with the management and facilitated the transfer of the land.																								A former manager said local CPM leaders had threatened more trouble if Dolphin did not vacate the land.																								Amitava Nandy, the CPM candidate from Dum Dum in the elections, said he had heard about the closure but not about the trading of charges within the party. We have heard that the management has sold the factory. I dont know anything else, he said.

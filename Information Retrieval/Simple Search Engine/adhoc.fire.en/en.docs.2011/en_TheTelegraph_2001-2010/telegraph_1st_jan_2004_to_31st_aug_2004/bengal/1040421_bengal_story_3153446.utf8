 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Court asks OC to keep watch on top cop 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 20: The high court today ordered the officer-in-charge of a South 24-Parganas police station not to allow the district police chief into a plot that had allegedly been trespassed.																								The OC of Bishnupur will now have to ensure that his boss D.K. Ganguly does not enter the land of Narendra Kalyania that was allegedly being taken over by goons with his connivance.																								The plot in question is at Khariberia in Bishnupur. The petitioner made the superintendent a respondent to the case.																								Kalyania stated that he had bought the land from Hamid Ali Mollah and others who were bargadars of the plot. Recently, the superintendent and some others had entered his land forcibly.																								Kalyanias lawyer told the court his client had filed a criminal case against the superintendent and the others, and accordingly, an order was passed by the trial court. But since the superintendent himself was involved, the local police did not take action, he alleged.																								Justice Barin Ghosh fixed the petition for hearing on April 27 and asked Subrata Mukhopadhyay, a junior counsel of the state, to file a report. 																								According to legal circles, the order is rare as it raises the question whether an OC has the authority to prevent his superior officer from taking action.																								Ganguly said: I have not received any such order from the court. I can comment only after seeing the documents.Heroin haul																								Police seized 500 grams of heroin worth more than Rs 45 lakh from Khejuri in East Midnapore on Tuesday. A peddler, Mukesh Khan, was arrested. 																								Khan later told the police that the drugs were being smuggled into the state through a new route from Bangladesh.

 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 AIDS care at TB clinics
 OUR BUREAU																								April 6: With 75 per cent of the 3,000-odd AIDS patients in the state developing tuberculosis as the primary manifestation, the health department has decided to marry the treatment of the two diseases.																								The HIV/TB treatment programme, though in practice already, will be officially launched on April 7, World Health Day. 																								Senior health officials said under the programme, all TB hospitals in the state will admit and treat HIV positive people and AIDS patients who have developed symptoms of consumption.																								With the success of the direct observation and treatment (short course), or Dots, TB patients no longer require to stay long in hospitals and can be treated at home, said director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee.																								As a result, the seven TB hospitals in the state have unoccupied beds and idle staff. These will be utilised now for the increasing number of AIDS patients who have developed TB. 																								Dhubulia State TB Hospital in Nadia, for example, has 12 doctors and 100 nursing staff, in addition to 140 other employees, from ward masters to those in grade IV. Nadia chief medical officer of health Prabhas Choudhury said at the moment, there are only 160 patients at the hospital with a capacity of 1,000.																								Choudhury said the medical and para-medical staff would require specialised training to manage and care for AIDS patients. We are in the process of imparting this training, he said. The training would also address the hesitation that doctors and para-medical personnel have in treating HIV positive people.																								The health services director said many still do not realise the difference between a person who is HIV positive and a person who has AIDS. A person may get infected with the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) today, but he may be unaware of his infection for about four or five years, till he starts suffering from an opportunistic infection like TB or diarrhoea.																								When normal medication or treatment for such infections do not work on the patient, the doctor suspects that he may have HIV and advises a blood test. TB specialists in Calcutta say several patients die in government hospitals because of TB associated with AIDS.																								AIDS Prevention and Control Society officials say, till March, there were around 6,150 HIV detections in Bengal, of which about half had developed into AIDS.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Salt Lake strikes at root of a menace
 SANJAY MANDAL 																								Calcutta, June 6: One of the citys greenest neighbourhoods may lose some of its colour at a time when conservationists are piling heat on the government for turning a blind eye to environment.																								Salt Lake municipality chairman Dilip Gupta, who once felled a couple of coconut trees in his backyard that had apparently pierced the reservoir and drainage system, today said owners of nearly 2,500 vacant plots in the township would be asked to fell the trees on their plots.																								Suddenly, big trees on vacant plots are a headache for us, said Gupta. They are choking the sewer and drainage systems in the township. 																								Severely strapped for cash, the municipality is increasingly realising that a large population of big banyan, mango, krishnachura and other trees on the plots across Salt Lake where buildings were yet to be constructed were damaging sewer and drainage systems and pushing up the already high cost of upkeep.																								The green coverage in defined zones in Salt Lake is about 15 per cent of total area, as against 23 per cent in Calcutta. However, the buildings in Salt Lake are relatively more tree-friendly than those in Calcutta. 																								We are going to push them (the owners of vacant plots) to get rid of the trees that are damaging our infrastructure and also to start construction of buildings, Gupta said.																								The municipality is looking at a 75,000 to 100,000- strong unwanted tree population that has sprouted on the vacant plots, posing a challenge to the maintenance of infrastructure.																								The owners of the plots, allotted decades ago, had planted the saplings unaware of the havoc the trees could play with the township. Sometime ago, the drainage line on the main road at Karunamoyee was damaged by roots of trees. With the monsoon approaching, civic authorities are planning to intensify the awareness drive. Over the past few months, the civic body has earned about Rs 1 lakh auctioning wood. We are planning to auction more wood in a couple of months, D.K. Gupta, the executive engineer of the municipality, said.																								Officials said an increasing number of people are approaching them with appeals to cut down trees. In some cases, owners of land are approaching. In others, the neighbours.																								Though unplanned plantings were done on residential plots, the problem is acute on main roads, said Sabyasachi Dutta, a Trinamul Congress councillor.

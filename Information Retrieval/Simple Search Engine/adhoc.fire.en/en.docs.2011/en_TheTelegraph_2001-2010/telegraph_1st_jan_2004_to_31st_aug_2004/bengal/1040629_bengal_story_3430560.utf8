The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Govt caught in plot flip-flop ordered to pay
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 28: The high court today ordered the government to pay damages for two plots at Panchanandapur in Malda that were gobbled up by the Ganga last year.																								The irrigation department had acquired the land of Motahar Biswas and Gafoor Sheikh in 2000. 																								They were told that the land was located along the alignment chosen to erect an embankment to stop the Ganga from flooding Panchanandapur, about 350 km from Calcutta and one of the worst-hit parts of Malda each rainy season. The land was subsequently washed away by the river.																								Biswas and Sheikh moved the court alleging that the irrigation department had failed to pay them compensation for the land and the buildings in four years. Both of them owned about 3.5 bighas with two two-storeyed buildings.																								The petitioners said in the court that when they approached the government three years after the land was vacated, they were told that the irrigation department was no longer interested in the land. 																								The district land department told them that the government had decided not to acquire the plots. They were washed away by then, the petitioners said.																								When Justice Pratap Roy asked government lawyers why the compensation was not paid, they said an administrative order had issued saying the government was no longer interested in acquiring the land.																								The judge said the government had no authority to issue an administrative order in this regard. The government will have to pay compensation to the petitioners at the current market value. Justice Roy also said that the petitioners were harassed. So, the government will have to pay Rs 1,700 as cost of the cases to each of the petitioners.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Bengal beats India in disability count
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Aug 19: In the number of disabled people for every population of hundred, Bengal clocks more than the national average.																								Among the districts, Darjeeling has the highest percentage of disabled population. 																								Releasing the census report on disability based on 2001 figures, the director of census operations in the state, Vikram Sen, said the percentage of disabled people in Bengal had gone up from 0.18 per cent in 1981 to 2.30 per cent in 2001.																								With 18.47 lakh people suffering from disabilities of sight, speech, hearing, movement or mind, Bengal exceeds the national disability average of 2.13 per cent.																								Concerned over the difference with rest of India in cases of mental disability, speech and hearing impairment, medical experts said ignorance among masses about preventive healthcare, low per capita income and lack of health facilities were the primary factors behind the grim picture. 																								We will have to study in detail the census report, but people in Bengal still opt for quacks and believe in home remedies and myths rather than doctors, said Jyotirmoy Dutta, the head of ophthalmology at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital. 																								Bengal has reported 14.66 per cent mental disability, compared to the national average of 10.33 percent. Psychiatrist Prabir Pal said more mental cases are now being reported but the fact remains that poor living and health conditions are taking their toll. 																								Orthopaedic surgeon Sunil Thakur blamed lack of awareness apart from poor diet and nutrition, for the rise in physical disability. 																								Sen said: In the earlier census, we took into account only those who were completely disabled. For instance, for physical disability we included only those who were completely crippled, mentally unstable meant the insane and disability in seeing.

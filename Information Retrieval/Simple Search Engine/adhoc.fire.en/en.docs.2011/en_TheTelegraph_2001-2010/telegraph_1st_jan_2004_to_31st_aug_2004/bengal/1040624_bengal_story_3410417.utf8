The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Tidal power hope 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 23: If the Centre gives its nod, several villages in the Sundarbans can be lit up with the power of waves. A Rs 32-crore proposed tidal power plant at Durgaduani in Gosaba could well be the first of its kind in India. 																								The station will generate four megawatts of power and benefit 20,000 families in Gosaba, Rangabelia, Pakhidala islands, said S.P. Gon Chowdhary, director of the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency. Chowdhury, also special secretary in the power department, added it would take about three years to start the station. 																								V. Muttemwar, the Union minister of state for non-conventional energy sources, assured that the project would be considered by the Centre. We will have to consult the Prime Minister on the project. Also, a clearance from the environment ministry will have to be sought before work gets underway, he said.																								The minister agreed to accord special status to the Darjeeling hills, enabling remote villages to be supplied by renewable energy at 90 per cent subsidy. A similar scheme for Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia would be considered favourably, Muttemwar said.

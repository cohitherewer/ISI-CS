The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Govt pitch for poultry 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Feb. 4: The state government today reaffirmed that fowls sold in the state were healthy and appealed to people to ignore the bird flu scare that appears to have affected fowl sales over the past few weeks.																								There is no reason to panic, said animal resource minister Anisur Rahaman. 																								People may rest assured that our birds are absolutely healthy and can be included in menus at any time and in whichever form they like. 																								Reports available with the government said sale of chickens and eggs have fallen by 30 per cent on an average across Bengal on account of the avian flu scare. 																								Alarmed at the fear gripping the people, Rahman said the government has started a continuous process to analyse the risk involved if the fowl plague reaches the state. 																								The government is maintaining close vigil on all poultry farms as well as the retail outlets to ensure that not a single bird showing unusual behaviour is sold to consumers. There is no reason why people should stop eating the bird, he said.

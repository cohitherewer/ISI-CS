The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Service trio on McKinsey map
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Feb. 25: The state government may soon appoint international consultants McKinsey to study three areas of the service sector  health, tourism and entertainment  and suggest ways to attract investments. 																								Ranjit Pandit, managing director of McKinsey India, today met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee about the project. 																								I have asked them (McKinsey) to carry out a study on the service sector. They will send us a formal proposal how they will carry out the study. The study will mainly focus on health, tourism and entertainment, Bhattacharjee said after the meeting. 																								The chief minister said he had recently met Rajat Gupta, former managing director of McKinsey who is now a senior director, and discussed how to draw investments to the service sector. 																								Earlier, Bengal had appointed the global consultants to work out investment models for the information technology, food and food processing, and agro-processing sectors and bring in investors from across India and abroad. 																								McKinseys efforts drew firms like Pepsico, Dabur, Calypso and others in the food and agro-processing sectors to Bengal.																								Commerce and industry officials said since the government has decided to promote private participation in health, entertainment and tourism, it wants to go about it in a transparent and systematic way. 																								The state government has realised that health, tourism and entertainment can create major employment opportunities. 																								Health is an area where the government wants to ring in major changes. But it understands that it cannot do it alone. 																								Similarly, tourism is another area in which it has not been able to draw much investment. The state has immense potential and wants to leverage it.																								Entertainment, too, is an area where the state has not witnessed major investments like the other metros in the country.

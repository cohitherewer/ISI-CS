The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Signal slip puts trains head-on
 OUR BUREAU Calcutta/Malda, April 24: The motormen of a train were suspended today for jumping the outer signal at Barharwa station on the Bengal-Jharkhand border around 4 am, bringing into play the possibility of a head-on collision with another express that was chugging into the station from the opposite direction on the same track. 																								Driver Ajay Kumar Singh and his assistant, Mahato, (of the Ranchi-Bhagalpur Vananchal Express) have been suspended and we have started an inquiry into the incident, said Charanjit Singh, divisional railway manager, Malda. Barharwa falls within Eastern Railways Malda division. 																								After jumping the outer signal, the driver stopped the train at the home signal, just outside the platform station, he added. 																								The Gaya-Howrah Express, which was entering from the other side, was stopped by alert station staff on the other side of platform one. 																								There was no chance of a head-on collision as the trains had a gap of 600 yards between them. There are also various safety measures if a train jumps a signal, Singh said. 																								Both trains were scheduled to stop at platform one, one after the other. Vananchal Express was supposed to wait outside till the Howrah-bound train left. 																								But the driver jumped the red outer signal and was heading towards the platform, when he noticed that the home signal  just outside the platform  was red and brought the train to a halt. The Gaya-Howrah Express was entering the platform from the other end. 																								When the station staff realised that the Vananchal Express had jumped the outer signal, they stopped Gaya-Howrah Express just outside the platform. 																								Train services disrupted: Train services on the Sealdah-Dankuni and Sealdah-Bongaon sections of Eastern Railway were disrupted this morning after a goods train derailed around 2 am.

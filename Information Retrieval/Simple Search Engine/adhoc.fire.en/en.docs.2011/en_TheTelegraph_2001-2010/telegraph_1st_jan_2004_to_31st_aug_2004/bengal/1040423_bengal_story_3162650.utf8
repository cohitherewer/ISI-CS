The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Minority pitch for Atal
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, April 22: Atal Bihari Vajpayee is expected to campaign in Bengal in the first week of May, according to the state chapter of the Himayat Committee, a platform of Muslim intellectuals, ulemas and educationists formed to rustle up support for the Prime Minister. 																								Chief patron Muzaffar Khan, a member of the All India Haj Committee, said tentatively Vajpayees visit has been fixed for May 3, but it could be deferred. 																								As in other parts of the country, the committee is striving to improve relations between Muslims and the BJP, which turned very frosty in the wake of the Gujarat riots. In Bengal, the bulk of Muslims, who account for nearly 30 per cent of the electorate, has stayed away from the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine. 																								Khan, however, told a news conference that the committee was an apolitical entity and was not just trying to whip up Muslim support for the BJP. During the last six years, Prime Minister Vajpayee has successfully run the NDA government comprising 22 political parties. With his able leadership, he has proved all those wrong who had any doubts about the stability of the coalition government, said Khan, explaining why they are pitching for Vajpayee. 																								Mainline parties in this state have exploited Muslims over the past five decades in the name of secularism, Khan said. We will submit a memorandum to the Prime Minister after the elections seeking further development of the Muslims, he added. 																								The committee will reach out to Muslim voters and hold statewide rallies to highlight the performance of the Vajpayee government, said Khan. 																								Another minority body, the West Bengal Bustee Conference, urged people to defeat the fascist and communal Trinamul-BJP alliance in the Lok Sabha polls and vote for the Left Front.

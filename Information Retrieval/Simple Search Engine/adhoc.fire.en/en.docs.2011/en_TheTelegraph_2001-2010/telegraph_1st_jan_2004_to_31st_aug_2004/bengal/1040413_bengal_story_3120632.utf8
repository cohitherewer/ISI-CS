The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 New rules for Tagore study
 OUR BUREAU 																								Santiniketan, April 12: Visva-Bharati has for the first time decided to draw up stringent rules for scholars who wish to conduct research at the university.																								The decision comes days after the CBI stumbled on evidence that at least one Tagore researcher had furnished fake foreign degrees to access the Rabindra Bhavan museum.																								The CBI found that the researcher with questionable credentials had access to all study materials and informed the Visva-Bharati authorities about it. 																								After an internal probe, the varsity officials realised that the man was not even registered as a researcher but had got hold of classified Tagore documents and had access to the archives.																								Shaken by the CBIs revelations and its own findings, the varsity has decided to overhaul its age-old system of allowing researchers easy access to study materials. The idea was to allow people to learn more and more about Tagore. We did not have any stringent rules in place. But with the developments, we have decided to review the policy and put some rules in place, vice-chancellor Sujit Basu told The Telegraph.																								The authorities have primarily decided on three new rules: A special committee would review the relevance of proposals submitted by the researchers. The committee would go through the subject of interest and find out whether the candidate deserves permission The researcher keen to study Tagore will have to produce a letter from the institute he is coming from A recommendation from a Visva-Bharati teacher would be a must for a green signal																								The recently constituted seven-member security committee will go through the research proposals. We will have to ensure that no one fools around with his credentials in future and takes the authorities for a ride, a committee member said.

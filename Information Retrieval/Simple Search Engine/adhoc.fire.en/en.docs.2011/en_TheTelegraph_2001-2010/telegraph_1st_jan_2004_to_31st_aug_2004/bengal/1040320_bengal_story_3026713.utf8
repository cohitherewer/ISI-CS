 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Midnapore child death alarm
 OUR BUREAU																								Midnapore, March 19: Five infants and a three-year-old died at the district hospital here in three days, swivelling focus on childcare in state-run clinics from Calcutta to the districts. 																								About a week ago, seven children died in a day at B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children in Calcutta. Many more babies had died within a few days at the apex childcare institute in the state in September-October last year.																								The affected families in Midnapore alleged that doctors negligence led to the deaths. Hospital superintendent L.K. Ghosh denied the charge. In two cases, the condition of the babies was critical during pregnancy. Two were delivered stillborn this morning.																								In Calcutta, director of medical education C.R. Maity said the health department did not receive any complaint. If we receive a complaint, we will carry out an inquiry into the cause of the deaths and find out whether they were preventable, he said.																								Last May, more than 50 children died in Murshidabad of what doctors initially called a mystery fever. Tests revealed that the fever was simple influenza and the deaths could be prevented.																								Bandana Mullick was admitted to the maternity ward of the Midnapore hospital on Tuesday. She underwent a caesarean section that night. We were told the boy was fine. At 2 the next morning, he was given oxygen and in the afternoon his condition turned critical. We repeatedly requested that the doctor pay a visit but he did not come. He came around 9 pm and we were told he was dead, said Bandanas husband Nepal.																								Mamata Tripathi, too, underwent a caesarean section. Her baby died yesterday. Her husband alleged that the dead baby was not handed to him. They made my mother-in-law give an undertaking that we did not want the body, said Nanigopal.																								The superintendent said it was sent to the morgue following the familys consent.																								Kenaram Ari of Binpur, too, could not understand how the child his wife Kajal delivered after a caesarean section died.																								Doctors allegedly advised Mala Das father to take her to a nursing home when he rushed the three-year-old girl to the hospital with a head injury. Mala fell off her cot at home. 																								Ghosh said Mala was alive for only 10 minutes after admission. The doctors cannot be blamed. Two babies, he added, were stillborn and the doctors could not be held responsible for that either. 																								Hospital sources said out of 463 babies delivered in February, 19 were stillborn and four died after birth.

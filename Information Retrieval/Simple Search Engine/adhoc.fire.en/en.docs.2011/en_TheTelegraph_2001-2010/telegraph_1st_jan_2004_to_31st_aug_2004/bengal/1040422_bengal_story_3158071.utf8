The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Mamata boots out Sudip
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, April 21: After the gripping lead-up, the poll process of the most keenly watched contest in the city got off to a dramatic start. 																								Minutes after Sudip Bandopadhyay filed his nomination as a Congress-backed Independent candidate from Calcutta Northwest at Panchayat Bhavan around 11.30 am, the Nationalist Trinamul Congress expelled the sitting MP. Outside, near the GPO, a large police contingent struggled to control slogan-shouting supporters from the rival camps as official nominee Subrata Mukherjee arrived to submit his papers. Their paths, however, did not cross. 																								We are left with no option but to take disciplinary action against Sudip after he filed (his) nomination against the party nominee. His is a case of natural death and we cant help it, said Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy, who heads the partys disciplinary committee. Bandopadhyay will cease to be a party member on April 27, the last date for withdrawal of nomination. 																								Mamata Banerjee was not available for comment as she was leading a padayatra in Ballygunge. 																								Bandopadhyay is unfazed. Those who have expelled me will realise later that they have committed a Himalayan blunder. What wrong have I done? I decided to seek re-election from Calcutta Northwest only because I dont want to leave my electorate here in the lurch, he said. 																								He recounted the days when he and Mamata were expelled from the Congress on the same day. Those who are wielding clout in the organisation (Trinamul) were nowhere to be seen when I walked out of the Congress along with Mamata in 1998 and formed the Trinamul Congress. I regret that Mamata has forgotten the past, he said.																								Partha Chatterjee, another member of the disciplinary panel, trained guns on two party councillors and Bandopadhyays wife Nayana, MLA from Bowbazar, for joining the rebel to jeopardise Subratadas poll prospects. We are keeping watch on the developments and will step in after April 27, he warned.																								Nayana said the party should have expelled her along with my husband. I am fed up with the party comprising a bunch of crooks. Now I want to leave Didi who is being misled by a group of sycophants, she added. 																								The state Congress said the party would welcome Bandopadhyay. Our doors are open for Sudip and we have instructed all grassroots workers to work to ensure his victory in Calcutta Northwest, said former state party chief Somen Mitra.

				 																																	Barasat, Aug. 25: Kabita Ghosh, a 28-year-old housewife in an advanced stage of pregnancy, was stabbed to death when she tried to resist dacoits assaulting her husband at Habra in North 24-Parganas early this morning. 				 																																	The goons fled with ornaments and cash before a local resistance group sensed trouble. Kabitas 10-year-old daughter, who witnessed the murder, is still unable to speak. 				 																																	Inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said in Calcutta later five people had been arrested. The district police said a probe is on to ascertain whether the raid was for monetary gain or a fall out of a family dispute.				 																																	About 20 goons entered the house, 30 km from Calcutta, by breaking open a rear door.

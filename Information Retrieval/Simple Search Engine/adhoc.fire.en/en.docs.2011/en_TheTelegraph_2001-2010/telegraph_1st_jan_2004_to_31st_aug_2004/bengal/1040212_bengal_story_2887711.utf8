 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Trunk teacher suspended
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mogra (Hooghly), Feb. 11: The Hooghly district primary school council today suspended Chandan Ghosh, a teacher of Chhota Khajuria school in Mogra, who was charged with locking up two Class I students in a trunk for more than three hours on Friday. 																								The council slapped a showcause notice on Somnath Ghosh, the headmaster of the institution, for not initiating any action against the teacher. It also sought an explanation for not bringing the matter to its notice even three days after the offence. 																								Chandan Ghosh will remain suspended for an indefinite period. We have asked our disciplinary committee to conduct a thorough inquiry and submit a report within two weeks. We will take stern action against the teacher if he is found guilty, council chairman Dulal Chandra Bhowmick said. 																								Bhowmick and MLA Ashutosh Mukherjee today visited the school for an inspection. 																								Describing the teachers action as a grave offence, Bhowmick said he was also shocked by the headmasters silence. He formally informed the council today. Chandan is said to be a local CPM leader. 																								Chandan had locked brothers Sujon and Sadhan Das in a trunk at school as punishment for playing pranks and left for home. They were rescued during the lunch break, more than three hours after being locked in. 																								The teacher is absconding, council sources said. 																								A demonstration was held in front of the school to demand Chandans immediate removal.

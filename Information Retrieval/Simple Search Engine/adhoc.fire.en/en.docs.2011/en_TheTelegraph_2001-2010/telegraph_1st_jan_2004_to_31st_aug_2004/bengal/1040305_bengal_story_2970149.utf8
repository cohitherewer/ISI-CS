 NARESH JANA																								Gadrasini (Belpahari), March 4: Policemen deployed to combat Naxalites in the region have failed to deal any major blow to the rebels because of the failure of their intelligence network, a senior officer said today.																								When operating on a difficult terrain, against trained guerillas, success depends a great deal on the quality of intelligence on their movement, hideouts and sympathisers. Such intelligence comes from locals who speak only when you have their confidence, the officer said, implying that the police have failed to nurse local contacts.																								The militants often have better relations with the villagers and thus outsmart the police. Repeated raids and combing operations in the forests yield little. 																								The police are yet to make an arrest in connection with last weeks landmine blast at Nundhola in which two police officers, five Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans and the driver of their vehicle were blown to pieces.																								Peoples War-Maoist Communist Centre rebels frequent the hills at Gadrasini, about 240 km from Calcutta. Jagadish Singh, who lives in the hills, said: We never inform the police. If we do, they will beat and torture us. Uttam Singh of Kathchara once tipped them off. They locked him up for two days.																								Karu Murmu and some other residents of Bemuta village had gathered enough courage to tell the police about rebels who had forcibly taken away rice and poultry. The police, in turn, charged us with providing supplies to them, said Murmu.																								About three weeks before the Nundhola blast, young cowherds in Daldali forest told parents on returning home that they had seen people plant landmines. When we walked 24 km to inform the police, they interrogated us for eight hours... as if our boys had planted the mines, said a relative of one of the cowherds. 																								Home ministry officials at Writers Buildings are worried about the villagers antipathy towards the police. They should handle the villagers carefully as the current hostility among the villagers has led to the collapse of the intelligence network, said a senior official.																								Deputy inspector-general, Midnapore range, Sadhan Chandra Mondal said: We are trying our best. He also admitted that the police resort to large-scale arrests after a militant strike.

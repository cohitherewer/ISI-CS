 OUR BUREAU																								Feb. 26: The mother of a police officer killed in yesterdays landmine blast in Belpahari accused the chief minister of failing to ensure the security of the men in uniform.																								Sushama Mondal said: When the chief minister visited the areas infested with Peoples War and Maoist Communist Centre militants, my son took care of his security, among many others. Why wasnt there enough security for my son and the rest of them? Can the chief minister give my only son back? 																								Satyabrata Mondal, a sub-inspector, was among eight people killed when a trekker was blown up at Nundhola in the Belpahari area of West Midnapore, 240 km from Calcutta. The son of a retired railway employee, Mondal was supposed to return home, at Hooghlys Bhadreswar, in March to attend his daughters rice-eating ceremony. 																								Even as Mondals family grieved, security forces launched a search for the militants in and around the Daldali forest. No arrests, however, have been reported yet. Director of State Forensic Science Laboratory .K. Nag went to the blast site and collected samples to determine the nature of the explosive. 																								The blast had blown parts of the trekker up to 50 feet in the air. The steering was stuck in a cluster of branches of a tree 40-foot tall while the burnt seat cover was found hanging from a branch of a sal tree 50-foot high. The area was today strewn with torn uniforms and burnt flesh. A sal tree that stood close to the blast site was almost charred.																								DIG, Midnapore range, Sadhan Chandra Mondal, who is camping in Belpahari, said two companies of the Central Reserve Police Force are arriving from north Bengal. Two companies of the Border Security Force are already in the area.																								Sadhan Chandra said the guerrillas opened fire from sophisticated weapons after the blast. Our Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans, who were on a truck behind the trekker, had tried to retaliate and chase them despite injuries. But the guerrillas were firing from behind trees and it was difficult to aim at them, he said. 																								The officer did not have qualms admitting that the polices intelligence network was poor and inadequate. The intelligence branch has so far failed to provide advance information about the activities of the guerrillas. We cant wholly rely on our sources in the villages....																								Asked about the spate of militant activity in the region, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in Calcutta militants are infiltrating into West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia from Jharkhand.

 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Minister leads midnight raid on liquor den
 PROBIR PRAMANIK																								Jalpaiguri, Feb. 22: A little after midnight last Monday, excise department sleuths and policemen swooped down on an illicit liquor godown at Salugara off National Highway 31 on the outskirts of Siliguri. 																								The haul, smuggled Indian-made foreign liquor worth Rs 32 lakh, was one of the highest ever in the state. But what set the raid apart was that none less than the excise minister, Probodh Chandra Sinha, and the secretary of his department, Tapan Kumar Burman, oversaw it. 																								The target of the 75-member contingent was the 55-year-old baroness of the illicit liquor trade Lambhuni Didi alias Swayam Lama. Though she escaped, the sleuths managed to lay their hands on around 1,700 cartons of Indian-made foreign liquor.																								Speaking to The Telegraph from Calcutta, Burman said: The Salugara area had become a notorious illicit liquor den over the past few years. A 55-year-old Tibetan woman, Lambhuni Didi, was running the racket under the nose of excise personnel. In fact, it was so organised that the department did not carry out a single raid on any of Lambhunis 12 godowns in the area in the past seven years. This was only possible with the active help of a section of employees of my own department. 																								Burman said excise minister Sinha had taken a personal interest and wanted the operation to be a closely-guarded secret. Following a tip-off, the minister and myself decided to conduct the raids. To keep a lid on the entire operation, we handpicked a couple of upright senior officials and took the Jalpaiguri superintendent of police into confidence as we feared armed resistance from the smugglers, he said. 																								The secrecy and the surprise element worked. Though Lambhuni fled, the team seized the large consignment of illicit liquor made in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Bihar. The liquor is smuggled into the state in trucks with either fake liquor licences or by using the same licence repeatedly. We have arrested Lambhunis daughter Denzam Lama, the excise secretary said. 																								Sources in the department said Lambhuni had over the years built up the liquor smuggling network. Her cartel smuggled Indian-made foreign liquor from manufacturing units outside the state using fake and forged liquor licences and a fleet of trucks, many of which were owned by the cartel. 																								Lambhuni has several benami plots of land and a fleet of luxury cars. She started as the owner of a small unlicensed restaurant-cum-bar to rise to be a multi-millionaire, a source said.

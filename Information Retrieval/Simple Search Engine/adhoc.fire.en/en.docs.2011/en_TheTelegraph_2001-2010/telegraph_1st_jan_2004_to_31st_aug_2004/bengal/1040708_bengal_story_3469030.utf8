 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 7: The government today formalised an agreement for an integrated satellite township in west Howrah with an arm of the Salim Group, one of Asias fastest growing conglomerates. 																								A memorandum of agreement was inked today between the Calcutta Municipal Development Authority (CMDA) and Beyond Limit International Ltd (BLIL). 																								Slated to come up over 390.20 acres at the conjunction of Howrah-Amta Road and National Highway 6, the township is expected to be completed in five to seven years. It will be developed in four stages. BLIL will pay CMDA Rs 95 crore to obtain a 999 year lease. 																								They will build a residential-cum-commercial-cum-industrial township boasting of hospitals, educational institutions, mercantile firms and banks, the chief minister said. He added about 7.5 per cent of the flats would be reserved for the economically weaker groups. 																								A nine-member delegation led by Beni Santoso, executive director of the Salim Group, met the chief minister this evening. 																								They will later inspect a site for a two-wheeler manufacturing unit in Kalyani and the Haringhata dairy.

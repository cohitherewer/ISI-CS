The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Punj Lloyd looks east
																								Calcutta, June 30: Delhi-based Punj Lloyd Ltd, arguably the largest gas grid company and the second largest road-maker in the country, has evinced interest in investing in infrastructure development in the state, says a staff reporter.																								Chairman Atul Punj called on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today and said he wanted to invest in roads and highways, the pipeline gas grid, Light Rail Transport and water supply sectors on a build-operate-transfer basis. 																								Accompanied by NRI industrialist Prasun Mukherjee and other officers of his company, Punj also held talks with chief secretary Ashok Gupta in the presence of PWD minister Amar Chowdhury, PWD secretary Kalyani Chowdhury, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and other state officials. 																								Our earlier perception about Bengal was: dont waste your time. But we heard how things were changing here and came to see it for ourselves, Punj said, adding that he was extremely impressed with the chief ministers response and keenness to push these projects.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, February 04, 2004  Engineering quotas abolished
 - Colleges to admit students who clear all-India entrance
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Feb. 3: The quota  for admission of non-resident Indian and foreign students  to engineering colleges in the state will be done away with.  The management quota, too, will become a thing of the past.																								Till last year, 5 per cent of the seats in engineering colleges across the state were kept aside for NRIs, foreigners and candidates of management staff. From this year, nearly 65 engineering institutions will fill up such seats with students who clear the All India Engineering Entrance Examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education.																								A circular asking the engineering colleges to abolish the system of having NRI, foreign national and management quotas from this year has already been sent. These seats will now have to be filled up by students coming through the All India Engineering Entrance Examinations, said Samir Bandyopadhyay, registrar, West Bengal University of Technology.																								Students who were admitted through the management, NRI and foreign national quotas till last year were not required to clear any joint entrance examination. Clearing the entrance test was, however, a must for students aspiring for the remaining 95 per cent of the seats.																								The selection of students entering through the quotas was held directly by authorities of the respective engineering institutions. Those admitted through these quotas had to pay higher fees than the students who cleared the Joint Entrance Examinations.																								Higher education department sources said the decision to scrap the quota system was taken in the wake of a recent decision of the Centre to make it compulsory for all students aspiring to study engineering degree courses to clear an entrance test, state level or national.																								Bandyopadhyay said reservation of seats for students seeking admission after clearing the All India Engineering Entrance Examinations will vary with the location of the colleges. While colleges in Calcutta and Howrah, for instance, will have to admit 5 per cent students who clear the all-India examination, institutions in the districts will have to keep 15 per cent of the seats reserved for such students.																								Bandyopadhyay said the colleges will have a uniform fee structure for all students. Those who clear the all-India test will pay the same fees as those who clear the Joint Entrance Examination conducted by the state government.																								Sabyasachi Sengupta, the registrar of Bengal Engineering College, said the decision to do away with the quotas for NRIs and foreign nationals would not be applicable in the institution as it is a deemed university. 																								We will continue with the system that we have been following, Sengupta said.

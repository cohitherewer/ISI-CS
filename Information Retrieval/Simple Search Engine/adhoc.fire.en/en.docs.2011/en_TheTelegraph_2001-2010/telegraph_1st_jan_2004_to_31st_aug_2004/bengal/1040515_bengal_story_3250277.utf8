The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Blame game at Mamata hub in suicide shadow
 OUR BUREAUCalcutta, May 14: On hindsight, everything he did in the hours preceding his death early this morning bore significance. 																								On Thursday evening, he squared the dues at the local paan shop, said goodbye to friends in a roundabout way and shared his shock with family during dinner.																								Unable to bear the near eclipse of Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress and the wipeout of the BJP, Sukumar Ghosh of Domjur in Howrah hanged himself from the ceiling of his bedroom. He was 27.																								Family members called police when they found the door closed well past breakfast hour. 																								I think I shall never see a Trinamul victory in my life, Sukumar had said after reports poured in suggesting a rout of the party. There is no joy in living, his friends recounted Sukumars words to a team of Trinamuls Howrah district functionaries who visited the Ghoshs.																								Chances are Mamata  now the solitary Trinamul MP  did not know her young fan. But the news of his death provided a grim backdrop to meetings at her Harish Chatterjee Street home through the day. 																								The talks were an extension of Mamatas last nights post-mortem of the Trinamul-BJP combines disastrous showing in 42 seats in the state.																								A blame game has apparently begun within the party reeling under the effect of the election results. Trinamul, observers said, is at its most crucial crossroads. 																								At one point, an angry Mamata ticked off several senior functionaries and held their indiscipline and tendency to work independent of the party responsible for the rout. It is a matter of regret that our party, which had been able to win so many seats in two elections in 1998 and 1999 on the strength of unity, lost almost all of them because of indiscipline and lack of unity, she said.																								The party brass will soon go for a more extensive review of the performance but several Trinamul functionaries put forth the view that the campaign strategy was flawed and distribution of workers to oversee electioneering did not match ground realities. 																								For example, better known legislators like Partha Chatterjee (Behala West), Sadhan Pande (Burtolla) and Jyotipriyo Mullick (Gaighata) had been pulled out of their turf to run Mamatas campaign, they pointed out. A section of workers, the functionaries added, ditched Subrata Mukherjee in Calcutta Northwest and teamed up with rebel Sudip Bandopadhyay, who figured in the talks as well.																								Mamata admitted that there was sabotage. We cannot deny that a section of our own people worked against the party, she said.

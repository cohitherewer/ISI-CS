 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Jan. 30: Now,  prepaid cards will fetch solar power.																								The West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency will introduce cash cards that will ensure solar power to villagers within their validity period. Prepaid energy meters that will show the limit up to which a consumer can draw power will be installed at homes. 																								Director of the agency Shantipada Ganchowdhury said the cash card system will stop wastage of solar power and save time spent to pay bills for the consumers. 																								We have already introduced the system on an experimental basis in Mousumi island in South 24-Parganas. About 25 families are enjoying the benefits of the new system. We have plans to cover 100 more families by April, he said. Gradually, about 500 families in Patharpratima, South 24-Parganas, and Tushkhali in North 24-Parganas will be included in the scheme.																								The cash cards will be of different denominations  from Rs 100 to Rs 300. The cash card we are using experimentally are of Rs 75 and Rs 100 denominations. The demand for solar power is on the rise and so the decision to introduce cards of higher denominations, said Ganchowdhury. 																								The agency has also taken up a Rs 10-crore project to electrify 11 villages on four islands in the Sunderbans with solar power. About 10,000 villagers will benefit from the project. Work will begin in March and is expected to be complete in a year. Four solar power stations will be installed at Pathankhali, Rakhalpur and Kochuberia in South 24-Parganas and Tushkhali in the north. 																								Ninety per cent of the funds will come from the ministry of non-conventional energy and the rest from the states rural electricity development corporation. More than 100,000 residents of 13 islands are already enjoying the benefits of solar power. 																								Once the project is complete, residents will get uninterrupted power for 12 hours from 6 pm. They will also be able to draw water with pumps and use grinding machines.

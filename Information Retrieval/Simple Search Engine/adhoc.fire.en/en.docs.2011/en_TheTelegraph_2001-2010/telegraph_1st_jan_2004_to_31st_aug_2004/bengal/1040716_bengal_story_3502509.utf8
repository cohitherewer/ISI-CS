 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 PhD probe demand 
																								Calcutta, July 15: The Opposition today demanded a government inquiry into the doctoral claim of Pabitra Sarkar, former vice-chancellor of Rabindra Bharati University. 																								Asit Mal of the Congress also sought a statement from the chief minister, but Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee avoided the issue while replying to the home (police) budget discussion. 																								Participating in the debate, Partha Chatterjee of the Trinamul Congress alleged that the government was protecting Sarkar while proceeding against Dilip Sinha, the former vice-chancellor of Visva-Bharati.																								The then governor had asked Rabindra Bharati to send the bio-data of Sarkar when his name was sent for appointment as vice-chancellor. The university sent a bio-data, in which it was claimed that Sarkar had done his PhD from Chicago University. But Sarkar has failed to produce his PhD degree. I want to know why action will not be initiated against him for giving a false statement to the governor, Chatterjee said.

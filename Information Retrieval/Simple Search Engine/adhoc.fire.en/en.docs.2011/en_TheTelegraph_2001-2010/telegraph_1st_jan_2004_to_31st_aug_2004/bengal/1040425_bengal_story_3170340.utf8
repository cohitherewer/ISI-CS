 OUR BUREAU 																								Kultali/Islampur, April 24: An SUCI supporter was shot dead at Kultali in South 24-Parganas and an attempt was made on the life of a CPM zonal committee member at Islampur in north Bengal, vitiating the atmosphere in the run-up to the May 10 elections. 																								Saidul Sardar, 32, was shot and his throat was slit by assailants, alleged to be CPM supporters by a district SUCI leader. But a local CPM leader, said the murder was a sequel to growing infighting within the SUCI. 																								In Islampur, Kalipada Adhikary was attacked last night by miscreants when he was returning home after campaigning. 																								Adhikary has been admitted to a clinic in Siliguri and his condition is said to be serious. 																								The CPM blamed the Congress for the attack.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Cong woos Sudip
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta/Raiganj, Feb. 11: The Congress sought to inject fresh impetus into its Lok Sabha campaign in Bengal with state party chief Pranab Mukherjee saying he might contest the general elections for the first time and MP Priya Ranjan Das Munshi wooing Trinamul Congress rebel Sudip Bandopadhyay. 																								Party colleagues are insisting that I contest from Jangipur as Murshidabad is a Congress bastion. My name appears on the list of candidates for the Jangipur seat and I am ready to take on the CPM nominee if the high command approves, Mukherjee told reporters today. He is a Rajya Sabha member. 																								After a meeting of its state election panel, the Congress recommended about 100 names for 37 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state. Of the remaining five, two have been given to the Party for Democratic Socialism and one each to the Jharkhand Party, and Sharad Pawars NCP. It has decided not to put up a candidate against Forward Bloc rebel Amar Roy Pradhan in Cooch Behar. 																								Inaugurating a bridge in Raigunj, Das Munshi offered support to the Trinamul MP from Calcutta Northwest. 																								Speculation is rife that Trinamul might replace Bandopadhyay with Subrata Mukherjee for this election. 																								If Sudip is not given a Trinamul Congress ticket, the Congress will support him. If we find that his party does not give him a ticket, the Congress will support him from outside. If required, he might be given Congress ticket, Das Munshi said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, June 20, 2004 				 Stamp scam arrest
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta, June 19: The state Criminal Investigation Department has arrested one person for his alleged involvement in the multi-million rupees Telgi stamp paper scam. 																								Mohammed Isha Biswas was picked up from a car on the Bongaon-Chakdah road in North 24-Parganas yesterday in a raid prompted by a tip-off. 																								He was produced before the sub-divisional judicial magistrate in Howrah this afternoon and remanded in police custody for six days. The CID will hand over Isha to a team of CBI officials, expected to arrive tomorrow. 																								The CBI is handling the cases spread across several states related to the scam masterminded by Abdul Karim Telgi. 																								CID officials said Isha was wanted for several months for allegedly selling fake stamp papers worth Rs 50 lakh. They claimed to have unearthed Ishas links as the lid came off the scam. 																								Police sources said Isha had sold at least 90 fake stamp papers in different courts across Bengal and in other parts of the country. 																								In court, the public prosecutor argued that Isha should be sent to police custody for interrogation. Police have definite information that Isha is involved in the stamp scam which rocked the country only a year ago, he said. There were no lawyers in the court to move Ishas bail plea. 																								The CID yesterday also arrested an advocate of Calcutta High Court, Ashok Kumar Pal, with his client, Prasanta Pal, for forging a court order to evade repayment of a bank loan. 																								Justice S.K. Mukherjee had ordered their arrest on April 19 after officials of the bank produced a fake copy of his order, restraining them from claiming repayment of their loan to Prasanta. 																								Prasanta and his two brothers borrowed Rs 2.66 lakh in 1997 from State Bank of India to buy a tractor. After they failed to repay the loan, the bank manager served a notice on them on March 22 this year with an ultimatum to seize their tractor and the land.																								They filed a case and their counsel sent a letter to the bank with a copy of the forged order.

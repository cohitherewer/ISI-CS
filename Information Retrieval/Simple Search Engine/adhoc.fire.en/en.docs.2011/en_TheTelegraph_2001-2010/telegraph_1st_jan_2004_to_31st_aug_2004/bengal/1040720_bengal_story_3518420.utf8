 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 An obese mother and child: Beware																								Calcutta, July 19: Cases of gall- bladder and pancreas cancer have risen in and around the city in the past few years and studies have revealed that an increasing number of obese people have fallen victim to the twin ailments.																								A decade ago, two to four people in hundred had stones in the gall-bladder. The count is 8 to 10 now. One per cent of all gall-bladder stone cases turn into cancer. 																								Compared with other cities, the number of cases dealt with by laparoscopic surgeons here is much higher. Irregular food habits, increased consumption of alcohol, smoking and high cholesterol levels in diet are the major causes for the rise of gall-bladder and pancreatic diseases, said laparoscopic surgeon B. Ramanna. Among women, regular consumption of oral contraceptives leads to gall stones, he added. 																								Prolonged fasting and quick weight gain or loss also makes a person prone to gall-bladder diseases. According to Ramanna, high cholesterol content in diets is the major factor leading to gall stones. Cholesterol deposited in the gall-bladder accumulates to form stones, he said.																								Laparoscopic surgeon D.J. Bhaumik said junk food and pollution have led to the rise in gall- bladder and pancreatic cancer. 																								According to doctors, one in every 1,000 people in the city suffers from chronic pancreatitis, which often leads to pancreatic cancer.

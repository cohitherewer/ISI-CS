 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Mukherjee with the Trinamul rebel. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Calcutta, March 25: Putting an end to speculation, Trinamul Congress rebel Sudip Bandopadhyay today announced he would contest from Calcutta Northwest as an Independent with support from the Congress. 																								State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee  addressing a news conference with Bandopadhyay by his side  said the party would support him only if he severed all ties with the National Democratic Alliance. This is a subtle shift from its earlier demand that the Trinamul rebel speak out against his former allies. 																								Bandopadhyay, known for his proximity to deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, said he would no longer maintain any relation with the NDA even if he won the elections. 																								I will contest as a Congress-backed Independent as I was denied a ticket in Calcutta Northwest, my old constituency, by Trinamul. My party did not respond to my appeals and fielded me from Raigunj in north Bengal, he said. 																								Bandopadhyay, the sitting MP from Calcutta Northwest, incurred Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjees wrath by trying to land a Union ministry berth with BJP backing in July last year. Mamata settled scores by fielding mayor Subrata Mukherjee from Calcutta Northwest. Teacher test cleared																								The Election Commission has given the go-ahead for continuing with procedures related to the School Services Commission examination in the state. Earlier, the poll panel had asked the examinations to be put on hold after it was alleged that publishing related advertisements flouted the model code of conduct.

 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Bribe cops in CBI net
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Barrackpore, Jan. 21: An officer-in-charge and a constable of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) were caught taking bribe by the CBIs anti-corruption wing last night. 																								The duo was produced before the third subdivisional judicial magistrate in Barasat, North 24-Parganas, and remanded in CBI custody for a day. They will be produced again tomorrow. 																								The CBI said S.K. Pandey, the officer-in-charge of the RPF in Naihati, had asked for money from one Shakil Ansari, who was carrying a cloth bag that was confiscated. Ansari said: The officer asked me to pay Rs 75,000 and a few bottles of liquor as fee to get my goods released. 																								Pretending to make phone calls to arrange the money, Ansari got in touch with the CBI. The sleuths arrived in plainclothes and waited outside Pandeys room as he negotiated the deal. They stormed in when the officer was about to accept the bribe.																								A panicky Pandey put the cash under the table and said he did not know what was happening. But the constable looked on with the liquor bottles in his hand.

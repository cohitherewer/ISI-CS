The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Mamata hints at upsets
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Mamata: Surprise?																								Calcutta, May 8: Mamata Banerjee today predicted surprising results in the May 10 Lok Sabha polls in Bengal if the Election Commission can take all the necessary steps to enable the people to cast their votes freely.																								You may see a lot of electoral upsets. Please wait till May 13, the Trinamul Congress chief said at her south Calcutta residence this afternoon at the end of a hectic campaign schedule.																								Mamata had by her side Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio and former Lok Sabha Speaker P. A. Sangma. The two are part of a 17-party alliance in the Northeast led by the Trinamul. 																								Mamata reiterated that the NDA would return to power under Atal Bihari Vajpayees leadership, irrespective of the forecasts made by pollsters. 																								She even predicted that Samajwadi Party chief and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav would join the NDA. I will appeal to Mulayamji to join us and am sure he will do so after the Lok Sabha polls, she said.																								Sangma, too, appeared optimistic about the Trinamuls prospects in Bengal. I have campaigned extensively in the industrial belt and seen tremendous response from the people. I could feel the peoples pulse in the industrial areas as I have once served as Union labour minister and also held the coal portfolio, he said.																								The Trinamul chief accused the ruling Marxists of planning strong-arm tactics to ensure their nominees victory. I will request them to put up a political fight instead of showing their muscle power, she said.																								She alleged that the CPM cadre had tried to obstruct the campaigns of Trinamul candidates. They attacked our candidates, disrupted our processions in many areas and ransacked our cars. Even my rallies were not spared. The CPM leaders only talk about upholding democratic values, but never put them to practice. The poll panel has already taken a few steps, still I will urge it to make fool-proof arrangements to ensure a peaceful and free election, she said. 																								The Trinamul chief also alleged that CPM workers were extorting money from the residents of Chandranath Chatterjee Street in Bhowanipore in her constituency. They (the CPM workers) are threatening them (the residents) with dire consequences if they dare cast their votes. I have asked my party workers to bring the matter to the notice of the chief electoral officer, she said.																								But she kept mum when asked about the result of her own constituency, Calcutta South. Pankaj Banerjee, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, however, quipped: Her victory margin this time will be an all-time record.

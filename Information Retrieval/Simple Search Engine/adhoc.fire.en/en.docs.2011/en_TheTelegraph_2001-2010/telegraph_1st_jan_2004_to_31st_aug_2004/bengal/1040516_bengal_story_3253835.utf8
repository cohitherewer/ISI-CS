 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Court orders inmate torture probe
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, May 15: The first additional sessions judge of Alipore court yesterday directed the Alipore central jail authorities to probe the alleged torture of Sheikh Shahnawaz Alam by some staff and convicts inside the prison on May 10.																								Alam has been lodged in the jail since December 2000 in connection with a dacoity case in Burrabazar.																								The court passed the order when Alam complained to the judge yesterday that a jailer, a head warder and some convicts had assaulted him when he caught an inmate carrying a mobile phone. He also showed the injuries inflicted on him.																								The judge then asked the jail authorities to admit Alam to the prison hospital, probe the alleged assault on him and submit a report within a week.																								Jail superintendent Ramapada Bhattacharya, however, said Alam had been beaten up by some inmates when he tried to misbehave with them. I have interrogated all those against whom Alam had lodged the complaint with the judge. No jail staff had touched him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Eyes plucked out after acid attack
 OUR BUREAU Birbhum/Burdwan, Jan. 16:  Relatives of a girl gouged out the eyes of a youth who had  allegedly thrown acid on her face two days before her wedding.																								Birbhum superintendent of police Akhil Roy said Nirmal Mondal, Nityagopal Mondal and Hem Chandra Mondal were arrested this morning after they attacked Brajen Mondal at Jagadishchandrapur village in Birbhum district, about 290 km from Calcutta.																								While the youth is fighting for life at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, the girl is recovering at a Rampurhat hospital.																								A couple of years ago, Brajens niece Kamana and Nirmals affair came to light. The village elders asked Nirmal to marry Kamana, but he refused, Roy said. 																								A few days later, Nirmal again turned down the request to marry Kamana, he added. 																								Thirsting for revenge, Brajen was waiting for an opportunity to strike. It came his way yesterday, when he waylaid Nirmals sister Sandhya and splashed acid on her face, the police official said.																								Sandhya was supposed to get married tomorrow.																								As soon as her relatives came to know of the incident from her, they accosted Brajen and attacked him. Later they gouged out his eyes, Roy said.																								Brajens family members lodged a complaint with the Margram police station and the arrests followed. 																								It seems there were a few others involved in the incident and we are looking into it. Brajen is undergoing treatment and we have not been able to speak to him. But if he recovers, he may be arrested for throwing acid on Sandhya, Roy said.																								Brajens elder brother, Sudam, however, claimed that his brother was innocent and accused Nirmal and his family members of being the main culprits. They started it all. First Nirmal duped our niece and now my brother will lose his eyesight forever, Sudam said. Schoolboys die																								Two schoolboys died in Midnapore on Friday after they fell off the roofs of their houses while flying kites. Police identified the duo as Koushik Tewari (13) and Arindam Nag (17).

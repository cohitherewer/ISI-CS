 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Forged certificate boot to teacher
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Jan. 19: Calcutta High Court has upheld the dismissal of a madarsa headmaster for submitting forged Burdwan University certificates during his appointment. 																								Sheikh Mohammad Badrujjaman, who was headmaster of the Moulana Ozia High Madarsha of Zara in West Midnapore, was also directed by the court yesterday to pay a fine of Rs 5,000 to the school authorities and another Rs 5,000 to Burdwan University for dragging them to court. 																								Badrujjaman, a teacher in the junior madarsa, had applied for the post of headmaster when the school was upgraded to high madarsa in 1981. He was selected after he produced forged certificates showing he held a Masters degree in Bengali, madarsa counsel Tapas Midya said. 																								Eight years later, the school secretary learnt the marksheets and certificates submitted by the headmaster were forged. He made his own enquiries and found that Badrujjaman had appeared for the MA final examination, but was disqualified for cheating. 																								The school authorities served him a showcause notice and suspended him. He was also asked to submit his original marksheet. 																								Badrujjaman responded by filing a writ petition in Calcutta High Court, challenging the decision. At this, the school authorities sacked him in 1991. 																								Badrujjaman filed another writ petition, in which he submitted a photocopy of the marksheet and told the court that the original marksheet was lost. 																								The high court asked the assistant controller of Burdwan University to appear in court and file a report on the academic qualification of the petitioner. In his statement, the official said the university never issued a certificate or marksheet to the petitioner.  Student suicide																								A 14-year-old girl committed suicide on Sunday night after she was scolded by her parents for returning late from a picnic. Sampa Ghosh, a Class VII student of Duttapulia girls school, went to her room and hanged herself from the ceiling.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Too slippery and steep for political climbers
 VIVEK CHHETRI				 	 The mule-track leading to Shrikhola. A Telegraph picture																								Shrikhola, April 27: A decent road, electricity, health and drinking water havent arrived here yet. Neither have politicians and their promises.																								But a handful of rock faces with graffiti painted by CPM cadre  who braved a steep 11-km trek over slippery trail and receding Oxygen levels  bear credence to Shrikholas claim to fame.																								At 12,000 feet above sea level, Shrikhola Junior Basic School is the second highest polling station in the country and the highest in Bengal.																								Most of the 628 voters here cast their votes. Sure we do. We voted even when the polls were boycotted by the GNLF (Gorkha National Liberation Front). But the time we spend at the booth delays daily chores, says Bir Bahadur Subba, prodding his ration-laden mules up a steep slope.																								Asked what he expects from the elected representative, he says: Dont know. 																								No one has ever come to us with the promise of a better life. We have nothing to expect. But what if some leader we vote for suddenly decides to do something for us?																								Shrikhola is 12 km from Rimbick, 82 km and a five-hour drive from Darjeeling town. 																								Candidates on the campaign trail have come as far as Rimbick but not to Shrikhola. The steep climb for 628 votes is perhaps too heavy a price.																								Residents may not have seen them, but they know the names of the contenders to the Lok Sabha seat. We hear their names on radio and read them in newspapers when we go down to Rimbick. There is Dawa Narbula of the Congress, Mani Thapa of the CPM and G.S. Yonzone of the BJP, Subba rattles off the names.																								Five women have died during delivery in the past three months. Residents dont remember having heard of anyone from the village in need of medical help ever making it to a hospital. No one lasts through the treacherous three-hour descent to Rimbick. The mule-tracks are so narrow there have been incidents in which people carrying the sick have been injured in a fall, says Nima Tashi Sherpa, who owns a shop near Shrikhola school.																								Students who go to the high school in Rimbick are forced to trudge uphill and back six days a week. The pursuit keeps them away from home 12 hours every day. If politicians ever come here, we will request them to construct a motorable road. Electricity, health centres and drinking water can wait, Nima added.

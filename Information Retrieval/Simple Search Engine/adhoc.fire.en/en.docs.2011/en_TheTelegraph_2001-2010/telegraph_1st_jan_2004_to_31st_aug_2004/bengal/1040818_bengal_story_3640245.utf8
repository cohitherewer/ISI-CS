 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 CPM guns target govt doctors
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Cooch Behar, Aug. 17: Tough-talking health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra today got a taste of his own medicine when Left Front MLAs from the district slammed government doctors, labelling them an insensitive lot, who misbehave with patients.																								Mishra, who is not known to mince words, found himself cornered when CPM and Forward Bloc legislators lashed out at the health service he heads at the inauguration of the renovated Maharaja Jitendra Narayan Hospital, the building of which has been given a heritage status.																								Mishra, however, chose not to comment on the allegations in his speech, which followed those by Bloc MLA from Cooch Behar Dipak Sarkar and CPM legislator from Natabari Tamsher Ali.																								Government hospitals have modern facilities for treatment, but people prefer private nursing homes because of the doctors attitude. If they are humane, people will definitely come to government hospitals for treatment, said Ali, who is also a member of the district health committee.

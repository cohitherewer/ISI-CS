 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Sinha fit to face scam sleuths
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, July 4: Dilip Sinha was today certified fit for interrogation, a week after he was hospitalised on complaining of acute chest pain following his arrest in the fake marksheet case.																								The former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor was in the intensive care unit of SSKM Hospital but was shifted to a separate cabin yesterday.																								A CID team briefly questioned him there and decided to come back tomorrow for interrogation. Sinha recently underwent a bypass surgery.																								Since he has recovered considerably, we decided to transfer him to a separate cabin. As per the doctors report, he is now available for interrogation and would be able to take the physical exhaustion of being questioned, hospital superintendent Santanu Tripathi said.																								Sinha, however, took only a few questions from the CID team investigating the case before saying he was not physically fit and would need another sitting to answer their questions. 																								I am not feeling too well. Can we have the conversation later? Sinha reportedly asked the sleuths today.																								The CID has prepared a detailed list of questions for Sinha along these lines: Why was Visva-Bharati applied math lecturer Mukti Debs candidature favoured and under whose order/request did Sinha attest the photocopied (forged) marksheets that Deb produced before the universitys interview board in 1995 and 1997? What is his relation with Deb or for that matter with political leaders who are suspected to have put in a word for her? How did he allow Deb to carry out research under the UGC fellowship scheme when she had not cleared BSc? How many other appointments did Sinha endorse during his seven-year tenure as vice-chancellor?

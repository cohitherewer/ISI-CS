 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta/Midnapore, June 18: A week after five starvation deaths in Amlashol hit headlines and reports of the areas lack of development made news, the local MP said those assigned to monitor development projects had failed in their jobs.																								CPIs Probodh Panda, who attended a meeting of the Paschimanchal Unnayan Parishad at the Midnapore zilla parishad office this morning, also said the CPM-controlled panchayat samiti of Amlashol had to account for its expenses and provide a statement of accounts. 																								Pandas indirect allegation of corruption against the samiti was an echo of the chorus of Opposition parties, which had been claiming that development funds allotted for the region had been laundered.																								Parishad sabhadhipati Pulin Behari Baskey admitted that funds had been disbursed illegally. He added that it was not possible to keep vigil on activities (laundering of funds) round the year. 																								The CPI MP said the parishad would report against the samitis failures and action would be taken accordingly. But one of the first steps mulled in the fight against backwardness was setting up a new panel, Paschimanchal Unnayan Committee, which would hear grievances. 																								Minister of state for the development of the region, Maheswar Murmu, who had earlier denied any starvation deaths at Amlashol, was also present at the meeting.																								Hearing a petition relating to the alleged starvation deaths, acting chief justice of Calcutta High Court A.. Roy today said they were a shame.

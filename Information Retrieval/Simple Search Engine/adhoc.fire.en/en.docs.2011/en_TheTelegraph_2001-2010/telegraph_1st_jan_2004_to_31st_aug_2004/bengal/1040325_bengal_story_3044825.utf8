The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Demand knock on NTPC door 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, March 24: The state electricity board has sought additional supply from the central power plants to meet the sudden increase in demand over the past three weeks and to ensure uninterrupted supply during the higher secondary examinations beginning on April 1. 																								Electricity board officials said they made a request for 170 mw over and above the 500 mw supplied by the National Thermal Power Corporations Farakka plant to the SEB grid during the evening peak hours last weekend. 																								One of them said efforts are on to get another 50 mw from the Loktak plant of the National Hydel Power Corporation in Manipur from April. 																								They linked the sharp increase in demand to the scorching summer heat and Boro cultivation. 																								We have asked our power plants to maximise production and asked the SEB to explore ways of bringing in additional supply to tide over any possible crisis, said power secretary Kalyan Bagchi. Department sources said the power corporations have been asked to ensure uninterrupted supply during the higher secondary exams. 																								The Power Development Corporation Limited has stepped up generation by activating the 210-mw fifth unit of the Bandel power plant that was shut down for renovation. We synchronised the fifth unit at Bandel yesterday and it is generating the full 210 mw. At present, all the 10 210-mw units are generating at full steam, said managing director Birenjit Pal.

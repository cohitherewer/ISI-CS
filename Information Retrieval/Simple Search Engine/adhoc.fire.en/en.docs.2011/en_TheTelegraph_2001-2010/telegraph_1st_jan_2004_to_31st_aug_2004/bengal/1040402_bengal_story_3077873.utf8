		 Subash GhisinghSiliguri, April 1: The Congress Lok Sabha candidate from Darjeeling, Dawa Narbula, today dared Subash Ghisingh to put up a contestant or acknowledge that the GNLF had a tacit understanding with the CPM. 																								Ghisingh cannot boycott the polls as it will earn the Election Commissions ire and the GNLF may even face de-recognition. He will either have to put up a candidate or come clean on his partys support to the CPM, said Narbula, whose name was cleared by the Congress yesterday. The GNLF chief has so far kept  the parties guessing on what he plans to do, leading Opposition  parties to suggest that he has cut a deal with the CPM.  Both the Congress and Trinamul have sent feelers to Ghisingh  on a pre-poll alliance but he is yet to respond.																								Brushing aside allegations of a deal with the CPM, GNLF Darjeeling unit chief Deepak Gurung said: Our chairman is not so shaky. He is holding his cards close to his chest and will reveal them only after all parties have fielded their candidates.

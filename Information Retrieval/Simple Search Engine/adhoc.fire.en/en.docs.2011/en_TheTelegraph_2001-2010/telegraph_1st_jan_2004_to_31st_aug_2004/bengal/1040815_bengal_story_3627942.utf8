The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 Double check on papers
 																											- Court also elicits HS council promise of review overhaul  OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 14: The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education has pledged to the high court that it will introduce a system of double evaluation of answer-scripts and simplify the review procedure from next year. 																								The affidavit came in response to a petition filed by a Howrah housewife, Dipty Chakraborty, claiming that no steps have been taken to make the process of preparing the Higher Secondary examinations results more transparent despite a plea by more than 300 examinees in 2001. 																								In an order that year, a division bench presided over by then Chief Justice A.K. Mathur directed the council to modify the method of publication of results to prevent suicides by frustrated examinees. 																								A lawyer appearing for the council said the education department is seriously trying to find a solution to the problem of suicides by unsuccessful examinees. To combat this problem, the HS council has decided to take several measures and from 2005 onward, the existing system of review will be totally changed, he told the court. 																								The council will also engage a second set of examiners from next year to double- check the answer-scripts. Now, all the papers are evaluated once. 																								A division bench of Justice A. Kabir and Justice A.K. Bishi expressed satisfaction with the councils pledges yesterday while disposing of Chakrabortys petition. 																								The 300 students, who were not satisfied with their results, also wanted photocopies of answer-scripts attached with the mark sheet. 																								But the council made it clear it would not be possible for them to implement the demand because of shortage of manpower. But the council is seriously thinking about introducing the method in future, its affidavit said. 																								The students counsel, Supradip Roy, had cited the example of an examination board in Bangalore that achieved good results after introducing the system. 																								The tendency of committing suicide by unsuccessful candidates had reduced to nil after introduction of the new method in Bangalore, he had claimed.

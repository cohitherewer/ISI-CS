 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 School head in teacher fracas
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Dinhata (Cooch Behar), April 20: Headmistress of Netaji Centenary Junior High School for Girls Rita Das was allegedly beaten up by two of her colleagues in school today.																								Das, who was admitted to the subdivisional hospital and administered saline, said the injuries to her neck and hands were inflicted by two lady teachers. 																								I had joined the school two-and-a-half years ago after being selected by the School Service Commission. Ever since, the Forward Bloc-dominated management committee has been after me for pointing out irregularities in its management, Das said from her hospital bed. 																								The school management committee has filed a counter-FIR alleging that the headmistress was not interested in getting the schools affiliation to the Madhyamik board renewed. 																								When we requested her to fill up the form, the headmistress refused. She abused us and hit us instead. Later, she came out of her room shouting and was taken home by her husband, the complaint filed by Lipika Roy and Sabita Pal stated. Das had complained to the police against both Roy and Pal.																								She said the duo wanted her to sign on blank sheets of paper. We have to send documents to the secondary board by April 30 to get the affiliation renewed. But I have not been able to get the committee to sit for a meeting to do this. Now, they want to send their own reports on the schools functioning, Das said.																								When I protested and refused to sign on the papers, they did not allow me to leave the room. I tried to force my way out and they hit me on the neck, scratched me and ripped my clothes, Das said, adding that had it not been for her husband, who dropped in to see her, she would have suffered more.																								Das also levelled charges against Bloc leader Hiten Nag, who is closely associated with party heavyweight Kamal Guha. Das said: This man wanted to make a puppet out of me. He wanted me to be at his beck and call, which I did not agree to. He instigated supporters to harass me. Nag was not available for comment.

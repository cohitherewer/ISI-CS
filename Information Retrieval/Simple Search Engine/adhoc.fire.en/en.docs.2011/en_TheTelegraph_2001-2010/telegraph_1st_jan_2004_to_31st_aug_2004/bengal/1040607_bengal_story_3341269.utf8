 OUR BUREAU																								June 6: A day after 50 people took ill after being given doses of filaria antidote in Birbhum district, reports of more such cases trickled in from the two 24-Parganas and Nadia taking the number up to nearly 250.																								The filaria antidote  tablets of di-ethyle carbamazine  was administered yesterday across the state as part of a nationwide government programme to eradicate the disease.																								More than 90 people were admitted to Bongaon Subdivisional Hospital in North 24-Parganas, 35 are undergoing treatment at local health centres in Nadia and at least 70 people were hospitalised in South 24-Parganas Namkhana, Gosaba, Bishnupur, Budge Budge and Maheshtala. 																								Most of them felt nauseous, vomited or had diarrhoea after consuming tablets distributed by health workers. 																								Health department officials said though the programme was taken up all over the state, only people from certain pockets were affected. There is no need to panic. The symptoms were mostly nausea and vomiting and these are just the side-effects of the drug, said director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee.																								He also said that there were reports of overdose of the drug from Bongaon. I have sought a detailed report from North 24-Parganas chief medical officer of health on those who fell ill, Chatterjee added. 																								He got in touch with health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, who is out of town, and gave him a situation report.																								According to health officials of North 24-Parganas, several villagers from Sherpur of Gopalnagar in Bongaon developed the symptoms on Saturday night. A medical team has been rushed to the spot to collect samples of the doses.																								Chatterjee said: It may be that the drug did not suit some people. We get similar side-effects from many other drugs, including antibiotics. They suit some but may react with others. 																								However, health department sources in North 24-Parganas said it appeared that the illness resulted from overdose. Health workers were trained about the correct dosage but maybe there were some who did not take the training properly, they said.																								Those found guilty of administering wrong dose of the drug will be punished, a health official said.

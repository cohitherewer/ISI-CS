The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Cong gets attack nod
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 25: Sonia Gandhi has directed her state party unit to step up its anti-CPM campaign despite the Lefts outside support to the coalition at the Centre, Congress leaders said today.																								Soniaji has given us the green signal to go in for a wider movement against the ruling communists in Bengal, though our partys equations with the CPM at the national level are different, former PCC chief Somen Mitra said over phone from Delhi this afternoon.																								Mitra, PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya and MP Jayanta Bhattacharya called on Sonia yesterday to discuss the partys course of action in Bengal. They also met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to seek a development package for the state.																								The leaders drew Sonias attention to the embarrassing situation the party is facing in CPM-ruled Bengal, said Mitra. Soniaji told us not to worry and cited examples of Kerala and Tripura where the Congress and the CPM are politically opposed to each other. She told us there would be no problem if the Congress agitates against the communists in Bengal, he added.																								The leaders immediate concern is to convince the party rank and file about the compulsions in Delhi and the need to turn up the heat on the CPM in the state.																								The state Congress was in a similar situation for about one-and-a-half years after the 1996 parliamentary elections when the party extended support to the H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral governments which were backed by the Left. 																								At that time, Congress workers were so depressed that senior leader Pranab Mukherjee had to travel across the state to explain that supporting a government at the Centre along with the communists did not mean the party would stop fighting the CPM in Bengal, said a Congress functionary here.																								He said Mamata Banerjee had described the state Congress as the CPMs B team to gain political mileage.																								The state Congress has also taken exception to recent statements of the chief minister and the Left Front chairman. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told a rally on Sunday that the Congress would have to follow the CPMs dictates. Biman Bose described the state Congress as a cobra which can always bite.																								Those who have huddled under the umbrella of the Congress to protect themselves from the communal forces should not have said such things. The Congress is not dependent on others and is capable of looking after itself, said Mitra.																								PCC general secretary Manas Bhuniya said the CPM is an opportunistic party that is now atoning for the sin it committed in the seventies and eighties by supporting the Sangh parivar. 																								During his meeting with the Prime Minister, Mitra had pointed out that Bengal had always been neglected by the previous central governments. Singh gave us a patient hearing and told us to inform him about the areas where development is required. On our return, we will draw up a development package and submit it to the Prime Minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Soul-search in Trinamul, scrap in BJP
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 17: Still striving to come to grips with the election debacle, the Trinamul Congress think tank will go into a huddle on Wednesday to figure out the cause.																								Mamata Banerjee has called a party working committee meeting at which MLAs and former MPs have been told to be present. 																								This is our first ever attempt to analyse what went wrong after an election. We should have fared better, despite the CPMs rigging across the state, said Pankaj Banerjee, the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and Trinamul spokesman.																								Mamata, who had threatened to revive her demand for Presidents rule in the state after the elections, tried to keep the party workers chin up. We must not be demoralised and should start afresh. There will be no let-up in our agitation against the communists, she told the former MP from Calcutta Northeast, Ajit Panja, when he called on her at her Kalighat home last evening. 																								Panja lost to the CPMs Mohammad Salim by more than 75,000 votes.																								But his brother Ranjit, who lost to Forward Blocs Subrata Bose by about 20,000 votes, hinted that all was not well within the party, even before the elections. He attributed his defeat to misdeeds of disgruntled party workers. I could have won easy if some party workers did not stab me in the back. A large number of them stayed away from polling booths following an understanding with the CPM agents. This is a deep-rooted conspiracy, Ranjit said.																								He would submit a list of black sheep in the party when he meets Mamata tomorrow. 																								The Trinamul chief, it appears, has decided to quell any possible infighting by pushing harder at the fight-CPM pedal. A statewide agitation with the BJP by its side has been lined up to highlight the CPMs post-poll terror tactics. 																								Mamata met a BJP delegation at home last night and reiterated her pledge to fight the CPM tooth and nail.																								But the state BJP itself appeared a fractured unit. Three days after the results of the Lok Sabha elections were declared, one group blamed the other for the humiliating defeat of Union ministers Tapan Sikdar and Satyabrata Mookerji from Dum Dum and Krishnagar.																								Party sources said both Sikdar and Mookerji have complained to the central leadership against state BJP president Tathagata Roy. The duo also alleged that party workers had joined ranks with CPM cadre in several places to ensure their defeat.																								The sources said a move is afoot to replace Roy with Sikdar at the helm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 CM aid alert to state units
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 11: The government today reaffirmed the notice it served some time ago on the heavily subsidised state-run transport corporations and other organisations.																								How long will we support the state-run units from the exchequer? They have to devise ways to generate revenue to support their operations, the chief minister said while answering the debate on the governors address in the Assembly.																								The organisations would have to take steps to stand on their feet and not be dependent on government funds, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said. Of the 56 state public sector undertakings, those beyond redemption would be wound up, and the financially-weak and loss-making but with potential would be considered for revival, he added.																								We are going to take financial assistance from the UKs Department for International Development. We have taken the decision on the basis of the recommendations given by PriceWaterhouse Coopers, our consultant to the revival package.																								The chief minister also tried to project his governments success in various sectors during the 35-minute speech.																								The information-technology sector in the state, Bhattacharjee said, had achieved 120 per cent growth in a year. We have been successful in wooing four IT giants: Wipro, Satyam, IBM and ITC-Infotech.																								At present, 137 companies have set up units here and more and more are coming in this sector. Wipro will complete its first project by this month and they have sought more land for their second unit, he said. Wipro chairman Azim Premji is coming here on April 4 to hold talks with me regarding expansion of the units.																								Bhattacharjee then took a crack at the BJP-led NDA governments India Shining campaign. Thousands of industries including jute, textile, engineering, and small factories are closed because of the Centres anti-industry policy, he claimed.																								Bhattacharjee said if the country was feeling good as touted by the government, why was it spending crores on advertisements. Seven parties have left the NDA. For what? he asked.

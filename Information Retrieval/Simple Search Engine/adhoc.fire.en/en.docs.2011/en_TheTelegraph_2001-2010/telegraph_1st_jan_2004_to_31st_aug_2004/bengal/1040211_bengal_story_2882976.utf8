 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Teacher packs boys in trunk
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Hooghly, Feb. 10: Two students of Class I were locked up in a trunk for nearly three hours by a teacher last week before they were rescued unconscious.																								Brothers Sujon and Sadhan Das were punished for playing pranks on their mates at their school in Chhota Khajuria in Mogra. The teacher, Chandan Ghosh, locked them in the trunk in the teachers room and left for home. 																								Other teachers heard groans from the direction of the trunk during the lunch break and found the two, said the boys mother, Sumitra.																								Villagers picketed the headmasters office this morning and demanded immediate removal of the teacher. Chandan, a local CPM leader, is likely to go unpunished, the villagers said. 																								However, Mahadeb Ghosh, the headmaster, said action would be taken. I have heard of the incident. He (Chandan) has done something unforgiveable and proper action would be taken against him, he said.																								No complaint has been lodged yet and we have no information about such an incident, said an officer of the Mogra police station.

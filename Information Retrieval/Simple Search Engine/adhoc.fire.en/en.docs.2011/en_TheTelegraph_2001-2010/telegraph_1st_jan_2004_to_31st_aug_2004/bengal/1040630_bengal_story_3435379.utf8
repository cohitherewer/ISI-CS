 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 CM sincerity pat on Centre
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, June 29: In a district that sent Congress representatives to the Lok Sabha and is ravaged by the Ganga every monsoon, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee showered praise on the Congress-led Centre for sanctioning funds to fight erosion.																								The chief minister said the Manmohan Singh government has sanctioned Rs 51 crore in the past week to start work on erosion control in Murshidabad and Malda. I must say that the Centre has really given adequate importance to the problem of erosion and is sincere about tackling it, Bhattacharjee said after a meeting with senior officials here.																								Bhattacharjee said Rs 68 crore will be spent to check erosion and initiate flood precautionary measures. The state will bear Rs 17 crore, he said.																								In the lead-up to the civic polls across the state, Bhattacharjee had criticised the Centre on several issues, including the hike in LPG price. 																								The chief minister said there has been a rise in criminal activities in Murshidabad. The law and order situation in three areas  Domkol, Jalangi and Burwan  is bad and I have asked the district administration to step up vigil, he added. The three places Bhattacharjee named are Congress strongholds and there were reports of violence there after the Lok Sabha elections.																								The Murshidabad zilla parishad sabhadhipati, Siddika Begum of the Congress, was not present at Bhattacharjees meeting. The chief minister said: The district magistrate had requested her but she could not attend the meeting because of ill health. 																								Bhattacharjee, who was prodded by the CPM to come here in the wake of the poll drubbing, discussed the fronts performance with party colleagues.

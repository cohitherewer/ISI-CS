 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Taste of grassroots conciliation 
 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN 																								Behrampore, Aug. 3: A daily labourer yesterday had a taste of conciliation as in the governments scheme of things while the state was coping with a bandh called to protest against the proposed block-level pre-litigation conciliation board bill.																								Ajit Das and his family had to leave Radharhat village near Behrampore town, about 200 km from Calcutta, after being made to pay up for a long-forgotten petty theft at a conciliation meeting.																								Das, a CPM supporter, was asked to attend a party meeting yesterday ostensibly to oppose the bandh called by the Trinamul Congress.																								At the venue, he found that the meeting had been convened to decide the fate of his 11-year-old daughter, Shrabani, accused of stealing three pieces of soap from a local grocery in December.																								Raghu Nandy, the president of the Behrampore panchayat samiti, Swapan Ghosh, the karmadhakshya of the same body, and some other party functionaries were present, Ajit said. I was told to pay a fine of Rs 500 (to grocery owner Santo Halder) for the theft my daughter committed in December. 																								Das said he left the village with his wife, son, daughter and mother because everybody started calling us thieves. His wife Rupta said: We will to go to a relative.																								Embarrassed with the fallout, local CPM leaders are planning to persuade Ajit to stay back.

 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 CPM leader thrashed to death
 STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, April 20: A CPM leader of Kulpi in South 24-Parganas was beaten to death at his doorstep tonight when he returned home from campaigning.																								Riyasen Gayen, 52, a local committee member of the party, was about to enter his house around 10 pm when miscreants hiding behind a wall attacked him. His son Rauf, 20, and daughter Muslima, 23, who rushed to rescue, were also beaten up. 																								All three were taken to Diamond Harbour Subdivisional Hospital, where Riyasen was declared dead. The condition of his children was said to be serious. 																								Police said one person has been arrested in connection with the murder. The attack followed a feud between two families over some local issue, an officer said. Senior police officers are on the spot. 																								Sunderbans development minister and CPM MLA from Mathurapur in the district Kanti Ganguly and the party legislator from Kulpi, Shakuntala Paik, visited the scene of crime. 																								CPMs South 24-Parganas secretary Shantimoy Bhattacharya alleged that Trinamul Congress supporters were behind the murder. Trinamuls goons want to terrorise our party workers, he said. 																								Bhattacharya added that the party would report the incident to chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee tomorrow. 																								Trinamul leaders denied the partys involvement. Our party has nothing to do with the murder. This is not a political clash, said Gobinda Naskar, the district Trinamul president and MLA from Canning.																								It was a village feud and has no connection with politics. The CPM is trying to tarnish the image of our party just before the elections, Naskar said. 																								Superintendent of police Deb Kumar Ganguly said there is tension at Raigarh village. I have asked officials to probe the incident and submit a report tomorrow, he said. A police team led by Diamond Harbour subdivisional officer Mehmood Akhtar has begun the inquiry. 																								The CPM has lined up a rally at the village tomorrow to protest against Riyasens murder.

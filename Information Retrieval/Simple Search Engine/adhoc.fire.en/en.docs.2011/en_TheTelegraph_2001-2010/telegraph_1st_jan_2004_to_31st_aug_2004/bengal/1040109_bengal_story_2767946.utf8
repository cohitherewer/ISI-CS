 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Day out with tutor ends in capsize deaths
 DEBARATI AGARWALA				 	 Relief: Madhumita Rai with her mother. Picture by Surajit Roy																								Gour (Malda), Jan. 8: Two girls and a boy picnicking here with nine others drowned in a lake after a dinghy in which they were boating overturned. 																								Police said the dinghy lost balance after six picnickers piled onto it despite being told that the boat could carry a maximum of two people.																								Three picnickers managed to make it to the bank but Pampa Sarkar, 16, Bidyut Deb, 17, and Beauty Chowdhury, 25, drowned. 																								The victims were among six students who had accompanied their tutor and his family to the historical ruins of Gour. 																								They had come to see the ruins of Gour from Raiganj in North Dinajpur around 12.30 pm. The tragedy occurred because the boat was overcrowded, said Malda superintendent of police Sashkant Pujari.																								The toll would have been higher if two local youths, Abhiram Mondol and Gangadhar Mondol, had not dived into the water to rescue Madhumita Roy, 16, and Arpita Ghosh, 17. 																								The duo, residents of a neighbouring village, were returning home when they spotted the boat tipping the six into the water.																								Pampas brother Sanjib Sarkar, 22, was the only one among the six who knew swimming.																								Pampa and Bidyut were fished out dead. Beauty died on way to the district hospital. 																								Sanjit Mishra, the investigating officer of Englishbazar police station, said boatman Gedu Mondol owned the dinghy. He used to guard the fishes in the lake. Gedu usually did not allow more than two persons on the dinghy. It seems these people had forcibly got into the boat ignoring the danger, said Mishra. 																								All seven of them, including the boatman, fell into the water. Gedu also helped in the rescue operation. But he has disappeared somewhere and we are looking for him. The dingy has been seized, Mishra said.																								According to archaeologists, the lake where the accident occurred was a part of the moat built around the Gour palace. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) team, which is excavating a site near the lake, had recently banned picnics at the spot. 																								A signboard stands at the site warning people not to lark around at the historical site. 																								However, panchayat representative Bimal Ghosh accused the ASI of not warding off the picnickers when they landed in the area.																								Sanjib and Pampas parents, Paresh and Seema, arrived by car from Raiganj. The father stood speechless near his daughters body. Her Sanskrit tutor Mintu Chowdhury promised to take them out. We had paid Rs 150 for each of them. Out of the blue we received this call telling us that Pampa had drowned. I still cannot believe, said the distraught hardware store owner.																								I had told the boatman from the very beginning not to take in so many passengers but he did not listen. I do not know how I survived, sobbed Madhumita, clinging on to her mother, who had arrived from Raiganj.

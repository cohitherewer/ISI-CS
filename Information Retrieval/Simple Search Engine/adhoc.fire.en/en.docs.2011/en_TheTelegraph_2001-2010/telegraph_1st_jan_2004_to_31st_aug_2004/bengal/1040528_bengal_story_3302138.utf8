 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Bail for Biman in poll case
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 27: Biman Bose today surrendered before the acting chief metropolitan magistrate and obtained bail against a bond of Rs 1,000.																								The Election Commission had filed an FIR against the Left Front chairman for his adverse remarks on the functioning of some poll observers.																								Boses counsel, Bikash Bhattacharjya, had earlier moved a petition on his behalf before the city sessions court seeking time to appear before the chief metropolitan magistrates court. The court had granted Boses prayer and asked him to appear before the magistrate by June 10.																								Bose, along with his lawyer, appeared before acting chief metropolitan magistrate Gopal Chandra Karmakar at 2 pm today. As most of the charges were bailable, the court granted Bose bail in five minutes. 																								The Left Front chairman had criticised the poll panels role at a news conference before the elections and alleged that observers were crossing their limits and asking people questions they had no right to. Bose had said he had advised his party members to take such observers by the scruff of their neck to the police. 																								When Boses comments appeared in newspapers, the poll panel directed chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee to lodge an FIR against him. An FIR was lodged at Taltala police station.																								Boses court appearance today was not the first one in recent months. When Justice Amitava Lala of Calcutta High Court imposed curbs on rallies in the city in September, Bose had spoken out against the court. He said he had instructed his supporters to disobey the court ruling and had led a rally himself on a working day.

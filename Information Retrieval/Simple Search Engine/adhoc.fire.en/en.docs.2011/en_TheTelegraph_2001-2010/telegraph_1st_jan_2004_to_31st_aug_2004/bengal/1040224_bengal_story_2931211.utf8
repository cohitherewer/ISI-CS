The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 Ford pat on Buddha for work culture
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMayapur (Nadia), Feb. 23: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may not have time to meet him but Alfred Brush Ford, the scion of the Ford empire, was today all praise for the remarkable improvement in the states work culture under his stewardship.																								The Bengal I visited last time has changed. Work culture is no more a chronic problem in this state, said Ford. He added that Bengal could become a promising destination for US investors while taking the wraps off his desire to create a software park in Calcutta.																								Asked if he was offended by the chief ministers (file picture above) refusal to give him an appointment, the Iskcon devotee also known as Ambarish Das said he must have been very busy with the general elections round the corner. It would have been better if I could meet him and hold conclusive talks on the projects I intend to have here. I will certainly try to meet him next time I visit the state, he said.																								The finance minister (Asim Dasgupta) has promised to provide me the necessary land for the proposed software park, Ford said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Health hardsell team to Gulf
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR  Calcutta, Jan. 9: A 20-member  CII team will leave for Abu Dhabi tomorrow to showcase India  in general and the city in particular as an affordable and  quality healthcare destination.																								With patients from the Arab countries finding it difficult to enter the US post 9/11, more and more people from the region are travelling to Thailand and Singapore for treatment. 																								Residents of the United Arab Emirates spend about Dirham 800 million (Rs 1,000 crore) annually for treatment in the US and the UK. But with protests against the allies gathering momentum, they are fast changing to alternative venues. 																								Sajal Dutta, the managing director of Ruby General Hospital and president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, will be part of the CII team. This mission will add another chapter to the citys healthcare history. The city, despite limitations, is a happening place at the moment if healthcare is considered. I am sure that in the near future, we will see the outcome of this visit in the form of many Arab patients coming here, said Dutta.																								The delegation, led by CII deputy director and mission manager Zakaria Ahmed, will meet UAE officials, hospital managers, insurance companies and industry personnel during its four-day stay in Abu Dhabi. Their motto will be to explain how India, with its improved infrastructure and facilities, can be the next destination for people from the Emirates.																								Dutta said though Mumbai would be much nearer, the fact that more than 40 per cent of the Arabs now fly to Bangkok, Phuket or Singapore gives the city much to hope for. The cost of healthcare here is much less than other cities and staying here is much cheaper than in Thailand or Singapore. I strongly believe that I will be able to portray Calcutta as the next best place, said Dutta.

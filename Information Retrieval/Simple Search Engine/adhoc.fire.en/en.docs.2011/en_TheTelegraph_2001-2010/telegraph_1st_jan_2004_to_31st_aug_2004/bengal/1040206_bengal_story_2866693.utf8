 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Visitor injured in hospital lift
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 5: A man was injured at Suraksha Hospital in Salt Lake this evening when he apparently tried to see how an out-of-order lift in which he was trapped on the way down was being pulled up. 																								S. Maiti, 35, a resident of Maniktala, had come to see a patient on the 7th floor of the hospital. On his way down, the lift developed a fault between the 4th and 5th floors around 7.30 pm. 																								The hospital authorities almost immediately ordered raising the lift up to the ninth floor manually. Maiti wanted to see how it was being done. 																								Despite being warned by the liftman, Maiti forced open the elevator door and tried to see what was happening, when he banged his neck on the base of a floor, said Tapas Choudhury, the deputy superintendent of the hospital.																								Writhing in pain, he cried for help. Once the lift was at the ninth floor, the liftman rushed him to the emergency. We immediately took all possible measures, including CT scan of the brain and neck, which revealed no serious damage, said Somnath Chatterjee, the chief executive officer of the hospital.																								Maiti sustained laceration on his neck, which required several stitches.

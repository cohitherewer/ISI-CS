The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 New district policemen contest pre-poll shift 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Feb. 25: At least 15 officers-in-charge of different police stations in East Midnapore district today challenged in Calcutta High Court the validity of the governments decision to transfer them before the Lok Sabha elections on the basis of a circular issued by the chief election commissioner (CEC). 																								The CEC, in his circular dated February 11, 2004, asked state governments and chief electoral officers across the country to make necessary arrangements for the transfer of senior police officials of the districts, including officers-in-charge, who have been serving for at least four years in the same post. 																								Former state advocate-general Naranarayan Gooptu appeared on behalf of the policemen while his successor, Balai Ray, opposed the petition. Gooptu told the court that the governments decision to act upon the ruling of the CEC was invalid as the circular was bad in law. 																								The court was packed to capacity as people flocked to see a sitting advocate-general take on his predecessor, a first in recent times. 																								Justice Shavro Kamal Mukherjee heard all the parties and adjourned his verdict till tomorrow. 																								Gooptu told the court that six days after the CEC issued his circular, the state police directorate sent a directive to administrators across Bengal to take necessary steps to shuffle those who have completed four years in one post. 																								The circular issued by the state police directorate is bad in law as it goes against the interest of general public. In fact, a policeman who has been serving in one post for four years or more is supposed to know the area better than a fresher. So, it is expected that he or she can conduct electioneering in a more efficient manner, he argued. 																								He also said East Midnapore is a new district and thus the CECs directive is not applicable to his clients. The district which was formed a year ago cannot have had any police officer in one post for four years or more at a stretch, he added.																								Joydeep Kar, counsel for the Election Commission, told the court that before all general elections, the commission issues such circulars to state governments regarding transfer of policemen to ensure free and fair elections as a matter of policy. 																								Ray argued that his government had accepted the recommendations of the CEC for holding free and fair elections in the state. Only after adhering to the CECs recommendations, we have sent directives to the administration for taking steps for a shuffle in the police force, he added. 																								He also challenged the validity of the petition and said it is a matter of transfer of police officers. They should move the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) instead of coming to the high court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Power cuts on Farakka collapse 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Aug. 10: A power  crisis threatened to blow up in the face of Bengal, living  in fear of an energy shortfall because of the fuel strike.																								As National Thermal Power Corporation authorities at Farakka in Murshidabad tried in vain to restart a 500-MW unit lying out of order since late last week, the shortfall in state electricity board-served areas in the districts shot up to nearly 200 MW in the evening peak hours. In Calcutta and its adjoining areas, the deficit was about 100 MW.																								Power cuts ranged between three and four hours in the districts. In Calcutta and its neighbourhood, the CESC resorted to rotational power cuts, lasting about an hour. 																								The board restricted its supply to the CESC grid and fed about 160 MW in the evening peak hours, which is about 100 MW less than usual.																								Power department sources said the 500-MW unit collapsed on Friday following a leak. The only other 500-MW unit at the plant had been shut down earlier for repair. 																								With both 500-MW units out of operation, NTPC could not supply more than 276 MW to the state boards grid this evening, which is about 250 MW less than usual.																								A 210-MW unit at the Kolaghat plant that was shut down for overhauling was brought back to stream yesterday. 																								We have asked all state-run power plants not to shut down any unit in the next three days, a senior power department official said.

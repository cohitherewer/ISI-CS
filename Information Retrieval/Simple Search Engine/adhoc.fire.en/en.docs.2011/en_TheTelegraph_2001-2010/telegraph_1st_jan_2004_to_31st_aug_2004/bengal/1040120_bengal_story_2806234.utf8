The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Front blood flows, anger at police 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, Jan. 19: Dates of the Lok Sabha polls are yet to be announced, but the political temperature in Murshidabad has soared with the murder of three Left Front activists in two days. 																								CPM leader Samsuddin Ahmed, 45, was hacked to death around nine this morning at Shefalipur crossing at Domkal. Yesterday, two Forward Bloc workers were killed in a gunfight with a rival group at Bishnupur Math. 																								The district police are yet to make any arrest. 																								Irked leaders of the ruling front, who play second fiddle to the Congress in the district, today blasted the police for complete inaction. 																								We have a feeling that the police have developed a nexus with the Congress and that is why they are not arresting Congress-backed anti-socials, alleged Chhaya Ghosh, minister for agriculture marketing and Bloc Murshidabad district.

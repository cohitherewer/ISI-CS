 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Anthrax tally rises, doctors rushed
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, April 18: As three fresh anthrax cases reported today added to the tally of 21 infected, a team of doctors was rushed to the site of the breakout in Murshidabad.																								A team of doctors has already left for Shibnagar village in the Domkol area to examine patients affected by the anthrax virus. Though the situation is under control, we have asked health officials based in the district to constantly monitor the ailing, Prabhakar Chatterjee, the director of health services, said in Calcutta tonight.																								He discussed preventive measures with Sachidananda Sarkar, the chief medical officer, health, Murshidabad.																								Animal resources development minister Anisur Rahaman, the CPM MLA from Domkol, is monitoring the situation and is scheduled to visit the area in a day or two.																								We have come to know about three fresh cases on the basis of reports from the medical team now camping in Domkol (about 230 km from Calcutta), Sarkar said. Two are from Shibnagar, and the third from adjoining Garibpur village, he added.																								Sarkar, who examined the patients, traced the disease to an afflicted cow that was butchered for a wedding party on March 24. Those who consumed the undercooked meat have been affected by anthrax, he said.																								Besides Shibnagar and Garibpur, people from Ambarpur and Gardiar villages have also been infected, official sources said. A team of doctors and nurses, they added, has been stationed at Domkol and a makeshift camp set up to treat people complaining of uneasiness and blisters on hands.																								An awareness campaign, too, has been launched. Villagers are being warned against eating cattle meat through microphones on the roofs of mosques, normally used for prayers.																								If cows here were vaccinated, we would not have been affected, said Mujibar Rahman, 44, an anthrax patient at Shibnagar. The residents of the village have planned a demonstration demanding round-the-clock expert monitoring.Angiography unit																								A new angiography unit of Anandalok Hospital in Salt Lake will become operational from tomorrow.

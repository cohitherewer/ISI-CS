 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Cheat chit triggers fear of paper leak 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jalpaiguri, Feb. 9: A candidate appearing in a Staff Selection Commission test yesterday was caught copying from a chit containing answers and serial numbers of objective-type questions, triggering concern about a possible paper leak. 																								Utpal Kumar Bala, a resident of Palta in North 24-Parganas, was handed over to police last night by invigilators and teachers of Jalpaiguri High School, where he was caught cheating during the graduate-level combined preliminary examination of the Staff Selection Commission. 																								During interrogation, the 30-year-old said he got hold of the answers from local friends, one of whom gave him the chit before the examination started. 																								Biplab Biswas, the friend who Bala claimed gave him the chit, had appeared for the same examination in the first half. The question papers for the two sessions are different.																								Bala later confessed that he had promised to pay Rs 50,000 to Biswas if he passed the test. He also claimed that Biswas had handed him the chit in the toilet during recess.																								A schoolteacher who was present in the hall as an invigilator said Bala was caught red-handed by principal Sandip Gun, while he was copying from a piece of paper that he had kept in his right hand. The answers were written alongside serial numbers of all the 170 questions. 																								The fear of a paper leak stems from the preciseness of the answers and the similarity of the exam booklets serial number and a figure on the chit.																								Beside every question number, there was an A, B, C, or D written. The test paper required him to tick one option for each question and he had all of them in that chit, the teacher said. 																								Bala had completed 100 questions when he was caught.																								We became suspicious when we found that a number written on the chit, 624NM9, almost matched with the serial number of the booklet that was given to him. The latter was numbered 624MN9, said Gun, who filed the FIR against Bala. 																								Balas choice of examination centre, too, raised the teachers suspicion. Why should a youth from Palta choose Jalpaiguri as his centre of examination? he asked.

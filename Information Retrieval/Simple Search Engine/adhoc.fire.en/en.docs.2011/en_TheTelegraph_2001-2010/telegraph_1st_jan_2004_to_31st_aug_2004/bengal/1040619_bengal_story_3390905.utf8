The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Biman stifles talk on starvation
 							 - Efforts to bypass poverty continue A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 18: Desperate to avert further embarrassment on the alleged starvation deaths at West Midnapores Amlashol, the CPM today rejected pleas from partners CPI and RSP to discuss hunger at a Left Front committee meeting.																								Minutes after the meeting began at the CPMs Alimuddin Street headquarters this morning, CPI and RSP leaders urged the front Big Brother to discuss the emotive issue of starvation deaths on the basis of human development reports published by the government. But the CPM leaders remained mum. 																								As the leaders insisted on a discussion, front chairman Biman Bose said the deaths could not be discussed as they were not on the agenda. 																								The CPI and RSP representatives were forced into silence as Bose began discussing felicitation of the front MPs from the state. We have decided to felicitate all the 35 MPs on June 25 at the partys Calcutta district committee office, Bose told front leaders. 																								I dont know if people have died of starvation or hunger. But I have information that deaths even from lightning strikes are being established as starvation deaths. Many people died of jaundice but these deaths are being described as starvation deaths, Bose said later.																								Asked if he was denying the reports of starvation deaths at Amlashol village, about 260 km from the city, he clarified: The chief minister has already said something specifically on the issue. He said some people are living in hardship in the locality. I also admit that.

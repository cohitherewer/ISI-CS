The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Youths head shaved for harassing housewife
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 15: A housewifes allegation that a youth in her locality was making advances led to a mini battle in a South 24-Parganas village today.																								Panchanan Das, 28, who apparently took advantage of the absence of the womans husband yesterday and entered their house, was tonsured and beaten up by a mob at Alida in Mograhat, about 70 km from Calcutta. 																								When husband Nilratan Das arrived, the woman recounted the incident, which prompted him to instigate a mob to drag Panchanan out of his house and shave off his head near the bustling Shalina Bazaar. 																								Additional superintendent of police Dilip Banerjee said: An angry Panchanan returned with armed associates and attacked Nilratans house. When our men arrived, the miscreants attacked them as well. A lathi-charge ultimately dispersed the mob. Banerjee also said that Panchanan had developed a soft corner for the 25-year-old housewife but was scared of the husband.																								We rounded up four people for tonsuring Panchanan, including Nilratan who masterminded it. We also arrested six others from Panchanans group. More arrests are likely, said Tanmoy Das, the police officer in charge of Mograhat.  Man lynched																								Rehmat Sheikh, 30, was lynched yesterday after a brawl over setting up a gambling stall at a fair in the Bhatar police station area of Burdwan, about 130 km from Calcutta. Police said four others are in hospital and in serious condition.

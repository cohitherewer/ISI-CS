 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Jail threat to board boss
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 9: The high court today threatened Madhyamik board president Dibyendu Hota with imprisonment for violating an earlier order to recognise a school at Nadias Karimpur.																								Hota would be sent to jail if Kanti Nagar Mahapran Junior High School is not granted recognition by June 22, Justice Girish Gupta said. 																								The chief of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and the secretary of the school education department were told to be present in court on June 22.																								The judge also asked the citys deputy sheriff to attend the court that day. When sentenced to jail, the deputy sheriff formally hands over a person to police.																								The management of the junior high school, about 190 km from Calcutta, had filed a petition in the high court alleging that despite recommendations from the school education departments district-level inspectors team, the secondary board was not keen to recognise it.																								The inspection team had submitted its recommendations in 1994. Ten years have passed but the board is still mum on the issue, the petitioners lawyer told the court.																								Tulsi Banerjee, the lawyer defending Hota, said the school could not fulfil criteria, including those on infrastructure required for recognition, and so the board did not proceeded. 																								Hearing both sides, Justice Gupta had directed the government to ask the board to recognise the school immediately. When the DLIT (the inspection team) has recommended recognition of the school, the board has no authority to disapprove it, he had held.																								But the board did not recognise it even after the court order and the school authorities filed a contempt petition. The board lawyer then argued that Hota could not carry out the order as the relevant documents had not reached his office.																								Summoned, Hota and the school education secretary were in court when the judge gave them a fortnight to carry out his order. Otherwise, I have no option but to send the president of the board to jail, Justice Gupta said.

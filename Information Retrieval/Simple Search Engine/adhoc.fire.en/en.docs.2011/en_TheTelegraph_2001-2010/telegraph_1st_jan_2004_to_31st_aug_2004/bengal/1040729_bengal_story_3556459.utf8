 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 HS script-tragedy boy scores 471 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Midnapore, July 29: Biswajit Dhara of Haldia has passed the Higher Secondary examination, securing 471 marks to be placed in the second division. 																								The result is ordinary but his effort is extraordinary. Biswajit took his physics test barely 12 hours after the funeral of his father. 																								The examinee lost his father and nine other well-wishers in a mishap that was the culmination of a tragic sequence of events set in motion after an invigilator wrongly suspected him of having walked away with his chemistry answer-script. The answer-script was later found in the wrong bundle. 																								The trauma I had to suffer for no fault of mine cost me dear. I would have definitely fared better if the tragedy did not occur. I dont know whether I will be able to get admission to an engineering course to fulfil my late fathers wishes, Biswajit said at his Hanschora school, about 110 km from Calcutta. 																								Biswajits father and the others died in an accident as they were rushing in a Sumo to the examinee, who had phoned an SOS after the invigilators accused him of taking away his answer paper. 																								Haldia municipality chief Tamalika Seth said she would try to arrange for Biswajits admission in the Haldia Institute of Engineering. 																								Though Biswajit was placed in the second division, we cannot deny the circumstances in which he had to sit for the remaining tests after the mishap, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Poll panel wary of Naxalite belt
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 1: The government will from now on send regular reports on law and order to the Election Commission, which would monitor the situation in Bengal, chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said today.																								We are in regular touch with the poll panel and the landmine blast in Belpahari was also discussed, said Banerjee, the top election officer in the state.																								The comments come in the wake of a recent spurt in Peoples War activities.																								The situation in West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia and Jalpaiguri is the most vulnerable. However, the deployment of forces will depend on the situation during the elections, Banerjee said.																								The poll panel official will meet district superintendents of police and district magistrates on March 5. The election notification will be issued on April 16, which is also the date for beginning to file nominations. The process of filing nominations will continue till April 23, and scrutiny will take place on April 24. The last date for withdrawal of nominations is April 26.

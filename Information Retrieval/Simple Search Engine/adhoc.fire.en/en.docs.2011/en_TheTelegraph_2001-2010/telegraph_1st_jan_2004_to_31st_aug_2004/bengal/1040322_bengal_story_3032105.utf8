 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Poll boycott for erosion price
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, March 21: Over 60,000 voters of 40 villages in Panchanandapur will boycott the Lok Sabha elections to press for the compensation promised to them by the government in the wake of the erosion of the Ganga. 																								Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who visited the erosion-hit villages on August 20 last year, had promised the affected families that they would get Rs 5,000 and 2 cottahs each 																								The resolution to stay away from the polls was taken at a meeting where, cutting across party affiliations, the villagers endorsed the decision. 																								Panchanandapur Ganga Bhangan Nagarik Unnayan Samiti secretary Tariqul Islam said a list of 1,355 beneficiaries from Panchanandapur panchayat and a list of 500 from Bangitolla panchayat were approved and put up in the panchayat offices in February.																								The district administration had asked the villagers to look for suitable land. Many villagers had then booked land with money earned through selling off their cattle. They were supposed to pay the rest of the money within a month. 																								The district authorities, however, are now in a bind because disbursement of the grant before the polls will lead to violation of the model code of conduct. 																								The villagers who have already paid the advance money are living with the fear of losing it and the land. First, we should get the money, only then will we consider participating in the polls. No party will be allowed to play around with us. We are united. If anybody wants our votes, he should ensure us our dues, said Abul Sheik of Bangitolla.																								If the villagers do boycott the polls it will hurt Malda strongman Ghani Khan Chowdhurys prospects as most of them are traditionally Congress voters.

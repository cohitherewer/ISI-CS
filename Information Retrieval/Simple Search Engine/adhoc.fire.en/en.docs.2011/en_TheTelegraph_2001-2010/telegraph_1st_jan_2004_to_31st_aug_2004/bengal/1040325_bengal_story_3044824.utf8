I can make it clear that Ramesh is only a day old in his new position as SP of North 24-Parganas. So how can there be allegations against such an officer? As far as allegations during his earlier tenure is concerned, all I can say is the government had consulted me before his appointment and I take responsibility for it, Banerjee said.																								The chief electoral officer said he had received complaints against Ramesh from the Congress.

At my level, there is nothing to probe as of now, he added. 																								Asked about the complaint, Ramesh said: I dont know about any allegations against me. I have been given an assignment which I shall carry out properly. 																								Ramesh met senior police officials and Banerjee this afternoon to pick up the poll rules and regulations which I have to inform to my junior officers. 																								State police chief D.C. Vajpai refused to comment on the allegations made against Ramesh.																								The state Congress said it would write to Nirvachan Sadan enlisting the complaints against Ramesh. We have specific complaints against Ramesh and will bring it to the notice of the EC, said a party functionary.

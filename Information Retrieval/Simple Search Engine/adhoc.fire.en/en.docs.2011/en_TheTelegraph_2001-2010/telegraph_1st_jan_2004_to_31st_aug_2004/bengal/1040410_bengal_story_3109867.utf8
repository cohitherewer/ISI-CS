 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Left vision of Delhi alternative
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, April 9: CPM leader and Left Front chairman Biman Bose today said there is a possibility of a Left-backed government replacing the National Democratic Alliance at the Centre after the Lok Sabha polls.																								Bose said the front would come out with a document within days that will mention the possibility of a secular alternative replacing Atal Bihari Vajpayees government. The document was finalised at a front meeting this morning.																								A senior front leader said neither the NDA nor the Congress would be able to form a government of its own. If so, the support of the 40-odd Left MPs may become decisive. 																								Bose added that the document will chargesheet the Congress for the policies it followed. We will begin with Indira Gandhi and mention that she was the first Prime Minister to have taken a loan from the International Monetary Fund, he said. It will also highlight the process of liberalisation initiated by Rajiv Gandhi.																								We dont think the Congress is 100 per cent secular or has worked for common people. Our only thought now is on how front MPs can effect a secular central government, Bose said.

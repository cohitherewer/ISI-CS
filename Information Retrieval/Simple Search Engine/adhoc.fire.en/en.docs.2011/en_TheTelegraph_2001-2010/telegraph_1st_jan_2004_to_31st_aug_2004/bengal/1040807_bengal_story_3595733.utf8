 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 CAG housing holes
																								Calcutta, Aug. 6: The Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) of India has held the West Bengal Housing Board guilty of injudicious purchase of land and idle investment.																								According to the report, in two cases, the secretary of the housing department warned the board commissioner to be cautious before taking up any project but no responsibility was fixed. 																								The CAG says the board took possession of 45.69 acres at a cost of Rs 8.08 crore in September 1993 in the Maheshtala-Behala area of South 24-Parganas for a housing project. However, after spending Rs 97.95 lakh in building a boundary wall and other work on the land, it abandoned the project on the grounds that sale prospects were bleak. 																								The report also points out the boards decision to buy 20 acres for construction of ownership flats in Burdwan without undertaking any demand survey. This resulted in idle investment of Rs 1.45 crore for more than 12 years and loss of interest of Rs 1.74 crore on blocked fund, the report says.

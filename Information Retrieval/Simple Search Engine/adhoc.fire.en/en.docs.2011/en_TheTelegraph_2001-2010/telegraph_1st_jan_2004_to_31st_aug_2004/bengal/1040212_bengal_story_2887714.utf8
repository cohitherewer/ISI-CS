 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE 																								Barrackpore, Feb. 11: At a time when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is hard-selling Bengal as an industrial destination, the Citus refusal to accept replacement of six unskilled workers at a biscuit factory here with skilled ones today prompted the management to declare suspension of work. 																								The management of Raja Biscuit hung the notice on the factory gate this afternoon after the six workers owing allegiance to the Citu declined to move from the computerised oven line to the grinding section, considered suitable for them. As a result, about 135 workers, belonging mainly to the Citu and the Trinamul Congress trade union wing, are facing an uncertain future. 																								The biscuit factory, which went into production last year, had not witnessed unrest earlier. Trouble started last evening when some Citu supporters objected to the authorities decision to commission a new oven line without consulting them. 																								This second oven line needed six highly skilled workers to operate the computerised boiler. But the six persons who were working there before the installation of the computerised boiler were unskilled workers, said factory manager Bibhas Bhuinya. 																								The authorities asked them to move to the grinding section to make way for skilled workers at the new oven line. The management apparently assured the union that they would be inducted into the second oven line after they underwent training. 																								But the unskilled workers would not listen and barred the entry of the new workers into the unit. The six skilled workers were recruited to learn operating the sophisticated machines under the supervision of engineers. 																								Explaining the decision to suspend work, Bhuinya said: As the new oven line is responsible for maximum production and the first one is dependent on it, we had no option but to bring down shutters. We cannot run the first unit without operating the second one as that will lead to huge financial losses. 																								CPM district secretariat member Amitava Nandy held a meeting of local CPM and Citu workers near the factory last evening and warned the factory authorities not to take any step that might harm the interests of workers supporting them. 																								Nandy, when contacted today, said the CPM was against the closure of any running factory. However, we will also not tolerate the whimsical decisions of factory owners which adversely affect Citu workers, he asserted.

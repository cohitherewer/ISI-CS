The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Bangla bites into Himsagar exports
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMalda, June 15: Bangladeshi traders are selling Malda mangoes in London at 50 pence (about Rs 41) lower than their Bengal counterparts, dealing a blow to exports from here.																								The Indians, who had priced the Himsagar fruit at 5 (Rs 410) a kg were forced to scale down to 4.5 in the face of Bangladeshi competition. 																								The Bangladeshis, who bought the mangoes here, could afford a lower rate because freight charges in their national carrier, Bangladesh Biman, were much lower than British Airways  which Bengals king of fruits had flown in. 																								Food processing minister and chairman of Food Processing and Horticulture Development Corporation Sailen Sarkar said: We ran up a loss of over Rs 11,000 selling 1,450 kg of mango in London on June 11. This is because of the high freight charges levied by the airlines.																								The Bangladeshi exporters had to pay Biman Rs 72 a kg for freight but international carriers operating out of Calcutta charge Rs 118 for a kg. It is disturbing that we are not being able to profit from the same product (that the Bangladeshis are selling), Sarkar said.																								Agriculture Exports and Processed Food Development Agency under the Union commerce and industries ministry, which looks after fruit export, has been apprised of the situation. The onus is now on the Centre to make our prices competitive. We thought that with the packing centres ready and the refrigerated vans in place, we would be able to capture the foreign market, but we need to overcome the freight hurdle first, said Sarkar.																								Commerce and industries sources said a 25 per cent subsidy on freight for fruit exports has been withdrawn.																								Sarkar said he would brief the chief minister about the situation. This (Bangladeshi competition) is bad news when our government is serious about developing the food processing industry and exports. 																								The director of the corporation said if Bangladesh began exporting flowers, growers in India would face the same problem.

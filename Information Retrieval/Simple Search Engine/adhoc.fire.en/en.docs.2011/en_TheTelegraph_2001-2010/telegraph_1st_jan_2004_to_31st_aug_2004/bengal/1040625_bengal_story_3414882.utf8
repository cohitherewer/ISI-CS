The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Polio at Calcutta door
 							 - Govt owns up to eradication failure, reschedules vaccination drive A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 24: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government today admitted that the polio eradication drive in the state was not foolproof and a mop-up programme would be taken up on July 4 to plug the gaps.																								Bengal had the dubious distinction last year of being third among all states with 28 fresh polio cases. This year, only one case has been reported so far. 																								But the panic button was pressed as a hole in the vaccination drive was detected agonisingly close to the city, at South 24-Parganas Maheshtala. If polio could be found 12 km from the city, the situation could be worse at a distance.																								Though the next immunisation programme was planned for October-November, a fresh drive was lined up. 																								Owning up that there were shortcomings in supervision during earlier immunisation programmes, the government decided to introduce nearly 5,000 additional supervisors for the July 4 programme. We have asked health department officials in every district to identify areas where there are cases of resistance. The special drive is to bring cent per cent children under the immunisation programme, said Prabhakar Chatterjee, the director of health services. 																								Special health camps would be organised in the districts, where doctors and paramedical employees would treat various diseases and also administer polio drops to children. The decision to organise the mop-up mission was taken at a high-level meeting earlier this month, family welfare department officials said today.																								One-and-a-half-year-old Sheikh Afridi was afflicted with the wild poliovirus in April. The son of daily wager Akhtar Ali could not be administered polio drops even once, officials said.																								Earlier mop-up rounds, too, had shortcomings. Families in some pockets missed out during the earlier drives. This time, we are striving to cover all families across the state, a family welfare official said. 																								He added that supervisors were facing difficulty managing large areas and as many as five booths. For 38,000 booths in the state, there are 7,700 supervisors. However, sources said their area of charge would be reduced and one supervisor would look after three booths. The number of supervisors would be increased to 12,600.

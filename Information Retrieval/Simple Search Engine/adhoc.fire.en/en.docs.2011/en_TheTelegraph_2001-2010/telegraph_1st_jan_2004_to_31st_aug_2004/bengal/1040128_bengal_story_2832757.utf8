 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Schoolboys dead
 OUR BUREAU																								Jan. 27: A boy of 17, Prabhat Saha was found dead in a field at Hooghlys Dankuni on Monday morning with a noose round his neck.																								Prabhat was a Class VIII student of Mahendranath High School across the Hooghly river in Alambazar near Dakshineswar.																								Subdivisional police officer of Serampore Sankhashubhro Chakraborty said a suicide note was found in his pocket. It may appear that he committed suicide but we cannot say anything before the postmortem, Chakraborty said.																								Policemen asked if Prabhat had hanged himself, how did his body reach the field? The boy had apparently gone to a Saraswati puja pandal near his house in Dankuni with a friend on Sunday night. Prabhat left his friend Biplab Sahas house around 11 pm saying he was going to do something auspicious, a police officer said. 																								In Ranaghat, Nadia, about 70 km from Calcutta, a 14-year-old boy riding a bicycle was lynched on Monday by a man whose cycle he had rammed into. Soumen Dey, the culprit, has been arrested.

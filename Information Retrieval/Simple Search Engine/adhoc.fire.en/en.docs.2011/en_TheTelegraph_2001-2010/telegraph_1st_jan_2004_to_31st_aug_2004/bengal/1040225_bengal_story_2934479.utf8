 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Strike hints at dent in GNLF bastion
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Darjeeling, Feb. 24: The success of the strike called by Citu, which had the moral support of the Peoples Democratic Front, in Darjeeling and Kurseong town has come as a blow to the GNLFs standing in the hills.																								Till last year, strikes called by Opposition parties never evoked a successful response in the hills unless it was supported by the Subhash Ghisingh-led front. 																								The success of the 24-hour strike has prompted political pundits to claim that the GNLF is steadily losing its grip in the urban areas of the hills. A similar strike called by the All Gorkha Students Union (Agsu) last year had turned out to be success, in spite of stiff resistance from the GNLF. Following the success of the Agsu strike, the GNLF had formed the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Sangrakchan Samity, bringing the entire business fraternity under its banner in an effort to avoid a repeat of the Agsu embarrassment. 																								The samity had maintained that any strike call in the hills had to be sanctioned by it. The Citu leaders in the hills, however, went ahead with the strike without doing so.																								A shocked GNLF is now trying to play down the success of the strike. It has no importance. We did not participate in the call. The Opposition parties (CPM and allies) forced it on people, said GNLFs Deepak Gurung.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 CM draws policy line for PM 
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Bhattacharjee greets Calcutta Northeast MP Mohammad Salim at the victory rally on the Shahid Minar grounds in Calcutta. Picture by Aranya Sen 																								Calcutta, May 23: Heady with Left success outside and inside the state, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today gave voice to what everybody knew but were not saying. Manmohan Singhs government will have to function within the framework put in place by the Leftists, the chief minister declared. 																								We will not join them at the Centre but we will ensure that they stick to the guidelines formulated by us. They can only proceed when we nod. If we disagree to a policy, it will not get implemented, said Bhattacharjee, rekindling memories of the influence Chandrababu Naidu had on the Vajpayee government. The Telugu Desam Party was the NDAs biggest ally but chose, like the Left, to remain outside the government. 																								Bhattacharjee was speaking at a rally to celebrate the victory of five CPM MPs  Mohammad Salim, Sudhangshu Seal, Amitava Nandy, Sujon Chakraborty and Shamik Lahiry  in Calcutta and its adjoining areas.																								In Calcuttas suburbs, there is unemployment and poverty, which we will not be able to address without a strong central policy, he said. 																								The areas where the Leftists would support the Congress have been pointed out to the party. We are still carrying out discussion on the common minimum programme, he said.																								The chief minister, however, underlined the need to stay united. We must remain alert to ward off any disunity or split among the coalition members. We must also be alert so that communal forces do not return to power. It is the need of the hour to hold all the allies of the Congress together, he said. 																								Describing the Congress as a party of landlords, he said: Our party is for the middle class, the unemployed and the peasants. The Congress of today will not be able to function without our support. 																								He pointed out that the Centre should emphasise on uplift of the rural poor. The Congress-led government should ensure development of the rural poor. If the problems of the rural areas are addressed properly, it will get the support of the masses, said Bhattacharjee. 																								While coming down heavily on the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine in Bengal, Bhattacharjee sounded a caution for his party, saying a section of people had voted for the combine. 																								There is no room for complacency. These (Trinamul-BJP) forces will not hibernate for long. They will try to stage a comeback. We will have to be ready to combat them, he added.

 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 EC zooms in on PMs highway pictures 
 BARUN GHOSH 																								Calcutta, March 7: The poll code glare fell on Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee after the state election office took cognisance of a CPM complaint against his pictures on signboards of the National Highway Authority of India on the highways under the Golden Quadrilateral project. 																								We have received a written complaint from the CPMs Burdwan unit on this score a couple of days ago and referred it to the Election Commission for necessary action. The Prime Minister is himself a candidate for the coming Lok Sabha elections and his picture on display on places where work on the Golden Quadrilateral is going on violates the model code of conduct, said Basudeb Banerjee, chief electoral officer (CEO). 																								The CPMs complaint was prompted by a recent circular from the Burdwan district magistrate asking the party to desist from writing poll graffiti on walls along the highways. 																								Why would the PMs picture be on display when we are not allowed to write poll graffiti along the national highway? asked Burdwan district CPM secretary Amal Halder.																								Chief electoral office Banerjee said this afternoon that he would initiate action only after hearing from Nirvachan Sadan. In other states, CEOs have covered Vajpayees picture on the signboards with cloth on the basis of complaints from parties. I think this is a step in the right direction, he added. 																								The CEO also issued copies of circulars to all district magistrates and superintendents of police across the state asking them not to call on ministers, including chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, when they visit the districts to campaign. 																								DMs and SPs can meet the chief minister, who is also in charge of home affairs, in the districts only if problems crop up over law and order. Besides, they can meet the relief minister if it is necessary for them to discuss measures concerning a natural calamity, he added. 																								In 2001, Krishna Gupta, the then district magistrate of Nadia, was transferred after he called on the chief minister at the circuit house, oblivious to the model code of conduct. 																								Banerjee said the district magistrate of West Midnapore M.V. Rao was transferred last week as he had already completed a four-year tenure there at a stretch.

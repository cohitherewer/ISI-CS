 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Dud post officer still at work
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 17: The government was caught on the wrong foot today when the high court questioned how the rent controller, whose post had been abolished, was still collecting rents.																								The post had been legally done away with after the promulgation of the Premises Tenancy Act in 2001. But the government did not issue a gazette notification formally abolishing the post.																								Hearing a petition filed by a house-owner, the court observed that there was no provision in the new act for a rent controller. How is he still collecting money from tenants and in which account is the fund being deposited? asked Justice Pinaki Ghosh. 																								Pradip Kumar Popper, a resident of Colootola Street, moved the petition alleging that after the enactment of the new law, his 156 tenants in various houses, who were locked in legal disputes with him, were depositing rents with the controller.																								The petitioner challenged the validity of the rent controllers existence. The court sought a clarification from government pleader Rabilal Moitra. 																								The pleader asked Justice Ghosh to give him two days.

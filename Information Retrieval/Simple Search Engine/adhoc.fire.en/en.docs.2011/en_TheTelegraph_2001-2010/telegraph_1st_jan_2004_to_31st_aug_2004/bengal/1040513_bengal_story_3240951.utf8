The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Tense, one for term amp; other for record
 OUR BUREAU																								May 12: One is eager to repeat history, the other is fighting to defy it. 																								Over 80, never mind his nomination affidavit, A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury is probably fighting his last election and the Congress legend from Malda will be keen to ensure that he gets an eighth straight term in the Lok Sabha. 																								In neighbouring Raiganj constituency, party colleague Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, several years younger, is hoping to win a second consecutive term, something that the seasoned campaigner has never achieved. 																								What is working against Ghani Khan is his age and the fact that he has not held any official post for quite some time. The CPM pounced on this issue during its campaign, dismissing Ghani Khan as a has-been who has little or no say in Delhi. 																								The octogenarian leader is expected to be at the polytechnic grounds early tomorrow. Counting will take place here for Maldas seven Assembly segments and three belonging to the Raiganj constituency, which explains the elaborate security arrangements that have been made in this district. 																								The counting might begin at 8 am but the first trends will start coming in only after 10 am, said CPM leader Jeeban Moitra.																								In Raiganj, Das Munshi has had to contend with an aggressive campaign by the CPM in support of former minister of state for health Minati Ghosh. Desperate to wrest the once-red bastion, the Left Front deployed six ministers, including Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, to campaign for Ghosh. 																								I am confident about breaking the two-year jinx, Das Munshi said. 																								The Darjeeling seat will also be keenly watched with CPMs Mani Thapa facing an uphill task to retain the seat. The party has won this seat three consecutive times, primarily because of the GNLF boycott. Congress candidate Dawa Narbula, on the other hand, is placed quite comfortably thanks to the surprise GNLF support.

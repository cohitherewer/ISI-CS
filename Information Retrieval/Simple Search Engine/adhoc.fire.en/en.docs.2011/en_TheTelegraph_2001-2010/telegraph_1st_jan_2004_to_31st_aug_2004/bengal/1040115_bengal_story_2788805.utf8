The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Cong resigned to vote split 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Jan. 14: State Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee today said anti-Left Front votes are bound to be split as Mamata Banerjee remains aligned with the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre. 																								We cannot help if (the) anti-Left vote gets divided here. However, the Congress is ready to fight the ruling CPM here tooth and nail, irrespective of its issue-based support to us at the national level, Mukherjee said. 																								The Congress kept its anti-Left vote bank intact during the 2001 Assembly elections after the Trinamul Congress chief allied with the former on quitting the NDA over the Tehelka scandal.																								Returning here after a month in Delhi, Mukherjee today began revamping the state unit by initiating talks with former state chief Somen Mitra and party vice-president Pradip Bhattacharya. The latter will be made state PCC working chief to assist Mukherjee who will be overseeing polls in various states.																								Mukherjee said Bhattacharya will oversee electioneering in Bengal in his absence. I shall be pre-occupied with elections to all 543 Lok Sabha seats across the country, he added.																								Sources say Mitra, who resigned as Congress chief after Mamata won a majority of Lok Sabha seats during the 1996 polls, refused to be working president. But he promised all help to the party, which is banking on support from Muslims unhappy that Mamata has kept silent on the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat.																								In a bid to stem inner-party squabbles, the Congress has also reached out to the disgruntled Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the party chief whip in the Lok Sabha.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Bharati date with Kohli at home 
 															- Mix-up sets up two meetings  REZA PRADHAN(Top) Bharati Das (in glasses) being escorted to the home. Kohli being taken out. Telegraph pictures 																								Kalimpong, July 26: Bharati Das, who had said she wanted to ask her husband if he was guilty, got her chance today. Twice.																								After 10 days of waiting, Bharati was granted separate permissions to meet Maninderpal Singh Kohli because of a mix-up between the subdivisional judicial magistrates court and subdivisional officer A.K. Yadav, the ex-officio superintendent of Kalimpong Subsidiary Correctional Home.																								Kohli, the prime accused in the rape and murder of British national Hannah Foster in UK last year, was lodged in the home.																								Yadav said he had allowed Bharati to meet her husband of one month on humanitarian grounds.																								A senior officer of the home said a mix-up gave her the opportunity to speak to Kohli twice.																								In a blue kameez and still wearing vermillion in the parting of her hair and the mangalsutra around the neck, Bharati, whose eyes lay hidden behind dark glasses, first arrived at the home around 12.30 pm. Her friends escorted her back some 20 minutes later.																								Around 2.40, Bharati visited Kohli again, along with her father Oath Bahadur Das. This visit lasted around 45 minutes.																								Todays meetings could well be the last opportunity that Bharati will have in the near future. Kohli was handed over to the Punjab police today. He will be flown to Delhi tomorrow.																								The communication gap between the subdivisional judicial magistrates court and the subdivisional officer, which allowed Bharati to meet Kohli twice, was an issue of light discussion among the authorities of the correctional home.																								Its funny, there is no other way of putting it, said an official of the home who did not want to be named.																								The subdivisional officer had granted Bharati permission to meet her husband, but the lady did not know that. Desperate for a meeting, she filed a petition in the court of the subdivisional judicial magistrate. The court granted her permission because it did not know that she already had one, the official said.																								After the visit was over, they received news that the subdivisional officer had already authorised them to visit Kohli and so, they came over once again, he added.																								What the Dases told Kohli is, however, not known. Both father and daughter refused to speak to reporters waiting outside.																								Bharatis father, who had been trying to meet Kohli for the past several days had earlier said: I want to meet him as he is married to my daughter and is still my son-in-law.

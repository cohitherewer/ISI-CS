 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, April 20: Governor Viren J. Shah today ticked off the authorities of Vidyasagar University for not filling up key posts in the varsity and updating its accounts.																								Speaking at the universitys convocation, the chancellor said: I was distressed to see that for more than four years, certain key and essential posts in the university are lying vacant. 																								Audit reports havent been published for the past four years.																								Calcutta University authorities had cleared the backlog in audit after the Governor criticised them for not doing so at a convocation a few years ago.																								Jogen Debnath, the registrar of Vidyasagar University, said many teaching and non-teaching posts are vacant, but steps are being taken to fill the vacancies.																								Key posts that are vacant include those of controller of examinations and director of the universitys distance education centre and computer centre. Posts of lecturers and readers in the geology and commerce departments are also vacant.

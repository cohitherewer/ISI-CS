The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Tea hopes to tide over low with banks
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jalpaiguri, Feb. 3: The tea industry in north Bengal is delighted at the prospect of receiving financial support from the Centre, which has announced a revamp package for the organised sector and bank funds for the unorganised, at a time when it is battling an acute depression.																								Presenting an interim budget, Union finance minister Jaswant Singh said small tea growers would be given term loans and a revival package would be worked out by the Indian Banks Association for the organised sector.																								Small planters will be entitled to Rs 2 lakh as Fresh Tea Term Loans, repayable at an annual interest of 9 per cent in five years, which includes a moratorium of one year. 																								The minnows in the industry, who were earlier deprived of assistance, are overjoyed. There were times when we had been desperately seeking financial help to run the plantations but got none. This policy, if implemented fast, would do us a world of good, said Bijoy Gopal Chakrobarty, the joint convener of the United Forum of Small and Tea Growers Associations, an apex body of small tea growers.																								Planters in the organised sector welcomed Singhs proposals as well. At a recent meeting with the bankers, we had put forward similar proposals. We are glad that the Centre has understood our condition. But the government should also come up with a package for the closed gardens and help them restart, said Prabir Bhattacharya, the secretary of the Dooars Branch of Indian Tea Association. 																								The labour unions, too, welcomed the proposals but were sceptical about whether the banks would follow instructions. In the past, the Madhukar committee had suggested similar measures. Most banks ignored them except the one headed by Madhukar. It is important that the government monitors the action of the banks, said Samir Roy of the Defence Committee of Plantation Workers Rights.

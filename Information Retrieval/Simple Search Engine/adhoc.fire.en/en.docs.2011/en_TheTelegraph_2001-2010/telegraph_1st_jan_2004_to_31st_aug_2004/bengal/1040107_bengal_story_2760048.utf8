The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 US team reads China script for Bengal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Jan. 6: The US  delegation on a two-day visit to the city has suggested  that the government should take a lesson from China and  work out a 10-year business plan to woo foreign investors.																								Addressing members of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, New York senator Malcolm Smith said: China had worked out 10-20 years business plan and went to different countries for attracting investment. In a similar fashion, the Bengal government should work out a 10-year business plan and share it with the potential investors. We feel that West Bengal is the sleeping economic capital of India and the state should come up with the concrete plans to turn it into an economic capital.																								Chinas endeavour has yielded results with the US having decided to take a 200-member business delegation to the country. 																								The delegates who have come here feel that the government should work out a package to sell the state across the world. They said, not only Bengal, India should try and project its policies and potential to draw foreign investment. 																								Smith said China is constantly talking to the US on its policies and what the country can offer to the investors. India, Smith said, should follow in Chinas footsteps.																								Congressman Gregory Meeks emphasised that the US believes in freedom of entrepreneurship and the government should not intervene in the operations of any enterprise. 																								He cited the example of Haldia Petrochemicals while talking about government-private entrepreneur relationship in any project.																								While replying to members of the chamber of commerce, Smith and Meeks said they would come back to the state with concrete proposals. We no more believe in one-night stay. We believe in marriage and that is going to happen between West Bengal and New York as part of our state-to-state relationship, said Meeks.																								Indias relationship with the US has thrived in the past couple of years. The two countries now have strong economic ties, with the US being Indias largest trading partner and foremost export destination. 																								In 2002, Indias merchandise exports to the US were about $11.8 billion and imports nearly $4.1 billion. Exports of software and information technology-related services to the US grew from $4.8 billion in 2001 to approximately $5.7 billion in 2002.																								Vikram Thapar, the president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, said economic trends in the east held out exciting business opportunities.

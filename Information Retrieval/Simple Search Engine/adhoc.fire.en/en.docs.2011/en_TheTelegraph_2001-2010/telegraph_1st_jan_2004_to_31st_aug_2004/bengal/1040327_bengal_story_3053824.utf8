 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Mamata party to Sonias, Sudip stirs up storm
 BARUN GHOSH																								Calcutta, March 26: If he thought he had succeeded in clearing the hurdles put in his way by Mamata Banerjee, he may have to think again.																								A day after the Congress decided to back Sudip Bandopadhyay as an Independent contesting the Lok Sabha polls from Calcutta Northwest, signals emerged that a section of the party could distance itself from the stand. 																								State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee had presented Bandopadhyay, a former Congressman, before the media yesterday and announced the partys backing. The rebel Trinamul leader, who had fallen out with Mamata because of his hobnobbing with the BJP brass, is the sitting MP from the city seat.																								But a sizeable section of Congress workers in central Calcutta, Calcutta Northwest in the election map, is believed to have ranged itself against their leaders decision. Posters have already appeared in the state Congress office condemning the move to support Bandopadhyay.																								We must protest against the manner in which the party has agreed to extend support to Sudip. We have an apprehension that he will return to the NDA in case it returns to power, said a Congress leader from central Calcutta.																								Former state Congress chief Somen Mitra said: Its true that some posters appeared in our office three days ago condemning the partys support to Sudip. But if I am a true Congressman, I will have to abide by the partys decision.																								Trinamul today decided to initiate disciplinary action against Bandopadhyay for addressing yesterdays news conference at the state Congress office with Mukherjee. Before leaving for Santiniketan, Mamata was learnt to have told her associates to draft a showcause notice for Bandopadhyay. 																								The party has taken strong exception to the manner in which Bandopadhyay held a joint press conference yesterday at the Congress office. We consider the Congress the CPMs B-team and sharing a platform with the party is a serious offence, Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said. We are keeping watch on the developments and will expel Bandopadhyay once he files his nomination as an Independent. 																								Reacting to the partys possible disciplinary action, an agitated Bandopadhyay said tonight he was not bothered. 																								I dont take into cognisance what Mukul is saying about me. I did not utter a word against the party. I have decided to seek re-election from Calcutta Northwest as I have certain responsibilities to the electorate there.

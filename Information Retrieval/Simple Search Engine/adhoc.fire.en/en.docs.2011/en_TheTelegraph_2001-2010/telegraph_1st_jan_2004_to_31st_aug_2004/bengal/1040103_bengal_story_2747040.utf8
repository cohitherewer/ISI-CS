The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Dhupguri sharpshooter shot dead
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Mainaguri (Jalpaiguri), Jan. 2: Police today gunned down Anirban Rava, one of the three KLO militants who triggered the Dhupguri massacre, in an encounter on the Jalpaiguri-Mainaguri road.																								Rava, alias Shyamal Singha, was on his way to collect extortion money from a petrol pump owner in Mainaguri.																								He had come down from the KLOs Bucca camp in the Bhutan hills in November to arrange funds. Rava was going to collect money from some local traders today when our team chased him. He was killed when the police returned fire after he shot at them with a 9mm revolver, north Bengal inspector-general of police Bhupinder Singh said. Thirteen rounds of live cartridge were also found on him.																								Singh, who reached the spot immediately, said KLO sharpshooter Rava was wanted in several cases.																								On August 17, 2002, three militants armed with automatic weapons had stormed the crowded CPM district office at Dhupguri and opened fire, killing five party functionaries and injuring 14. 																								He was among the trio in the operation, Singh said. Tom Adhikary (the KLOs action squad chief) had fired three rounds while Rava emptied the entire magazine of his AK-47. He also masterminded abductions.

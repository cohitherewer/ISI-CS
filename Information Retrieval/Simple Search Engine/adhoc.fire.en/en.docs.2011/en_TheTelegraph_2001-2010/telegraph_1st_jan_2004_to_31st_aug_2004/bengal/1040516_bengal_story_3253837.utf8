 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Soaring mercury lays Calcutta low 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 15: Soaring mercury levels are forcing Calcuttans to queue up before doctors chambers. 																								Most patients, with symptoms like nausea and vomiting, are rushing to hospitals complaining of heat fever and acute dehydration. We have put our staff on high alert and made elaborate arrangements to give specialised treatment to patients according to the nature of their ailments. We are getting at least 15 to 20 patients who are victims of extreme heat, said Amarendra Biswas, deputy superintendent of Medical College and Hospital.																								Some patients, according to Biswas, are also suffering from hypertension, acute respiratory distress and extreme pain in the neck and joints. 																								We are giving huge quantities of oral rehydration solution to these patients, which we make at the hospital itself unlike in other places, he said. 																								The situation at B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children is no different as patients come complaining of abdominal cramps and extreme lethargy. We are advising to keep the babies out of the heat and in optimum temperature at home to escape heat fever, said Mrinal Kanti Chatterjee, medical superintendent of the hospital. 																								Private practitioners are also getting more patients, mostly suffering from diarrhoea, these days. Calcuttans, in order to beat the heat, are drinking a lot of water, but they do not seem to be bothered about checking the source, which could be unsafe, said gastro-enterologist Abhijit Choudhury, who has been getting five to six extra patients for the last few days.  Doctors recommend the following dos and donts to beat the heat:  Drink at least four to five litres of water daily Avoid having cold drinks in the heat. Have packaged drinking water when you are out Dont eat cut fruits sold in the open Dont drink water from unsafe sources Cardiac patients should stay away from the heat to avoid dehydration and to prevent their blood pressure from shooting up  Dont go out in the heat without protection, especially in the afternoons 																								B.C. Roy hospital and the Infectious Diseases hospital at Beleghata are getting nearly 50 heat fever patients every day over the last seven days compared to 15-20 earlier. 																								Initially, we thought that most cases were enteric in nature, but investigations revealed that they were all manifestations of heat fever. They are all being given adequate treatment, said Chatterjee. 																								Hypertension patients are flocking to the cardiology department of R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital. 																								Two patients with a history of heart problems had an attack in the last few days at the hospital. Since the 29 beds in the male ward are occ- upied, some cardiac patients have been kept on the floor due to the space crunch, said Abhijit Banerjee, head of the cardiology department at the hospital. All cardiac patients must keep their blood pressure under control to avoid a possible heart attack, he said.

				 CM rap gets minister going 

 OUR BUREAU
																								Calcutta, Jan. 23: A day after the chief minister ticked him off for being perfunctory regarding training English teachers in primary schools, education minister Kanti Biswas said the task will be completed by March 31.
																								Training 53,000 primary school teachers and bringing 90 lakh students under the mid-day meal scheme were two projects Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told Biswas to give top priority at a meeting convened yesterday to review the ministers performance. 
																								Biswas and some of his colleagues came under severe criticism in the day-long session at the CPM headquarters. 
																								We are extra careful about meeting the (March 31) deadline after the chief minister showed special interest in the twin programmes. We have already begun the process in right earnest, Biswas said this afternoon.
																								The governments seriousness in training English teachers at the primary level is directly related to its decision to teach the language in Class I from the session beginning this year. The subject tops our agenda, we want to teach the language well to our children, Bhattacharjee is learnt to have told Biswas. 
																								Jyoti Basu today joined forces with Bhattacharjee to make the programme a success. As we are re-introducing English in Class I from this year, Buddha has rightly asked Kanti (Biswas) to be careful about completing the training of primary teachers before the new academic session begins, Basu said.
																								With the Lok Sabha elections round the corner, we have to translate our promises to the people into action, despite the funds crunch, he added. The finance minister, Basu said, has been given the necessary directive.
																								Bhattacharjee is learnt to have asked Biswas to ensure that at least one teacher from each of the 53,000 state-aided primary schools gets trained in teaching English. None of the 1.75 lakh primary teachers in the state has the experience of teaching the language in Class I, sources in the party said. 
																								Bhattacharjee was also concerned about the half-hearted effort in implementing the mid-day meal scheme. We can check drop-outs in primary institutions if we can bring about 90 lakh children under the mid-day meal programme, he said. The chief minister resented the fact that only 6 lakh primary students are now covered by the scheme.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Front shelves rural taxes plan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Jan. 7: The Left Front today discussed the issue of taxes on livestock and rural transport, particularly in view of the coming general elections, and decided to put the proposals on hold following protests from smaller constituents like the Forward Bloc and the RSP. 																								A proposal to impose taxes on livestock, grazing on panchayat land and rural transport has evoked a sharp reaction from the Trinamul Congress. Mamata Banerjee has called a Bengal bandh on February 3 against this suggestion in a government circular last October to the village bodies about ways to boost revenue. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today reiterated that his government had at no point of time decided to impose the taxes. Talking to reporters at Writers Buildings, Bhattacharjee said the government had only identified the areas, under provisions of the Panchayat Act of 1973, from where panchayats can mobilise resources. 																								It is part of an exercise both by the Centre and the state governments to make the panchayats self-sufficient. The village bodies will take the opinion of the people and submit their suggestions to the government. The ultimate decision will be taken by the government, he added. 																								However, if the panchayats felt they could do without imposing the taxes, they were free to do so, he said. 																								At a meeting of the Trinamul womens wing at Nazrul Mancha, Mamata demanded that the circular be withdrawn. If the government decides to impose taxes even on the livestock of the poor villagers, we will go ahead with our bandh programme. We will not let the poor people in rural Bengal suffer, she said. 																								Referring to animal resources development minister Anisur Rahmans statement yesterday ruling out immediate imposition of the proposed taxes, Mamata said: If the issue is non-existent, then why was a meeting of the Left Front called today to discuss it?																								Left Front chairman Biman Bose said after the meeting that Trinamul was misleading the people of rural Bengal. If the people want the taxes, they will be imposed. If the people do not want them, they will not be imposed. He, however, did not rule out their imposition after the general elections. 																								RSP and Forward Bloc leaders protested that the rural voters might react sharply if the proposed taxes are imposed to boost revenue in the panchayat areas as many people in the villages earn their livelihood from their livestock. 																								The proposed tax structure envisages a payment of Rs 12 every month for cows, bullock, horses and donkeys and Rs 6 every month for goats for grazing on panchayat land. An annual licence fee of Rs 10 is proposed on domestic animals and birds. 																								Taxes have also been suggested on bicycles, rickshaws and bullock carts with rubber tyres for using village roads maintained by the panchayats.

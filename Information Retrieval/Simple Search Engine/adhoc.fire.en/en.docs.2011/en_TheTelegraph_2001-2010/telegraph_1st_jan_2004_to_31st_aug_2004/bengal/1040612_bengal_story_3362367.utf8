 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 11: Calcutta High Court today ordered the Nadia District Primary School Council to absorb within three months 56 persons selected for the posts of primary teachers in 1979 but not employed for 25 years. 																								The petitioners, led by Sidheswar Biswas, had complained that the district school board  the predecessor of the council allegedly refused to give them appointments to make way for those close to a political party. 																								My clients had taken junior basic training course. During admission to the training course, they had to give an undertaking that they would teach in a primary school for at least five years after completion of training. If they do not teach for five years in a primary school, they would not get any other government job. 																								After the training, they registered their names with employment exchanges. Their names were sent to the school board by the employment exchanges and their names were empanelled for recruitment by the board after a two-day interview, said L.K. Pal, counsel for the teachers. 																								According to rules, candidates with certificates of junior basic training course would get first preference in the selection of primary teachers. But surprisingly, the board in 1979 had prepared a list of 1,965 candidates of whom 600 did not have the training. A large number of candidates, including the petitioners, was left out, the lawyer said. 																								About 108 candidates deprived by the board approached the high court in 1980 and won the case, and jobs. Impressed, 89 other deprived candidates moved a petition next year and were absorbed in 1988. 																								The 56 petitioners moved court in 1989 and Justice Ashim Banerjee directed the council in January this year to give them appointments too. But the council challenged the order in the division bench. The division bench today upheld the order of the trial court.

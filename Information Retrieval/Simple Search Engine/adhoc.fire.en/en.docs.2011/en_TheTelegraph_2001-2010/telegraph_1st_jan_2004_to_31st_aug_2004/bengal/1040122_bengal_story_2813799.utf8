The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Bandh spared Kalam qualms
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Jan. 21: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has saved Mamata Banerjee the blushes. His scheduled visit to the city on February 3, the day Mamata has called a dawn-to-dusk bandh across the state, has been put off.																								The President was supposed to attend the centenary celebrations of Mitra Institution. But Kalam called up the president of the school managing committee, CPM MP Somnath Chatterjee, to inform that he would have to be in Delhi on February 3 to sign the appropriation bill to be placed in Parliament.																								It was a touching gesture on his part to ring up in person to express his inability to attend our function. He gave me three dates  February 21, 26 and 27  and said he could be here with us on any one of them, said Chatterjee.																								As the news of the Presidents rescheduled programme reached the Trinamul Congress, its leaders heaved a sigh of relief. This will put a stop to criticism that it was uncivilised to call the bandh on a day the President was to attend a programme in city, said party spokesman and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Pankaj Banerjee. 																								Trinamul functionaries believe the postponement of the Presidents visit will silence the Congress and the CPM. Till the other day, the CPM leaders were saying we lacked decency in calling the bandh on the day of the Presidents visit. Now, they cannot criticise us on this score, said Trinamul chief whip in the Assembly Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay.																								Having heard the news, Mamata was learnt to have told her aides that she was relieved. 																								However, Muslim leaders in Trinamul are still opposed to the bandh as it coincides with the second day of Id-ul-Zoha. The festival beginning February 2 will continue for three days. We had requested Mamata to reconsider the bandh date, said mayor-in-council Javed Ahmed Khan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Tropical team to death belt 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Lalgola, June 1: A team of doctors from the School of Tropical Medicine will visit Nashipur village near here where a mystery fever claimed four children in the past week.																								More than 40 were taken ill in the village, about 260 km from Calcutta, where as many children with similar symptoms had died last year.																								Murshidabad chief medical officer of health Sachchidananda Sarkar has sent two reports on the outbreak to health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra.																								The situation is now under control. Two medical teams  one local and another from Behrampore  have been working round the clock in the affected areas. No fresh death has been reported, Sarkar said.																								He added that the influenza B virus, which took a heavy toll of children in 2003, was also responsible for the disease this year.																								Last year, the district health administration had dubbed the influenza as a mystery fever. Two doctors were later suspended for negligence. 																								This time, we have taken prompt steps to bring the situation under control. Doctors have already examined hundreds of children suffering from malnutrition. We have urged the government to send an expert team to the area, the medical officer said.																								He conceded that the absence of a health centre at Nashipur was hampering treatment of the children. We have decided to run the nearby Natun Diyar health centre round the clock. We will also urge the local panchayat and NGOs to start an awareness campaign among the villagers, Sarkar said.																								Sources said lack of facilities has forced the villagers to depend on quacks for treatment of their children. These quacks advise them against getting the children hospitalised.

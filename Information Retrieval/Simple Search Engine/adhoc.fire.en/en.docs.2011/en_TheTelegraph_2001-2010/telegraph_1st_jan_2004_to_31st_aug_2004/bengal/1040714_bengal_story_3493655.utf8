 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Class torture
Burdwan, July 13: Minhajul Haque, a Class X student of the municipal high school here, was beaten senseless by headmaster Madan Mohan Roy and forced to kneel for over an hour when he regained consciousness. He is now in hospital.																								Doctors said Minhajuls injuries are serious. His fault was missing classes for four days. When he resumed school on Saturday armed with a letter from his father saying that he had taken ill, the class teacher asked him to produce a medical certificate. Minhajul was taken to Roy when he failed to do so. 																								Roy justified the punishment saying he was beaten for the sake of discipline. Ohidul took his son to the police station but the officer refused to lodge a complaint.

 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Clearing test must for candidates
 OUR LEGAL REPORTERCalcutta, March 29: The high court today upheld the higher secondary councils decision to make it mandatory for an HS candidate to pass the test exam conducted by an educational institution before the finals. 																								The court dismissed petitions by students challenging the councils decision saying their contention was ultra vires. 																								In their petition, the students also argued that there are no uniform rules regarding promotion from Class XI to XII. They said students should be allowed to sit for the final examinations without taking the test if they have been promoted to Class XII. 																								Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta said the schools have a right to test the merit of a candidate before clearing him or her for the finals. 																								In a separate case, a trial court had asked a school in an interim order to allow a candidate to sit for the HS examinations after she failed in the test. 																								The councils lawyer said a high court division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee today stayed the trial court order.

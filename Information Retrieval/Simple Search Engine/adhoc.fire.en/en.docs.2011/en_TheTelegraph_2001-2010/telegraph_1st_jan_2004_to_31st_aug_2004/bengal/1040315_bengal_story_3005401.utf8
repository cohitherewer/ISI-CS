The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Students shut down Visva-Bharati office
 OUR CORRESPONDENTSantiniketan, March 14: Visva-Bharati was on the boil this morning when angry students union members put the universitys administrative office under lock and key.																								Sunday in Santiniketan, the idyllic university town and Rabindranath Tagores peace haven, is like any other working day.																								Teachers and employees at work were taken aback by the students protesting against the authorities alleged indifference towards their demands, which included introduction of MA courses in Japanese and drama and coaching classes for the national and state-level eligibility tests for lecturership aspirants. 																								The teachers and office employees tried in vain to resist the students who stormed Vidya Bhavan, the arts faculty, and asked officials to vacate it. The employees who protested against the students audacity walked out when they threatened to lock them inside. The union later said it would close down all the faculties if the university failed to address their grievances. 																								We will shut down Siksha Bhavan (the science faculty) if the authorities continue to ignore our demands, union president Bhramar Bhandari said. He added that a committee headed by vice-chancellor Sujit K. Basu was formed to look into the demands but nothing was done. 																								The authorities had apparently said that the coaching classes would begin from March. Renovation of hostels and computerisation of all departments were also on the list of demands. Bhandari said: We have every right to protest if the authorities do not keep their promises. 																								He promised that classes would not be stalled because of the agitation. We will not prevent students from attending their classes but stall the administrative work, Bhandari said.																								Registrar Sunil Sarkar dismissed the allegations. We have introduced campus interview as demanded by the students. Interviews were held only two days ago and some of the students got jobs. The other demands are under consideration, he said.

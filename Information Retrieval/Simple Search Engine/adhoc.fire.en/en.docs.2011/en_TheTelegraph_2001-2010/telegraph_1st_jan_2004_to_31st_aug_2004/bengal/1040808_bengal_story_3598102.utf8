The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Power cuts continue 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Aug. 7: Calcutta and its suburbs experienced dark spells for the second consecutive day as the power shortfall rose to 144 MW in the evening peak hours. The power cuts ranged from one to two hours on an average. 																								The situation in the districts was worse with the deficit rising to 216 MW. 																								Prolonged power cuts began on Friday after two generating units, one each at the CESCs Budge Budge plant and the National Thermal Power Corporations plant in Farakka, collapsed following technical snags.																								Power department sources said the situation is not likely to normalise before Monday. While the Budge Budge unit is expected to start generating from Sunday, the Farakka unit is not expected to be back in stream before Monday.

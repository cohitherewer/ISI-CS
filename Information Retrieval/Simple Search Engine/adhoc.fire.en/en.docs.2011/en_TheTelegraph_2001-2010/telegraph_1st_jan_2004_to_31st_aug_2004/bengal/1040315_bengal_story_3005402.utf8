The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Bloodstains remain
 OUR CORRESPONDENTBanglarjhar, March 14: A wall peppered with bullets, a pair of bloodstained slippers and scattered glass from broken soft-drink bottles and all the gore in front of a shuttered-down shop are the only evidence of the terror unleashed by the KLO militants yesterday.																								No one knows when the shop will reopen. Nitaipada Das, who was injured in yesterdays attack, is battling death in the sadar hospital. The militants bullets claimed his 21-year-old son, Bishnupada, who had gone to the shop to assist his father.																								Nitaipadas wife, Kunti, has not been able to come to terms with the loss. Too shocked even to shed tears, she has only one question. What did my son do to deserve this? Ask the killers why him.																								She fears for her husband, who has not been told about their sons death. He had so many plans for Bishnu.																								Bishnu, as he was popularly known, was the typical neighbourhood good samaritan.																								Deepak Sarkar was another innocent casualty claimed by the militants indiscriminate firing. His mother had fainted when the police arrived at their door. His sister continued to stare blankly at the wall even after they left. Nothing their neighbours did brought Deepaks mother to full consciousness or his sister out of her trance. 																								We thought we had seen the last of these rebels when the army brought them to their knees. But they are hitting back. I can only feel for the families that lost their members to the rebels guns, said Manoranjan Sarkar, a neighbour.

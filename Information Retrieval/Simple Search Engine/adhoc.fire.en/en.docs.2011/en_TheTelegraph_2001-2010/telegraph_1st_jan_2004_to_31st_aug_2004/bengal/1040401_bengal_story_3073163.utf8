 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Loopholes irk CBI
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND PRONAB MONDAL 																								Santiniketan, March 31: The CBI sleuths who arrived here to take over investigations into the Tagore memorabilia heist have detected several loose ends in the week-long probe by the state administration. 																								Loopholes in the probe by the district law-enforcing agencies, who were in charge for a few hours before the CID took over, have complicated things for the CBI. 																								A few mistakes are glaring and it is definitely not expected. We will have to work extra-hard to cover the mistakes and come up with results in quick time, a senior CBI official at Nizam Palace said on phone. 																								The bureau has listed a few flaws and reasons why investigation will now be more difficult.  Sniffer dogs were not pressed in immediately after detection of the crime. Since local operatives are prime suspects, sniffer dogs could have helped the police throw up some leads. A dog squad came, but only to make sure things were safe for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visit.  The collection of fingerprints could have been better. Fingerprints of policemen seem to have smudged many of the suspect prints in the museum. The CBI has to sift through the policemens fingerprints and eliminate them. The absence of a computerised system has forced the CID to wait for results of the manual matching process, which is tedious and can be misleading.  The police and the CID have detained several suspects whose details are not there in the crime record book. There was no prior intelligence available with the local police. Many criminals from places like Tiljala and Canning  and even Bangladesh  have poured into Bolpur, which has been described as a soft target. Again, there was no information about them or records. All information should have been computerised by now for quick investigation, but very little information is available on the computer.																								On Thursday, the CBI team is expected to meet senior police officials and take over the remaining files from the CID and the local police. 																								 At a meeting of senior officers at the CBI headquarters in New Delhi, it was decided to approach the Interpol for information on international gangs involved in antique smuggling. They also felt Interpol member countries should be alerted. 																								The forces manning exit and entry routes of the areas bordering Bengal have been alerted so that the loot is not smuggled to countries like Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, officials said.

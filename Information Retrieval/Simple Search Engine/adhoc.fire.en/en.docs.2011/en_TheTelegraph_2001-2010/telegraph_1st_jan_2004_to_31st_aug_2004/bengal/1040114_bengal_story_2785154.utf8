 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Mamata Kala Patthar
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Jan. 13: Mamata Banerjee today invited director Sandip Ray to film the lives of coal mine workers.																								Speaking at a programme at Harish Park in Bhowanipore, the new Union coal and mines minister promised Ray, who was on the dais, cooperation if he ever chose to shoot inside a coal mine.																								After Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Kala Patthar in the 1970s, there has not been any film on the miners and their lives. I invite Sandip Ray to shoot a film on the coal mines and the everyday struggle of the workers, said Mamata. But earlier in the programme, Ray had said his next film would be based on a Feluda story. 																								At the Trinamul Congress office in Topsia in the evening, Mamata reacted sharply to state CPM secretary Anil Biswas remark that she would not be able to fulfil the promises made three days after taking charge of the ministry and that her sops were pre-poll gimmicks. Among other things, Mamata had said no coal mine would be closed and there will be no retrenchment. 																								The decision was made after extensive meetings with the officials and the trade unions. It does not matter what the CPM says because they dont understand what is going on, Mamata said today.

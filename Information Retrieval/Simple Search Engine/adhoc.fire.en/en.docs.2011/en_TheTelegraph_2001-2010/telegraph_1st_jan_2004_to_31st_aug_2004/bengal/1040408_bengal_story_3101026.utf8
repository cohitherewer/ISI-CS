 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 HC bail blow to Adhir relative 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, April 7: Calcutta High Court today rejected the anticipatory bail plea of a close aide and relative of Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury and said Murshidabad police were free to proceed against him over the murder of a CPM leader. 																								Satyen Chowdhury came under the scanner after the killing of Ashraf Ali at Harihar Para market two months ago. 																								While setting aside the bail order of a sessions judge, the court said: The petitioner has violated the order of the sessions judge by not attending his court during the stipulated period. The judge has asked him to appear 30 days after granting bail. 																								Opposing the bail plea, public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah said Ashrafs murder was planned by Congress supporters. Ashraf was very popular in Harihar Para and under his leadership, the CPM was regaining power. Unable to bear it, Congress workers owing allegiance to Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury masterminded the murder, he claimed. 																								The district in which the Congress is engaged in a fierce turf war with the CPM seemed headed for another bloodbath, like the one before the last panchayat elections, with Jamirul Sheikh, 20, a Congress worker from Nabagram being hacked to death last night, allegedly by CPM activists. District superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh said two persons have been arrested. 																								Locals stumbled upon Sheikhs mutilated body in the fields this morning. The deceaseds father alleged that CPM goons had kidnapped his son.

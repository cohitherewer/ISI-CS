 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Suicide after two-year wait for pension
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, April 4: Nalini Ranjan Bhattacharya, a former municipal employee who did not get his retirement benefits in two years, hanged himself from the ceiling of his bedroom yesterday. 																								He left behind an ailing wife and an 11-year-old mentally challenged son. 																								In death, the active CPM member has put the local leadership in a spot. The party shielded the family from media glare today. No reporter was allowed into the house.																								Suresh Mondal, the chairman of Burdwan municipality, admitted that Bhattacharya was not paid the dues. As a result, he was suffering from financial problems. Last week he withdrew Rs 10,000 from his account for the treatment of his wife, who is suffering from cardiac problems. However, we cannot say for sure that his death has anything to do with this, Mondal said.																								Bhattacharya retired from the assessment department in 2001. Tapan Mukherjee, a colleague and union secretary, said he was to receive Rs 1.5 lakh as gratuity but got 15,000. He had to maintain family with Rs 3,000. 																								Bhattacharyas brother Biswabandhu said: I am also a party member. How can we complain against a municipality run by the Left Front?

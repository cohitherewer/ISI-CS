The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Other reasons turn garden killer
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 12: The government has denied in the Supreme Court deaths due to starvation in the tea gardens of north Bengal.																								A report attached to its affidavit filed in court says that last year, there were 200 deaths in the gardens  5 of malaria, 16 of diarrhoea and the rest of other reasons. 																								The report does not clarify what other reasons mean. It was prepared on the basis of data obtained from 10 tea gardens, which had been locked out or were abandoned. 																								A parallel study of the toll by an NGO, Right to Food and Work  West Bengal Network, shows an alarming number of starvation deaths. We had conducted a survey in Jalpaiguri and found that there were about 1,000 deaths in the last three months, said Swapan Ganguly, a member of the organisation.																								The official report itself has shown a startling number of deaths in the past two years. Can the government explain the rise in toll? The community of tea garden workers has not faced any natural calamity in these two years. What can be the reason behind the deaths but starvation? asked Ganguly.																								Convener of the NGO Chittaranjan Chattopadhyay said the workers were not paid wages and provident fund dues by the garden owners who shut down. The families of the workers who lost their jobs are surviving on Rs 50 a month per head, he said. 																								Electric supply cables were snapped. Water supply, too, was affected and the sick do not have a place to go as the healthcare units are only partially functioning. These workers stay in the gardens, miles away from the nearest town, Chattopadhyay said.

 OUR BUREAU 																								Santiniketan, April 7: Visva-Bharati authorities have submitted a list of possible suspects from among former employees who could have played a role in the Nobel heist. 																								In a secret meeting with the CID, the authorities had given the names of three persons  a former professor, a Left party member and associate of Pradip Bauri, and a former official  for thorough investigation. 																								The names have been handed over to the CBI by the state agency for a thorough probe and interrogation of the three. During a meeting with the CBI today, the university again furnished all relevant details about the trio.																								Without giving details of the interaction, vice-chancellor Sujit Basu said: We have told the CBI about the possible reasons of the theft. 																								A senior varsity official and member of the internal probe committee said the professor, who was forced to quit two years ago for getting involved in controversies, had recently threatened the administration with serious repercussions. 																								The professor, who had got embroiled in a molestation case and theft of sandalwood trees from the campus, is one of the key suspects. We have told the CBI and the CID that this person has the habit of mysteriously disappearing from Santiniketan. He also disappeared from Santiniketan a day before the Nobel medal was stolen and he was again seen here last week after the theft was detected, the official said. 																								The second person named, a member of a Left party and a close associate of Pradip Bauri, still the top suspect according to the CID, had been recently hauled up for entering the campus without permission. CBI officials said he had predicted in private that something big would happen in March that would embarrass VB and the world.																								The third person under the CBI scanner is a former senior official, who was allegedly involved in the disappearance of portions of a rare Tagore manuscript from the archives. 																								The manuscript was never found and the official, who was embarrassed, had sworn revenge by engineering something big, a CBI official said.

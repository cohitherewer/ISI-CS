The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Bureau clean chit to top suspect
 PRONAB MONDAL AND SOUMI BHATTACHARYA Santiniketan, April 5: Seventy-two  hours after the CID announced that the fingerprints of Pradip  Bauri, a contract labourer, matched with those found at  Rabindranath Memorial Museum, the CBI said the states premier  investigating agency got it all wrong.																								Results of a more comprehensive computerised test conducted by the CBI showed that the fingerprints on the glass case containing Mrinalini Devis Baluchari sari were not Bauris. After a thorough computerised test, the report has come negative. There is absolutely no similarity between Bauris fingerprints and the samples collected from the museum. Right now, he is not suspect number one, a senior CBI official told The Telegraph.																								However, just to make sure, a CBI official left for the city to get hold of the chance prints of Bauri collected from the museum by the CID and get it re-examined. The officer will also discuss the case with officials of the Fingerprints Bureau in the city, where the CID carried out the test. He will be back tomorrow with the CIDs version, the CBI official said.																								Senior CID officials today said there is the possibility of an error cropping up here and there. In the absence of computers, the CID had to manually check the fingerprints. 																								Bauri did not crack in the face of sustained grilling by top CID officials, even as they told Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee during his Santiniketan visit that they had achieved the first breakthrough.																								Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Sujit Kumar Basu today requested the Union home ministry to deploy jawans of the Central Industrial Security Force to guard the campus till a panel looking into the varsitys security submitted its report.

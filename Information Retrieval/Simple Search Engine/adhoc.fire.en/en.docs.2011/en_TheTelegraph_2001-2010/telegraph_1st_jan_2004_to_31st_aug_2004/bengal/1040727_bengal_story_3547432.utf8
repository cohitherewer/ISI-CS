 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 29 years on, teacher turns peon
 OUR LEGAL REPORTERCalcutta, July 26: The Nadia district magistrate sent an officer on Saturday to hand a letter to Shyama Prasad Majumdar appointing him cycle peon at a rural library, 29 years after he started as a teacher.																								The high court had said district magistrate Krishna Gupta would not get salary till he appointed Majumdar, who has been locked a legal battle since 1978.																								In 1975, I joined as a teacher in a pathshala set up by the state government under its pilot project at Rupdaha under Kotwali police station. The government later decided to turn the school into a library and asked me to obtain a librarians certificate. Accordingly, I completed a librarianship course in 1978. But when the Left Front came to power, it decided to appoint another person as librarian at Rupdaha Rural Library, the 48-year-old Majumdar said.																								He moved the high court, where his lawyer argued that he may be appointed in any of the rural libraries of the district. The court ordered the Nadia authorities to induct Majumdar.																								In 2002, the district authorities moved court again, saying there was no vacancy in any rural library. When told to give an option, the authorities said Majumdar could be appointed a cycle peon. The judge asked them to give him the job immediately.																								But, the court order was not carried out and Majumdar moved a contempt case.																								Now, I will claim his arrears since 1978. But who will pay for the trouble my client had to face for the past 26 years? his lawyer asked. 																								Majumdar joined the library today.

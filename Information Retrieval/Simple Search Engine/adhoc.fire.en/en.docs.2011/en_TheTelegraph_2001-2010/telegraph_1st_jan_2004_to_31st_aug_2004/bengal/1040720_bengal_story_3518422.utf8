The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Leaders slug it out, survivors amp; kin bear
 DEBARATI AGARWALA Relatives of the injured wait for updates on their condition at the district hospital. Pictures by Surajit Roy 																								Malda, July 19: They were not spared, even in death. 																								A free for all reigned at Malda District Hospital as CPM and Congress leaders quarrelled over the compensation for the next of kin of the dead they wanted to demand, oblivious of the helpless relatives of survivors running pillar to post for blood and medicines. 																								Trouble started around 3 pm. Zilla parishad sabhadhipati, Congress leader Gautam Chakrabarty seized the microphone at a camp set up by an NGO on the hospital premises and demanded that the chief minister announce Rs 2 lakh as compensation for the families of those killed in the accident. He claimed Rs 50,000 for the injured. 																								CPM leaders alleged that Chakrabarty misused the public address system in declaring that the cremation expenses would be borne by the parishad, which is ruled by a Trinamul Congress-BJP-Congress alliance.																								Unable to bear politicisation of the situation, CPM councillor of Englishbazar municipality Dolon Chaki protested. Indrojit Mitra and Biswanath Ghosh, two other CPM leaders, joined him. Who are you to fax a message to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee? Has your leader A.B.A.Ghani Khan Chowdhury come forward? Dont make this a political issue. This is not the time, shouted Chaki. 																								He claimed that while CPM leaders were helping the relatives of victims procure blood and other necessities, the Congress leaders were busy looking for political mileage. 																								The CPM leaders demanded an apology from Chakrabarty. 																								The efforts of municipality chairman and Trinamul leader Krishnendu Chowdhury to calm things proved futile. Peace prevailed after Chakrabarty said over the same public address system: I beg to be excused if I have hurt anybody. He was misunderstood, Chakrabarty said later.

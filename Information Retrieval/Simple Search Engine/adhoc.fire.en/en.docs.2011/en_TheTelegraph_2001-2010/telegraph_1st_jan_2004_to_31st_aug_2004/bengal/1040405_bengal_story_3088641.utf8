 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Probe into cash for school job
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 4: School education minister Kanti Biswas has ordered a probe into an incident in which the headmaster of a Howrah high school forced an assistant teacher to give him Rs 30,000 for the post.																								Narayan Chandra Mandal, who was appointed by the School Service Commission, joined Kushberia Mouza Baneswar Sikshalaya in Amta as an assistant teacher on February 12, 2001. He was asked to cough up the money by headmaster Benoy Kumar Ghosh. Mandal even got a receipt for the amount he paid.																								Mandal was carrying out his duty without problems. But recently, the headmaster asked him to return the receipt. When he refused, Ghosh became furious.																								Sensing trouble, Mandal wrote to Biswas. 																								I dont know why Mandal gave the money to the headmaster as he was selected by the commission. I also dont understand why the headmaster demanded the sum from the teacher. To me, both giving and accepting bribe is a crime and I have ordered an inquiry into the incident. I want to know the details of the case, Biswas said.																								The incident is being considered an eye-opener. This is because the department has for the past few months been receiving unconfirmed reports against some headmasters and members of school managing committees demanding money from teachers selected by the commission.																								The government had set up the commission in 1997 to stop corruption in recruitment of teachers by the school managing committees. Before the commission was set up, most of the committees used to recruit teachers after collecting huge sums from aspirants.																								But the practice of collecting money illegally from the newly appointed teachers persists among a section of school managing committees and headmasters. We had unconfirmed reports in this regard, but Mandals case has opened our eyes to the fact. We are determined to stop such corrupt practices, said an official of the school education department.																								The commission, too, is alarmed over the increasing number of cases in which the institutions are ignoring its recommendations regarding appointment of teachers.																								The schools that have been flouting the commissions rules by not appointing teachers recommended by it are also approaching courts to stall these appointments. 																								During 2002-03, 848 cases were registered against the commission. In most of these cases, the schools had refused to go by the commissions recommendations regarding recruitment of teachers. 																								During 2003-04, the number of court cases went up to 1,088, which indicates that the tendency of ignoring the commissions recommendations has increased.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTERDasgupta amp; Co MetroEverest HouseMohta HouseFirposBook FairFamous fires: Several landmarks in the city have been ravaged in the past few years, many others got a scare. File pictures Calcutta, Aug. 7: The high court has asked the department of fire and emergency to set fresh safety norms for new buildings and apartments in the city.The department was also told to take special measures to tackle fire hazards in educational institutions in the city and its neighbourhood.																								Delivering the directive yesterday, Justice Amitava Lala said: The city is rapidly turning into a concrete jungle. The existing norms of building construction need to be revised to ensure safety and security of people visiting public establishments. Moreover, special measures have to be taken for safety of children in educational institutions. 																								The unused and age-old underground pipelines also need to be cleaned regularly to combat fire hazards in the high-rises, Justice Lala said. Any fire can be easily tackled if these pipelines are cleaned properly...																								Disposing of a petition filed by Kanak Jain, a resident of Sarat Bose Road, Justice Lala called the director of the West Bengal Fire Service  now called the fire and emergency department  to meet him in court. 																								Accordingly, the director appeared yesterday and told the judge about the existing rules governing construction in the city. There should be a reservoir with a capacity of 2,000 litres in a five-storeyed building in the city. In case of buildings with more than five floors, the reservoir should store about 5,000 litres of water, the director said.																								The judge also said that the norms for granting permission for new building were not sufficient. To provide more security to city dwellers, the conditions should be revised further, Justice Lala observed. 																								The petitioner had approached the court after Calcutta Municipal Corporation and West Bengal Fire Service refused to allow her to construct the sixth and seventh floors of her building in south Calcutta as she failed to comply with the norms regarding the size of the reservoir and its capacity. 																								The petitioners counsel argued before the court that there should be separate norms for buildings that had more than five storeys. He felt that the rules concerning the size and capacity of a reservoir could not be applied to, say, the sixth or the 10th floor of a multi-storeyed building.

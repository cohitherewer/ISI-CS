 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Doctors at fair, patients despair 
 							 - Health suffers most as politics hots up OUR CORRESPONDENT Malda, Feb. 12: As politicians  spoke on extending healthcare to remote pockets of the district  at the inaugural ceremony of a Centre-sponsored health fair,  organised on the premises of the subdivisional hospital  here today, the out-patient department remained without  a doctor till noon. 																								Most doctors were busy a few yards away, listening to Congress MP A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury and zilla parishad sabhadhipati Gautam Chakraborty talking about reaching medical help to rural corners, and did not return till noon when many of the patients had left after having waited for hours.																								Irate patients, who had turned up early in the morning, shouted slogans against the doctors for staying away from their duty and demanded a refund of the check-up fee. 																								Some patients, who went to the fair after being told by some junior nurses that the doctors would check them after the inauguration ceremony, returned without luck.																								The wait continued till noon when district magistrate Ashok Bala was informed about trouble at the OPD. 																								As Bala asked his deputy Amitava Sengupta to inquire into the incident, the doctors scurried to open the doors of the department. By then, most patients had gone home. 																								This should not have happened. I have asked the deputy magistrate to submit a report on the incident. We will certainly act against the guilty, Bala said later.																								According to the patients, the OPD had remained without doctors from 9 am till 12 noon. 																								At 11, the scheduled time for the inauguration of the fair, we were told to go to the fair. When we went there the inauguration ceremony had not yet started. We had to return as most of the doctors and para-medics were either busy listening to the speeches or watching cultural programmes being held there, said Noor Alam, 42, who was suffering from severe stomach cramp and had to wait for almost five hours.																								Chhabilal Chowdhury, who had blood dysentery, returned home without a check-up. Why were we issued tickets? she asked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Showcause on negligent doctors 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Burdwan, June 11: A top medical officer today pulled up the chief of the Katwa sub-divisional hospital for poor attendance during a surprise visit and showcaused four doctors against whom there were past complaints. 																								Doctors Somnath Ghosh, Milon Modak, Subrata Roy and Gopeswar Mukherjee were charged with dereliction of duty, said director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee. We have showcaused the four doctors and sought replies within a fortnight. After getting the replies, we will decide on the punishment, he added. 																								Chatterjee was displeased with hospital superintendent Goutam Ghosh for the thin attendance when he arrived without intimation this morning. 																								Around 11 am, he found only about half of the doctors and other employees present. According to the hospital record, 21 staff members were present against a total strength of 36. 																								An agitated Chatterjee headed straight for the hospital superintendents office and met Ghosh. He sent for the attendance register and marked those not present absent. 																								Accompanied by Ghosh, he went on a round of the hospital wards and scrutinised the treatment charts of the patients. 																								Then he turned his attention on the four doctors  all from Calcutta  against whom there were earlier complaints of negligence and dereliction of duty and met them separately. 																								He admonished them for being absent from work frequently and not adhering to the duty roster. They spent most of the time in Calcutta though quarters have been allotted in Katwa. 																								The four accused said they would send their replies within a fortnight. The allegations against us are not true. We have explained our position to the authorities, said Somnath Ghosh.																								Hospital sources said the superintendent had served showcause notices on Ghosh and Milon Modak on similar grounds this February. The two doctors had not replied to the notices and their pay was blocked. Later they apologised and the matter was settled amicably, an official said. 																								Chatterjee, who has been paying surprise visits to the district hospitals for some time, said he would keep an eye on the attendance of doctors.

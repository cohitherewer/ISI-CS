				 																																	Calcutta, June 17: Satyabrata Dutta, Satyada to those who flocked to his tutorials, apparently hanged himself to death this evening.				 																																	His wife and son, who had gone shopping, returned home at Nazirbagan in Kasba and found the bedroom door locked. When there was no response to repeated knocks, neighbours broke the door open and found Dutta, 52, hanging. 				 																																	Police had interrogated him during the Madhyamik paper leak scam in 1997. What began as a coaching centre on Mirzapur Street two decades ago grew into a chain. Dutta founded Central Calcutta Correspondence College and his suggested questions, from secondary to university level, grew in demand. The police said Swapna was his fourth wife and no suicide note was found on him.				 																																	Calcutta: The spiders which bit many in the past fortnight in Burdwan and East Midnapore were not Tarantulas. The government said on Thursday experts at the School of Tropical Medicine had opined that they were not very poisonous. However, the exact species of the insect is still not clear.				 																																	Calcutta: The first district-level disaster management committee will be set up in South 24-Parganas. The panel will find ways to repair breaches in embankments and suggest means to combat natural calamity. 				 																																	Calcutta: The government has constituted a Sate-level Advisory Committee for Minorities Welfare headed by the chief minister that will offer advice on minority development.

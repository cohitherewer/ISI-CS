 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 CPM points at poll sabotage 
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								Calcutta, June 5: Sabotage by a section of party workers and a formidable Congress election machinery, led by stalwart Adhir Chowdhury, are being attributed to the CPMs defeat in last months Lok Sabha elections in Murshidabad.																								Despite putting up one of their best performances in Parliament in years, the ruling Left Front lost all the three Lok Sabha seats to the Congress in Murshidabad.																								A report, being prepared by CPM state secretary Anil Biswas, on the partys electoral reverses in the district will be placed before the state committee in its two-day meet beginning June 12. CPM sources said central committee member Shyamal Chakraborty, who is overseeing the party affairs in Murshidabad, visited the district last week to assess the reasons behind the poll debacle. 																								The state CPM leadership, also summoned former zilla parishad sabhadhipati and sitting MLA from Nabagram, Nripen Chowdhury, to the partys Alimuddin Street headquarters on Friday to seek an explanation on the partys electoral rout. 																								Our party members cannot evade responsibility for the poll debacle in Murshidabad, Nripen Chowdhury is learnt to have told the top brass, also admitting that a section of party workers did not work hard for the CPM nominees and indirectly helped rival Congress candidates to sail through. Moreover, said Nripen Chowdhury, a considerable number of party workers had failed to cope with Congress MP Adhir Chowdhurys well-knit organisation in the district. 																								Lack of support from the Muslim community, which constitutes a large part of the districts electorate, is also being viewed as a reason for the Fronts debacle. Referring to a book written by former CPM MP Mainul Hassan that calls for reforms in the Muslim society, he claimed that Adhir had bagged the minority voters by misinterpreting the contents of Hassans book.																								Nripen Chowdhury, however, conceded that the CPMs organisational network could not match the clout wielded by Adhir Chowdhury in Murshidabad. 																								Adhir has cultivated a personal rapport with all local clubs and has considerable influence over them. While he stands by the villagers, particularly the poor, whenever they face crisis, many of our district leaders do not even have the patience to listen to the common people. We have to change our attitude to win the confidence of the masses, the Alimuddin Street bosses were told.

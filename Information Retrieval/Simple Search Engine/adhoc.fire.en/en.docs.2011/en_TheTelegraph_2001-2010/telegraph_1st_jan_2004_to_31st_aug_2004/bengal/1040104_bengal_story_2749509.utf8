The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 No end to jute strike deadlock 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Jan. 3: The indefinite strike in the states jute industry continued as a tripartite effort by labour minister Mohammad Amin today failed to resolve the impasse between the mill owners and the trade unions. 																								Representatives of the Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA), the body of the mill owners, insisted on linking a dearness allowance payment to productivity, a move the trade unions vehemently oppose. 																								As many as 19 trade unions representing a total workforce of over two lakh workers launched the indefinite strike in 59 jute mills in the state on December 29. Their demands include payment of increased dearness allowance since the last industry-wise agreement was reached in February 2002. 																								After nearly five hours of negotiations, Amin said the strike will continue as it was not possible to find a meeting ground between the jute mill owners and the trade union leaders. 																								Nevertheless, Amin was hopeful the IJMA would soften its stand during another round of conciliation meeting next week. 																								Arun Bajoria, a leading jute industrialist, said after the meeting that the issues related to productivity-linked wages, including dearness allowance, have to be sorted out once and for all. 																								I am not willing to take chances and give in to the demand of the trade union leaders unconditionally. What happens if the labourers at the mills fail to live up to their commitment? So we have to have some levers, said Bajoria, reacting to Amins conciliatory draft. 																								Gobind Sarda, another leading jute entrepreneur, Nirmal Pujara, a senior professional in the industry, and several other owners agreed with Bajoria.

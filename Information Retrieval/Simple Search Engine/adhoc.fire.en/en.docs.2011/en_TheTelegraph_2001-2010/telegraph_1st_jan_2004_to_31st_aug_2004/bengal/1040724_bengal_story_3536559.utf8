 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Sen brings Great Eastern back on the table
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 23: The government is hopeful about securing DFID funds that will help it offer voluntary retirement schemes to employees of sick public sector units, including the 150-year-old Great Eastern Hotel.																								If the British agency does provide the financial support to the state, the money may be channelled to trim the ailing hotels 500-plus workforce by offering a VRS. 																								After a meeting with DFID officials this afternoon, industries minister Nirupam Sen sounded positive about the governments bid to privatise Great Eastern. All its earlier efforts to do so in the past decade had come a cropper. 																								The (successful) bidder (for the hotel) will have to be a company having long experience in the industry. We will evaluate the status of their finances, background and previous performance, Sen said. 																								The governments condition to allow Great Easterns takeover is that it has to be fashioned into a heritage hotel. 																								The government had earlier appointed a consortium of consultants  PricewaterhouseCoopers, CB Richard Ellis and a Mumbai-based firm  to float global tenders and evaluate bids for Great Eastern. But the employees unions  the CPMs labour arm, Citu, and the Congress-affiliated Intuc  had resisted efforts to restructure it. 																								The Intuc-affiliated union will oppose the move to introduce the VRS. We shall resist it tooth and nail, said a union spokesman.

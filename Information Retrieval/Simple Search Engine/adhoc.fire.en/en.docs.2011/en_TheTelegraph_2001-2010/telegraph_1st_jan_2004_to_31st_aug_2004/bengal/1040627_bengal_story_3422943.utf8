The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Weak winds smother rain hope 
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, June 26: The sweltering heat after a spell of showers is likely to continue for at least another week as the moisture-laden monsoon wind is yet to enter Gangetic West Bengal from neighbouring Jharkhand. 																								Met officials added that no depression has formed over the Bay of Bengal and, as a result, there is not much possibility of heavy showers at the moment. 																								We hope a depression will form over the Bay of Bengal over the next few days, said K.K. Chakraborty, director of the Alipore weather office. 																								Officials said the monsoon wind is currently very weak and will take another week to gain strength, needed to bring fresh rain. But they offered the hope of isolated showers in Calcutta if the heat continued. 																								The officials pointed out that distress due to lack of rain has been aggravated by high humidity varying between 93 and 99 per cent. The temperature will continue to run two to three degrees above normal if the city does not experience rain in the coming week. 																								The south-west monsoon wind, which blew from Bihar in the second week of June, reached north Bengal on time, bringing sufficient rain. But the same wind, supposed to enter south Bengal through Jharkhand, has remained weak. 																								This kind of long hot spell during monsoon is somewhat unusual. We are yet to experience a spell of heavy and continuous rain which generally marks the onset of monsoon, said Chakraborty.

 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Mishap after Holi splash
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 8: Holi turned into a nightmare for a group of tourists from Contai when the trekker in which they were travelling overturned yesterday afternoon as youths splashed colour into the drivers eyes.																								The tourists were on their way back from Digha when the youths tried to stop their car, witnesses said. The driver turned the vehicle around, but the youths hurled balloons, which hit the driver in his eyes and he lost control of the car, said Anupam Das, a friend of 23-year-old Satyajit Pramanik, who was among the injured.																								Residents immediately rushed to the spot and rescued the victims. Pramanik and 74-year-old Banbihari Patra were rushed to Bell Vue Clinic here. Doctors detected a rib fracture on Patra and multiple injuries on Pramanik. 																								The young man (Pramanik) was in a very bad state with injuries sustained in his ears, stomach, intestine and an internal haemorrhage, apart from a femur bone fracture. We operated on him, but he is still on a ventilator, critical care specialist Dr Sourav Koley said. Rape protest in House																								Congress legislators today staged a walkout from the Assembly for half an hour as a mark of protest against yesterdays gangrape in Burdwan.																								Five women living on the outskirts of Putunda village were raped on Saturday when eight Holi revellers barged into their houses.																								The incidents are very unfortunate. Police have already arrested eight persons in connection with the Burdwan gangrape, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at the Assembly lobby.

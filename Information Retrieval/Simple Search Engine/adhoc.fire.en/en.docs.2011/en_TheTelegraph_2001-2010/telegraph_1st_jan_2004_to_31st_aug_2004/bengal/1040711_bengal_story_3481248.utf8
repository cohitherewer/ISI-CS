 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Dilip headed for SSKM 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Bolpur, July 10: A day after bail was again denied to former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Dilip Sinha, he fell ill in Bolpur sub-divisional jail. He has been referred to SSKM hospital in Calcutta. 																								Sinha, who was arrested in connection with the recruitment of a lecturer on the basis of fake documents, was produced yesterday before the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court here and remanded in judicial custody till July 21. 																								He was put in police custody for two days on July 7 after his release from SSKM hospital. Sinha, who recently underwent a bypass surgery, was admitted there after his arrest. 																								When Sinha complained of chest pain late last night, policemen took him to the sub-divisional hospital after a medical check-up in the jail. A five-member medical team, including hospital superintendent Manabendra Ghosh, is treating Sinha. 																								We have examined Sinha and carried out all tests required. He has been referred to the SSKM hospital for better treatment, Ghosh said. 																								Bolpur sub-divisional police officer Rabindranath Sarkar said: We are making necessary arrangements to shift Sinha from here.

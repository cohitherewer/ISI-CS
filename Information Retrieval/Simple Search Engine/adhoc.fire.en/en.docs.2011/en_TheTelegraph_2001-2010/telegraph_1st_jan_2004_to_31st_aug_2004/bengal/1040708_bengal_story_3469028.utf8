The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Flash strike by IOC tankers 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 7: Calcutta and its suburbs are in the grip of a fuel scare after a flash strike by transporters today in Indian Oil Corporations Maurigram terminal. 																								An IOC spokesperson said supply to petrol pumps here has been disrupted and if the strike continues for one more day, the pumps would dry up. 																								The biggest crisis will be for the airlines as the Maurigram terminal caters to the entire aviation fuel need of Calcutta airport, he said. 																								Ajit Das, secretary of the West Bengal Transporters Association, said it has called a one-day all-Bengal strike tomorrow to protest against the IOCs dilly-dally over renewing their contract that expired in October 2002.																								He claimed the IOC is unilaterally curtailing the supply quota of the tanker owners to bring in new transporters. 																								The spokesperson said: It is because of the highhandedness of the WBTA that a solution has become very remote. 																								The company, which needs about 200 tankers everyday, has floated a tender and proposes to give priority to operators with one tanker. 																								In protest against the clause, the operators today did not provide any truck and prevented the new operators from doing so despite the presence of a police contingent.

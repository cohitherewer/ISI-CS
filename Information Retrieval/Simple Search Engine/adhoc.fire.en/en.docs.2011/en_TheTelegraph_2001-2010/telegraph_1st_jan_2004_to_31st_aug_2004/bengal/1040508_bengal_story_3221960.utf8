 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranaghat (Nadia), May 7: The BJP may be a pariah to Sonia Gandhi but her partys leaders here have apparently forged an alliance with the party.																								A grand alliance of the Trinamul Congress, the BJP and the Congress is said to have thrown its weight behind Nilima Nag, the Nabadwip candidate from Mamata Banerjees party.																								The widow of slain Trinamul leader Samir Nag, Nilima is taking on the CPMs sitting MP Alokesh Das. Three CPM workers were arrested in connection with Nags murder in September.																								Partha Chatterjee, the chairman of the Congress-controlled Ranaghat municipality, today said: We are not bothered about the partys whip against joining hands with Trinamul. It may be an ally of the communal BJP but in Nabadwip, our sole aim is to ensure the CPMs defeat. 																								Chatterjee had just finished a campaign meeting with Mamata at Ranaghat, about 65 km from Calcutta, when he iterated his stand on Sonias whip. 																								Though Shankar Singh, the Congress MLA from Ranaghat (West) and an associate of former state party chief Somen Mitra, stayed away from this mornings rally, he is said to be the mahajot (grand alliance) mastermind. What can I do if Congress rank and file join forces with Mamatas party to ensure the defeat of the CPM nominee? Singh pleaded.																								Trinamul had won the seat in 1999 but the CPM wrested it in the bypoll held after the death of the sitting MP. 																								At the rally, Mamata thanked the Congress leaders for their support to her partys candidate.

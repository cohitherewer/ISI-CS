 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Naxalite war saps BSF 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 A BSF jawan stands guard outside a poll booth in West Midnapore. A file picture																								Krishnagar, Aug. 4: The BSF wants out  of the Naxalite-plagued districts of West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura. They would much rather be doing what they were trained to: patrol international borders. 																								Jawans, peeved with the rising human cost in the low-intensity conflict and a lack of co-ordination with the state police, will submit a memorandum to director-general Ajai Raj Sharma when he visits Nadia later this month. 																								Sharma is aware of the mood in the area, particularly after the Centre suspended the pullout of the BSF from counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir. 																								The BSFs pullout was sanctioned on the recommendations of a Group of Ministers set up after the Kargil intrusions. It had suggested that each force be deployed for the duty it was created for. 																								Sharma plans to meet the jawans and officers for their opinion on a phased pullout from the Naxalite belt. 																								Over the last 15 years, the BSF is dealing with issues like cross-border terrorism while simultaneously maintaining internal security in trouble-prone states. States like West Bengal have also sent troops on such tasks though we have to maintain peace along the porous Indo-Bangladesh border, pointed out R.C. Saxena, the BSF deputy inspector- general. He added that hundreds of personnel have been diverted from Nadia and north Bengal to tackle the Naxalites. 																								The common perception among the ranks is that the BSF should withdraw from all such activities for which it was not built. Our function is to stay cautious along the border, he added.																								The novel vertical interaction between the BSF chief and jawans is a keenly awaited event, the official said. Never before have jawans placed a memorandum before the BSF chief. The issues being raised here are crucial for the entire force, Saxena said. 																								Senior BSF officials in Calcutta said the Central Reserve Police Force was asked to deal with internal security but it reportedly declined.																								Saxena said the force is not sure what reaction the memorandum will elicit, but it would be an opportunity for the BSF to seek reinforcements if the pullout is deferred again.																								The director-general would reconsider the demand for more people in the battalions in place of the people who have been sent to maintain internal security in Kashmir and Manipur and for taking on the Naxalites in Purulia, Midnapore and Bankura, he said.

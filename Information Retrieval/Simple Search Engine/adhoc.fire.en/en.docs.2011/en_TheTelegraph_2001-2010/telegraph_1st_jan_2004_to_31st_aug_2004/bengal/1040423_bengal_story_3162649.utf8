The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 HS papers go missing on train
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, April 22: A fortnight and two days after the higher secondary history examination, an examiner lost a bundle of 80 answer scripts at Sealdah station last night.																								The teacher waiting for a Habra-bound train to leave suddenly discovered that a bag containing the answer scripts had vanished. He went to the government railway police (GRP) at the station.																								The history test was held on April 5. The higher secondary examinations are still in progress and will end on April 26.																								Admitting that the scripts were lost, secretary of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education Dibyendu Chakraborty said: The examiner has submitted a report to the council today. The police have not been able to trace the scripts till tonight.																								He appealed to the students not to panic. The examinees whose answer scripts are lost will not be affected in any way, even if the scripts are not found, Chakraborty said. 																								The council refused to identify the affected students or the institutions they belong to. They would be given the option of either writing the exam again or agreeing to accept an average of the marks in other subjects, the council secretary said.																								The examiner was reportedly carrying 199 answer scripts in two bags. He had collected the scripts from the house of a head-examiner in Calcutta and was seated in a compartment of the home-bound train when he noticed the bag was not there.																								The incident has again embarrassed the council, smarting under the loss of three answer scripts of St Lawrence School students minutes after they wrote their mathematics paper at Tiljala High School. The scripts were recovered off the EM Bypass two days later. 																								Chakraborty today said the council will conduct an inquiry to ascertain the authenticity of the examiners statement. He did not identify the examiner but added that action will be taken against him if the scripts went missing because of his negligence.

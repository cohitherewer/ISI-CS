The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 One more held for Haroa robbery
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Basirhat, Feb. 13: One  more person was arrested today in connection with Wednesday  nights looting of three Sumos packed with families returning  from a wedding reception.																								The five who had been arrested yesterday for the robbery at Haroa in North 24-Parganas were produced in court and have been remanded in police custody.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was asked at Writers Buildings if he would still call Bengal an oasis of peace in the backdrop of the highway robbery. Just name one state in the country that is better placed than ours, Bhattacharjee said.																								Inspector-general of police (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said in Calcutta that the women who were looted had not made any complaint of sexual assault. After interrogation by the sub-divisional police officer and women police officials, the women said though they were verbally assaulted, they had not been molested.																								The police official ruled out medical examinations for the women, saying the question of such tests did not arise as they had not pressed any charges.																								Mukherjee said superintendent of police Basudeb Bag had visited the spot and submitted a detailed report to him. We have so far arrested six persons and are on the lookout for more on the basis of the names five of them have given us, he added. 																								Though the district police are officially investigating the case, the CID usually sends their team in such incidents, Mukherjee said.																								Asked why state highways were not patrolled properly, Mukherjee said it is impossible to patrol all state highways at all points.																								Patrolling is done in crime-prone areas and criminals often take advantage of this and conduct operations at the relatively safer places, the police official said.																								Bag later said at least six of the women among the victims had been interrogated in the presence of women police but none of them had complained about molestation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Fingers at IOC safety apparatus
 OUR BUREAU				 	 A fireman on the IOC premises																								June 4: The government made desperate enquiries about fire-safety arrangements in oil installations near the IOC premises.																								The IOC has such a big installation here  on almost 25 acres  but their fire-safety measures were vastly inadequate, especially when their other tanks contained a variety of highly inflammable petroleum products, including naphtha. They seem to be in a sea and it is obvious that they never apprehended such an incident, fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee told The Telegraph.																								Fire services director B.M. Sen said complaints that IOCs tank 12 did not have proper earthing would be verified. Apparently, this seems to be the reason behind the fire. Once it is out completely, we will conduct an inquiry. But it is a fact that disaster management in the complex should have been better, he said.																								At least 15 lakh litres of petrol was pumped out of tank 12. No IOC official was willing to comment on the charge leveleed against it. We ourselves are not clear about everything, a senior official said.																								The fire brigade asked the Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum installations at Rajbandh to check whether they had proper fire fighting facilities, adequate water reservoirs and other equipment at hand.																								The spokesmen for both companies said they were concerned and checking their fire-security arrangements afresh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Cry to rejig relief norms 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, Aug. 9: Not only for floods and drought, the minister for relief wants the purview of his department extended to other natural calamities like river erosion, landslides and fires. 																								Hafiz Alam Sairani regretted that much of the relief funds are returned as the Centres relief rules, which bind his department, do not cover erosion and landslide, two of the worst calamities affecting Bengal. 																								The concept of distributing relief has undergone a sea change over the past three decades. Today, we follow the same process of reaching out to the flood-hit and the drought-affected only after disaster strikes. There is no provision for relief to be given to others,  he said during a visit here to oversee relief distribution to people affected by Ganga erosion. 																								Last year, my departments budget was Rs 117 crore but we could spend only Rs 36 crore. There were areas where we could have sent relief, but our hands were tied, he said.																								Sairani pointed out that many people were affected by the erosion of the Ganga in Malda last year. 																								Others in the Darjeeling hills were uprooted from their homes and lost cultivable land in landslides. These people could have been helped if the Union government had provisions for us to do so, he said. 																								He also pointed out that many people in villages and small towns were increasingly being affected by water-logging.

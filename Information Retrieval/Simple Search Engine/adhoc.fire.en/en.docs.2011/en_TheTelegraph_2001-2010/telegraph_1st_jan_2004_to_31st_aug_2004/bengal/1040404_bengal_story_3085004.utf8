The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 Blaze at night razes 52 homes
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Islampur, April 3: A devastating fire raged across Nandangach village late last night, rendering about 400 people homeless.																								Though there were no human casualties, about 100 cattleheads kept tied in their sheds perished in the blaze that was triggered in a kitchen and quickly spread across the village, burning to ashes about 52 homes near the border. Five people were injured in the incident.																								Village leaders said the fire destroyed property worth about Rs 4 lakh and Islampur fire service personnel worked the whole night to extinguish the flames. They alleged that relief from the district administration is yet to reach the village where the Border Security Force distributed khhichdi to those displaced.																								Not even a strand of hay of my house has been spared by the flames, septuagenarian Kalimuddin said. Our thatch-roofed house suddenly caught fire last night when we were getting ready for dinner. Even before we could do anything, it engulfed the whole house, leaving us with no option but to run for our lives.																								Officer-in-charge of Islampur fire service J. Ram said: By the time we reached here, the fire had spread since several houses are thatch-roofed. Our problem was aggravated due to scarcity of water. However, we managed to procure water from Nagar river on the Indo-Bangladesh border with which we were able to douse the flames in about five hours.																								Sub-divisional officer Rabindranath Roy said the block-divisional officer had been instructed to prepare a list of the displaced families. The BDO has been asked to prepare a list of displaced families. Based on the details of the list, relief materials will be provided. Efforts are on at a war-footing to provide relief to the people, Roy said.																								Local Forward Bloc leader Kamrool Haq accused the local administration of not being prompt in providing relief. Both the SDO and local panchayat offices were informed as early as possible, but no relief has trickled in, Haq said. District sabhadhipati Jyotsna Rani Singh also visited the site.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 6: Cow dung and garbage would become a source of power in the state with American collaboration.																								The West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency has joined hands with a US government agency to produce non-conventional energy. 																								US-Asia Environmental Partnership Program, based in California, will help electrify rural areas that are yet to be identified. 																								Getting a whiff of the project, entrepreneurs from Burdwan and Nadia have approached the agency for supply to their region. 																								Director of the agency Santipada Ganchowdhury said under the project, methane gas extracted from cow dung and garbage will drive micro-turbines at great speed to generate electricity. This technology is new in our country, Ganchowdhury said. The gas has to be compressed under high pressure to run the micro-turbines.																								Micro-turbines will play an important role in the generation of electricity from bio-gas in future. This method could prove to be the most cost-effective and efficient and could be utilised in rural electrification, he said. The technology, he added, is environment friendly.																								Electricity from bio-gas would be cheaper than power from thermal plants. Consumers will have to initially pay Rs 3 per unit of electricity but this will come down to Rs 2 per unit when we go into mass production, Ganchowdhury said.																								Nadia and Burdwan are leading the race in the districts rush for bio-gas power plants. Ganchowdhury said: The districts have a natural advantage. There is no dearth of cattle and hence cow-dung. There will also be no scarcity of garbage. So, we can seriously think about mass generation of electricity.

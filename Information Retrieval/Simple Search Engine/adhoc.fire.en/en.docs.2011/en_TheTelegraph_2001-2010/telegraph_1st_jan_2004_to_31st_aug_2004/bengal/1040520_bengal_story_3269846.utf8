The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
		 Thursday, May 20, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Calcutta, May 19: A 51-year-old elephant, one of the two that had strayed into Bangladesh across the Nadia border about a fortnight ago, died last night. Forest minister Jogesh Burman said the elephant perished in the extreme heat while a section of forest officials claimed that the tranquilliser dose administered was too strong and killed it. 				 																																	Burman said two elephants had strayed into Faridpur district in neighbouring Bangladesh from the Dolma hills on May 8. He explained that the elephant slipped through the border as police and other government officials were busy with the elections. Bangladeshi forest officials took good care of the animals, he added.				 																																	Calcutta: The law minister has finally sent the file containing the order to hang Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who had raped and murdered student Hetal Parekh in a Bhowanipore highrise in 1989, to governor Viren J. Shah for his final approval. 				 																																	Burdwan: Fifteen people were feared drowned when a boat capsized in the Khari river near the Nawpara ghat in Burdwan. Five bodies have so far been traced and sent for post-mortem. The boat was on its way to Nabadwip when the accident occurred around 6.30 on Wednesday evening. 				 																																	Calcutta: Calcutta High Court has directed the state government to remove B. Halder from the post of rent controller of Calcutta within a month and appoint a judicial officer in his post. The court order was passed following the provisions of the newly-enacted West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act of 2001.

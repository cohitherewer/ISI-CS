 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 In rain amp; mist to beat heat
 VIVEK CHHETRIA couple takes a stroll on a misty Tuesday evening in Darjeeling. Picture by Suman TamangDarjeeling, May 25: Its a washout, no less.Let alone Kanchenjunga, visitors have not been able to see even 5 feet in front of them. A glimpse of sunrise at Tiger Hill is out of the question and a ride to the rock garden or zoo impossible, but the vagaries of the weather have done little to deter people from heading to the hills to beat the heat.We have seen nothing here. A thick blanket of fog cloaks the town in the morning and hangs there till late in the evening. Then there is the rain that drums on the roof all day, said Tanmay Ghosh from Nadia, who came here with his family three days ago.																								But its not all that bad. Not many have seen Darjeeling in this mood and we are enjoying it. It feels fine to just laze around in the hotel, he added.																								This month is one of the wettest in recent times, with the hills recording 212.5-mm rainfall. The town is wrapped in thick fog and the showers, which have refused to stop since May 17, have tethered tourists to their hotel rooms.																								In May 2003, Darjeeling recorded a rainfall of 55 mm, with only six days of rain in the month.Even in April, the total rainfall recorded in Darjeeling was higher than last year. While Darjeeling received a total rainfall of 66.7 mm last year, this time the total rainfall recorded in April stands at 93.7 mm.The heavy fog is bringing down visibility to almost zero in areas along the Jorgebungalow and Ghoom stretch, but tourists do not seem too worried about being denied a peek of the rolling hills and the panorama of peaks that Darjeeling is famous for.																								They say the view from Darjeeling is really great and that Kanchenjunga can be seen from virtually every place in town, said Sukvinder Singh, a tourist from Jalandhar.																								We can see nothing, but are enjoying the peculiar weather here and it is interesting to walk around the Mall and surrounding areas, seeing other people appear suddenly out of the mist.																								Hoteliers also spoke along the same lines. They said business was doing well and that Darjeeling was witnessing a surge in the number of tourists despite the gloomy weather.There has been no cancellation of bookings that were made for this month. People are, in fact, enjoying the weather here, said Dinesh Sharma, the general manager of Fortune Central Resort.

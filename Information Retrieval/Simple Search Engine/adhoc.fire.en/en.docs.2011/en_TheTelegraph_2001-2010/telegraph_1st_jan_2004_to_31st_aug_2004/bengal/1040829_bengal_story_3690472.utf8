The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Fight over rally might
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug 28: The Trinamul Congress and the state Congress claimed to have outdone each other in mobilising people for their rallies in central Calcutta on the 51st anniversary of the foundation of the Chhatra Parishad, in the wake of an injured Mamata Banerjee not attending the Trinamul meet.																								Traffic in the central business district ground to a halt today when the participants of the two rallies headed to their venues  the Congress-led Chhatra Parishad to Mahajati Sadan and the Trinamul to Mohammed Ali Park.																								The Congress invited defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Congress general secretary in charge of organisation Ashok Gehlot to ensure a good turnout at Mahajati Sadan. The Congress leaders said the Trinamul function was a damp squib as party chief Mamata skipped it on health grounds.																								Mamata, who fractured two right ribs when a dais collapsed at an August 9 rally in Midnapore, is recuperating at her residence. We tried our best to make the programme a success, but Mamatas absence affected the turnout, said Trinamul Youth Congress president Madan Mitra.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee felt the turnout could have doubled had Mamata attended.																								However, Baisnawar Chatterjee, the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad president, claimed the rally was quite impressive despite Mamatas absence. He said more than 300 party workers, who had switched over to the Congress, rejoined the party during the day.																								The Congress leadership, in turn, claimed that the turn out at its rally was huge compared to that of Mamata.																								Trinamuls rally was no match for our programme. Over 30,000 students from 115 colleges attended the programme, claimed Parishad president Sourav Chakraborty.

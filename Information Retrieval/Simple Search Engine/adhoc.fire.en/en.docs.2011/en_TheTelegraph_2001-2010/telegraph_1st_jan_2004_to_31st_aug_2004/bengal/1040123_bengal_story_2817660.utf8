 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Durgapur, Jan. 22: Two  persons travelling in the convoy of Murshidabad superintendent  of police Gyanwant Singh were killed when their vehicle  rammed into a stationary truck on National Highway 2 near  Gipal Math here. 																								Police said Nikhil Roy, 40, a bodyguard, and driver Sanjay Gupta, 35, were following Singhs vehicle back to Murshidabad from Asansol railway station. The police officer had come to Asansol to receive his wife who arrived from Uttar Pradesh. 																								The second vehicle, a Tata Sumo, was speeding to keep up with Singhs vehicle. We suspect the brakes of the car failed and it lost control and hit the stationary truck, said Sheshadri Mukherjee, officer-in-charge of Durgapur police station. 																								Singhs driver sped on without noticing that the second car was not following them. The police superintendent realised that his bodyguard was not with him only on reaching Murshidabad. 																								The police initially had difficulties in identifying the bodies, but the problem was solved by an assistant sub-inspector who recently moved to Durgapur from Murshidabad. 																								It was this ASI who identified the bodies as Gyanwant Singhs security guard and his driver, said an official. 																								Singhs wife was supposed to travel to Murshidabad alone. But the superintendent decided to receive her as the train was late.

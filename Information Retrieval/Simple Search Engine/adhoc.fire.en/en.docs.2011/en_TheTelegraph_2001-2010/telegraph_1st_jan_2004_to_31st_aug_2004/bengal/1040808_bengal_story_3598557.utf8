 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Curbs on school bus in Salt Lake
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, Aug. 7: Wiser after last weeks accident in which 21 students were hurt in Salt Lake, police have decided to act tough against school buses plying in the township.																								Senior officers of Bidhannagar met owners of school buses today to find out ways to avoid mishaps. 																								The meeting decided that the buses would stick to the main roads and not enter the lanes that run through the residential blocks comprising Salt Lake. We will not allow school buses to enter the blocks from Monday, a senior police officer said. If a school bus is found on any such road, it will be seized.																								Government officials said most school buses plying in the township do not have proper documents. Most of these buses do not have valid permits. They neither have insurance cover nor clearance from the pollution control board, the official said. In a number of cases, he added, drivers do not have a licence. 																								Those running buses without documents will be prosecuted, the official said.																								In April last year, pick-up points for school buses were identified. But little was done to implement the rule that students could only be picked up or dropped on main roads. Now, it will be strictly implemented, an official said. 																								On July 31, at least 21 students of Bidhannagar Municipal School, mostly studying in classes V and VI, were injured when the chartered bus carrying them overturned near Karunamoyee. The bus was moving at a high speed on an empty road and the driver lost control while taking a turn. 																								Seven students were admitted to hospital. Police officials also blamed the bad road conditions of the township for mishaps. In some areas, the conditions of roads have become worse. We will discuss the issue with the Bidhannagar Municipality, a police official said. However, Sutanu Kar, executive officer of Salt Lake said the municipality was doing annual maintenance of the roads under it. The main roads in Salt Lake are under CMDA and urban development department, Kar said.

 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Hanging game toll rises 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Sukharol (West Midnapore), Aug. 24: The hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee seems to have left a lasting impression on young minds. 																								When 12-year-old Manti Malakar died trying to enact the hanging last Saturday, a young boy was also climbing his own gallows. 																								Samiran Tiwari, 14, was found hanging from the tube of a cycle tyre strung from a beam of his house here, 170 km from Calcutta. 																								Samiran did not go to school on Saturday. Around 10.30 am, he went to a first-floor room with his books. Some time later, his mother went to the room and found him hanging, said Samirans father Nirmal Tiwari. 																								He said the boy was taken to the local health centre where doctors pronounced him dead. We did not want our sons body to be sent for post-mortem and requested the doctors not to tell police. 																								The district administration learnt of the death today. 																								Tiwari said a few days before he died, his son frequently spoke about the hanging. On his way to school, Samiran used to devour any news he found in newspapers on Dhananjoy and narrate it to his mother and sister after returning home, he added.																								Anxious about the obsession with the hanging, the family stopped him from going to school after Dhananjoy was put to death on August 14. 																								He returned to school four days later and learnt that a boy had a miraculous escape while playing Dhananjoy. The incident seemed to have made an impact on Samiran and he decided to enact the hanging on his own.

 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Police name mine blast mastermind
 OUR BUREAU March 11: After days of little progress and complaining about lack of cooperation from residents in Naxalite-infested areas, police claimed to have made a breakthrough in the inquiry into the landmine blast at West Midnapores Belpahari.																								Peoples War guerrillas led by Banamali Deswali were behind the February 25 explosion at Nundhola in which two police officers and five jawans of the Eastern Frontier Rifles were killed, the police said today.																								A plan is now being drawn up to flush Deswali out of his hideout in the Belpahari forest bordering Jharkhand. The police said some villagers revealed after intense interrogation that another Peoples War leader, Shashadhar Mahato, was responsible for the mine blast at Salboni in November in which four policemen were injured.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in the Assembly today the Naxalites sneak into the state from Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand and return after the strike. We are carrying out raids jointly with four other states to trace the Peoples War activists, he said.

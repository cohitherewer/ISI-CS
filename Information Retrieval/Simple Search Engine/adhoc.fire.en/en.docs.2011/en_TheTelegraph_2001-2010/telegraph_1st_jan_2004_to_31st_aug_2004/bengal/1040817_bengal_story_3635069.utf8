 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Transfusion trip to HIV
 NARESH JANA																								Midnapore, Aug. 16: Indranath Pal, 10, a patient of purpura, a disorder in which the blood platelet count goes down and bleeding refuses to cease, underwent transfusion at government hospitals twice. He is HIV positive now. 																								A resident of Gangchha village in Chandrakona, West Midnapore, about 135 km from Calcutta, Indranath (name changed) was diagnosed HIV positive in Vellore. 																								His parents, both daily labourers, said the purpura was detected when four-year-old Indranath bled from the nose and mouth.																								Doctors said the condition  medically known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura  leads to severe anaemia and requires need-based blood transfusion.																								Indranaths father said: We took him to Ghatal Subdivisional Hospital in 1999, where a paediatrician prescribed a transfusion. Accordingly, we took a pouch of blood from the hospital blood bank.																								After months of treatment there, Indranath was shifted to the district hospital, where two pouches of blood were transfused. 																								As there was no sign of improvement, the parents were advised to take him to Christian Medical College, Vellore, but they could not raise the money immediately. Begging and borrowing, and with assistance from the panchayat, the Pals set out last January.																								This is not the first instance in which a child undergoing transfusion in a state hospital has been infected with the dreaded virus. Ananda Saha, 3, who was diagnosed with thalassaemia in 2001 at a hospital in North 24-Parganas Habra, was infected during the many transfusions he underwent at NRS Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta.																								West Midnapores chief medical officer, Mangobinda Mondal, said he has instructed counselling for Indranath and his parents. The parents are not infected. It is important for us to find out how he contracted the virus, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Left looms on civic polls
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 26: Just over a month after the big-bang Lok Sabha elections, the state has again geared up for polls. Tomorrow, about 19 lakh voters will choose their representatives in 17 municipalities. 																								State election commissioner Ajoy Sinha said this afternoon 2,218 polling stations have been set up and the results will be announced on Tuesday. More than 15,000 security personnel would be deployed to maintain law and order. 																								Apart from policemen, the state election commission has also decided to deploy Rapid Action Force (RAF) and paramilitary forces like Eastern Frontier Rifles in sensitive areas like Asansol, Kulti, Maheshtala, Dum Dum and South Dum Dum municipalities, Sinha said. 																								We have also deputed 53 observers to tour the municipalities which will go to polls tomorrow and submit their reports to us, he added. 																								Darjeeling is among the municipalities where elections will be held tomorrow. All 11 Gorkha National Liberation Front candidates have been declared elected unopposed. In Kurseong, one GNLF candidate sailed through without contest. 																								In Dum Dum and South Dum Dum municipalities, four CPM candidates faced no competition. In Mal municipality of Jalpaiguri district, one RSP candidate was elected unopposed. 																								The other municipalities going to polls are Madhyamgram and Rajarhat-Gopalpur in North 24-Parganas, Sonarpur-Rajpur in South 24-Parganas, Islampur in South Dinajpur, Kalimpong in Darjeeling district, Gangarampur, Sainthia in Birbhum and Uluberia in Howrah district. 																								Elections to the Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad would also be held tomorrow. Matigara, Naxalbari, Phansidewa and Kharibari are the four sub- divisions under the Mahakuma Parishad. There will be 379 polling stations for the elections and 2.85 lakh voters will exercise their franchise. 																								Political observers feel that the CPM, buoyed by its good showing in the parliamentary elections, will sail through in most of the municipalities. Besides, a low-key campaign by both the Trinamul Congress and the Congress has come as a boon for the communists. 																								Still smarting under the humiliation of the general elections, Trinamul does not appear very concerned about its prospects. 																								To us, elections in Bengal have become irrelevant as they are rigged by the CPM, said a party leader. 																								He admitted that party chairperson Mamata Banerjee, Trinamuls sole MP from the state,did not participate in the campaign.

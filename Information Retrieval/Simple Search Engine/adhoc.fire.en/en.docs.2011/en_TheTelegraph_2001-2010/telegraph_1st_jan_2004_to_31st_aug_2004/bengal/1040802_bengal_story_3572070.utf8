 TAMAL SENGUPTA 																								Calcutta, Aug. 1: Hounded by CPM activists, a family has fled its house at Ghordourchati in Burdwan town and is spending days of terror in a central Calcutta hotel. 																								We had to flee our home as CPM men were threatening us. After staying for four days in a relatives house, we had to shift to the hotel on July 22 and have been suffering sleepless nights, said Dipak Chakraborty, a retired port trust employee. 																								In a reminder of the extra-judicial role CPM activists take on, the family is being harassed since Dipaks daughter-in-law Soma complained about physical and mental torture. 																								Soma had married Debashis in 1994. In 2002, the family bought a two-storey house and moved in. Earlier, Dipak had bought a childrens garment shop. 																								About one-and-a-half years ago, Debashiss relations with Soma became strained as she wanted ownership of the house and the shop. When we refused, she approached the local CPM leadership, said Dipak. 																								When Debashis filed a divorce suit, the CPM cadre demanded Rs 30 lakh on behalf of Soma for an out-of-court settlement. We couldnt pay such a hefty sum, said Debashis, explaining why the effort fell through. 																								Debashis and his father have met senior officials of the state human rights commission and sought their intervention. 																								Burdwan district CPM secretary Amal Haldar dismissed suggestions that the cadre had violated a party whip by intervening in a family dispute. 																								We had stepped in correctly to protect a housewife who was being subjected to physical and mental torture by her husband and in-laws. We consider it social service, he said.

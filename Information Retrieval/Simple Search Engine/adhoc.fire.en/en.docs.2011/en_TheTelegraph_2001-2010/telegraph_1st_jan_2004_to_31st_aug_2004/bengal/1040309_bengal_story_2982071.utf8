The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Eye on Bihar twins, CPM keeps hot seat in hand
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta/Malda, March 8: In a last-ditch effort to extract two seats in Bihar  as part of an electoral deal with Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)  the CPM today said it was still willing to part with the key Calcutta north west seat.																								Our leaders in Delhi tonight initiated a dialogue with Laloos party to clear the hitch over seat adjustment. If the RJD is ready to offer us two seats, including Bhagalpur in Bihar, we shall back the RJD nominee in Calcutta north west. But if this falls through, we shall field our nominee for the key seat, Jyoti Basu said tonight.																								The former chief minister said the partys leaders in Delhi, including general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and politburo member Sitaram Yechury, were in regular touch with him. I think everything will be clear by tonight as the meeting is going on in Delhi. I am expecting a call any moment and will announce the partys decision in this regard by tomorrow, he added.																								Basu said the party has chosen two possible candidates for the seat. We will select either of the two as soon as we hear from Laloo, he added. 																								Party insiders said the CPM would choose between MLAs Sudhansu Sil and Lagan Deo Singh. However, Sil scores over Singh as he happens to be an MLA from Jorabagan, which falls under the Calcutta north- west parliamentary seat, said a key party functionary.																								Rebel Trinamul Congress MP Sudip Bandopadhyay today denied having made any overtures to the Congress for seeking re-election to the north west seat with its support. I have already made it clear that I shall contest independently and will not take support either from the Congress or any other party, he said.																								We have not received any response from Sudip yet. Only when we get one, it will be decided whether or not to welcome him into the Congress fold, PCC chief Pranab Mukherjee said in Malda after calling on Congress MP A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury at his Kotwali residence.																								Former PCC president Somen Mitra said Bandyopadhyays move and the partys reaction would be dealt with by Mukherjee. Pranabbabu will say whatever there is to say on the issue, he said. 																								Sources close to Chowdhury said all senior leaders visiting Malda have sought the veterans opinion on Bandopadhyay.																								Mukherjee had called on Chowdhury to seek support if and when he campaigns for the Jangipur seat.																								The two then went to Farakka for the party workers convention. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, too, paid a visit to Chowdhury and promised all help to Mukherjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Sack revenge raid
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, April 21: A retrenched employee stormed into a soap factory before dawn and attacked his sleeping former colleagues, killing the elderly head mechanic and severely injuring the manager. 																								Sixty-year-old Piru Mian died on the spot and Anil Singh is undergoing treatment in hospital. Santosh Yadav, the attacker, and his associates stole two bicycles from the factory, Mahalakshmi Soap Industry, at Kanchannagar in Burdwan, about 120 km from Calcutta, and fled. 																								Deputy superintendent of police (headquarters), Burdwan, Ambika Mukherjee said Santosh attacked the men because he wanted to avenge his retrenchment. We have issued an alert in all police stations in the district to find out and arrest those who are absconding, he added.																								His head swathed in bandages, Anil, who is recuperating in Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, said the miscreants attacked us when we were sleeping inside a room of the factory. They found Piru first and hit him on the head with something that looks like a hammer. Piru died on the spot. Then they hit me on my head in an attempt to kill me. 																								He too claimed Santosh, who hailed from Rishra in Hooghly district, had attacked them to take revenge for sacking him.																								The owners brother-in-law, Dilip Sankar, who rushed to factory, said Santosh was sacked on charges of theft. Even though there was no workers union at the factory, local people had put pressure on us to take back Santosh. But we refused to take him back, he added.

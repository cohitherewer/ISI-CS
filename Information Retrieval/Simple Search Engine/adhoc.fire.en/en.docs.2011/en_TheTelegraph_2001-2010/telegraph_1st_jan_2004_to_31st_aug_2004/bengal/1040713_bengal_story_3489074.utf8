The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Calcutta, July 12: Finance minister Asim Dasgupta will meet his central counterpart P. Chidambaram on Friday.				 																																	Dasgupta will go to Delhi with a clutch of demands, including reduction of interest on central loans and funds to check erosion. The discussions would centre around the Union budget and its implications and the implementation of VAT (value added tax), he said. One of Bengals grievances has been that it was paying 9.5 to 10 per cent interest on central borrowings when the market rates ranged from 6 to 7 per cent.				 																																	Calcutta: Trinamul Congress MLA Nirbed Roy demanded a statement from the higher education minister in the Assembly on the controversy dogging Pabitra Sarkars doctorate from Chicago University. However, Satyasadhan Chakraborty said only the chief minister could make one. Roy alleged that the government had tarnished its own image by attempting to defend Sarkar, a former vice-chancellor of Rabindra Bharati University and a renowned linguist.				 																																	Durgapur: Citu and DYFI supporters stopped production at Shankarpur and Chora open cast mines at Kenda on Monday. Eastern Coalfields Ltd had withdrawn the suspension on two Citu supporters after cautioning them against disrupting work, annoying the unionists. Two ECL officials were gheraoed for about 13 hours on Saturday.				 																																	Calcutta: A couple travelling in a Diamond Harbour-bound train was looted at gun-point on Sunday night near Deola station on the Sealdah South section, about 70 km from Calcutta. Narendranath Sinha and Saswati, who were going to Diamond Harbour for a wedding, had to hand over their ornaments and cash.

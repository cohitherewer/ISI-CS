 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, Dec. 31: An armed gang raided the hostel of a vocational institute run by Christian missionaries here in the early hours of December 25 and allegedly attempted to molest a young nun. 																								Authorities of Don Bosco, which runs the institute, today accused the police of trying to hush up the matter. They complained that the injured nun was sent to Bhagalpur in Bihar for treatment instead of being admitted to a local hospital. 																								Father Scaria said a gang of at least 22 dacoits raided the nuns hostel in Badarpur around 2 am on Christmas and entered the rooms where they were sleeping. After tying their hands with ropes, the miscreants beat up two nuns in which sister Ashiqua sustained serious injuries. They even tried to molest her, he said. 																								Scaria recounted that the goons knocked on the doors of his room after beating up the nuns. As I opened the door, I saw them brandishing arms. They forced me to hand over the keys to my almirah and fled with cash worth Rs 60,000. 																								After the incident, Murshidabad district magistrate Manoj Panth and superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh came to the institution and asked him not to inform the press. 																								Reacting to the accusation, Singh today said: The Christian community of the district is already suffering from a sense of insecurity after last years dacoity at Maliapota in Nadia. We requested the authorities of the mission to keep silent for the sake of investigation. 																								He said the police learnt about the incident the next day and visited the hostel to investigate. We have identified the gang and raids are on to round up its members, Singh said, adding that at least three persons have been arrested. 																								Senior officials said security has been beefed up at Christian institutions, including the churches across the district. A permanent police picket has been posted near the hostel. 																								Ila Mukherjee, a resident of Badarpur, said: We stay close to the institution gate, but we came to know about the incident only on December 28. 																								Paurus Pauria, a daily labourer attached to the missionary, said he, too, did not know about the incident. I went to work on December 25 morning as usual but nobody told me about the incident. 																								Singh argued that residents were unaware of the incident as the hostel is situated in the middle of vast grounds surrounded by a high wall. 																								It was not possible for residents to know about the incident as the dacoits had fled quietly after committing the crime, he added.

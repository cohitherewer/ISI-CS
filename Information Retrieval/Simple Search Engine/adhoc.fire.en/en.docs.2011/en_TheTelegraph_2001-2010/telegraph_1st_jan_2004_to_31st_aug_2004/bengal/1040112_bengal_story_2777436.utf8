 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Bloom for Sourav
 ABHIJIT CHAKRABORTY Balurghat, Jan. 11: A cricket-crazy  flower-grower has raised a chrysanthemum bush that contains  no less than 1,800 buds and their numbers are still growing.																								Animesh Das, who has been nurturing the bush, plans to hand over his prized possession to the Indian skipper after he returns from the tour to Australia.																								I began growing and nurturing the plant last March while Sourav was leading the cricket team at the World Cup in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya. It was always meant for the Maharaja, a proud Das said.																								He claimed that by the time the flowers get to Sourav, their numbers are bound to surpass all records. The Indian team is expected to return in the first week of February after the finals of the tri-series. Sourav and his boys are tipped to qualify for the finals of the tournament, which also features Zimbabwe.																								Animesh, in his early forties, is an active member of the floriculture society in Balurghat, the headquarters of South Dinajpur. A primary school teacher, he is no stranger to cricket and has represented the district. I have been growing flowers since 1981. This is not the first time I have grown this multi-budded chrysanthemum, he said. A well-wisher who knows the Gangulys, Das added, would arrange the delivery.

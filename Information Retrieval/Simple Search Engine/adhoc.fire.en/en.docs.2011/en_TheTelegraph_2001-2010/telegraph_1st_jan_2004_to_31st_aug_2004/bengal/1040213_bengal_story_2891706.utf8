 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Ministers jibe at MP 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Raiganj, Feb. 12: Relief minister Hafiz Alam Sairani today took a jab at Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, saying he is a former MP now that the Lok Sabha has been dissolved. 																								Das Munshi, the MP from Raiganj who was the Congress chief whip in the 13th Lok Sabha, had said he would boycott the health fair that began here today as the North Dinajpur administration had gone back on its word that he would inaugurate it. Das Munshis name was included in the invitation card as a special guest.																								Justifying the decision, Sairani, a Forward Bloc leader who was invited to inaugurate the fair, said: Das Munshi lost his status as MP with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha last week. Now he is just a former MP. Protocol demands that either civil defence minister from the district Srikumar Mukherjee or I should inaugurate the fair, Sairani said. 																								It is unbecoming of a senior political leader. The fair is meant to spread awareness. It doesnt matter who inaugurates it.																								Das Munshi lashed out, saying though the House was dissolved, the MPs were told to complete projects by February 18.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Teachers at training, board results at risk
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, April 20: The publication of Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examination results may be delayed because of the involvement of a large number of teachers in the May 10 polls.																								Officials of the board of secondary education and the higher secondary council said that a bulk of teachers requisitioned for poll duties has also been roped in to evaluate answer scripts of the 2004 examinations. 																								Sources said more than 70,000 teachers and non-teaching employees of secondary schools across the state have been requisitioned for the polls.																								Many of our examiners and head-examiners are now busy attending training programmes for election-related work. Their absence is leading to disruption in the process of evaluation of higher secondary answer scripts. We may have to face difficulty in publishing the results in time, said Jyotirmoy Mukherjee, the president of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education.																								The election department started training camps for the teachers on April 19. The classes will continue till April 29. The teachers will have to report again for election duty on May 8 and will be released after the process of counting and announcement of results is complete.																								Officials said if the two exams are taken together, over one crore answer scripts need to be examined. More than 10 lakh students have appeared for the two examinations this year.																								However, academic activities in many state-aided secondary schools across Bengal have virtually come to a standstill because of the teachers preoccupation with the polls. 																								Sources in several schools said that the teachers training has prompted many of the institutions to keep all their administrative and academic work suspended till the completion of the election process as a number of their teaching and non-teaching employees have been requisitioned.																								We are helpless and sitting idle with practically no one in the school to do any work. There is no way we can announce the results of our annual examination till the elections are over. We have 38 teachers. But 33 have been taken away by the election department to attend the training programme for poll work, said Sisir Chakraborty, the headmaster of Belghoria High School on the northern fringes of Calcutta.																								In view of the polls  when most school buildings will have to be handed over to the election department to set up polling booths and counting centres  the board has asked 12,500 secondary institutions to announce the results of their annual examinations by April 29.It is impossible for us to meet the April 29 deadline set by the board for announcing the results of our annual examination. Our total staff strength is 41 and 35 of them are attending the election training programme, said N.K. Singh, the headmaster of Rishra Vidyapith in Hooghly. Singh has registered his protest with the district administration.																								Teachers bodies have approached the election department demanding withdrawal of teachers from election duty. 																								Schoolteachers normally have to work overtime around this time every year because of the exams. The overlapping of the election training has multiplied their problems, said Amiya Basu, the general secretary of a teachers association.

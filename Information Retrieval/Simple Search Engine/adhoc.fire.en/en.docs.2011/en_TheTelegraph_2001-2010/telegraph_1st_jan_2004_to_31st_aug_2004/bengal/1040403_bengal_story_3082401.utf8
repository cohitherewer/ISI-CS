The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Were busy, Chancellor
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SOUMI BHATTACHARYA				 	 Students on the campus on Friday. Picture by Amit Datta Santiniketan, April 2: The  acharyas (chancellors) convoy rolled this afternoon  into a campus that was not really waiting for him.																								The varsity had classes as usual, and examinations. About 20 students who were waiting for him left muttering angrily at not being allowed a view. And, out of his sight, teachers and students hesitantly expressed their disapproval of an acharya who missed two consecutive convocations and came to see Santiniketan squirming in embarrassment.																								There was no call to boycott Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit, exactly a week after the place had lost some of its most prized possessions  Tagores Nobel medal and many other memorabilia. 																								But the students had more important things on their mind than flocking to the helipad or Uttarayan to catch a glimpse of Vajpayee. Some of them were busy preparing the convocation magazine, for example.																								He did not have time for us for two years, Vidya Bhavan student Sachin Jain said. This year, too, we will go ahead with the convocation without him. 																								Shiksha Bhavan (the science stream) and Vidya Bhavan (the arts faculty) had classes and Patha Bhavan hosted exams. I have just attended a class and am rushing for another, Shiksha Bhavan student Anwesha Mallick said. I have heard that the acharya is here but, frankly, I do not have time right now, she added as she ran to catch up with friends.																								At the behest of the Special Protection Group, police made sure no one came close to Santiniketan Road, from where the VVIP convoy entered the museum complex.

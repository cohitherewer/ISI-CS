The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Lull after church robbery cracks 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Krishnagar, April 29: Sixteen months after the daring Christmas raid on a church at Maliapota in Nadias Tehatta, robbers revisited the area last night and struck in several houses about half-a-kilometre from the shrine. 																								Dissatisfied with the cash and jewellery looted from the houses of Siraj Kalim, Hatim Khalim and Jamal Biswas, the 10-member gang plundered foodgrain stocked there and fled after firing in the air from improvised revolvers. 																								Jamal, a trader, has been admitted to a Tehatta hospital with splinter injuries as the robbers hurled bombs at him when he tried to resist. 																								The dacoits could not lay their hands on much cash as the villagers, wiser by the attack on the church, do not keep money at home, but deposit it in banks. 																								An armed gang had raided the Maliapota church when midnight mass was in progress in 2002. They looted everything in sight in the church, which was also the repository of the villagers earnings, plundered the cash box and attacked priests, including church head T.J. Abraham. 																								A high-level police team from Calcutta had rushed to the area and arrested about 20 people, including a few Bangladeshis, in a series of raids after investigations. Last nights incident was the first since the church robbery. 																								We lived in peace for the past 16 months because of intense police raids and the large-scale arrests. Maliapota and a score of villages adjacent to it were earlier areas where dacoities were common, said Abraham today. 																								The villagers had rushed to him this morning. They were scared as they thought the horrible nights had returned. We have no clue as to where the dacoits came from this time. A new gang may have begun operating. The villagers are scared to speak to the police as the dacoits have threatened them with dire consequences if they informed the police, Abraham added.																								We have started investigation. According to the villagers complaints, the looted amount is not big, district police superintendent Pankaj Dutta said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 BJP keeps Sikdar loyalists out
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Jan. 24: The Bengal BJP leadership today did not induct in the reconstituted state party executive any loyalists of Union minister of state for small scale industries Tapan Sikdar.																								Sikdar, who is in the city, was learnt to have lodged a complaint with national BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu. The reconstituted committee in which none of our members have found a place is an insult to Tapanda, said a key party leader who owes allegiance to Sikdar.																								State party president Tathagata Roy has rubbished the charge. Roy claimed, while announcing the committee, that the Union minister was consulted twice on this score. I twice called on Sikdar before finalising the names of the committee. I think this is a balanced body and Sikdar has nothing to complain about it, he said.																								However, BJP sources said Roy did not induct two key Sikdar loyalists  Muzaffar Khan and Pratap Banerjee  despite promises to make room for them. The beleaguered organisation is bound to suffer in the coming days, particularly at a time when we are preparing for the Lok Sabha elections, asserted a party veteran.																								Sikdar loyalists made it clear tonight that they would abstain from campaigning. This is a committee in which our Muslim representatives are conspicuous by their absence, they added.

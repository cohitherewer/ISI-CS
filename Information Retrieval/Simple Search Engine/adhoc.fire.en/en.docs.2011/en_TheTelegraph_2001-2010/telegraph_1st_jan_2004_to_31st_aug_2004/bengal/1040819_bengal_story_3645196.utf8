 OUR BUREAU																								Aug. 18: The Haldia port authorities informed the shipping ministry today that the chief cook of a Cyprus-registered ship, commanded by a Greek captain, was murdered on board the vessel by a crew member at the Sandheads anchorage.																								Shipping secretary D.T. Joseph confirmed the incident and said the embassies of Cyprus, Greece and the Philippines had been informed.																								The alleged killer, Jerry Sumalinog, a Filipino who holds the rank of seaman, had tried to escape by jumping into the sea, sources said. But he was spotted and caught after a motorboat chase. 																								During the interrogation that followed, Sumalinog confessed to murdering chief cook Colantro Romeo, also a Filipino, after an argument. The victims body was found in his cabin.																								Captain Nikolaos Foskolos had Sumalinog locked up in a cabin after tying his hands and feet. 																								The ship was brought to Haldia to offload the body and initiate legal action.

The port authorities are reported to have informed the shipping ministry that the police are waiting for the embassies to respond before taking further action. 																								Superintendent of police, East Midnapore, Maharathi Adhikari, who visited the Haldia dock complex, said: We have informed the state home department for necessary action as we are unable to board the vessel. However, no officials have so far reached from Delhi.

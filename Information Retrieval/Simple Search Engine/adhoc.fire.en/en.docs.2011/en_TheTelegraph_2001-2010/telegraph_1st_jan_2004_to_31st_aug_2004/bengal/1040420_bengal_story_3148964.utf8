The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 BJP nominee ruled out of race for account slip
 OUR BUREAU																								April 19: BJP candidate from Burdwan Anindya Gopal Mitra has been disqualified from the Lok Sabha elections for failing to produce an account of his expenses as the Habra candidate in the 2001 Assembly elections. 																								District magistrate Subrata Gupta, the returning officer of Burdwan for the May 10 elections, served the disqualification notice to Mitra this afternoon. 																								Mitras name figures on the list of persons disqualified by the Election Commission. And I have served the notice to him accordingly, Gupta said.																								Mitra said his election agent for the Assembly polls might have forgotten to submit the expense account. I cannot remember whether the expense account was submitted. However, I am leaving for Delhi tomorrow to meet chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy to submit the account for the Assembly polls and make a fresh appeal to him to withdraw the disqualification, he added.																								However, fearing the worst, the BJP has started looking for an alternative candidate. This is really a sad development but we will have to go by the commissions decision. We shall put up a fresh candidate from Burdwan if the EC does not budge, said state BJP chief Tathagata Roy. The partys central leadership has been told about the development.																								The CPM is already cheering. Its candidate, Nikhilananda Sar, had won the seat by a margin of more than 300,000 votes in 1999. This year, the party feels, it could be even easier. Sar is eyeing a third win in a row from Burdwan. 																								We have no comments on the poll panels decision. But in the event of Mitras disqualification, there will be a straight contest with the Congress candidate, who has hardly any base in the district, said district CPM secretary Amal Halder. 																								In Murshidabads Jangipur, state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee filed his nomination today, but without the affidavit declaring his assets. 																								The partys candidate from Behrampore, Adhir Chowdhury, filed his papers today, claiming in an affidavit that no criminal cases were pending against him. 																								But a deputy superintendent of police said more than one case is on against Chowdhury. We cannot divulge the details of the cases. We will submit a detailed list to the district magistrate tomorrow, he added. 																								Special observer Afzal Amanullah, chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee and inspector-general, law and order, Chayan Mukherjee met 109 election observers in Calcutta this morning.

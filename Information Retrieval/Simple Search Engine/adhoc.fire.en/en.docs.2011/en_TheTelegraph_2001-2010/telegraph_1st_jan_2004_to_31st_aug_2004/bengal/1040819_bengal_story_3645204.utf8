The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 RPF man held for rape at station 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Bashirhat (North 24-Parganas), Aug. 18: Four days after Dhananjoy Chatterjee was hanged for raping and murdering a teenager, a Railway Protection Force constable has been arrested on charges of violating a woman at Hasnabad station last night. 																								Kapil Deorai was held by the Government Railway Police from his Barasat house after incensed commuters held up trains for five hours at the station from 6.40 am. 																								The accused had made all attempts to hide the crime and even shaved to change his appearance, an official said. The clothes he wore last night were seized.																								Sealdah superintendent of railway police Nabarun Bhattacharya said: We have arrested Kapil Deorai, but there are no specific complaints against any accomplice.																								The 30-year-old woman boarded the last train to Hasnabad, about 70 km from Calcutta, at Sealdah with her husband and three minor children around 7.45 last evening. When the train reached Hasnabad at 11 pm, the couple failed to find transport to reach home at Bhaktinagar in Dulduli, 18 km away. 																								Kapil and another constable approached the couple and advised them to wait in a train compartment as the platform was not safe. 																								Soon the intentions of the two became clear and one constable held the husband and the children in one compartment while Kapil allegedly raped the woman in another. 																								Praveen Kumar, the district superintendent of police, said once the couple was inside the compartment, the constables said they wanted to search them. The case is being probed by the GRP. 																								After the two left, the couple found a GRP outpost at the station and lodged a complaint. Later they informed Hasnabad police station, but no complaint was lodged. 																								The news spread with first light and by the time commuters began arriving at the station, emotions were on boil. The five-hour blockade of the single track was lifted after police intervention.

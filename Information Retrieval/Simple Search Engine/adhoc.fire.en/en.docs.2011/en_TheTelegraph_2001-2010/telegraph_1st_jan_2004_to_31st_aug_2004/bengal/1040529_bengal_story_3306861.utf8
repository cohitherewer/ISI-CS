The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Centre push to state funds
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 28: The Congress-led government at the Centre will move the 12th finance commission to provide incentives to states for collection of small savings, to strengthen their fiscal condition, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.																								After a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Mukherjee said some policies of the NDA government were detrimental to the improvement of the fiscal conditions of some states. 																								In a federal structure, if the states are fiscally weak, the Centre cannot be strong, said Mukherjee, a former Union finance minister.																								Mukherjee pointed out that Bengal had not benefited despite topping the country for several years in mobilisation of small savings. The previous finance commissions had not recommended any incentive to the state for collection of small savings. We will see if the present commission can recommend such incentives to benefit the states.																								He said erosion along the Hooghly and Padma was also discussed and announced this had been included in the common minimum programme prepared by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. As a result, the problem of erosion will get top priority.																								Only yesterday, Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi had called on Bhattacharjee to discuss erosion.

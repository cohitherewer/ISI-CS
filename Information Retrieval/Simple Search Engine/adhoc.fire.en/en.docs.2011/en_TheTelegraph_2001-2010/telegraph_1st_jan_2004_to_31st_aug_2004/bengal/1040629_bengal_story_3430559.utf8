The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Calcutta, June 28: The CID will conduct a fresh inquiry into the disappearance of Sushmita Dhar, a second-year MA student at Jadavpur University, from a Chandipur hotel in 1995. 				 																																	Dhar, then 24, was holidaying with six friends from the university. Her father Shyamal Dhar had named Debanjan Das and Rajiv Chowdhury, the two male members of the holiday team, in the FIR but a CID probe drew a blank.A CBI investigation did not yield any result either.				 																																	A private agency appointed by the father of Suparna Banerjee, who was in the group, had apparently found Sushmitas blood-stained nighty from the hotel but Banerjee did not reveal that in court. Home secretary A.K. Deb said on Monday the case would be reopened again.				 																																	Calcutta: Concern over the CPMs failure to rejuvenate its organisation in Murshidabad has prompted the party brass to rush Budhhadeb Bhattacharjee there. The chief minister will go to Behrampore tomorrow to chalk out a strategy with the district leaders.				 																																	Calcutta: Citu leader Chittabrata Majumdar was on Monday elected to the Rajya Sabha. He defeated Sital Sardar of the Trinamul Congress 194-54. Five Trinamul legislators did not turn up in the Assembly for the voting. The Congress MLAs abstained.

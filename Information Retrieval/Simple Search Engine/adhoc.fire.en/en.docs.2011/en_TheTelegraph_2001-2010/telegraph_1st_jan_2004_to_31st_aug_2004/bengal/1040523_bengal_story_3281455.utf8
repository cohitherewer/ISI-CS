 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Job clash anger turns on police 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Durgapur, May 22: Scuffles between CPM and Trinamul Congress workers over recruitment to a factory here snowballed into a clash and the activists later turned on policemen when they tried to intervene in a heavy-handed manner. Police first fired in the air, lobbed teargas shells and then resorted to a lathicharge to disperse the mob.																								At least 24 persons, including two policemen, were injured in the melee in front of Jessop Factory under Coke Oven police station, about 170 km from Calcutta. 																								Immediately after the incident, agitated CPM supporters ransacked the local Trinamul office and tried to set it ablaze. Police arrested 12 persons. 																								The factory, closed since 1998, was bought by a private company recently to start a steel plant. Around 7 this morning, a group of contract workers, said to be of the CPM, tried to join work. 																								There were at least 300 Trinamul Congress supporters waiting in front of the gate. As the contract workers reached the gate, they were surrounded by the Trinamul supporters, said a police officer. 																								Heated arguments between the groups soon gave way to blows and the situation spun out of control when they started throwing stones and acid bulbs at each other. 																								On hearing about the clash, a police team led by Coke Oven police station officer-in-charge Abu Selim reached the spot. He fired six rounds in the air from his service revolver. The firing without any provocation sparked fresh violence. The warring supporters then attacked the policemen, said a factory worker. 																								A large contingent led by additional superintendent of police Sunil Halder rushed to the rescue. We had no option except firing teargas shells. Police resorted to lathicharge to bring the situation under control, said K.C. Meena, Burdwan police superintendent. 																								Sub-divisional police officer Osman Gani, who also visited the spot, said: I have heard about the police firing. An officer of executive magistrate rank will conduct a probe into the incident. 																								Local Trinamul Congress councillor Biswanath Padial said the company had promised that 60 per cent of contract workers would be from the CPM and the rest from Trinamul. But a few days ago, 10 were taken from the CPM but none from his party.

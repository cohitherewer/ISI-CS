 															- Males down 10, cubs up 10 in census  A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 28: The endangered Royal Bengal Tigers in the Sundarbans are prospering. 																								The number of tiger cubs in the Sundarbans in 2001 was 23. It has now risen to 33, which shows a healthy growth. It is an indication of good protection measures taken to cause the least disturbance in their habitat, said Pradeep Vyas, director of the Sundarban Tiger Reserve. 																								The 2004 tiger census came up with pugmarks of 274 wild cats. This, however, cannot be taken to be the exact number of tigers in the biosphere, declared a Unesco heritage site. 																								The census is indicative of the trend and does not provide absolute figures. The real population will vary by 5 per cent and the actual number would figure between 260 to 288, forest minister Jogesh Burman said. 																								The census, which cost Rs 6 lakh, was funded by the UNDP. 																								The approximate tiger count at the Sunderbans reserve this year stands at 249, with 83 tigers, 133 tigresses and 33 cubs. The total count at the South 24-Parganas reserve forest is 25, with seven tigers, 13 tigresses and four cubs.																								The 2001 census had concluded that the mangroves had 245 tigers, with 93 male and 129 female tigers and 23 cubs. The count at the South 24-Parganas forest was 26, with seven tigers, 13 tigresses and six cubs.																								Were planning a census of tigers in north Bengal, Burman said.

 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Buddha to seek gas hike rollback
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Buddhadeb																								Asansol, June 20: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said if the Congress-led government in Delhi does not follow the common minimum programme, the Left parties will rethink their support.																								Virtually kicking off the Left Fronts campaign for the elections to Asansol Municipal Corporation and Kulti municipality slated for June 27, the chief minister singled out the Congress as the main Opposition party.																								With the elections round the corner, Bhattacharjee tried to prove in his half-hour speech at the Polo Maidan that the alliance at the Centre did not mean much in the state. We consider the hike in petrol and diesel prices inevitable since it is directly linked to prices in the world market. But we will oppose the Centres decision to hike the price of cooking gas. I will urge Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to roll back the hike in the price of cooking gas, he said. The state will speak to the Centre on reopening closed public sector units. I will speak to the Prime Minister about reopening the closed units, Bhattacharjee said.

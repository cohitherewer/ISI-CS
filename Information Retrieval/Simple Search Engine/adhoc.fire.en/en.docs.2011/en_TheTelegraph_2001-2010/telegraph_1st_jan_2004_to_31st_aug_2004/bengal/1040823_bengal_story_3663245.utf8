 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Staring at supply blackout
 							 - Fish to fuel, truckers strike casts shadow on essentials A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A truck driver lazes in his cabin on strike Day II. Picture by Amit Datta																								Calcutta, Aug. 22: Prices of essential commodities continued to creep up in most city markets as the nationwide truckers strike entered its second day. 																								Supplies from other states were badly hit as trucks and lorries stayed off the roads across the state. Rohu and katla fish from Andhra Pradesh are already rare. 																								The situation is likely to worsen tomorrow as traders who allegedly hoarded over the past week anticipating a shortage are releasing commodities with closed fists to jack up demand.																								In the last few days, the number of trucks and lorries arriving at Koley market in Sealdah was more than the count on normal days. There was no problem yesterday, but we are feeling the pinch today, said a green grocer.																								No loading or unloading will be allowed in Burrabazar or anywhere else and no truck would leave or enter the city. The government has not shown willingness to consider our demands and we will not give in, said Raja Roy, a leader of Calcutta Goods Transport Association.

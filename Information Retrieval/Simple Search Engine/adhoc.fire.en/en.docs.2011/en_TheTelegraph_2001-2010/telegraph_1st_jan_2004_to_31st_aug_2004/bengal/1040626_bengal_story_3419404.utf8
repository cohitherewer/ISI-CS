 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Part revival of IISCO
																								Durgapur, June 25: Union steel, chemical and fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan today unveiled a Rs 341-crore revival package for the Burnpur unit of Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) but ruled out reopening of its Kulti plant.																								The Bengal government has made several requests but we have no such plans (to reopen the Kulti plant). We have asked all 57 workers of the closed unit to opt for VRS, Paswan said. The Burnpur unit would be upgraded and modernised. The money, Paswan said, will be provided by financial institutions and the Government of India would be a guarantor.

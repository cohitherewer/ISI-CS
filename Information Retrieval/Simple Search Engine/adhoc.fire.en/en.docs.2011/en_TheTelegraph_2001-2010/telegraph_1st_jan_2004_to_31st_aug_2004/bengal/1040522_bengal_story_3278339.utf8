 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Two-year water deadlock breaks
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 21: The government today reiterated its pro-poor stand, assuring farmers better irrigation infrastructure with the promise of installing 800 power-driven tubewells.																								Finance minister Asim Dasgupta met minor irrigation minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya and power minister Mrinal Banerjee and resolved a two-year deadlock over who should bear the cost of installing the tubewells. The power and minor irrigation ministers had both refused to bear the brunt, despite agreeing that the scheme had to be implemented.																								The project would require providing additional electricity that the power department was not willing to subsidise. The minor irrigation department, on its part, said it could not bear the huge cost. 																								The government was, however, clear that the additional burden must not be passed on to the farmers.																								Dasgupta said the deadlock was resolved today. The finance department would offer support, the finance minister said.																								Subsidies will be offered if required. Installing 800 deep-, shallow- and mini-tubewells will ensure better irrigation facilities, but the farmers will not have to bear any financial burden for this, he said.																								The installation would require about Rs 40 crore and the government will take a soft loan from a financial organisation for this with the finance department playing the guarantor.																								The power would be supplied to the wells directly from sub-stations, which would prevent wastage. The installation of the tubewells is expected to raise the efficiency and productivity of agricultural land.

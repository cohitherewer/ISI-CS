 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Maoist spills KLO plan
 PROBIR PRAMANIK AND ANUPAM DASGUPTA 																								Siliguri, April 11: The Nepal Maoists are helping the KLO, which is still licking its wounds from the operation launched by Bhutan last December, to regroup, arrested Maoist leader Mohan Baidya has revealed.																								Baidya, the intellectual guru of Nepal Communist party (Maoist) chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Comrade Prachanda, told police that his outfit largely depended on guerrilla organisations of similar nature for access to virgin territories. 																								Information available with the BSF suggests a small bunch of KLO militants has forged a working relationship with the Nepal guerrillas to revive their organisation, the backbone of which was almost broken by the Royal Bhutan Army. 																								Post Operation All-Clear, intelligence agencies had warned that the KLO would make a last-ditch attempt to regroup with help from Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence or any other outside agency. There also were inputs about KLO self-styled commander-in-chief Jeevan Singha, who had eluded the Bhutan forces and escaped to Bangladesh, holding talks with the ISI bosses. 																								We have information that the KLO is seeking the Maoist guerrillas assistance to reassert themselves ahead of the general elections. In view of the perceived threats, we have increased vigil along sensitive stretches of the Indo-Bangla border, said BSF deputy inspector-general Sukhjinder Singh Sandhu. 																								For the Maoists, who are on the run, north Bengal is of vital importance as it can provide shelter far from the Hindu kingdom. On the other hand, the KLO militants can use parts of eastern Nepal as hideout after a strike, said a senior official of the Sashastra Suraksha Bal, earlier known as Special Services Bureau.

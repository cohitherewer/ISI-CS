The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Cable TV costlier
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 13: Cable television subscription rates are set to go up by Rs 50-75 across Bengal from next month as a fallout of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) announcement today lifting the freeze on prices. 																								In the past two years, operational costs have increased significantly owing to hikes by broadcasters, said Mrinal Chatterjee, a city cable operator. So long, cable operators were unable to pass it on to their customers, but the Trai order opens that route, he added.																								Most multi-system operators welcomed the decision but were cautious at the same time to push for a uniform increase on the ground causing as little inconvenience to the viewer as possible. 																								We will start a campaign among operators immediately to ensure standard subscription rates, said a spokesperson for RPG Netcom, the largest multi-system operator in the city. 																								CableComm shared RPG Netcoms concerns. We will discuss with our operators for a uniform increase, said a CableComm official.																								After the announcement, operator groups in the city held a series of meetings on their course of action. 																								According to early indications, the rates are to go up by a minimum of Rs 50 and a maximum of Rs 75. The hike is likely to be effective from September. Currently, cable subscription rates vary from Rs 150 to Rs 250 in the city. The rates are more or less the same in the districts.																								The regulator, appointed by the NDA government as a cable watchdog, cited increased service tax and introduction of education cess on cable services in the budget as reasons for the liberty to raise the rates. 																								Since the rates of taxes are decided by the central and state governments, it would not be appropriate for (Trai) to put a ceiling on such charges, it said. 																								In an order earlier this year, Trai had sealed the rates as prevalent on December 26, 2003.																								The multi-system operators are not happy that the government is collecting service tax from them as well as the local agents.

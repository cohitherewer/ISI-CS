The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 SFI wades into poll battle
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta/Burdwan, April 3: The Students Federation of India, the CPMs students wing, is playing a big role in the campaign for the Lok Sabha polls in Bengal.																								Students need to be involved in this years elections because never before have we faced a bigger threat from communal forces. We have to defeat forces like the BJP and Trinamul Congress, Apurba Chatterjee, the state SFI secretary, argued. He said students needed to be made aware of the BJP-led Centres move to privatise education. 																								The students also have the right to know what the Opposition and Left Front MPs have done for their respective constituencies. We want to show the students that Left Front MPs are way ahead in development work from their local area development funds compared to those belonging to the Opposition, said Chatterjee. 																								So, the SFI is sending out bulk mail to about six lakh students across the state, urging them to vote for Front candidates. 																								The organisation will also contact former members, who have passed out of schools and colleges, and request them to back the Front nominees. The SFI units of schools and colleges in the districts have been asked to draw up lists of ex-students for this purpose. 																								Moreover, it has brought out audiocassettes  of speeches of former chief minister Jyoti Basu and Rabindrasangeet and other songs by famous singers like Debabrata Biswas. 																								For the first time, the organisation is also taking Front candidates to colleges and universities to introduce them to the students. We have instructed our unions in the colleges and universities to take the candidates there. This will help the students have a first-hand knowledge about the candidates, said secretary Chatterjee. 																								The CPM alone has put up 70 candidates in the country, 34 of them in Bengal. We want to win all the 34 seats in this state. So, we want to engage all our frontal organisations, including the SFI, a party official said. 																								The Opposition Congress and Trinamul Congress sharply criticised the CPMs move. This is a blatant move to involve students in poll politics. At a time when students should be studying, they are being asked to attend meetings and write wall graffiti, said Rabindranath Chatterjee, president of the Burdwan district Congress.

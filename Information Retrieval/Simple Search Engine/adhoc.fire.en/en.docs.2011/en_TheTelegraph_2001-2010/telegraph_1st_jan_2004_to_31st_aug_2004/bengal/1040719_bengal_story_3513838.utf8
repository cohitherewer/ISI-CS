The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, July 19, 2004 Aged and challenged spared stair climb 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 18: If things go according to plan, the physically-challenged and the aged will soon be able to cast votes in polling booths at ground level.																								Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee today said his department would start identifying the disabled and the aged from the voters list to ensure that their booths were on the ground floor. No more climbing up stairs for them, said Banerjee. 																								We are doing this primarily in Calcutta, as well as other urban areas in the state, because polling stations are usually on floors above the ground level in these areas, he said.																								Changes in the room number of voters would be made according to necessity, he said, adding that the Election Commission has also said that a system needed to be evolved to help the aged and the physically-challenged.																								A lot of times, we hear of old people not being able to cast their votes because the booths are located above the ground floor and climbing up so many flights of stairs is extremely difficult. Also, the system appeared to be insensitive towards them. There should be separate arrangements for these special voters, said an official from the chief electoral officers department.																								The Supreme Court had ordered that ramps be constructed in polling stations before the recently-concluded elections. 																								Banerjee and his department will take the help of the state social welfare department in identifying the physically-challenged voters since it has a list of handicapped people. 																								The list may not give us the names of all handicapped voters. Therefore, we will publicise the move so that disabled and aged voters come and ask for the service, Banerjee added.																								People who declare that they cannot climb stairs for reasons of age or handicap will be offered the benefit. It is important to look at the number of people who need the arrangement. In case the number is huge, an auxiliary polling station may be offered to them, Banerjee said.

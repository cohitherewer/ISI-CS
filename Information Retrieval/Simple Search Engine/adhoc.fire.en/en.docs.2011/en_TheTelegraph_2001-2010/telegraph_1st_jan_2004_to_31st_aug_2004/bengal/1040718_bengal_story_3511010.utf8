 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Cry for Sonia as chancellor
 SOUMI BHATTACHARYA 																								Santiniketan, July 17: With the Visva-Bharati University executive council gearing up to pick names for the post of chancellor, the non-Left students union is pitching for Sonia Gandhi. 																								The varsity authorities will meet on July 24 to prepare a panel of three candidates and send it to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. As President, he has the right to nominate chancellors of central universities. 																								The Visva-Bharati Chhatra Sammilani members will urge the council members, including the vice-chancellor, to recommend the Congress chiefs name. 																								Union president Bhramar Bhandari said they will send a fax message to Sonia, calling upon her to replace former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as chancellor. Vajpayees term expired in January. 																								We have discussed the issue and will send our appeal to Soniaji in a day or two. We want somebody from the Gandhi-Nehru family to head our revered institution, Bhandari said. 																								Sharing his view, Kaushik Sinha Roy, a BA Part II student of Ancient History, said: Soniaji will be a fit candidate for the prestigious office as she belongs to a great family. 																								Varsity officials said in 1991, the council had included Sonias name in the panel for the chancellors post. We had referred Sonia Gandhis name to President Shankar Dayal Sharma after her husbands assassination. We included her name in the panel after the university employees union made a formal request, said a senior university official. 																								Although the Visva-Bharati Act of 1951 does not make it mandatory for a Prime Minister to become its chancellor, in most cases they have held the post. Litterateur Uma Shankar Joshi is the lone exception.

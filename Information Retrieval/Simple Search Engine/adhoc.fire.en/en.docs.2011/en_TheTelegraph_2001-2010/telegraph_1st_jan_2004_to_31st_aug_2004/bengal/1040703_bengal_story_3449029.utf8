The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
		 Saturday, July 03, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Debagram (Nadia), July 2: The station here, about 140 km from Calcutta, turned into a battlefield this morning when passengers travelling without tickets fought ticket examiners and Railway Protection Force jawans. 				 																																	Trains on the Sealdah-Lalgola section were disrupted for over three hours. 				 																																	Five ticket examiners and eight RPF jawans boarded the Sealdah-bound Lalgola Passenger at Behrampore around 5.30 am. By the time the train entered Paglachandi station around 6, about 50 passengers were caught ticketless. Daily labourers who work for railway contractors, they pleaded that they could not afford tickets. When the train stopped at Debagram 20 minutes later, they attacked the ticket examiners. Hundreds from the station joined in and the situation spun out of the jawans control.				 																																	Calcutta: Congress legislative party chief Atish Chandra Sinha urged the chief minister in the Assembly to visit Amlashol, where five people allegedly died of starvation. He also took on the government for its failure to eradicate poverty in rural Bengal.				 																																	Calcutta: High-school teacher Kalobaran Das was arrested on Friday morning on the charge of raping a teenage domestic help. The wife of the teacher of United High School, Ultadanga, complained to police against her husband.

 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Parents lock up school
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jalangi, Aug. 5: Guardians of students of a primary school here have forced its main entrance shut since Monday in protest against the authorities failure to find replacement for teachers transferred.																								Pradip Mondal, who was shifted on Monday, was the only one apart from teacher-in-charge Radheshyam Pal taking classes for some 218 boys and girls at Dayarampur Primary School, about 255 km from Calcutta. 																								Founded in 1942, the school had five teachers but the number came down following several transfers. Pal and Mondal were the only ones left. 																								Narendranath Sarkar, a guardian, said: My son Nirmal is a student of Class lV. With one teacher for more than 200 students, they will quarrel and fight. There is no need to keep the school open.

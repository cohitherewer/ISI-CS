 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Siliguri, May 22: Eleven councillors, including Independents and members of the Trinamul Congress and the Congress, today staged a walkout from the monthly board meeting of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation following a heated debate over Nantu Pal, who had switched over from the CPM to Trinamul before the Lok Sabha elections.																								The board was supposed to discuss important issues like income-expenditure plan for July and August. But instead of focussing on important issues, the CPM leaders began to make Nantu Pal an issue and asked him to resign from his post of a borough chairman because he has joined Trinamul. It had been made clear to them earlier too that people had voted for Pal and there was no reason for him to resign just because his party has changed. What was not acceptable was mayor Bikash Ghoshs brazen support to the unruliness of the CPM members. When the atmosphere became such that no business could be conducted, we walked out, said Gautam Deb, leader of the Opposition. 																								Deb said the CPM is frustrated because it lost the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat and also the court case Trinamul filed against them. The CPM is making Nantu Pal an issue only because it seems to be left with no other issues. The communists are working against democracy and are not letting us do the work of an Opposition party, he added. 																								This was the third consecutive board meeting in which the Opposition walked out. In the last meeting, too, the Opposition parties had stayed away.																								The CPM said Pal is bound to answer the questions raised against him. Which party does he belong to? He won elections on a CPM ticket, which made him the borough chairman. Now he has switched over to Trinamul. He should have resigned from the post on ethical grounds. We are not making Pal an issue. We are asking questions that are coming from the people who had voted for him. He is answerable to the people, a mayor-in-council member said.																								In fact, due to Trinamuls dismal performance in the state, they are left with no issues. When they are confronted with genuine questions of the people, they make it an issue and stage a walkout, he added.																								In Calcutta, Trinamul spokesman Pankaj Banerjee said: Our protest against the CPMs attempts to throttle democracy is quite justified.

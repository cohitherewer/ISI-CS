 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 CM assigns cadre as monitors 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 13: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today asked the CPM units in the districts to report instances of underdevelopment and human hardship, if any, so that government departments could be directed to meet the crisis. 																								Speaking on the concluding day of the CPM state committee meeting, sources said Bhattacharjee asked the district party units to be more vigilant. 																								We want a balanced development in the state. First of all, we have to give special emphasis on improving the remote villages where there are still no power, no health centres, no schools and, moreover, the people has no work. We have to improve their life and provide them the basic minimum needs. We want that development activities should not be concentrated in any particular region, he said. 																								Bhattacharjee told the district units to verify the needs and demands of the people and prepare a note on what needed to be taken up on a priority basis. 																								The advise follows criticism over alleged starvation deaths at Amlashol, a remote tribal-populated village in West Midnapore. The chief minister himself admitted that conditions of starvation prevailed in the region. 																								According to party insiders, state committee members from Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore urged the party leadership to ask the government to take up more development activities. 																								After briefly describing the development programmes taken up by the government, the chief minister, the sources said, asked the party leaders to ensure they are implemented and people are benefited.																								While Bhattacharjee and his cabinet colleagues furnished details of progress on different rural development schemes, a section of party leaders feel there has been a lack of balance in the implementation of the schemes . 																								They also alleged that excessive bureaucratic delay and formalities hampered the development process.																								Leaders from the backward districts pointed out that though the government has constituted a Paschimanchal Unnayan Parshad, it has not achieved much. 																								The Peoples War activists are gaining support of the villagers as they have managed to convince them about poor pace of development. Though many development works have been taken up during the Left Front regime, we feel it is insufficient in meeting needs and demands, said a state committee leader.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Order to probe IIT death
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 23: Calcutta High Court today directed the Criminal Investigation Department to probe the death of Nishit Karwa, a third-year electronics student of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.																								Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh issued the order to D.P. Tarania, the deputy inspector-general (CID).																								The body of the 21-year-old student from Jodhpur was found hanging from a rod in the window of room 215 in Nehru Hall on August 12, said local police.																								Nishits family had demanded a full-fledged inquiry into his death.																								Abha Roy, the counsel for the state, told the court today that it was a case of suicide. The investigation by the Kharagpur town police and the post-mortem report had made it clear that it was a case of suicide and there is nothing more to it, Roy said.																								However, Ashim Ghosh, appearing on behalf of the Karwas, argued that the case demands further investigation as the reports of forensic experts do not tally either with the post-mortem report or the police version. The death of the boy under mysterious circumstances demands a separate probe as the reports of the forensic experts contradict the findings by the police, argued the lawyer.																								Nishits fellow students sensed something was wrong when they found the door of his room locked from inside for long. On breaking open the door, they found him hanging from the window rod. The institute director, S.K. Dubey, was informed and he reported the death to the local police.																								The students family flew in the following day on learning of the death. On reaching Kharagpur, H.P. Karwa, Nishits father, registered a case with the Kharagpur town police, alleging foul play. In his complaint, Karwa claimed his son was murdered.																								Karwa had spent two days in Calcutta with his son a week before the incident. He had told the police that his son was not under any stress and when he last spoke to Nishit over phone a day before the incident the student sounded all right. Karwa demanded a proper probe into the case.																								Police, however, ruled out murder. Circumstantial evidence suggested that Nishit had committed suicide, said a senior police official.																								Justice Ghosh, after hearing the arguments put forward by both sides, ordered the CID to initiate a fresh probe and file a report within three months. Ensure a thorough probe into the death of Nishit Karwa and submit the investigation report within three months, he told the CID.

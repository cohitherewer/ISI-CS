 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Suicide pointer to potato plight
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, March 14: The plight of potato farmers in the state came into focus today when Surajit Debnath identified a body at the morgue of Kalna Subdivisional Hospital as that of his father Judhistir. 																								A potato farmer, Judhistir had committed suicide. He had gone missing on Thursday. After searching several morgues and hospitals, Surajit found his father this morning. 																								Government Railway Police recovered the body from the tracks near Samudragarh in the Katwa-Bandel division, about 180 km from Calcutta, on Friday. It was sent for postmortem to the subdivisional hospital, said the district police chief.																								Surajit told the police his father had borrowed Rs 11 lakh after incurring huge losses in potato farming. He had to sell his land for a living. The creditors often visited the Debnath residence demanding money and quarrels were common. 																								Surajit informed the police that regular quarrels with the creditors prompted his father to commit suicide, said a senior police official. 																								Kalna potato dealers association secretary Bijon Seth said most farmers were faced with the same predicament. A recurring high yield has led to low prices and the farmers have suffered the most. Demands to fix a minimum price have gone unheeded. Suicides, Seth said, could be the only escape for many more.

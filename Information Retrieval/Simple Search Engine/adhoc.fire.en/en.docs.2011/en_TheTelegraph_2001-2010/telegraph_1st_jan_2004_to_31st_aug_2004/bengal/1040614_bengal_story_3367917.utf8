 VIVEK CHHETRI				 	 Narbula at the felicitation. Picture by Suman Tamang																								Darjeeling, June 13: Dawa Narbula, the Congress MP from Darjeeling, today said he would raise the issue of Gorkhaland when the Centre starts working on the separate state of Telengana. Narbula was backed by Subash Ghisingh in the elections. 																								Narbula, who was felicitated by the Gorkha National Liberation Fronts (GNLF) Darjeeling branch committee at Capitol Hall here, said he had broached the topic with senior Congress leaders in New Delhi. 																								Even the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance has a mention of Telengana. I have told the (party) leaders that I too have the right to speak for a separate state if the Telegana issue crops up, said Narbula. Observers feel that with the Left Front supporting the UPA from outside, it is unlikely the Centre would considers Narbulas demand seriously.																								Though Narbulas party is still a member of the Peoples Democratic Front (PDF), a conglomeration of five anti-Ghisingh parties, Narbula thanked the (GNLF) chairman (Ghisingh) for supporting the Congress and ensuring its victory in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha election.																								Though it was the demand for a separate state that had given birth to the GNLF, Narbula maintained that the party had not asked for any commitments from him or the Congress high command for its support. 																								The fact that the chairman decided to support the Congress without imposing any condition made me feel that the chairman took a decision taking into consideration the welfare of the people, said Narbula.																								He added that he had told Sonia Gandhi, the Congress president, about the decision taken by Ghisingh. On May 2 itself, when the chairman announced his decision to extend support to the Congress, my party workers in Islampur brought out a victory rally as they were very happy. We won the election the day the GNLF decided to extend support to us, added Narbula.																								The newly-elected Congress candidate said the days of the hill people have finally come. 																								It is after a long time that the people of the region have sent an MP from the same party which has come to power at the Centre and I believe that the good days have come back, he said. Narbula also listed his priorities and said he has talked to water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi about the water crisis in Darjeeling. 																								Narbula, who was propped up as the PDF-backed Congress candidate before the GNLF decided to extend support, said all parties should work together for the welfare of the hill people.

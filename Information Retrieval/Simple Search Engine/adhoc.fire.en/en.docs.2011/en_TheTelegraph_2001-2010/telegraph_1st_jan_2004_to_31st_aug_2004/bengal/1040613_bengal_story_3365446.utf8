The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 Israel boost to farming, dairy amp; flower export
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Danieli in Calcutta. (PTI)																								Calcutta, June 12: Israel has offered to be one of the major providers of modern irrigation technology to Bengal and help it in flower export, dairy farming and fruit and vegetable cultivation.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee received this assurance from Israeli ambassador David Danieli during an hour-long meeting on Thursday. 																								Bhattacharjees positive talks with Danieli were in sharp contrast to the Lefts known antipathy towards the enemy of the Palestinian people.																								The CPM and other Left parties had persuaded the Congress-led UPA government to address the Palestinian issue in the common minimum programme.																								The chief ministers discussion with the Israeli ambassador, however, appears to be a logical fallout of his predecessor Jyoti Basus visit to Israel in 2000 along with the then chairman of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, Somnath Chatterjee.																								The government of Israel has agreed to assist the state to step up agro-productivity and thereby augment the farmers income. Danieli, who was on a three-day trip to Calcutta, left for Delhi yesterday.																								Joint activities in this regard in Andhra Pradesh have yielded positive results. Our country can provide hi-tech water management, post-harvesting technology, better fertilisers and seeds to increase productivity, Danieli told The Telegraph before his departure. 																								He described Israel as the third-biggest exporter of flowers after the Netherlands and Colombia and said its milk production was more than three times that of India. 																								This was Danielis first visit to Calcutta. He also indicated a keen interest in the iron and steel, leather and gems and jewellery sectors in Bengal. In these sectors, we can play the role of a buyer. All Indian products are valued in our country and it is a good brand name, he said. We would like to send more Israeli delegations to Calcutta for better interaction. Israel has good relations with India and Bengal is no exception.																								The Israeli ambassador said his country was a major exporter of diamond and a substantial part of cutting and polishing of the precious stone was done in India. Israel is a world centre for diamond trade. These diamonds can be cut, set and polished in Indian states including Bengal.																								He said he knew that some of the best diamond cutters and setters in Maharashtra and Gujarat hailed from Bengal. 																								Danieli asserted that Israeli infotech companies were very active in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Mumbai. I intend to draw their attention to the new opportunities available in Bengal where the IT industry has already taken off, he said.

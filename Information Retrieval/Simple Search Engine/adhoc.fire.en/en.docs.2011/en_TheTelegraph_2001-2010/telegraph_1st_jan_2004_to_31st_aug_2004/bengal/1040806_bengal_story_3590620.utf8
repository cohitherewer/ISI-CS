				 																																	Calcutta, Aug. 5: Kaushik Tripathy has never had time to play. Apart from studying, the 18-year-old from Bamunsayee village in West Midnapore spends his waking hours making sal leaf plates. 				 																																	Despite the odds, he ranked ninth in JEE and secured admission to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. The chief minister today promised to fund Kaushiks education. Dont worry. We will sponsor your education, hostel and books. Ebar ektu hansho (now smile), he told him at Writers.				 																																	Calcutta: Dissident BJP leaders have floated a forum called Jai Jawan Jai Kishan with former party general secretary Sunil Shastri at the helm. Forum spokesman Muzaffar Khan said it will soon organise a rally in the city but the BJP denied its existence.				 																																	Krishnagar: Saraswati Chowdhury, 43, hanged herself at Kalyanis Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital apparently unable to bear the pressure of being childless after 15 years of marriage. Hospital authorities said she was admitted on Sunday with abdominal pain. 				 																																	Calcutta: Visitors entry to Dum Dum international airport has been barred for 10 days from Saturday.

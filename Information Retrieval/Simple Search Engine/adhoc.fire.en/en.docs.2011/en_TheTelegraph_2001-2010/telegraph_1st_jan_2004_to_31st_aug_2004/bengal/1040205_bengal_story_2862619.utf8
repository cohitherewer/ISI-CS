The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Ruckus at CM-Kamal show 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Chinsurah, Feb. 4: Agriculture minister Kamal Guha, who has been at loggerheads with the chief minister, be it over the agriculture policy or starvation deaths in tea gardens or the choice of a Lok Sabha polls candidate, shared a platform with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today. 																								I am happy to share a public rally with the chief minister after one-and-a-half years. We shall be able to settle the minor problems through discussions, Guha said tonight on his return from Chinsurah. 																								After the bout over the agriculture policy, Guha insisted that over 500 people died of starvation in the tea gardens of north Bengal while Bhattacharjee asserted that only a few deaths occurred due to malnutrition and lack of medical care. 																								The Forward Bloc leader also rubbed the CPM the wrong way by nominating Hiten Barman as a Left Front candidate from the Cooch Behar Lok Sabha seat though the CPM intends to put up Amar Roy Pradhan, expelled Bloc leader and sitting MP. The matter is expected to come up at the Left Fronts meeting on Friday when the final list of Front nominees will be announced.  Guha and Bhattacharjee opened  an agricultural fair in connection with the centenary celebrations  of the Rice Research Farm here. But the coming-together  was marred by demonstrations by angry employees at the state-run  farm. 																								They gheraoed agriculture secretary Sukhvilas Barma to protest against the fact that the ministers  finance minister Asim Dasgupta had come too  did not care to visit the original building of the farm and left after delivering speeches and visiting a few stalls at the fair. 																								The 350-odd employees were also aggrieved that they did not get their salaries today due to the programme that came after an extended weekend.

 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Blame on Delhi for arsenic
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 2: Paucity of central funds has prevented a full-fledged fightback against arsenic in drinking water, public health engineering minister Gautam Deb said today. 																								The government has written to Union minister for rural development Raghuvansh Prasad Singh seeking intervention. Deb said: We need immediate funds for schemes to contain arsenic contamination. At least 28 lakh people in the two 24-Parganas, Malda, Murshidabad and Nadia are under serious threat. The contamination has to be tackled in phases. We require at least Rs 1,200 crore, Deb said. 																								Short-term projects to contain the contamination include installing hand-pumps. Supply of pure drinking water in affected areas is part of the mid-term plan and a permanent solution lies in creating drinking water supply systems using surface water.

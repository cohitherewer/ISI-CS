 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, April 8: The West Midnapore authorities today unveiled measures to ensure peaceful elections in Naxalite-infested Belpahari, Binpur, Goaltore, Lalgarh and Salboni.																								Carrying guns and firearms, even if they are licensed, has been banned till counting of votes is over. District magistrate Chandan Sinha said civilians would have to submit their arms to police stations in areas where the Peoples War has a presence.																								Superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said army-trained crack commandos would be deployed along with paramilitary forces in Belpahari, Salboni and adjoining areas to keep an eye on the Peoples War-Maoist Communist Centre guerillas.																								A deputy inspector-general and three officers of superintendent rank will keep vigil in the militant-infested areas, Kumar said. We are very alert about any possible acts of violence.																								We have already arrested 2,500 people with criminal record. The Opposition parties had complained about accumulation of arms but no specific complaints have been lodged, the district police chief said.																								Though the authorities said they did not have any information about a poll boycott call by the Peoples War, Left Front chairman Biman Bose said at a meeting at Shilda in Belpahari that the outfit has asked villagers in at least 15 booth areas not to vote.																								To instil confidence in voters, officials will go around Keshpur, Garbeta and Pingla, where the Opposition parties had accused the CPM of employing terror tactics during the Assembly polls of 2001.

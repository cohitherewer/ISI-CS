The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Laloo on mission to wrest hot seat
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Feb. 22: Laloo Prasad Yadav will be in town on March 1 to coax the CPM to part with the Calcutta Northwest Lok Sabha seat.																								The CPM had left it to Laloo Prasads party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, in 1999. This time, it wants to field its own candidate to cash in on a possible split in Opposition votes.																								Laloo Prasad will lodge a protest with Jyoti Basu against the denial. He will also attend a seminar on coalition politics organised by Ganashakti, the CPM mouthpiece. To get even, Laloo Prasad had said he would not give two seats to the CPM in Bihar. 																								RJD parliamentary party leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh today reiterated his leaders bargaining chip but also said: CPM leaders will discuss the matter with Lalooji at a meeting in Delhi on March 25. 																								Basu, a CPM politburo member, said tonight he had heard about the RJDs unwillingness to offer us (the CPM) two seats in Bihar. Let Laloo come and discuss it with us. We want to put up our nominee for Calcutta Northwest, which we are sure to wrest this time because of infighting within Mamatas Trinamul Congress, he added. 																								Trinamul has replaced its MP from the city seat, Sudip Bandopadhyay, with mayor Subrata Mukherjee. But Bandopadhyay is unwilling to move out and has indicated that he would rather contest as an Independent from the seat.																								Trinamul chief and Union coal and mines minister Mamata Banerjee has decided to steer Mukherjees electoral campaign to counter the rebel MP. 																								The Congress today decided to field state unit working president Pradip Bhattacharya in Calcutta Northwest. Bhattacharya, who is in Delhi to finalise party chief Sonia Gandhis campaign programme in the state, said he would not mind entering the fray in the prestigious seat.

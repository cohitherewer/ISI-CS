The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Bandh plea to minnows
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, July 31: Mamata Banerjee today warned the government not to play with fire by trying to foil Mondays 12-hour bandh and appealed to the minor Left Front parties to support the strike. 																								We have called the bandh in protest against the move to introduce the West Bengal Block-level Pre-litigation Conciliatory Board Bill, 2004. I warn that the CPM will oust grassroots workers of minor front partners like RSP, CPI and Forward Bloc from village-level committees once the bill is passed. The CPM will induct its own cadre in such committees, she said this afternoon. 																								The Trinamul Congress chief threatened a fresh movement if the communists tried to thwart the bandh. The more they try to suppress our movement, the more we will react. This is our battle for survival. No movement can be suppressed by force... our workers will face bullets, she said. 																								The MP asked the CPM not to organise a rally at Esplanade on Monday. This is unethical. The CPM is heading for confrontation..., she said. The Trinamul Youth Congress has planned a rally at the venue on bandh day. 																								The CPM will force supporters of minor front partners in the villages to go by the verdicts passed by rural conciliatory bodies, which will be formed with CPM men only, she said. 																								Mamatas attempt to drive a wedge in the front fell flat on its face. This is childish... We wonder how Mamata dares to make such an appeal to us, said RSP leader Sunil Sengupta. 																								Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh said: We want Mamata to call it (the bandh) off in greater interest of people, he added. 																								The administration has asked all district magistrates to maintain normality on Monday. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said buses and other modes of transport would run as usual.

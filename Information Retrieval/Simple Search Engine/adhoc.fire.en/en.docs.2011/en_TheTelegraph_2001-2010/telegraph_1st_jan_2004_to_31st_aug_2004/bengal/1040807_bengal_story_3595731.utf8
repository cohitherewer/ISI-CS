 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Court questionnaire on plastic bag bar
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 6: The high court today asked for a report from the government on the harmful impact of plastic.																								Justice Barin Ghosh also wanted the government to inform the court in four weeks if a law banning the use and manufacture of plastic carry bags was in the offing.																								The same order asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to tell the court its system of dumping plastic bags, their segregation and recycling. 																								The judge had a set of queries for the Plastic Manufacturers Association as well. Justice Ghosh asked if developed countries like the US, UK, Germany and France had banned the use of plastic.																								The order followed a petition by a lawyer, Pradip Suchanti, who demanded a ban on the use and manufacture of plastic bags across the state to scale down pollution and health hazards.																								Opposing the petition, members of the Plastic Manufacturers Association told the court that the government had already imposed a ban on the use and manufacture of plastic in hill and coastal areas.																								The ban order was issued by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and it is illegal because an executive order by a state government department cannot prevent manufacturers from producing goods, said the lawyer representing the association members.																								He also pointed out that there was no national or state law banning the use of plastic articles. So, an executive order from the pollution control board cannot be executed. Plastic carry bags are being used in almost all developed countries as there is no such ban there, he said. 																								Plastic bags, the counsel added, pose no health hazard and only choke drains.																								The judge wanted to know from the corporations counsel what steps it had taken to stop the use of plastic bags. 																								An awareness programme has been launched, the lawyer said. What more can we do than ask shops and establishments not to use such bags? 																								The governments counsel told the court that it has banned poly bags from the premises of historical monuments and certain public places. 																								However, legal experts said in the absence of a law, the use of plastic bags cannot be banned altogether.

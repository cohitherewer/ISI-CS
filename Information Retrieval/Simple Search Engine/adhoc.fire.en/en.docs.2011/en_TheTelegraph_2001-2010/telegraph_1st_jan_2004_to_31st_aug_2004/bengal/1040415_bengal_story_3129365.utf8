 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Salary fraud on campus recruits 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Burdwan, April 14: A computer firm owner has been arrested on charges of duping 45 persons, including 30 students of Burdwan University and the Industrial Training Institute for women. 																								Credence Infosolution had hired the people to promote online marketing. But after a months work, the salary cheques they received bounced. They lodged an FIR with Burdwan police station, following which firm director Avijit Kapuria was arrested.																								The company had recruited many students but could not pay them salaries. We have arrested Avijit Kapuria on charges of cheating these students, said K.C. Meena, Burdwan police superintendent. 																								Twenty-two of the Credence employees were fourth year students of the University Institute of Technology (UIT), controlled by Burdwan University, and were recruited after campus interview. Seven students were from the state-owned ITI and the rest were recruited from outside. 																								Burdwan University registrar Shoroshi Mohan Dawn said the university has started an inquiry into how the firm got permission for campus interviews. 																								The officer on special duty at the UIT in charge of placement, S.. Chowdhury, said different companies approach the university to hold campus interviews. We speak to the representatives of these companies and if we are satisfied, we allow them to interact with students. But we never realised our students will be cheated, he added.																								Kapuria was released on bail today. He said Credence wanted to develop the online marketing concept but could not raise enough funds. The cheques bounced because there was not enough money in the bank, he added. 																								But the recruits alleged they had to pay a security deposit ranging between Rs 5,000 and 7,000 each.

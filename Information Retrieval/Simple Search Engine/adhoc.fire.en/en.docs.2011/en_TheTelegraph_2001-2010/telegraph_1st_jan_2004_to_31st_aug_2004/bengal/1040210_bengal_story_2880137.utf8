 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 9: The chief minister has asked the youth services department to sanction loans to young entrepreneurs at the earliest. 																								Addressing a programme on the third anniversary of Bangla Swanirvar Karmasansthan Prakalpa, a self-employment scheme, he said: Earlier, banks used to take time to sanction loans but with our intervention, the picture has changed. The youth services department was also responsible for the delay, which prompted me to talk to the minister (Mohammed Salim).																								Under the scheme, banks give 70 per cent of the required sum, the government gives 20 per cent and the rest is borne by the applicant. The chief minister handed over cheques to 200 young entrepreneurs today. Salim, the CPM candidate for the Lok Sabha from Calcutta Northeast, accompanied Bhattacharjee.

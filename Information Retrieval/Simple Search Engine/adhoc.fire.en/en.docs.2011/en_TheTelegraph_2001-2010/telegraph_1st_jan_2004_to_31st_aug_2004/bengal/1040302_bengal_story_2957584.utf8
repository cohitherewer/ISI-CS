 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Brides branded witches after express crash
 MEHEDI HIDAYTULLAH AND SAROJ SINHAMarch 1: Three days after the Kanchenjunga Express rammed into a mini-bus and turned Dilip and Ranjit Rishis marriage celebrations into mourning, the newlywed brides are running scared with superstitious villagers thirsting for their blood.																								Branded witches for killing 11 people soon after their wedding, residents of Sadhopur village in Bihars Purnea district have warned the grooms families not to allow the brides  from Majlispur in the Chakulia police station area in North Dinajpur to enter the hamlet. They claimed the brides would bring bad luck to the community.																								While Basanti Devi, one of the brides, fled to her parents in Majlispur, the other, Jago Devi, and her aunt Lako Devi, have disappeared without a trace. The villagers had tried to lynch Jago and Basanti on Saturday.																								That the Sumo in which the newlyweds were travelling had crossed the unmanned level crossing moments before the train smashed the bus was interpreted as an evil omen by the villagers who gathered outside the Rishi household demanding that the brides be handed to them.																								They (the villagers) wanted to burn my daughter (Jago) alive the day after the accident. She ran away from her in-laws place and has been missing since, said Kalo Rishi. I had sent my son to Sadhopur to enquire about her, but the villagers nearly beat him up. He was lucky to escape unharmed. He said Jagos husband, Ranjit Rishi, had also fled Sadhopur and taken shelter in his house.																								Villagers have boycotted us as many of their relatives who had come along to attend the wedding are either dead or in critical condition, Ranjit said. 																								They have threatened to burn the brides alive if they enter the village, he added.																								Basanti was escorted to her parents house in Majlispur late on Sunday night by her father-in-law Narayan Rishi.																								Basanti said: Villagers surrounded the house and shouted that they wanted to burn me alive. My husband Dilip fled, but my father-in-law rescued me from the crowd and took me back to Majlispur. 																								Her father Mahichand Rishi is unable to come to terms with the events. I do not know what to do. My daughters in-laws have made it clear that they will not accept her.																								North Dinajpur district magistrate Manish Jain said he could not take legal action. But I will speak to my counterparts in Purnea to ensure there is no violence.

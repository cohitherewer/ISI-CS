 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Mob at war after child is run over
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Dankuni (Hooghly), April 9: A truck laden with soil climbed onto a footpath in Dankuni and crushed under its wheels 12-year-old Tinku Singh, who was bathing at a wayside tap. 																								His friend Tarak Naskar, 12, had to be hospitalised.																								Within minutes, Raghunathpur Bazar, about 25 km from Calcutta, turned a battlefield with residents taking on passing trucks and then policemen who came to rein them in. 																								A mob burnt three trucks. A subinspector was hit in the head by a stone hurled at the police. Sensing that the situation was spinning out of control, the police fired in the air. That incited a fresh assault. Teargas shells and rubber bullets had little effect. The crowd finally yielded to a baton charge. Over a dozen people were arrested.																								Serampore subdivisional police officer Shankha Subhra Chakraborty said the truck from Uttarpara hit the children around 8.20 am. Local people gave the vehicle a chase. The driver managed to escape but the vehicle was set afire. In no time, two more trucks were ablaze, Chakraborty said.																								Tinkus father Rajput said: The truck crashed through the tap and into the wall of my house. My son was trapped between the vehicle and the rubble. He died as I looked on.

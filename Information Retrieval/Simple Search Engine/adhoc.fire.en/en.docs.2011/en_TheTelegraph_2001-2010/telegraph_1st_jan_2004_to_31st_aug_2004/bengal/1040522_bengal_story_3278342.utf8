 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Headmaster branded insane
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMidnapore, May 21: The managing committee of a high school in West Midnapore has barred a headmaster from work for four years alleging that he is insane.																								Sabyasachi Patnaik appeared before medical boards thrice and was certified fit on every occasion but the bosses at Tiorberia Jagannathpur Troilakkyanath Ramanath High School in Daspur, about 80 km from Calcutta, have not budged.																								The district inspector of schools has now threatened the committee with action for not allowing the headmaster to work. Nurus Aslam has warned the panel members that they will be if dismissed if they continued to disturb Patnaik and prevent him from entering the school.																								We are not bothered about what the committee has to say about the headmaster. Patnaik had appeared before medical boards thrice and every time he was declared fit. He has every right to function as the headmaster and we will ensure that, Aslam said.																								Headmaster since 1994, Patnaik was asked in end-1998 not to come to the school as his presence could be dangerous for the 600-odd students.																								Assistant headmaster Sambhunath Manna said: Sometimes Patnaik behaved like a mad man. He used to beat up students mercilessly and without reason. They complained against him.																								He added that Patnaik often came to school in a lungi. Students are not at all safe in the hands of Patnaik and we cannot allow him to work, Manna said. Secretary of the school managing committee M.. Maity nodded. 																								Patnaik said he was being hounded because he found fault in the way the school funds were managed. I worked for 14 years as an assistant teacher before joining this school as headmaster. No one had complained, he said when asked about the charges against him.																								I appeared before a board at Bankura Sammilani Medical College, which certified me fit in January 1999. But four days after I resumed work, the managing committee again charged me with insanity. I ignored it but the teachers refused to talk to me, Patnaik said. 																								Twice after that he was certified sane but the school panel has slammed the doors shut.

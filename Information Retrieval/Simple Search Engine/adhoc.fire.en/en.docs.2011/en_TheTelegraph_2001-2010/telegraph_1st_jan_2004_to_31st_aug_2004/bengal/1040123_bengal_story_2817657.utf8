 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Classmates, lover in teen death net
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Krishnagar, Jan. 22: Three teenagers, including a girl, were arrested today in connection with the death of Amit Saha, a resident of Kalyani whose decomposed body was found nine days ago. 																								Totan Saha and Tushar Das, two 17-year-old classmates of Amit, and 15-year-old Rinki Das, with whom Amit was having an affair, were held. Amit, a Class XII student of Adarsha Shikshayatan, in Kalyani went missing on September 22. 																								On January 14, the police arrested Rinkis brother Shekhar, 20. Amits father, Haripada, had accused Shekhar of his sons murder in his complaint at Kalyani police station. 																								The police had decided to arrest Laltu Ghosh, a close friend of Amit, but finally did not. They said he could provide important leads to the death. 																								After interrogating several persons, the police said Amit and Rinki, a Class IX student of a girls school at nearby Gayeshpur, had developed a close relation. The affair made Totan and Tushar jealous as they were apparently interested in her. They reportedly threatened Amit several times asking him to sever his ties with Rinki. 																								But the boy was desperate. One day after getting another round of threats he wrote to Rinki asking whether she loved him. The girl wrote back, saying Amit she did not have any soft corner for either Totan or Tushar. We got both letters, said district police superintendent Benoy Chakraborty. 																								Rinki initially tried to mislead the police. But she accepted her relation with Amit after we got her letter in a book seized from Amits house, he added. 																								Chakraborty said Amits murder revolved round Rinki. So, we suspect Rinki knows the murderer and we need to interrogate her intensely, he added. 																								Police suspect the arrested duo contacted Shekhar. Shekhar conspired with the two because he did not like Amit and played a key role in kidnapping him, said an official.

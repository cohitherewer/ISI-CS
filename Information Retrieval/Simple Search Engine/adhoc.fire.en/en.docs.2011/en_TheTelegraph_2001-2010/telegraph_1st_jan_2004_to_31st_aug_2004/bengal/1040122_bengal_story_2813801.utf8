 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Unions spill blood in garden over crisis funds
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jalpaiguri, Jan. 21: A young man was killed and many others injured at Grassmore tea estate in Nagarcata last night as Citu and Intuc activists clashed over the demand to refund an emergency fund contribution.																								Garden resident Sunit Toppo, 24, an Intuc supporter who was injured in the clash, died at Malbazar hospital. 																								Eight people have been arrested and Grassmore is on alert with police patrolling the precincts of the garden.																								The clash was preceded by a skirmish in the evening when Intuc took out a rally to press for disbursement of the fighting fund, created by the Citu in the mid-1990s with a contribution of Rs 35,000 from the workers affiliated to it. The aim was to build a nest egg for periods of crisis.																								Over the years, political equations changed in the garden with many workers switching over to the Intuc-affiliated National Union of Plantation Workers. The Citu, though, remained the only union recognised by the management.																								Trouble started when the tea industry entered a trough and the workers dues started mounting. At Grassmore, where provident fund dues crossed Rs 1.5 crore, the labourers were getting fortnightly wages once in five terms and ration supplies and other benefits were stopped.																								Finding the going tough, the labourers belonging to the union of plantation workers said the Citu must release their contribution to the fighting fund. The demand was promptly rejected. 																								This was followed by a Citu rally on Sunday, at which members raised slogans against the distribution of the fighting fund. The union of plantation workers held a retaliatory rally yesterday, insisting that the labourers be refunded their emergency fund contribution. 																								Leader of the National Union of Plantation Workers Mani Kumar Darnal said the clash was triggered by Citu members who threatened rallyists and hurled stones in the presence of the police. This sparked off the disturbance. At night, they attacked us again. Sunit was seriously injured in this strike. He later died at Malbazar. If the police do not arrest the murderers, the law and order situation in the garden might worsen, said Darnal.																								Ashu Sarkar, a CPM and Citu leader of Nagarcata, said: We were attacked by the anti-socials in the Intuc, who abused and threatened our supporters.																								Asked how Sunit was hurt, Sarkar said: Congress and Intuc leaders are responsible for his death. They were the ones to instigate the labourers to fight against each other. The refund demand is an excuse to oust us.

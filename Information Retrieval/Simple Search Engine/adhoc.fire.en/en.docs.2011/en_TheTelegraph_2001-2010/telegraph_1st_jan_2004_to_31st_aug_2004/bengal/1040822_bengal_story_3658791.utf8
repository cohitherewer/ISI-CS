The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Smugglers fell trees in Sunderbans
 DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY																								Calcutta, Aug. 21: Smugglers reportedly supported by the ruling party have over the past month cleared a 4-km stretch along the Matla river of nearly 50,000 Sundari, Hetal, and Keora trees.																								The tree-felling scandal broke even as the state government today observed Sunderbans Day at Patharpratima in South 24-Parganas, about 120 km from Calcutta.																								The Sunderbans Development Board lodged a complaint with the police that some members of the force were turning a blind eye to the felling of trees.																								The felling started in July along the bank of the Matla river in Bhangankhali in Kanthalberia gram panchayat and Narayantala in Phulmalancha gram panchayat about 120 km from Calcutta.																								Villagers of the area, led by the RSP MLA from Basanti, Subhas Naskar, had reported the tree felling to forest minister Jogesh Chandra Barman, Sunderbans development affairs minister Kanti Ganguly and Maheswar Murmu, the minister of state in charge of Paschimanchal Unnayan affairs, when they had visited the area to attend a programme on the Sunderbans.																								The ministers ordered a probe. But till today they could not make any arrest, said RSP leader Lokman Mollah.

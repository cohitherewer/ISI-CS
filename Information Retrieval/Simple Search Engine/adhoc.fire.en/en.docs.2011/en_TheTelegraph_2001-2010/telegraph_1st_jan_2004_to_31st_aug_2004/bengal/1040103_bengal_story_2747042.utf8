 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 2: After signing a memorandum of understanding today with a British firm to supply flowers, vegetables and fruits to England, the Food Processing and Horticulture Development Corporation took up a Rs 2-crore project to set up a sorting, grading and processing unit at Nadias Haringhata.																								The Agriculture and Processed Food Export Development Authority has provided Rs 1.73 crore for the Haringhata project. Mullickghat Phoolbazar Parichalan Samiti chairman Sudhanshu Sil, who first conceived the idea to open an export window for flower farmers in the international market two years ago, said the state government has given 100 acres for the plant. 																								The vegetables, grown with bio-fertilisers in Hooghly and North 24-Parganas, have found a market in the UK and the first contingent of ladys finger, brinjal and capsicum will be airlifted to London soon, food processing department officials said. 																								Shibnath Ganguly, a representative of Ansib, a Middlesex-based company, and senior officials of the horticulture development corporation signed on the dotted line in the presence of food processing minister Sailen Sarkar. 																								Besides marketing cut-flowers and green vegetables from Bengal, Ansib has agreed to market four varieties of mango  Himsagar, Langra, Lakshman Bhog and Amrapali  in London, said deputy manager of the corporation Subrata Bose. 																								The corporation has already set up a sorting, grading and processing plant in Malda. Two more plants will soon come up at Haringhata and Siliguri.																								The vegetables will be collected from special farms in the Tarakeswar-Arambag belt of Hooghly, and Habra, Gaighata and some other areas of North 24-Parganas, said Bose. No chemical fertilisers or pesticides will be used to grow these vegetables, he added.

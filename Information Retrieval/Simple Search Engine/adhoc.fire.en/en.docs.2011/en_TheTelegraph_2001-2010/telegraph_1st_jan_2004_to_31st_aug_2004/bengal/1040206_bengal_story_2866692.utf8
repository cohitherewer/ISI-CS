The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Kanti confesses to flaws in education policy
 SUNANDO SARKAR				 	 Kanti Biswas: For whom the alarm bells rang Calcutta, Feb. 5: Amar  buk bhenge jaye (My heart breaks). Its very appropriate  when it comes from school education minister Kanti Biswas.																								From a Calcutta Book Fair programme  where he refuses to defend the indefensible, accepts criticism and asks for understanding from a staunch critic of the education policy  to a chat with the media, Biswas seems to have woken up to the follies for which the states youth are paying.																								After decades of being a prime votary of the states no-English-in-primary-classes policy and everything orthodox (critics say regressive) in school education, Biswas is now unusually defensive. 																								A day after the fair surprise  those from his party who were present at the programme said they had never seen any minister so defensive  Biswas told The Telegraph he was through with defending his position. We had many plans, he admitted. But we have not been able to implement them despite trying. 																								But, if the turnaround appears to be dramatic, his party colleagues have something different to say. They trace his mood to the dressing down he got from his seniors in the government and the party at a CPM state committee meeting on January 22.																								He had to face uncomfortable questions in the presence of the leadership (the government and the CPM), a source said. No one came to his aid and, instead, it appeared that his seniors had planned the exercise to convey their unhappiness, said another source.																								Biswas was given to understand that his department was being perceived as one of the laggards.																								The first apparent effect of the tough talk came on Tuesday. Educationist and dissenting member in the Ashok Mitra Commission Sunanda Sanyal, who remains one of the governments bitterest critics in the education sector, read out a litany of charges.																								Bengals schools did not have a high dropout rate, he said. The number of entrants itself was very low, he added, quoting from a 1998 Unicef report.																								The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan would fail in Bengal, Sanyal said; a government that could not handle formal education would not be able to manage non-formal education, especially when teachers would be paid only Rs 1,000 or Rs 2,000. Besides, the government has failed in making schools and the curriculum attractive. Schools without meals, toilets and uniform and a syllabus that did not pay any attention to area-specific needs are what Bengals students have got apart from a politicised school environment.																								Biswas did not deny the charges. Amar buk bhenge jaye, he said, explaining how lack of finances had prevented changes. We tried to do our best  appointing so many teachers and giving them a reasonable pay  but that hasnt been enough. He then walked up to Sanyal. Abuse me if you want to, but understand my problems, Biswas told him. 																								Sanyal said later, he was touched. Id always thought him to be a gentleman, so his behaviour wasnt surprising. His frankness was, he added.

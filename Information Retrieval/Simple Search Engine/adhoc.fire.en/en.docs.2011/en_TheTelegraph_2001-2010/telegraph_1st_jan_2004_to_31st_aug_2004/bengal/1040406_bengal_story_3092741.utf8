 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Hill freeze on school funds
 VIVEK CHHETRI																								Darjeeling, April 5: The Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council has not released funds meant to develop infrastructure in 37 junior-high schools under Operation Blackboard, more than three years after the scheme was launched by the state government. 																								Seventeen schools in tribal areas and 20 others elsewhere in the district were selected under the scheme in 2000. The schools in the tribal areas were supposed to receive Rs 50,000 each while those outside were entitled to Rs 40,000. 																								Though the government has already sanctioned Rs 16.5 lakh to the hill council for implementing the scheme, it has released only Rs 19,000 each to 33 schools.																								Demanding an immediate release of funds, general secretary of the Hill Secondary Teachers Organisation B.B. Pradhan said: The buildings of many secondary schools in the hill areas of Darjeeling are in a shambles. Most of them face shortage of desks and benches. We request the council to release the amount meant for development of these schools so that the necessary items can be purchased. 																								Pradhan pointed out that 17 schools in Siliguri subdivision that were selected under the same scheme had already received the funds. 																								Of the 17 beneficiaries in Siliguri, 15 received Rs 50,000 and two  Milangarh Junior High Madrash at Hardigach and Bharati Hindi High Schools at Siliguri Junction  got Rs 40,000. The money was sent in cash a year after the scheme was launched.																								The delay has peeved the principals, many of whom have appealed without much success to hill council chairman Subash Ghisingh and its executive councillor of secondary education .K. Kumai.																								The council will release the money in due course, said Kumai.

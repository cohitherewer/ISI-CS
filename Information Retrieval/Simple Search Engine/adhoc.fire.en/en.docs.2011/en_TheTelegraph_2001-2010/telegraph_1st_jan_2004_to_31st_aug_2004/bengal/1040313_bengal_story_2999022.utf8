 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Denied fake certificate, husband flees hospital
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, March 12: Patani Ghatak, a housewife, had allegedly committed suicide. Her in-laws were kind enough to take her to a hospital. But they fled when the doctor said he could not issue a death certificate without informing police.																								Married for seven years and a mother of two, 25-year-old Patani of Satikhali village in Tehatta, 140 km from Calcutta, was allegedly under pressure to divorce Ratan. She consumed poison last night. Hours before that, she was thrashed by Ratans mother.																								Patani was insecure and concerned about her children. She could not be a burden on her farmer father, said an officer of Tehatta police station.																								When she consumed poison, only her children and mother-in-law were at home. Ratan returned an hour later and saw her writhing in pain. She was taken to Tehatta Subdivisional Hospital.																								After she was declared dead, her husband requested for a certificate saying she died of cardiac problems. The doctor demanded her medical records and called the police, said circle inspector Nirmal Bhattacharjee.																								When the police arrived, Ratan and his relatives were not around. They are absconding.

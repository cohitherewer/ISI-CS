 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 CPM supporters fury on rally-skip family
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, March 1: The chief judicial magistrate here today ordered police to initiate a case against CPM cadre who allegedly beat up four members of a family and raped a pregnant woman for not attending a rally.																								Magistrate S.K. Mukherjee asked the officer-in-charge of Ausgram police station to start proceedings against 11 CPM activists, including zonal committee member Alamgir Mondal, for Saturdays attack.																								In her petition before the court, Sahanara Begum said Alamgir and 10 other CPM supporters raided her house on Saturday morning and beat up her husband Raju Mondal and two sons Siphon and Khokon for failing to turn up at the public meeting. 																								Sahanaras daughter Dolly, 28, who was four-months pregnant, was not spared when she tried to shield Raju. Sahanaras counsel told the court: Some of the CPM members took Dolly to a local club and raped her. As a result, she suffered a miscarriage. Now, she is at Burdwan Medical College Hospital.																								Dolly was taken to a local clinic at Naoda, but the authorities there referred her to the medical college, he added.																								Raju and his sons have also been hospitalised. Even Sahanara suffered severe injuries when she tried to prevent the rowdies from beating her husband and sons, the counsel told the court.																								Ausgram police refused to register an FIR. 																								The chief judicial magistrate asked the police to treat Sahanaras petition as an FIR and initiate a case against the accused. The court also asked the officer-in-charge of the police station to submit a report based on his inquiry by early next week.																								Alamgir, the main accused, rubbished the charges. They are fabricated. None of our men is involved. It is a conspiracy to malign the party before the Lok Sabha elections, he said. The CPM, Alamgir added, would fight the allegations politically. 																								Superintendent of police K.C. Meena told reporters here this afternoon that the accused would not be spared. We will arrest those involved in the attack, irrespective of their political affiliations, Meena said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Bandh excuse punched
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Jan. 6: The Left Front today attacked Mamata Banerjees excuse for a bandh with animal resources development minister Anisur Rahaman ruling out imposition of taxes on domestic animals by the panchayats. 																								A guideline from the panchayat and rural development ministry last year informed the village bodies about ways to increase collection of revenues, Rahaman said. We never told a panchayat to collect tax on domestic animals. The allegations by Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee about imposition of tax on animals are baseless. We had just asked the panchayats to find out ways to collect revenues and increase their income.																								 The directive, Rahaman said, should not be treated as an order. The government cannot impose a tax on behalf of the panchayat, he added.

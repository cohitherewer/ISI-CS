 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Girls expose ration racket 
 AMIT UKIL 																								Purulia, Aug. 9: Two girls from the backward Sabar community here exposed a ration card scam, proving that education is deterrent to corruption. 																								Sixteen-year-old Namita Sabar and her friend Janaki, both students of Class VIII, are the only literate members of their community in Nirbhoypur village, about 270 km west of Calcutta. 																								Last week, they sensed something amiss when food inspector Kartik Dutta, accompanied by a local dealer, Mahadev Mahato, arrived at the village with huge bundles of ration cards to distribute them among the tribal community. 																								Nirbhoypur and adjoining Jorgora have 58 Sabar families, comprising 263 adults and children.																								Our curiosity and suspicions were aroused when we saw the huge bundles of these new ration cards with them, said Namita. The girls challenged the official and snatched the cards from him. They found that half the cards were fictitious. 																								Several cards had names of Sabars who had passed away quite some time back, while the others had names of persons who did not exist at all, said Namita. There were a total of 525 cards, she said. 																								The special ration cards are distributed to the Sabars and other backward tribal communities under the Annapurna Antodoy Yojana, a central government scheme, which entitles the holder to 30 kg of rice or wheat every month at very low prices. 																								Under the scheme, the price of a kg of rice is just Rs 2, said sub-divisional officer Balaram De. 																								Officials suspect unscrupulous persons are illegally drawing rations from the district food and supplies department under the scheme and diverting it to the open market where the cereals would command four times the price. 																								Taken aback by the girls queries, the dealer and the official fled leaving the bunch of cards behind. Namita and Janaki took the cards to Puncha block development officer Supriyo Das and related the story. 																								Das informed district magistrate B.P. Gopalika, who asked the sub-divisional officer to constitute an inquiry. Today, De said the inquiry is over and the report would be submitted to him tomorrow.

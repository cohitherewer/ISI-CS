 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 After Mamata, coal concern 
 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 																								Durgapur, Feb. 12: The Left Front government is scurrying to check illegal mining to pre-empt Trinamul Congress accusations of failure to tackle the coal mafia, now that the party chief is the Union coal and mines minister.																								Late last month, four front MLAs on the Assembly petition committee  set up to look into the state of affairs at coal mines  met top officials at Ranigunj in a bid to curb illegal mining in abandoned coal mines. 																								Senior officials of Eastern Coalfields Ltd, the superintendents of Burdwan, Birbhum, Bankura and Purulia and the district magistrates of the last two were present at the meeting with CPMs Benoy Dutta, Madan Bauri and Pankaj Ghosh and Forward Blocs Bijoy Bagdi.																								Trinamul leader Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay said the petition committee had no power to take any policy decision; they can only submit suggestions and proposals to the Assembly. 																								The bid to stop illegal mining is nothing but an eyewash. It is not so easy to stop a trade that has the backing of the ruling party, he said.

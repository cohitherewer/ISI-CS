 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Varsity strike
																								Santiniketan, June 24: Life on the Visva-Bharati campus is limping with about a hundred employees on strike since June 18. 																								The casual employees in charge of kitchens, sanitation, transport, generators and security have ceased work demanding better facilities. 																								The strike has forced students, many of whom are preparing for exams, to live on bread and butter. Some of them also said the striking employees were responsible for frequent power cuts on the campus between 6 pm and 4 in the morning.

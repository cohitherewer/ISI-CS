 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 AB Ford with wife Sharmila on Friday. Picture by Amit Datta																								Calcutta, Feb. 20: Roadblocks slowing down the Ford scions chariot to a world-class tourism destination in Mayapur are on their way to being removed, following a constructive meeting with finance minister Asim Dasgupta. 																								After a string of meetings with industrialists and government officials, Alfred Brush Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford, called on Dasgupta at Writers Buildings this morning. 																								After meeting the Iskcon devotee, also known as Ambarish Das, the finance minister said: He had come to discuss a project to develop a tourism centre of international standards in Nadias Mayapur. This will also include creating facilities for public healthcare and educational institutions. The government, on its part, has asked him to look after the interests of the local residents, who can find employment either during construction of the tourism centre or after its completion. The discussion, overall, was very positive.																								Asked if Ford had sought any land from the government, Dasgupta said: We did discuss something about land, but I will not say anything further. Talks will continue, he added.																								Iskcon sources later said most of the 350-400 acres required for the project would be bought from land-holders. What they were seeking from the government was a waiver of the Land Ceiling Act and infrastructure support, from improvement of roads and water supply to electricity and dredging of the Ganga.																								During a presentation on the project at a Confederation of Indian Industry session in the evening, Ford was upbeat about the Vedic Planetarium project in Mayapur. He refused to divulge details of his meetings with industrialists Harsh Neotia and Sanjiv Goenka and the minister but described them as positive.																								While stepping on the pedal, Ford did not rule out the possibility of steering a different course. I would love to do the project here, but I received a call from the Governor of Orissa this morning expressing interest There are a few promises that have to be kept by the Bengal government..., Ford said.

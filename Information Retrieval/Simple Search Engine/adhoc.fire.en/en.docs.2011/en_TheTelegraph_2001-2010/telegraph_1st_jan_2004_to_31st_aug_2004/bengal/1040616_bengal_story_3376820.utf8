 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 CPM leaders axed for extortion
 OUR CORRESPONDENTCalcutta, June 15: A CPM local committee secretary and a zonal committee member have been expelled from the party for extorting money from factory owners in Howrah.																								Ram Kumar Pal, the chief of the partys Liluah unit, and Abichal Bose, a zonal member and local Citu leader, were dropped following a series of complaints from businessmen in the industrial belt and pressure from the state CPM leadership.																								The duo was first pulled up a month ago, when some factory owners complained. Party insiders said the two were also responsible for the closure of a factory. 																								District party secretary Sreedeep Bhattacharya said the two members were expelled after a month-long inquiry into the complaints. We had found the two party members guilty and had referred the case to the state committee. We expelled them on charges of anti-party activities after receiving the green signal from our Alimuddin Street headquarters, Bhattacharya said.																								We have also asked the local people not to maintain any contact with the expelled persons, Bhattacharya added. 																								A party leader said the businessmen had come with clinching evidence, which included a VCD with recorded evidence of their extortion bid.																								Party insiders said complaints had also come from residents and that the duo was part of irregularities involving a welfare fund of bus workers on the Bhattanagar-Esplanade route. 																								The expelled leaders were out of bounds. They did not take phone calls and their family members repeatedly said they were not at home.																								Local Trinamul Congress leaders alleged that most CPM leaders were dishonest but only some were punished. District party chief Arup Roy said: We are aware of extortion by CPM and Citu leaders. We had been vocal against it and now we stand vindicated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Report on health rot on course
 BARUN GHOSH																								Calcutta, Feb. 24: Lack of infrastructure coupled with faulty management has led to the rot in rural healthcare, says the preliminary finding of a committee appointed by the high court to probe the prevailing malaise in hospitals starting from primary health centres. 																								The court constituted the six-member panel with former judge Chittotosh Mukkherjee as its chairman two months ago following a public interest litigation moved by Congress MP from Behrampore Adhir Chowdhury who blamed the health set-up for the deaths of more than 45 children in villages across Murshidabad last June. 																								The government had faced flak from the Opposition parties and the public for the deaths, which were initially said to have been cause by a mystery fever. However, tests showed the fever was nothing but influenza, which could be easily cured. 																								The court had earlier held the doctors in the district responsible for the large number of deaths. All is not well in block-level rural hospitals and primary health centres due to lack of proper infrastructure and efficient management. But there is enough scope for improvement so that people can get quality treatment, observed Mukherjee. 																								He said the panel is examining both preventive and curative aspects of the healthcare system in district hospitals.																								We have already visited six or seven rural hospitals and interacted with a huge number of patients and doctors and other employees there. What is required to stem the rot is an extra effort from all those attached to the healthcare management, he added. 																								The panel will submit its report to the high court by June. Its members are paying surprise visits to rural hospitals to identify the cause of the present mess.																								Vice-chancellor of the West Bengal University of Health Sciences M.M. Chowdhury, who is also a member of the panel, said they would also visit the hospitals in the city. We want to go to the bottom so that the problems affecting the system can be addressed to, Chowdhury added.																								The panel members also felt that those at the helm in the hospitals management should deal more firmly with cases involving dereliction of duty on the part of Class-IV and GDA employees. Trade union activities have to be reined in at any cost, they added. 																								A strategy should be worked out to bridge the communication gap between doctors, patients and their relatives to prevent untoward incidents on hospital premises, said a pnel member.																								Health secretary Asim Barman today said the government will implement the recommendations of the panel. He said the government had on its own formed a task force in district and sub-divisional hospitals to identify the problems affecting hospitals in the rural areas.

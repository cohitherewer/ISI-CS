 Sunday, April 18, 2004 				 Sneak-in bid at Visva-Bharati
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Santiniketan, April 17: Three youths on a scooter tried to sneak near the podium built for Visva-Bharatis annual convocation, on the eve of the ceremony, prompting the authorities to tighten security in the area.																								More than 2,800 Visva-Bharati students are to receive their degrees from vice-chancellor Sujit Basu tomorrow morning.																								Around 1 this afternoon, the three youths sped towards the makeshift podium at Amra Kunja when a guard raised the alarm, said eyewitnesses. The youths sped away towards the Uttarayan complex. We have bolstered security in the area, said a Visva-Bharati official.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was scheduled to attend the convocation but pulled out because of the elections.																								Investigations into the theft of Tagore memorabilia from the Uttarayan complex  where the sneak-in trio disappeared today  gathered momentum as district police found new leads and sought custody of Pradip Barui, earlier arrested by the CID in a mobile-theft case.																								Sunil Bagdi, arrested by the CID in a similar case, has already been taken into police custody. Bagdi and Barui, who are known burglars from Bolpur and are suspects in the museum break-in case have given misleading information to the CID and the CBI.																								During investigation we got names of several persons who might have had a hand in the burglary (of Tagore memorabilia). As Bagdi and Barui are both known criminals of the area, we thought grilling them in police custody might be useful, said a senior police officer.																								The two were produced before Bolpur sub-divisional judicial magistrate Debasish Halder. The local police prayed for their custody and got them for seven days at the Bolpur police station.																								A report from Patna says Food Corporation of India union leader Madan Mohan Singh, who was arrested from Katihar district in Bihar following a CBI raid in connection with the Tagore memorabilia theft, has not been charged with the Santiniketan museum heist, said police superintendent A.K. Jain.																								The CBI could not establish his role in the theft, though he was nabbed after the bureau got a lead from its Dhanbad office, the police officer said today.																								Singh is lodged in jail for illegal possession of firearms.

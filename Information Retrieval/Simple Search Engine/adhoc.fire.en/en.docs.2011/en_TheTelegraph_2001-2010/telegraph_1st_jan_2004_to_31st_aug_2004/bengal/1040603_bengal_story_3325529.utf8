 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Affiliation threat to biased school
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Burdwan, June 2: A boys school in the Kalna sub-division faces possible derecognition and drying up of government grants due to its refusal to appoint a School Service Commission-selected woman as assistant teacher of work education. 																								Kaberi Saha of Nadia received an appointment letter from the commission on March 23 this year and visited Simlan Annapurna Kali Vidyamandir, a higher secondary school, as many as five times. But the authorities turned her away, saying they wouldnt employ a woman in a boys school. She has complained to the commission. 																								Headmaster Muktipada Chandra said: We could not accept a female candidate as ours is a boys school. In fact, there is no need to fill up the post for which she has been sent. 																								Tapan Dutta, chairman of the commissions eastern region, said there is no rule against appointment of women teachers in boys schools. We have asked the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education to take stringent action against the school, he said.																								We have told the school its affiliation will be cancelled if Saha is not appointed teacher. The school will also not receive its grants from next month, added district inspector of schools (secondary) Sibaji Porel. 																								The council may also ban appointment of teachers to five other posts in the school as long as Saha is denied. 																								Saha said she needed the job as she is the only bread-winner in her family. My mother and sister have become totally dependent on me after my father died four years ago, she said.

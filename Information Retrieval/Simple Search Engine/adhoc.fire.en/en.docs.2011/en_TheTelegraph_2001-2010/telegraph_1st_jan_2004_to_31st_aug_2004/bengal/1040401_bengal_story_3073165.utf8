 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Varsity seal on security overhaul
 OUR BUREAU Santiniketan/Alipurduar, March 31: The Visva-Bharati executive council today approved upgradation of security on the campus to the level found in mints in an emergency meeting. 																								Stung by the sensational theft of Tagores Nobel medal and other memorabilia from the campus museum last week, the council decided to set up an expert committee, comprising army and police officials, to overhaul the age-old security system. 																								It also recommended administrative action against a section of the staff not yet cleared by the probe, vice-chancellor Sujit Basu said. All 10 members of the staff, including the National Voluntary Force personnel, entrusted with ensuring security at the museum have been asked to stay away from work, he said. 																								As the university was grappling with the security blues, Left Front chairman Biman Bose fired a salvo at the Centre, saying security at the central university was Delhis responsibility, not the states. 																								Speaking at a rally in Alipurduar, he blamed the Union human resource development ministry of deploying only NVF personnel at the museum. The chief minister has asked for a CBI probe because the state government has nothing to do with what happened at Santiniketan, he said. 																								The Visva-Bharatis highest decision-making body, on the other hand, was trying its best to get over such issues. It expressed solidarity with vice-chancellor Basu after receiving the internal probe report from the Asim Adhikari committee. 																								The council, after examining the report, suggested an overhaul of the security system and observed that the number of securitymen deployed in the museum was not adequate. The council has proposed that we have at least a six-member team patrolling the campus at night, Basu said. 																								We have decided to rope in army and policemen in the expert committee to provide a tight security ring not only for the Uttarayan complex but also the whole campus, he added, claiming that it would be similar to the system prevailing in mints. 																								Expressing shock and describing the loss of the Nobel medal as a blow to national heritage, it made other suggestions: immediate deployment of curator, deputy curator and special officer for better management (of the museum); immediate augmentation of the lighting arrangement (the Uttarayan complex has only four neon lights); deployment of specialised agencies, including ex-servicemen. 																								The Justice Malay Sengupta report on affiliations given to institutions was placed in the meeting. It will be discussed later.

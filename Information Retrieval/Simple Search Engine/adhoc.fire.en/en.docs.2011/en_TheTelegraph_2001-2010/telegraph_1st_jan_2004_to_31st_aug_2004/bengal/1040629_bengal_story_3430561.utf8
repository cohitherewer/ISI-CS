The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Court clears CID voice verification
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 28: The high court today green-signalled the CID to match the voices of the accused in the hunt for the smugglers of Tagores manuscripts.																								The order is rare because courts do not usually permit investigating agencies to record voices of the accused as they cannot ask those charged to produce evidence against their own interests.																								But Justice S.P. Talukdar said: The incidents of thefts from the custody of Visva- Bharati have lowered the dignity of Bengal. So, the investigating agencies should have full liberty to inquire and the court is in favour of recording the sample voices of the accused for the interest of the probe. The judge set aside two earlier orders of the Alipore sessions judge restraining the CID from recording the sample voices of the accused to match them with those recorded from telephone conversations of the alleged culprits.																								Manuscripts of Tagore, Prativa Basu and several stalwarts were stolen from the university. The CID arrested Tapan Bose and Biswanath Roy from Jadavpur on May 12 and recovered the stolen manuscripts from their possession.																								After interrogating the duo, the CID recorded telephone talks of Dwijadas Banerjee, a retired Visva-Bharati registrar who was arrested later. Banerjee was heard discussing the sale of manuscripts with Pritimoy Chatterjee. The CID had sought the courts permission to match their recorded voices with the real.

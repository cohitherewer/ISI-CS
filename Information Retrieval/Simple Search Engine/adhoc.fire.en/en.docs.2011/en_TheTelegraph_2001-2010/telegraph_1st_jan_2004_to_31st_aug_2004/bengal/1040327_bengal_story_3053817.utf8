 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Thieves catch OC napping at home
 OUR CORRESPONDENTAsansol, March 26: Burglars entered the quarters of an officer-in-charge a few hundred metres from the police station and escaped with a revolver and money as he slept after the days work.																								Kashinath Singh and his personnel at Jamuria police station could contest each other on who should be more embarrassed after last nights incident, about 210 km from Calcutta. 																								No one has a clue yet to how many robbers entered Singhs house. Besides the service revolver, five cartridges, a gold ring and Rs 1,000 were taken from the almirah in the bedroom, the police said.																								The burglars appeared to have scaled the boundary wall and entered the quarters. Singh has lodged an FIR with his own police station. 																								The quarters has been sealed and Burdwan superintendent of police K.C. Meena has sought the assistance of fingerprint experts from Calcutta. No arrests have been made yet. 																								Senior officers said the break-in was probably the handiwork of a local gang but they did not rule out the involvement of Naxalites. 																								It is a very serious case. The miscreants seem to have been desperate and daring. I have asked additional superintendent, Asansol, G.A. Srinivas to submit a detailed report. A departmental inquiry may have to be initiated against the officer-in-charge. He should have kept the service revolver in safe custody, Meena said. The almirah where the gun was kept was not under lock and key. 																								Singh returned from duty around 3 am. The door to the bedroom was left open as it was hot inside. Around 4.30, Singhs wife noticed the almirah doors ajar. She raised an alarm. A dazed Singh called other officers from the police station.

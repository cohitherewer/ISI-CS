The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Driven by poverty, MLA resigns
 OUR CORRESPONDENTKhandoghosh, Feb. 27: A CPM legislator gave in her papers yesterday, unable to cope with the responsibility as well as extreme penury.																								Unable to meet both ends, I had to quit, said Jyotsna Singh, 35, the communist partys representative in the Assembly from Khandoghosh in Burdwan. Jyotsna met Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim yesterday and handed in her papers.																								Left with the choice of taking up the post of hostel superintendent at Balurghat Girls College and continuing as a peoples representative, Jyotsna chose the first. 																								Being the eldest among four sisters and three unemployed brothers, I was desperate to get a job to run my family. After I got through the selection test, I spoke to higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty, who suggested that I should quit (the House) and accept the job, Jyotsna said today at her home in Paharpur village, about 155 km from Calcutta.																								Balurghat being a government college, she could not have accepted the offer and continued as an MLA.																								A member of the CPMs youth wing, the Democratic Youth Federation of India, for 15 years, Jyotsna won the panchayat elections in 1998 and was appointed president of the local panchayat samiti. In 2002, she was elected to the Assembly. 																								I am sure that a permanent job will help me tide over the financial crisis. Only two of my sisters are married. Besides, one of my brothers is studying in Class IX. It was really difficult to support my family without a permanent job, she said.																								The CPM tried to play down the resignation. She had been sidelined, said a local leader. Jyotsna was not taken into account by senior leaders even while dealing with issues concerning her constituency, he added. Amal Halder, the Burdwan secretary of the party, said: We, too, suggested that she resign...																								Halder claimed that the party would have provided help to Jyotsnas family. But she was desperate for a permanent job.

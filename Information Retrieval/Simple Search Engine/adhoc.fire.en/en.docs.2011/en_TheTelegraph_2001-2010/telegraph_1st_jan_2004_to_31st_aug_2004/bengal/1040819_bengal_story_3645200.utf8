 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Aug. 18: Manwara Bibi, who went missing in August last year with her 13-year-old daughter, Sarifa Khatoon, from their Raninagar residence here, has been rescued by police from Jammu and Kashmir. 																								She was produced in the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court at Lalbagh this morning. 																								A search for her daughter is on. 																								Police swung into action after Manwaras husband lodged a complaint in December that one Ahmed Mondal had kidnapped and sold them. 																								We arrested Ahmed last month and took him to Kashmir to trace Manwara. We are still looking for the girl, said district superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh.

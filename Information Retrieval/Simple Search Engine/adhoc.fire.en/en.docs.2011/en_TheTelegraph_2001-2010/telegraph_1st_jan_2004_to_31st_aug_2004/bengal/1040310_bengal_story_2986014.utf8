The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Sudip OK, if official: Cong
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Actor Sharad Kapoor at the Congress office in Calcutta on Tuesday with an offer to campaign for the party. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Calcutta, March 9: The Congress will not back rebel Trinamul Congress MP Sudip Bandopadhayay in Calcutta Northwest unless he approaches the party officially. 																								Reacting to reports that Bandopadhyay had sought the partys support to contest as an Independent, former state Congress chief Somen Mitra today said: Let him officially approach state party president Pranab Mukherjee. Only then shall we consider... 																								The Calcutta Northwest MP said he has already spoken to Mukherjee. I am ready to accept the Congress support as an Independent but have no plans at the moment to switch over to the party, he added. 																								Asked if he was backing himself to retain the seat, Bandopadhyay said: There is a tremendous sympathy wave after Trinamul denied me a nomination. This will have its impact on ballots.																								Bandopadhayay called on chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee this morning, seeking a suitable symbol. He asked the officer if an Independent with support from a national party would get priority in getting a symbol. Banerjee told reporters later that there was no such possibility. 																								The rebel Trinamul leader brought to Banerjees notice that mayor Subrata Mukherjee, the official Trinamul candidate from Calcutta Northwest, was using his car with the beacon lights for party programmes.																								The CPMs seat-share talks with Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal have not yielded results yet. Discussions are still on in Delhi. If the RJD offers us two seats in Bihar, we are ready to leave Calcutta Northwest to the RJD, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said. 																								Mamata Banerjees meeting with state BJP president Tathagata Roy fell through last night as the Trinamul chief refused to offer two seats, Bankura and Purulia, to the BJP. Mamata wants us to contest the Jangipur seat in Murshidabad. We do not want it, said Roy.

 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Top cop takes to road for turnout
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhagwangola (Murshidabad), April 10: Murshidabad district superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh has pulled out all the stops to make people aware of their electoral responsibilities, urging them to turn up to vote for their preferred candidate.																								Addressing the public at various meetings, Singh urges voters to help police crack down on attempts to disrupt free and fair elections.																								Politics is aimed at doing good for the masses. People require a representative voice and the purpose of holding elections is to provide you with it. So cast your vote at your discretion Ensure that there is no untoward incident anywhere. If any such incident does come to your notice, inform us immediately the SP says.																								Not only is the cop drawing bigger crowds than local politicians, some are reportedly turning up to hear what he has to say.																								Singh has taken a personal initiative to generate public awareness and can be found on a dais from noon to night every day, urging the masses to vote.																								Yesterday alone, Singh addressed the people at Hussainpur, Dihipara and Pahar in Ranipara and at Hussainnagar in Bhagwangola. All these places are considered disturbed, prone to political violence.																								The SPs meetings are drawing larger crowds than the pre-election political meetings, said Habibur Rahaman, officer-in-charge at Bhagwangola police station. Though the use of microphones is not allowed, it would be very helpful. That way, the speeches can really reach the masses, he added.

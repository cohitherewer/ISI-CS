 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 Coal strike over Citu nexus 
 OUR BUREAU																								Durgapur, May 29: Several trade unions went on a wildcat strike at Shankarpur Colliery last night in protest against the nexus between the Citu-controlled trade union and the management of Eastern Coalfields Limited. 																								Lifting of coal from the mine has come to a standstill. The water level in the mine is rising as workers are refusing to operate pumps to drain it out. 																								Trouble began after a pump operator, who is also a Citu supporter, was transferred to the power supply department. 																								The Citu forced the management to withdraw the transfer order, but this angered the other unions like the Intuc, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and the Colliery Mazdoor Union. They demanded the withdrawal of transfer orders served on their supporters. 																								The management, however, refused to do so and this led to the strike.																								BMS president Sheikh Badaruzzoha alleged that there was a nexus between the Citu leadership and the management of the colliery. 																								The management is not listening to our problems and it has been running the mine in consultation with the Citu. We wanted to sort out the problem through negotiations, but the management refused to meet our representative. We had no option but to resort to the strike, he said.																								ECLs Bankola area manager Mohammad Taslimuddin denied the charges. The strike is uncalled for. The workers of the rightist trade unions have affected the working of the mine by calling the strike, he said.																								Durgapur sub-divisional officer Osman Ghani said the block development officer of Pandabeshwar has been asked to call an all-party meeting to resolve the problem.																								In another development, the proprietor of a biscuit manufacturing unit in Asansol has closed his factory after he was allegedly heckled by some employees, reportedly backed by Citu, yesterday. 																								Hindul Roy lodged a complaint with the CPMs Asansol zonal committee, saying some miscreants in the name of the CPM and the Krishak Sabha had been compelling him to buy construction material from them at a higher price.

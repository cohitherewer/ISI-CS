The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 BJP resurrects booth-capture spectre
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								Calcutta, May 16: Banamali Bera had gone to booth 123 in Srirampur under Pursurah Assembly segment of Arambagh Lok Sabha seat to work as an agent of BJP candidate Swapan Nandi. He said he was not allowed to enter.																								The authorisation letter you are carrying is not valid because the signature of the chief election agent, Ratan Chatterjee, is different from the specimen signature of Chatterjee which is with us. So I cant allow you into the booth to function as the BJP agent, the presiding officer told Bera. 																								He tried to convince the officer that the authorisation letter was genuine.																								Chitta Mandal, too, met the same fate at a booth in Pursurah I area. Gorachand Pramanik, a BJP agent in Shyampur area of the same Assembly segment, also failed to convince the officer concerned.																								The entire election had been rigged in a calculated manner. The CPM with the help of the polling personnel, most of whom were CPM card-holders, had confused our party workers over the signature issue, Nandi said.																								We received thousands of phone-calls from almost all the booths from the very beginning of the election. Everywhere, the presiding officers argued that the signature of my chief election agent (on the authorisation letter) differed from his original signature.																								According to Nandi, we had to rush from one booth to another to sort out the dispute, but in vain. At the end of the day, we had managed to deploy agents only in 400 booths, though the total was 1,194.																								Nandis party colleagues in Hooghly district alleged that CPM cadre had posed as BJP agents even in most of these 400 booths.																								Since the identity cards issued to the election agents dont have any photographs of the agents, the CPM had forced our agents to leave the booths and posed as our agents when any observer visited the booths, local BJP leaders alleged.																								At booth 101 at Purba Hauli Primary School, Subhendu Chatterjee, the son of a former BJP pradhan of Bhanjipur panchayat, arrived to cast his vote and ended up challenging a person he knew to be a CPM activist for trying to vote in another persons name. Chatterjee was thrashed.																								On the BJP workerss request, their chief election agent Ratan Chatterjee arrived and enquired about the thrashing. He, too, was beaten up. Chatterjee was hospitalised, first at district hospitals and finally in Calcutta where he spent the rest of the polling day.																								Is it possible for any candidate to contest a Lok Sabha seat without the chief election agent? asked Nandi, who plans to move court against the election authorities.

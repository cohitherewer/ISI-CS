The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Govt readies firefight in schools and colleges
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 19: Wiser after the Tamil Nadu tragedy in which 90 children were charred in a school with hardly any fire-fighting arrangement, the Bengal government unveiled a plan to push for fire-safety measures in schools and colleges. 																								The measures will be put into effect in 63,000 schools and about 340 undergraduate colleges and norms for the recognition of new educational institutions will be amended, school education minister Kanti Biswas said in the Assembly today.																								Admitting that most educational institutions are ill-equipped to combat hazards, fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said the government may have to close down schools, especially at the kindergarten and preparatory levels, having narrow exits.																								Workshops will be organised across the state to educate school inspectors about fire-safety measures, Chatterjee said. 																								Biswas said rules governing recognition to new schools would be revised to make safety measures against fire mandatory. He added that the government will examine the kitchens of 1,100 primary schools where cooked mid-day meals are being provided to children. Our officers will inspect the kitchens regularly.																								The Kumbakonam tragedy is an eye-opener for us. It had never struck us earlier that schools should have proper fire-fighting arrangements. While recognising schools, we did not take into account whether they had fire-fighting arrangements. Now we will do that, Biswas said.																								What will be must-have for new schools will apply to existing institutions as well. Several norms are being mulled (see chart) and a decision is likely soon. Biswas warned that the government would de-recognise an institution if its fire-fighting arrangements are not in conformity with the rules. 																								In the absence of norms, Biswas said most schools do not have emergency exits. In many schools, there is one staircase and ill-maintained electrical wiring.

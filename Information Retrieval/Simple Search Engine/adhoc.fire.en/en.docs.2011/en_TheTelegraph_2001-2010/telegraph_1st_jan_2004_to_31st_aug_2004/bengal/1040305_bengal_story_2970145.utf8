 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, March 4: A forest officer was beaten up and tied to a post for over four hours today by residents of a West Midnapore village who accused him of failing to protect their crop from marauding elephants.																								A herd of 53 elephants from the Jhargram forest crossed the Kansabati river on Monday and entered Lalgarh, about 180 km from Calcutta. For two days, the residents of Kantapahari village kept the herd confined to the Jhitka and Bhedua forests with the help of some forest department workers. All this while, district forest officials showed no initiative to drive the elephants out.																								The herd finally entered the villages yesterday. It destroyed paddy, potatoes, wheat and mustard in about 300 bighas. Two houses were also destroyed, said Jadupati Pratihar, a resident.																								The villagers gheraoed Nibaran Bera when he went there to inquire into the incident. They beat him up and refused to set him free till higher officials promised that, in future, elephants would be prevented from entering the villages.

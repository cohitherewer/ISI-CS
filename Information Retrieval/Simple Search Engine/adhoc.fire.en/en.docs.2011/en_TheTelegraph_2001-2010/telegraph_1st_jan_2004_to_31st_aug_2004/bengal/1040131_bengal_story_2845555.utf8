 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Mamata wants joint manifesto with NDA
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 30: Mamata Banerjee wants the NDA to adopt a joint manifesto in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.																								The NDA is scheduled to meet on February 5 and may discuss a common minimum programme, which will ensure greater coordination among NDA partners, the Union coal and mines minister said.																								Mamata said the Trinamul Congress and the BJP would undertake a joint campaign. We have already entered into an electoral alliance with the BJP in the state, she said but refused to divulge details of her poll ploy. 																								Asked about the possible candidates, especially in the city, she said: This is Trinamuls internal matter. We have already had discussions and will take only a minute to finalise the list. Bandh petition																								The high court today admitted a petition urging it to declare the bandh called by Trinamul on February 3 illegal. A division bench fixed February 6 for the next hearing and told the petitioners that it would ask the party to send its representatives as respondents. Trinamul, however, stuck to the bandh call.

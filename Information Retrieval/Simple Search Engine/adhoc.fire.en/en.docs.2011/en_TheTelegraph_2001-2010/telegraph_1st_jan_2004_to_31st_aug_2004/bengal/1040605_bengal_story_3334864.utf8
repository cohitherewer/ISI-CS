 OUR BUREAURajbandh, June 4: Seated in the west cabin of Rajbandh station, 40-year-old Satyanarayan Pal, an electrical signal maintenance employee, was relishing the relief of the drizzle and the occasional thunder last evening when lightning struck.																								The man who had a birds eye view of what happened at the IOC terminal said: After the sweltering heat, the rains were a great relief but I was concentrating on train schedules when I felt the big jolt.																								Around 6 pm, Pal had stretched his hand to pull the lever used to change the railway lines when he felt current pass through him. I knew that lightning had struck somewhere and was thanking lord that I was spared. When I looked out of the window in the blinding rain, I saw people running away from the IOC storage tanks, Pal said.																								He looked back. Power at the cabin had snapped. Both the traction power and the local power had gone out. There was nothing for me to do but look in horror at smoke billowing from one of the 20 IOC tanks.																								About seven minutes later, the traction power came back in the west cabin but the rest of the area was still plunged into darkness. Pal grabbed his repairing tools and was about to alight from the cabin when he noticed huge flashes of fire.																								I soon received a message that the transformer fuse near the east cabin had burst. I immediately set out for the place. But then the fire was raging and gradually getting bigger. I soon had confirmation that lightning had struck the tank and the oil inside was afire, Pal added.																								Around 7.30 pm, he returned to the tracks opposite the towering inferno when he saw the leaping flames. People inside the IOC terminal were running everywhere. They seemed to be completely caught by surprise. We could make out that there was little for them to do. Fire tenders rushed in Pal continued.																								At 9.30 pm, he decided to return home. Panic-stricken neighbours urged him to vacate the quarters. I decided to stay back since I had work to do, Pal said. 																								Around 2 this afternoon, Pal was going back to the west cabin. They still seem perplexed. All day I have seen them pour water on the oil. I hope the tank does not blow up.

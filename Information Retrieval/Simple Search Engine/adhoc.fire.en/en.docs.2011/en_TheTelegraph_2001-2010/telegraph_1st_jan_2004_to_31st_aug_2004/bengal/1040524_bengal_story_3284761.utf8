 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA 																								Siliguri, May 23: Good tea will fetch good price; bad tea, bad price. 																								Four years of recession have taught the industry the need to control the quality of the brew, if a tea-tasting session conducted by J. Thomas and Company  the oldest and largest tea auctioning house in the country  is any indication. 																								The tea-tasting survey was conducted in Bengdubi, Nagrakatta and Hashimara on May 15, 17 and 18 respectively. Almost all the 80 gardens and factories that had participated had shown an improvement in the quality of tea. Even the bought-leaf factories, generally known for inferior tea, had upgraded their quality, industry sources said.																								The industry has learnt that there is no alternative to quality, said M. Bhattacharya, chairman of the Terai branch of the Indian Tea Association and manager of the New Chumta Tea Estate. 																								It is because of the fall in quality that Indian tea lost out to competitors in several world markets. Improving the quality of tea is the only way to regain our position in the market. This is a lesson that the industry has learnt when passing through the bad phase, Bhattacharya added. 																								Till 1998, planters were not much bothered about quality. Good quality tea then fetched only about Rs 5 to 10 per kg more than inferior ones. But now the difference is marked. Quality tea brings Rs 30 to 40 higher than inferior ones, he added.

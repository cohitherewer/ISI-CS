The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Bill to create water bodies
																								Calcutta, July 13: Alarmed at reports on the slowdown of the natural recharging of underground aquifers because of filling up of water bodies, the government has decided to table a bill in the Assembly allowing digging of ponds, lakes and canals.																								Water resources development minister Nandagopal Bhattacharaya told the Assembly that the aquifers, both in urban and rural areas, are dwindling and their natural recharging has been slowed because of silted ponds, bils and canals. 																								However, he also said that there is no block in Bengal where underground water resources have been over exploited.																								Replying to a question from Forward Bloc MLA Shibaprasad Malik, the minister told the House that his department had been preparing a status report on the condition of underground aquifers in all 341 blocks across the state. A survey has already been completed in 210 blocks and work is in progress in other 59 blocks. 																								 The condition of the aquifers in 188 blocks had been found to be within the safe limit. Critical condition had been noticed only in two blocks.																								In terms of percentage, underground water constitutes 41.3 per cent of the total water used in the state for residential, industrial and agricultural purposes. 																								Bhattacharya pointed out that because of indiscriminate drawing of water, the underground water level in Calcutta had receded from a sixmetre depth to 11 metres over the last few decades.																								According to him, over 63,000 shallow and 5,000 deep tube wells are now in operation in the state to irrigate about 14 lakh hectares of arable land. It has now been made mandatory to take permission from the state water investigation directorate (SWID) for sinking a new deep tube well.																								Bhattacharya said the state has submitted a Rs 2025 crore project for construction of various minor irrigation structures under the Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy. He said this was conveyed to his counterpart at the Centre Priya Ranjan Das Munshi when he had called on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								Meanwhile, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had taken a decision not to allow sinking of deep tube wells in housing complexes where filtered water supply was available.																								  We will not even renew the licence for deep tube wells. Instead we will offer them to take bulk connection for filtered surface water. The quantity of water to be consumed will be charged according to the prescribed rate, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee.He said CMC had been running over 300 deep tube wells and most of them would be phased out with the commissioning of the booster stations at Bagmari, Ranikuthi, Garfa, Kalighat, Bansdroni and Kasba.

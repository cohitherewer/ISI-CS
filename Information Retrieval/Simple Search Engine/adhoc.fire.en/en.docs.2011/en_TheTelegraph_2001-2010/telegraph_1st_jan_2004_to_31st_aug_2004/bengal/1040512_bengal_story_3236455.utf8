The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Repoll today in 31 booths, north to south
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 11: The Election Commission has set 31 booths in the state another date with the general elections by ordering repoll tomorrow.																								We had sent a list of 31 polling stations to the Election Commission and received a letter from the ECs office this afternoon declaring that repoll must be held in those polling stations, chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said this afternoon.																								The repolling between 7 am and 5 pm tomorrow across 20 Lok Sabha constituencies follows allegations of booth-capturing, damage to electronic voting machines and complaints of inadequate checking of voter identities.																								The CPM had demanded repoll in 34 booths, most of which are at Bhatpara in Barrackpore and Nanoor Assembly segment of Bolpur Lok Sabha seat. The Congress and the Trinamul Congress had sought repoll in Purulia and Murshidabad districts.																								Ten polling stations in Sagardighi, Murshidabad, Jangipur, Asansol, and Joynagar have been singled out for the repeat exercise after booth-capturing and because in some cases, some miscreants had damaged voting machines, Banerjee said.																								In Cooch Behar, an EVM was malfunctioning and the presiding officer had announced that there would be no more voting. So even when the EVM was replaced, voters were under the impression that it was over for the day and had all left, Banerjee said of another instance.																								Asked whether the officer would face action, he said: We will decide on all that after the polling procedure is completed.																								He, however, added that we will take very strict action if charges of negligence are proved against poll personnel, especially the ones who have not checked identification of voters adequately.																								Banerjee clarified that no election observer was manhandled yesterday, when asked about the reported instance involving Aniruddha Mukherjee. His security guard was manhandled, but not him. I have seen the FIR copy, the chief electoral officer said.																								The repolling will be held at booths in Calcutta South, Cooch Behar, Darjeeling, Raiganj, Malda, Jangipur, Murshidabad, Behrampore, Barasat, Basirhat, Joynagar, Barrackpore and Dum Dum.																								The final results and trends emerging during counting would be available on the commissions website, Banerjee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Marooned cry for rescue, not rice
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sandbags being dumped by the Fulhar. Picture by Surajit Roy																								Malda, July 22: Surrounded by water but without a drop to drink, 505 families marooned on an island at the confluence of the Ganga and Fulhar demanded rescue, not relief.																								Food processing minister Sailen Sarkar visited the flood-affected areas of Bilaimari gram panchayat in Ratua Block I today to take stock of the devastation and distribute food and tarpaulin.																								On Tiklichar, an island sticking out of the surging water, 4,000 people from four villages in Bilaimari, about 45 km from the town, have taken up residence after being robbed of their homes and possession by the Fulhar.																								They said it was the only chunk of land that would not be eroded. However, it could be the first to fall when the floods follow.																								We have given each family one tarpaulin and distributed 31 quintals of rice, said Sukhen Sarkar, the block development officer who accompanied Sarkar.																								That, however, is not what the stranded people want. 																								We need water. We need boats that will take us from here more than food, said Najera Bibi. This will be the first piece of land to be swamped when floods hit the district in a few weeks.																								There was no hope on offer though. The government does not have the money to prevent erosion on such a large scale. The proposal we sent to the Centre has been shot down. There is little we can do apart from moving these people to safer places, Sarkar said. Sources in the administration said that would be easier said than done.																								The officials are yet to receive money to pay boat owners for services hired during last years floods. Out of Rs 2 lakh, we have received Rs 25,000. From where will we get money to hire boats this year? asked one of them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Bruise of massacre in historic high
 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN 																								Behrampore, May 14: The CPM has decided on an autopsy after its annihilation in Murshidabad district. 																								A preliminary post-mortem has revealed several factors that led to the CPM drawing a blank from the district. The inability of local leaders to motivate cadre at the ground level and a faulty assessment of Congress MP from Behrampore Adhir Chaudhurys organisational prowess being the two on top.																								A swing of minority votes towards the Congress compounded problems, CPM sources said.																								Our party workers were suffering from complacency and took the Left Fronts victory for granted. It is a matter of shame. Pranab Mukherjee, who never dreamt of becoming a member of the Lok Sabha, won Jangipur. Unthinkable , said Madhu Bag, the CPM district secretary.																								The complacency, it must be said, was misplaced. The front was routed in the district in the panchayat polls last May and lost 23-0 to the Congress in the elections to Behrampore municipality.																								The RSP, which failed to wrest the Behrampore Lok Sabha seat for the second successive term, sounded candid about the debacle in Murshidabad when the Left has been savouring a historic high across the nation. The results have proved that Chaudhury is more acceptable to the people of Murshidabad than we are. We have lost two more seats to the Congress this time because of the campaign spearheaded by him. He also succeeded in bringing the votes polled by Trinamul-BJP in the last elections to the Congress kitty, said RSP district secretary Biswanath Banerjee.																								Senior leaders in Calcutta were reluctant to comment on the bruise at a time they are being called to play a role at the national level. 																								Chaudhury explained what led to the so-called complacency of the CPM cadre. Old cases were dug up and my lieutenants were picked up by police in the run-up to the polls. They (the Left) thought I would not be able to overcome the handicap.																								State Congress chief Mukherjee described the outcome as a verdict of the people to ensure the districts development. 																								The CPM MPs of Jangipur and Murshidabad did nothing for the districts development in the past five years, Chaudhury alleged.																								Minority votes played a crucial part. Mannan Hussain won the Murshidabad seat, 75 per cent of whose voters are Muslims, by a margin of 14,000. The Congress had lost it to the CPM in 1999 by 1,23,000 votes. Mukherjee won Jangipur by 36,860 votes, wiping out a deficit of 60,000 in 1999.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Salim deal hope 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 16: Nearly 10 months after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees first meeting with Beni Santoso, chief executive of Indonesias Salim Group, prospects for an agreement on investment by Salim in Bengal have brightened. 																								Heading a team, Santoso is scheduled to visit the city for three days from the night of July 6. He is expected to sign an agreement on July 7.																								We are going to talk to him (Santoso) about possible investment in developing a township in west Howrah.It is going to be a follow-up on what had already been discussed during his earlier visit, Bhattacharjee said.																								In October, the Bhattacharjee government and Salim explored the possibility of a joint venture but, as it appears now, Salim was also open to the idea of going solo. However, much of the planned developments would depend on the outcome of the July meeting. 																								In the upcoming meeting the government will also press Santoso for a commitment to invest in developing a modern dairy at Haringhata and get another associate company Quincin to start up a two-wheeler manufacturing unit.

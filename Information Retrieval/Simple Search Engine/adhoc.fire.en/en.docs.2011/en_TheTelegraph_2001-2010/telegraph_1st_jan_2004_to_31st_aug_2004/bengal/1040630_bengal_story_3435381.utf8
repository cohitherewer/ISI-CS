The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Civic setback for CPM 
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, June 29: The Opposition parties matched the Left Front, civic body for civic body, in the elections held on Sunday. It was eight-all when the results were declared.																								In the polls to 18 municipalities, the Left parties had hoped to continue their good showing from the Lok Sabha polls. 																								However, the overall tally may still tilt the Lefts way as Mal and Uluberia municipalities now have a tie.																								The front has retained Gangarampur, Rajpur-Sonarpur, South Dum Dum, Dum Dum, Mahestala, Asansol, Rajarhat-Gopalpur and wrested Madhyamgram municipality from the Trinamul Congress-Congress combine. The Congress and Trinamul have held Kulti, Sainthia, Egra, Islampur and Kaliaganj. The front also failed to dislodge the GNLF from the hill municipalities  Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong.																								The result from Uluberia also came as an unpleasant surprise to the front, which had won 18 out of 28 seats last time. This time, it won 14 seats, leading to a tie with the Opposition. Mal municipality witnessed a tie for the second successive civic election. The CPM is ahead in the Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad polls.																								The state CPM leadership put up a brave face, saying the results have been on the expected lines. State party secretary Anil Biswas said: We have wrested Madhyamgram from the Opposition parties. 																								Asked why the CPM could not sweep the polls after its success in the Lok Sabha elections, Biswas said: There is a difference between Lok Sabha and municipal polls. The issues are different. The municipal election results do not indicate an erosion in our support base.																								The Opposition parties were buoyant. A Trinamul leader said they could have done better if the polls were free and fair.																								People were not allowed to vote in Dum Dum, South Dum Dum and Mahestala by CPMs musclemen, said Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy. Congress leaders echoed him.

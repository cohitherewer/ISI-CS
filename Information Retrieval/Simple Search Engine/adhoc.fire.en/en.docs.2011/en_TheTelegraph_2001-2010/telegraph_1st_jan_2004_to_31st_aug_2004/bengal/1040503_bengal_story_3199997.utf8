 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Delhi rescue of dead girl
 OUR BUREAUCalcutta, May 2: Ajimoon Khatoon, a teenager from Kulpi in South 24-Parganas whom police declared dead six months ago, was rescued from a brothel in Delhi.																								On September 11, she went to see a film in Diamond Harbour with friends. Ajimoon, 16, was last seen talking to a middle-aged woman after the show.																								The police initially refused to listen to her parents but an NGO ensured that a missing complaint was registered.																								On the basis of descriptions provided by Ajimoons friends, Angoora Bibi was arrested. A murder case was initiated. 																								The NGO, Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, alleged that the police began the murder case to shrug off responsibility. 																								The NGO traced Ajimoon to the Delhi brothel. She was spotted near Ajmeri Gate with a couple of other girls. The rescue brought to light that Angoora was the tip of a trafficking racket.																								Ajimoon had met her at the cinema. Altaf Ahmed, a member of the NGO, said: The woman offered her drugged groundnuts and she fainted. With the help of an associate, she carried her out of the hall. They took a train to Delhi that night itself. 																								He added that many underprivileged girls take to prostitution for a better living but Ajimoon refused. Their lure did not work with her. We also saved six other girls from South 24-Parganas, Ahmed said.																								We arrested Angoora for murder. Now that Ajimoon is on her way back, we have to see what can be done, said an officer of Diamond Harbour police station. Subdivisional police officer Mehmood Akhtar said he would have to find out if the murder case was registered.																								Ajimoon, Lalmoon, Ajmira, Malika, Mithu and Padma, who are now at Delhis Nariniketan, would return in a few days.

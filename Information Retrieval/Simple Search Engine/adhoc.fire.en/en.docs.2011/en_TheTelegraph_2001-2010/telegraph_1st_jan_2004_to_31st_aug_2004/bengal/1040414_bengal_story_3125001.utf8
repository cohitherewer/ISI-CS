 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Caste drives lover couple to death
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Narayangarh (West Midnapore),  April 13: Unable to bridge the divide between a Brahmin  Chakraborty and a low-caste Patar, a boy of 22 and a girl  of 18 leapt in front of a train near here yesterday.																								Prasenjit Chakraborty and Pakhi Patars families were against their marriage because of the difference in caste. 																								Neighbours at Jamuna village in Narayangarh, about 150 km west of Calcutta, Prasenjit and Pakhi were in love long enough for their families to get an inkling. Yet, when Prasenjit, who had been working with an NGO in Gujarat for the past few months, returned to his village and made the formal proposal, the families were crestfallen.																								A relative said: Had this marriage taken place, it would have been difficult for the girls in our family to find grooms. No one else among the Chakrabortys would speak about the deaths under 203 Up Kharagpur-Bhubaneswar Passenger. 																								Prasenjits mother Arati, a widow, refused to accept his body because he had reportedly got married to the Patar girl before death. His elder brothers had their lips sealed.																								A family of priests, the relative said they would have lost their livelihood had Prasenjit and Pakhi got married. 																								Pakhis father Khandu, a labourer, said he had no complaint to make. Let God judge those who did not allow the young couple to live together.

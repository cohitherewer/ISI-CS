				 																																	Burdwan, April 21: Two teams from the state health department and the Burdwan Medical College started work in full swing in Mukundapur village today to find the cause and contain a mysterious disease that has claimed 23 lives in the past eight months. 				 																																	The village has a population of 302, including many tribals. Doctors carried out check-up on the afflicted persons and drew blood samples, even as insecticides, including DDT, were sprayed in the village. 				 																																	So far, 19 persons have been admitted twice to the Bhatar primary health centre. But the district administration and the health department were unaware of the situation, despite the 23 deaths.				 																																	Siliguri: Life came to a standstill in the hill subdivision of Kurseong and surrounding areas on Wednesday evening following a heavy downpour. The rain continued for more than an hour throwing traffic on the busy Hill Cart Road out of gear.

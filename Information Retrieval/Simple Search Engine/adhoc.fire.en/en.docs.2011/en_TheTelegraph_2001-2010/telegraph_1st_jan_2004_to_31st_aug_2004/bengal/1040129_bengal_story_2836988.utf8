The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 CPM undecided on Mamata rival
 BARUN GHOSH Calcutta, Jan. 28: The  CPM is finding it difficult to select candidates for the  Lok Sabha in two key constituencies, Calcutta South and  Dum Dum, as senior leaders appear reluctant.																								In the last general elections, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee retained Calcutta South for the third time in a row by defeating the CPMs Bharati Mukherjee by about two lakh votes. BJP leader Tapan Sikdar won Dum Dum for the second consecutive time routing the CPMs Anil Bhattacharya by more than a lakh.																								CPM sources said the party is likely to field former advocate-general of Tripura Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya in Calcutta South and Amitava Nandy, a key functionary in North 24-Parganas and a known rival of transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, in Dum Dum. 																								Left Front chief whip and CPM MLA from Ballygunge Rabin Deb is also being considered for Calcutta South. 																								Bikash Ranjan said he heard about the likelihood of his nomination from sources. I am ready to take on Mamata if the party chooses me. I was born in Calcutta and have been associated with students politics here, he said. 																								Deb said the party will field a heavyweight personality against Mamata. Wait a few days, everything will be clear by the first week of February. 																								The CPM, said Deb, has prepared a list of nominees that has to be ratified by the politburo and the central committee, which are meeting in Hyderabad from today. 																								Former health minister Prasanta Sur, who lost to Mamata in 1996, said the partys Calcutta district committee has begun discussions to choose nominees for Calcutta Northeast, Calcutta Northwest and Calcutta South. Sur ruled himself out of the contest. I am not interested in contesting polls any more as I am busy overseeing the organisation, he said.																								The CPM has asked allies Forward Bloc, RSP and CPI to submit the names of their candidates by February 5. A Left Front committee meeting is scheduled the next day, where chairman Biman Bose will release the names of the front candidates. Before that, we shall meet on February 1 to finalise our manifesto, RSP leader and former minister Kshiti Goswami said this afternoon. He indicated that the party would renominate those who won last time. 																								The CPI will renominate Ajoy Chakraborty and Probodh Panda from Basirhat and Midnapore. In Panskura, the party is likely to field trade union leader and former Rajya Sabha MP Gurudas Dasgupta.																								The Bloc is in a spot over its Cooch Behar candidate as incumbent Amar Roy Pradhan has been expelled from the party. The CPM wants Roy Pradhan, who now heads his outfit, the Forward Bloc (Socialist), to enter the fray as a front nominee but the Bloc is opposed to it.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, June 7: Nearly 150 villagers have been afflicted with kala-azar in 12 blocks of Murshidabad over the past two weeks, the highest health official of the district said today. 																								Chief medical officer of health Sachchidananda Sarkar said three people have died of the disease in the past six months and health officers have gone to the affected areas to collect blood samples.																								The three deaths occurred at Patni village in Kandi, Harhari village in Sagardighi and Janardan village in Lalgola. 																								The worst affected blocks are Kandi, Jiaganj and Sagardighi, where the disease, according to health officials, has taken a serious turn.																								At Patni, 47 people were affected and 16 had to be admitted to the Gokarno block health centre. The others are being treated at home. The dreaded fever has reappeared at Kusumkhola village in Jiaganj. In the past three days, 10 people were admitted to the Jiaganj block health centre.																								In the past month, 22 villagers were found afflicted with the disease at Harhari. 																								Sarkar said: There is no need to panic. One of the three died before tests were conducted on him. We are not considering it a case of kala-azar.																								The chief medical officer said health workers are going to the affected villages, collecting blood samples from patients showing symptoms of kala-azar and sending them to the School of Tropical Medicine in Calcutta for tests. We have made arrangements for treatment of those found suffering from the disease, Sarkar said.																								Reports of kala-azar have also come from Samserganj, Farakka Bhagabangola and Behrampore. Health officials said there was a dearth of medicines initially but there is no scarcity now.

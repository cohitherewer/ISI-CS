The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Reforms first, managers later
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, July 28: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government plans to bring in qualified professional managers to run sick state-owned public sector undertakings, but only after they are restructured. 																								We will not be able to engage professional management groups at the moment because we will not be able to afford it. We will first have to take up financial and administrative restructuring of the units before handing them over to professional managements, said commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen.																								To realise this aim, the government has engaged a consultant firm to suggest ways to restructure the sick PSUs, Sen said. The government would retain full control of the ailing units that can be revived by restructuring. 																								Speaking in the discussion on the commerce and industry budget, the minister said this after Trinamul Congress legislator Partha Chatterjee charged that the government was making a mistake by placing a WBCS officer at the helm of affairs of the state-owned medicine manufacturer, Gluconate Health Ltd. 																								He also unveiled the governments plans to encourage small and medium industries. Earlier industries in our state used to be labour intensive but now, the trend has changed and it has become more capital intensive. In Haldia Petrochem, Rs 6,000 crore has been invested but the project has provided employment to about 750 persons. So, we will have to give importance to downstream industries that will provide employment to a large number of people, he said.																								Laying down the governments policy on small and medium industries, Sen admitted the governments failure to bring in big industries but maintained it was able to woo small industries investing between Rs 10 and 20 crore. These industries have tremendous employment potential and the state will benefit from it, he added.																								At this, Trinamul MLA Saugata Roy quipped: Sometimes we have a feeling that you are actually the small-scale industry minister of our state.

 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Inmate pricks rehab bubble
 BHAJAN GANGULY																								Howrah, Aug. 7: An inmate of Howrah Jail today lifted the veil off the much-hyped criminal rehabilitation programme across the state, saying criminals were still being made out of those who were not.																								Ramua, who was in the jail for over six months in connection with a drug-peddling charge, condemned the polices half-hearted effort to rehabilitate prisoners. 																								Those who are trying to reform us are responsible for turning us into criminals, Ramua said. 																								I was first apprehended for extortion and I served my term. When I came out, I had no intention of resorting to crime again, but was booked the next day on the false charge of trading heroin.																								Ramua today presented his case before a host of senior officials, including inspector-general of prisons Joydeb Chakraborty, Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee and district magistrate S. Kishore, who were in the jail for the first evaluation of a rehabilitation programme organised in association with the Ramakrishna Mission Janasiksha Mandir. 																								The programme had been initiated on June 28. Saturdays session was for the inmates to voice their views on it.																								The allegation that police action spawns miscreants is not totally correct, said Chakraborty, who had not anticipated the twist to the proceedings. 																								The police have to maintain relations with criminals to keep a watch on other criminals. Veteran criminals are always under watch, he said. 																								A jail official, however, revealed that Ramua was not the only frequent guest. Ramavtar, who had been imprisoned on the charge of selling heroin, was released a few days ago and arrested the same day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Basu better in Mamata report card
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTCalcutta, May 13: Mamata Banerjee today played a tune that she has made her own  Presidents rule. 																								In Bengal, free and fair polls are not possible minus Presidents rule. You have seen how I worked hard, physically and mentally, for this election. Democracy was again demolished in the state, Mamata told a news conference.																								The Trinamul Congress chief said she would renew discussion on the partys demand for Presidents rule in Bengal. We will have to discuss this (the call for Presidents rule) within the party, she said. 																								However, Mamata, the lone Trinamul MP, would not have the usual chorus of party colleagues in Parliament when she pleads for central intervention.																								The former Union minister refused to admit that her party suffered defeat in a fair game. I dont consider this a defeat. The ruling party has used goondas and the police administration to rig the polls. 																								She refused to blame her partys organisational weakness for the outcome.																								However, Jyoti Basu, during whose chief ministership Mamata emerged as a leader in Bengal, won a certificate. Basus regime was better than Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees so far as rigging and booth-capturing go, Mamata said. When Jyoti Basu was the chief minister, rigging was not carried out so blatantly. With the one occupying the chair at present, elections have become a nightmare. 																								Trinamul, Mamata said, will remain part of the NDA and the results would not affect the party workers morale. They would remain loyal and will plunge with renewed vigour to fight the CPM, she said.																								Unlike after the 2001 Assembly polls, Mamata did not charge the Election Commission with bias. What can it do if cadre posing as election personnel and police help in rigging? 																								Candidates like Krishna Bose, Nitish Sengupta and Ranjit Panja cannot lose without rampant rigging and booth capturing, Mamata said.																								Reminded that the Congress had bagged six seats, Mamata said: The understanding between the CPM and the Congress was exposed at last.

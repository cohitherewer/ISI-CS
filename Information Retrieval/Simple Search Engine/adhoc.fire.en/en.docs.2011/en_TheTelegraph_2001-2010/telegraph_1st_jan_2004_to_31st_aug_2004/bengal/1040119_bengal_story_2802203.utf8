The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Booklet bullets fly in tax war
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Jan. 18: The Trinamul Congress has decided to bring out a document by the end of this month to counter the CPMs claim that the proposed taxes on pets, livestock and use of rural roads would not affect the poor.																								The document, a booklet, will describe 26 years of CPM misrule and justify Trinamuls February 3 bandh call. 																								In a circular sent to the panchayats in October, the government had proposed taxes on pets, cows, goats and other livestock. It also proposed levies on bicycles and rural transport like bullock carts.																								In the face of protests from the Opposition, the CPM, however, said taxes will not be imposed on the poor. State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said those who earn their livelihood selling the milk of a few cows or eggs of some hens will not have to pay any tax. 																								CPM leaders also said the directive was aimed at the affluent and mobilising resources to make the panchayats self-sufficient. 																								The CPM has circulated a leaflet countering the Oppositions criticism on the proposed rural taxes and Biswas has ruled out withdrawing the directive. But realising that the general elections are round the corner and the taxes would antagonise the rural vote bank, the CPM has shelved the proposal for now. 																								Withdrawing the circular, though, has become difficult as Trinamul has made it a condition for the withdrawal of the bandh.																								The CPM had said the rural taxes were proposed in accordance with an act framed by the Siddhartha Shankar Ray government in 1973. But Ray said yesterday the act was framed by the British in 1935 and his government did not implement it. 																								Unless the circular is withdrawn how do we know that the poor will be exempt from the taxes. The circular does not make any difference between the rural rich and the poor? asked Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee. Nalco selloff opposed																								Mamata Banerjee, now the Union coal and mines minister, today said any move towards disinvestment in the public sector aluminium company, Nalco, would be disallowed, says a PTI report.																								 The public sector company, Balco, has already been sold out. Any move towards disinvestment in Nalco would not be allowed, Mamata told a rally. 																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had earlier ruled out an immediate selloff in Nalco.																								Mamata had recently announced that no colliery would be closed and no retrenchment made in the coal sector. 																								Today she said a package is being worked out to save two lakh employees in the ailing Coal India subsidiaries  Bharat Coaking Coal Limited and Eastern Coalfields Limited.

 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Trinamul guns for new top cop
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 23: The police chief of North 24-Parganas was shifted after the Opposition parties accused him of bias but the Trinamul Congress is not happy with the officer who replaced him either.																								Trinamul MLA Saugata Ray, who is contesting the Lok Sabha polls from Diamond Harbour, said the party today lodged a protest against the new North 24-Parganas superintendent of police, B.. Ramesh. Several allegations have been raised against Ramesh from time to time, he said. 																								Trinamul spokesman Pankaj Banerjee said: We are collecting details about the incumbent and would inform the Election Commission about it. 																								Ramesh was appointed after Basudeb Bag was removed following a poll panel order. Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee declined comment on the allegations. All I can say is the government consulted me (on the appointment) as per the commissions instruction, he said.

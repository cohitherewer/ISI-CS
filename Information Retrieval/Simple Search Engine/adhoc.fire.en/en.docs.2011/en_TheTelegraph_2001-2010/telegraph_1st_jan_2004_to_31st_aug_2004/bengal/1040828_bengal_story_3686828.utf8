The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Metal Box bosses face siphon charge 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug. 27: A recent inspection by enforcement officers from Delhi and Bengal has led to the discovery that the management of Metal Box India Limited took out funds to the tune of about Rs 11.79 crore from its deposit of employees provident fund with the Reserve Bank.																								All nine Metal Box factories  once reputed manufacturers of packaging material and containers  including two in Calcutta closed down between 1987 and 2003 but its Delhi office is functioning. 																								During the inspection at the Delhi office, the authorities could not allegedly produce relevant documents like cash books, bank reconciliation statements and balance sheets to the officials. 																								Senior provident fund officials said no documents showing utilisation of the funds were produced either.																								Regional provident fund commissioner A. Mahendra Raju said: We had been receiving complaints from trade unions as well as employees that post-retirement settlements were not being made properly. Often, they were being sent to wrong addresses.																								Raju said he has appealed to Delhi High Court to have the Metal Box head-office shifted back to Calcutta as the complaints are mostly from employees here. We want the Metal Box board of trustees handling PF to function under our direct supervision here. The Calcutta office was shifted to Delhi without the our permission and so we want it back, he added. The case will come up for hearing on September 29. 																								Once we get the office shifted, we plan to create a task force comprising PF inspectors, trade union representatives and the management to look into the irregularities. We will also engage an independent auditor to have a look at papers relating to PF since 1989, Raju said. 																								Aloke Mukherjee, the president of Metal Box Workers Union, said 550 workers are still on the companys rolls in Calcutta and 1,550 employees who have retired have not received or only received part of their retirement dues. 																								City mayor and state Intuc chief Subrata Mukherjee demanded a CBI inquiry into the affairs at Metal Box. This is serious and only a CBI probe can reveal what the management did with the crores that cant be accounted for. They have cheated the state government of crores of rupees in various taxes, he said.																								In 2002, the industrial reconstruction department had asked the commercial tax commissioner to initiate legal proceedings against Metal Box according to sales-tax laws.

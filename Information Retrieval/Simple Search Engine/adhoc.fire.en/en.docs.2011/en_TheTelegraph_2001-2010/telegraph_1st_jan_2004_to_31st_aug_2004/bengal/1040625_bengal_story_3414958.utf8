				 																																	Cooch Behar, June 24: On Tuesday night, Rabi Burman had claimed that he had found an abandoned baby boy crying by the road at Tiadaha village. A day later, he handed the child to police after the body of an unidentified woman was recovered from near the same spot.				 																																	Today, he broke down at Dinhata police station and confessed that he had strangled the woman, the mother of the child he rescued, to death. Rabi, 25, has been arrested. 				 																																	Yesterday, the eight-month baby was handed to Rupeswari and her husband Jatra Burman. Residents of Tiadaha fondly named him Haradhan. 				 																																	Sources at the police station said the dead woman has been identified by her husband as Sukumari Mahato of Hashimara in Jalpaiguri district. The baby would be handed to the father. Rabi, a cook in Hashimara, apparently had an affair with Sukumari, a domestic help.				 																																	Midnapore: Chittaranjan Ghosh, 73, of Sitanagar in Chandrakona, about 150 km from Calcutta, fired from his rifle to foil a dacoity last night and killed one of the gangsters.

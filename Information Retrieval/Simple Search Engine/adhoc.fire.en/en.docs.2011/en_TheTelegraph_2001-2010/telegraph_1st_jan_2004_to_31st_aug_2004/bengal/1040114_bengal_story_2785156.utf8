The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Boy missing for months found dead
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar (Nadia), Jan. 13: Police today recovered the decomposed body of a Class XII student from a field adjoining a spinning mill near Kalyani.																								A school bag with science textbooks and a marksheet were lying close to the body of Amit Saha, 17, who went missing two-and-a-half months ago.																								A student of Adarsha Sikshayatan, a higher secondary school at Gokulpur in Kalyani, about 50 km from Calcutta, Amit left home around 6.45 pm on September 22 for private tuition. He did not return that night. Father Haripada Saha lodged a diary with the police the next morning. 																								Preliminary investigation revealed that Amit was killed after being kidnapped. But we are still clueless about the motive. The body has been sent to Calcutta for forensic examination, said subdivisional police officer Prasun Banerjee. 																								Nadia superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty said tonight: May be some of his friends were behind the murder. We are planning to interrogate some of them. The needle of suspicion is pointing towards friends as the kidnappers did not ask for ransom. Haripada is a small businessman and had no known enemy, said Chakraborty. 																								A grieving Haripada said: I thought he fled with friends and would return home. He was a good student.

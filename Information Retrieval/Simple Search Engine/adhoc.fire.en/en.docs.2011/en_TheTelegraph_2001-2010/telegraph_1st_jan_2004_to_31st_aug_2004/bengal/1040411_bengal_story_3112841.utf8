The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Voters list slur on CPM
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta, April 10: Trinamul Congress leader Pankaj Banerjee today told chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee that there are largescale anomalies in the Bengal voters list.																								Pankaj Banerjee said: The ruling CPM, with the help of a section of the district administration and the election department, is making the voters list according to its wish.																								He reported 14 lakh anomalies and said more would follow after the completion of our investigation into the Assembly seats, from Darjeeling to Sagar.																								Pankaj Banerjee said the anomalies include repetition of some names on the list. I dont believe these are accidental occurrences, and am of the opinion that the list has been compiled with vested political motives. We want the people to know and protest against this hoodwinking of the masses by the CPM.																								The leader said the chief electoral officer had not taken any action after Trinamul representatives complained in December last year. He also pointed a finger at a leader of the state co-ordination committee, alleging bias towards the ruling party.																								The state Congress today sent a fax to Chief Election Commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy complaining about the recent attack on party MP Adhir Chowdhury, who is seeking re-election from Behrampore. 																								Both the CPM and the Murshidabad district police are targeting Chowdhury and we want the Election Commission to intervene as the chief electoral officer here is doing nothing, said its general secretary Manas Bhuniya.																								Amid all this, Trinamuls Burdwan unit has complained against CPM election graffiti on a wall in Ukhrid in the Khondoghosh police station area. 																								The red, black and blue graffiti urges people to avenge the 2002 Gujarat riots. It lists seven points, including statements like 200 women were raped in front of their family members, and asks voters if they would still elect the BJP or its NDA partner, Trinamul. The BJP is in power in Gujarat.																								Trinamul cadre photographed the graffiti and sent copies to the poll panel and the district magistrate, saying such statements violated the model code of conduct and could cause communal tension. Khondoghosh is a Muslim-dominated area and is considered a CPM stronghold.																								District magistrate Subrata Gupta has said he would investigate.

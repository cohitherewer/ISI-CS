 OUR BUREAU 																								Burdwan/Barasat, March 31: The report of an inquiry into complaints against North 24-Parganas superintendent of police B.. Ramesh by some police lobbies was submitted to new state police chief Shyamal Dutta. 																								Deputy inspector-general (Burdwan range) K. Harirajan conducted the inquiry, examining about 30 police officials of ranks ranging from deputy superintendent to constable. The probe was order by former director-general Dinesh Vajpai.																								The probe followed complaints against Ramesh by the Burdwan chapters of the West Bengal Non-gazetted Police Karmachari Samity, the West Bengal Police Association and a local organisation, the Nabajagaran Ganatantrik Mancha. 																								I received the report today. But I have taken over as the new DG only three hours ago. I will have to go through it before I can make any comment, said Dutta. 																								Contacted at his residence, Ramesh denied the allegations. Ramesh, dogged by controversy, was shifted from Burdwan after North 24-Parganas police chief Basudeb Bag was removed following an order from the Election Commission. Rail officer suspended																								The assistant station master of Mazherhat in the Sealdah south section was suspended for negligence after train services were held up for two hours from around 6 pm. First, a signalling system fault was repaired, but still services could not resume due to a mechanical fault, for which the officer was held responsible.

New Delhi, April 16 (PTI): A Delhi court today gave the CBI three days transit remand to produce before a court in Calcutta the Ananda Margi arrested in connection with the Purulia armsdrop.																								The CBI claimed in court that Acharya Tadhbhavanand Avadhoot alias Lal Chand Parihar was the prime conspirator in the 1995 incident.																								Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ravinder Dudeja asked the bureau to produce Parihar before the chief metropolitan magistrate in Calcutta before whom the armsdrop chargesheet was filed, by Sunday.																								The Interpol had issued a red corner notice against him, a special public prosecutor told the court.																								Parihar, a resident of Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir, was arrested from the upscale Chanakyapuri area here yesterday. The CBI had chargesheeted him on March 20, 1996, along with 13 others. An Antonov 26 flew over Purulia on the night of December 17, 1995, dropping a huge cache of arms and ammunition near the Ananda Marg headquarters.																								A key accused, British citizen Peter Bleach, was released by the Union government this February following a presidential pardon. Another key accused, Danish citizen Kim Davy, is absconding.

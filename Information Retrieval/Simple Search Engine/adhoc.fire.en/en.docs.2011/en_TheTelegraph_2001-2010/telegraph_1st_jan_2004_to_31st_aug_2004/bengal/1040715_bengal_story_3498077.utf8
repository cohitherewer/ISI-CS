 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Hard-up couple jumps off ferry with baby 
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, July 14: Mohammad Imtiaz boarded a ferry last Friday with his young wife and infant daughter in tow. He stood on the upper deck, holding the hand of his wife, who was clutching little Simi. The passengers saw them looking at the horizon, and the next moment, there was a loud splash. 																								Unable to bear the torment of penury and the humiliation heaped by family members, the young couple chose death. 																								The bodies of 27-year-old Imtiaz and eight-month-old Simi were fished out of the Hooghly last night. His wifes body hasnt been found. 																								It was a tragic incident in which three lives were lost, but it must be mentioned that the report of the incident came in late, rendering us helpless, said Sanjoy Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).																								The Hooghly Nadi Jalapath Paribahan Samabaya Samity Ltd, which runs the ferry service, filed a report on Saturday. 																								He said the bodies have been handed over to the West Port police station and sent for post-mortem. Imtiazs father had claimed the corpses. 																								Imtiaz, a resident of the Calcutta Port Trust quarters on Bhukailash Road, worked as a welding labourer in the port area and barely earned enough to the home keep fire burning. For long, Imtiaz had been taunted by the cruel remarks passed both by his family and his in-laws. 																								Over the last few months, things took a turn for the worse. Work was difficult to find and the family faced a serious financial crunch. As it became more and more difficult to provide for his family, Imtiaz became depressed. 																								Unable to find a way out of his predicament, Imtiaz seems to have sealed a suicide pact with his wife. He took out his family and boarded the MV Jalajatra, which was on its way to Nazirgunge in Howrah from Metiabruz. 																								Mid-voyage, before the passengers could react, they jumped off the ferry. All three were sucked in by the current midstream as soon as they fell into the river. 																								Yesterday, the bodies of Imtiaz and Simi were seen floating near Panchpara ghat in Howrah. The River Traffic Police were informed and a team fished out both the bodies. 																								It is obvious that Imtiaz was an emotional person and acted impulsively. We are not sure whether he had told his wife about his intention to commit suicide before they boarded the launch. But when they jumped into the water, they evidently intended to end their lives as per the accounts of the launch personnel, said an officer attached to West Port police station.

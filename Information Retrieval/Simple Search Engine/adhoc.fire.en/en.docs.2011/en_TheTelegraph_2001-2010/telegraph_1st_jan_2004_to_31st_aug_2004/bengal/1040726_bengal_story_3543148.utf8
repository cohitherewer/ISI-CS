The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Revenue nudge to panchayats 
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Tough talk: Aiyar at the conference. Picture by Amit Datta																								Calcutta, July 25: Panchayats will have to raise their own revenue, Union minister for panchayati raj Mani Shankar Aiyar said today. 																								Citing the example of Karnataka, Aiyar said the state could be taken as a model for the way panchayats there have imposed taxes to realise revenue. 																								The minister was speaking at the conclusion of a two-day round table on panchayati raj in Calcutta. This conference was the first of seven to be held to formulate a joint action plan by the states and the Centre for devolution of responsibilities and finances to gram sabhas. 																								Aiyar called for electronic monitoring by the states to see if there is delay or diversion of funds meant for the panchayats. State panchayat minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said Bengal already has such a monitor in place. 																								Panchayats have been communicating to us regularly about funds utilised in course of the Pradhanmantri Rozgaar Yojna via e-mail, he said.

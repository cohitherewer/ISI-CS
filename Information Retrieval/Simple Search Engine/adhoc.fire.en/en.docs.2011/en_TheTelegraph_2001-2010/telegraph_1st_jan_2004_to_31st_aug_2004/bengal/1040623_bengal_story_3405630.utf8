 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Bar on books beyond syllabus
 ABHIJIT CHAKRABARTY																								Balurghat, June 22: The education department has barred five private schools here from following books of their choice. 																								The order to stick to the government-prescribed syllabus met with resistance from the school authorities and parents but the department has stuck to its stand. The parents found no fault on the schools part in using reference books and encyclopedias but their protests, lodged with the district inspector of schools, were futile.																								They have been told that nothing out of syllabus could be taught unless the district primary school council issues an order to that effect.																								The directive to Lalit Mohan Primary School, Monimela Primary School, Balurghat Girls Primary School, Abhijatri Primary School and Balurghat Primary School was signed by district inspector of schools Amalendu Mahanta and said no additional books other than those recommended by the state should be prescribed to students.																								We have asked the schools to teach the books included in the syllabus. I have nothing more to say, Mahanta said. He refused to react when asked why only five schools were sent the notice.																								He added that the order to restrict teaching to state-prescribed books was passed quite some time ago.																								It is only now that the order is being implemented, Mahanta said.																								The guardians were not happy with the explanation. We took special initiatives to get our children admitted to these schools because they took extra care and taught from reference books to provide them a good grounding. The council has no business being autocratic, said one of the guardians.																								You cannot play with the future of bright young minds by making them learn from a single book on all subjects, said Shivaprasad Chaki, the grandfather of a student of Balurghat Primary School.																								The system of clearing examinations in order to get promoted has been abolished and there is no reason to make the students stick to the thin syllabus devised by the primary education council, he added.																								This is an unfair system. If teachers can teach more, why should it be disallowed?																								About a hundred guardians of students of Balurghat Primary School have met the district inspector of schools and handed a letter demanding that the bar on extra books be lifted. 																								One of the guardians asked why the government order was being implemented in five schools alone. 																								The council should not interfere with the system of schools trying to improve quality of teaching. This is an attempt to lower standards, said Manjula Sarkar, whose son studies in Abhijatri Primary School.																								Head teacher of Abhijatri Sudhin Chakraborty said: We are helpless. The guardians are regularly urging us to re-introduce the books but we cannot. Anita Sinha of Balurghat Primary School echoed Chakraborty.

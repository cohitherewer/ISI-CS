 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Bar fumes at dispute bill 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 16: The West Bengal Bar Council has threatened a stir if the government tries to constitute proposed block-level conciliation boards or shalishi sabhas to settle disputes before they are brought to court. 																								Reacting sharply to a letter by law minister Nisith Adhikary seeking the councils opinion on the proposed legislation, chairman of the councils executive committee Uttam Majumdar said lawyers would stop the legislation by launching a movement.																								The chief minister gave us his word that this bill would not be tabled. But we have information the bill (will be placed) in the coming session, Majumdar said. 																								He said the proposed Block-level Pre-litigation Conciliation Bill has been opposed by all 172 bar associations across Bengal. The bill envisages boards comprising local influential persons and a lawyer to convince people to settle disputes outside courts.																								The intention of the bill is to curtail the power of the judiciary, a council member said.

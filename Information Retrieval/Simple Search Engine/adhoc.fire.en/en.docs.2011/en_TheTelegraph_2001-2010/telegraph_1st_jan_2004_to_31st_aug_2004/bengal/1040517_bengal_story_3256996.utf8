The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Airport hoax after Big B flick
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Krishnagar, May 16: Excited after seeing an Amitabh Bachchan pot-boiler, a teenager today called up Dum Dum airport saying a Delhi-Calcutta flight was carrying explosives. 																								Nineteen-year-old Rupak Biswas, a Class XI student of a school in Mahishbathan, about 190 km from Calcutta, rang the RDX alarm this morning.																								Airport officials took down the number flashing on the caller identification device and immediately rang up Nadia police. 																								The police swooped down on Rupaks home around 2 pm. He was taken to the local Karimpur police station. The parents had no clue what their son was up to.																								Rupak confessed to his prank during interrogation. 																								Circle inspector Nirmal Bhattacharya said the boy told them that he drew inspiration from Kohram, in which Bachchan featured with Nana Patekar, and television serial Hukm Mere Aka.																								Bhattacharya said Rupak claimed to have no ill intent. He just wanted to scare people and have some fun. 																								However, he did not anticipate where the desire for fun could land him. A special team from the airport will reach the district tomorrow to question him, Bhattacharya said. 																								From the comfort of home and the luxury of a television, Rupak will have to bear with a night in the lock-up.																								His mother Sandhya could not come to terms with the fact that he did what the police are saying he did.

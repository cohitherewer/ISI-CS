The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Opposition plots grand alliance
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Somen Mitra with Sudip Bandopadhyay at the central Calcutta rally. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Calcutta, March 30: A tacit alliance between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine appears to be emerging in key Lok Sabha constituencies.																								Two days ago, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas accused in public a section of Congress leaders of colluding with Trinamul to ensure the defeat of its nominees in some seats.																								The CPM is sniffing a mahajot (grand alliance) in Basirhat, Jadavpur, Calcutta Northeast and Northwest, Nabadwip, Krishnagar, Barasat and Malda. 																								The Congress has left the Basirhat seat to a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) candidate with little following to take on Trinamuls Sujit Bose. 																								In Jadavpur, the Congress is planning to put up a university teacher who has hardly any sway in the area. The CPM sees this as a walkover to Trinamul MP Krishna Bose. 																								In Northwest, though the Congress is backing rebel Trinamul MP Sudip Bandopadhyay in public, most party workers have allegedly shifted loyalty to the Trinamul candidate, mayor Subrata Mukherjee. Bandopadhyay is contesting as an Independent.																								Congress functionaries admitted that those belonging to Intuc, the partys trade union wing, are backing Mukherjee defying a whip. It is better to work for Subratada who is more likely to win, said a union leader from north Calcutta. 																								However, former state Congress chief Somen Mitra today shared dais with Bandopadhyay at the inauguration of his election office, which was followed by a public meeting. 																								In Northeast, the Congress is planning to field the president of its womens wing, Chandrima Bhattacharya, a very low-profile candidate, against veteran Trinamul MP Ajit Panja. 																								In Nabadwip and Krishnagar, Congress workers led by the Ranaghat MLA are allegedly working to ensure the victory of Trinamul and BJP candidates.																								In Malda, Trinamul chairman of Englishbazar municipality Krishnendu Chowdhury has been campaigning for veteran Congress leader A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury. In Barasat, the Congress has put up a former MLA with little organisational skill, Prabir Banerjee, against Trinamuls sitting MP Ranjit Panja. 																								We cannot lose sight of atrocities unleashed by the CPM on innocent party workers. The reality is that Congress workers are backing Mamata Banerjees Trinamul to prevent a split in anti-Left votes, said a Congress MLA from Nadia.																								Satyanarayan Bajaj, the Trinamul MLA from Jorasanko, said: We have not forged any electoral alliance with the Congress, which is the CPMs B-team, but if its workers help us, we cannot ask them not to.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Laloo keeps in touch with Bengal express
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, July 6: The rail budget has given Bengal a new train and an increase in frequency of several others, a clutch of extensions and gauge conversions. 																								West Bengal Express will ply between Sealdah and New Delhi as part of the Sampark Kranti trains linking state capitals.																								The Sealdah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express and the Howrah-Pune Azad Hind Express will now run daily, the Sealdah-Amritsar Akal Takht Express will be a biweekly, and the Sealdah-Alipurduar Kanchankanya Express will run four days a week. 																								The Amritsar-bound train from Asansol will now leave from Sealdah. The train between Asansol and New Jalpaiguri has been extended to run between Alipurduar and Ranchi.																								The budget did not mention the major ongoing project of a new terminal at Chitpur and just said that work is progressing on schedule on the extension of Metro Railway to Garia.																								However, it mentioned that work would be completed this fiscal on linking Dum Dum Cantonment to the airport as also Contai and Digha, and extending circular railway from Princep Ghat to Majherhat.																								Railway officials sought to allay doubts that omission of an ongoing project and the cursory mention of another meant the two projects will not receive any funds this year.																								As for the Chitpur terminal project, Rs 9 crore was allotted in the interim railway budget earlier this year, a senior railway official said. This, officials said, indicated that more funds were in the pipeline for the Rs 90.54-crore project.																								Work has already started and the first phase is scheduled to be completed by April 2005, an official said. Work on the Metro extension, too, is on in full swing. There is little doubt there will be funds for that also, he added. The project is scheduled for completion by 2008.																								Gauge conversion for the New Jalpaiguri-New Bongaigaon and Khana-Sainthia lines and the Bankura-Sonamukhi section is expected to be completed. 																								Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee said the budget was aimed at the elections in Maharashtra and Bihar. Some of the projects I had sanctioned as railway minister have found place in this budget...However, I must congratulate Laloo Prasadji for not burdening people with increased fares, she said.																								Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said: The budget will not only uphold the interests of the general public, it will (also) especially benefit the common people in Bengal.

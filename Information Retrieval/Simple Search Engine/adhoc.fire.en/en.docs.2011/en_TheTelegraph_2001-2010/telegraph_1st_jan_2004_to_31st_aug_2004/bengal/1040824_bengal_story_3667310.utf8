 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Beaten and harassed, nurse tries to end life
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Barasat, Aug. 23: Jharna Dutta, a senior nurse at a government-run health centre, attempted suicide by swallowing sleeping pills after she was allegedly beaten up, threatened and harassed by some colleagues on Saturday night.																								Dutta, superintendent of health (nursing) at the Dhanyakuria rural health centre in North 24-Parganas, was admitted yesterday to the Basirhat sub-divisional hospital in an unconscious state. Doctors at the hospital said her condition is critical.																								A letter found at Duttas Dhanyakuria residence  about 40 km from Calcutta  alleged that five employees had assaulted her after she had complained about their involvement in selling medicines from the stock of the rural health centre. The nurse had also said the five did not attend office regularly and indulged in other corrupt practices. She said she was being targetted because she protested against these practices.																								Duttas husband, Nemai, lodged an FIR with Basirhat police yesterday, pressing the charges mentioned in the letter. We have received a complaint from the nurses husband and initiated an inquiry. We are also inquiring whether she was sexually assaulted, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police. Kumar said Dutta would be examined after she was declared fit.																								District health authorities said Dutta had tried to commit suicide, but claimed they were not aware of any racket. We dont know why she has brought corruption and other charges against some employees. We are waiting for a feedback from the police to start our inquiry, said chief medical officer of health Shankar Saha.																								Saha, however, said Dutta was recently served a showcause notice for interfering in the duties of her seniors.

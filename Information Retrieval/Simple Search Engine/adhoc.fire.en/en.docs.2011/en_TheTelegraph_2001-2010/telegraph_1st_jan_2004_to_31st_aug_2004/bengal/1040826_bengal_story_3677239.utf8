 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 HS call for engineering cut-off marks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug. 25: The higher secondary council will request Calcutta High Court to ask the joint entrance board to fix cut-off HS marks to qualify in the tests to enter engineering colleges. 																								Officials of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education said that they lined up the move in the wake of mounting instances of candidates failing the HS exams and clearing the JEE. Most of these candidates, officials added, drag the council to court.																								At least three examinees who failed this years HS examinations had figured on the JEE merit list and secured admission to engineering colleges. They moved the high court challenging their HS results. 																								Last year, at least eight such students had filed cases in the high court.																								We dont mind producing the answer-scripts of as many students as who challenge our assessment but there should be transparency in the examination and the evaluation system followed by the joint entrance board as well, said Jyotirmoy Mukherjee, the president of the HS council. 																								We will soon approach the high court seeking an order to establish transparency in the examination and evaluation system followed by the joint entrance board, Mukherjee added.																								Even if a candidate clears the JEE, it is mandatory for all engineering and medical aspirants to have passed HS.																								Following the three petitions this year, the high court has directed the council to produce their answer scripts in court for re-evaluation.																								Sources in the education department said the council is justified in demanding fairness in the method of preparation of joint entrance engineering merit lists. 																								The engineering merit lists are prepared, among other things, on the basis of the total number of candidates required to fill up seats in engineering institutions  private and government, an official said.																								For instance, he explained, the government had empanelled 28,000 candidates for about 13,000 engineering seats this year. All JEE examinees who ranked within the first 28,000 have figured on the 2004 engineering merit list, irrespective of the marks they scored in the entrance, said the official. 																								Alok Das, a JEE board official, admitted that there is no cut-off marks for candidates seeking admission to engineering courses. 																								Students seeking admission to engineering institutions appear in English, physics, chemistry and mathematics tests. We cannot fix a cut-off percentage subject-wise as such a system will make it difficult for us to get enough students to fill up all engineering seats, Das said.																								However, students aspiring to study medical courses have to score 50 per cent in physics, chemistry and biology in both JEE and HS.

 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Teacher dies during grilling
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, Aug. 21: A 58-year-old school teacher and secretary of the CPMs local branch committee, Satyanarayan Singha, died yesterday during interrogation at his house in Chadrakona police station area by a CID official.																								Singhas widow, Swaha, lodged a complaint with the police holding the CID official responsible for his death at their residence in Midnapore, 170 km from Calcutta.																								The local CPM leadership said they would inform chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee about the death of the teacher of Chanda Primary School.																								Singha was unwell when the CID officer went to his house. He fell ill and died when the officer was questioning him. We are conducting a probe, said the West Midnapore superintendent of police, Vineet K. Goyal.																								Singha, the former secretary of the Kechkapur Krishi Unnayan Samity, was being interrogated by CID officials for the past two years in connection with the murder of Chittaranjan Ghosh, the samity manager. Ghosh was murdered in 1998 while returning with Singha and another samity member after withdrawing Rs 2.1 lakh from an account at the Tamluk-Ghatal Central Co-operative Bank.																								CID officials used to call him (Singha) to Kharagpur and Midnapore frequently. As a result, he suffered a heart attack, Swaha said.																								A CID official, Saroj Chakroborty, came to our house. I requested him to defer the interrogation as my husband was not well. However, Chakroborty did not heed my request, Swaha said.																								Singha, she said, fell from the chair after five minutes. We rushed my husband to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him dead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Beauty masks claws of hunger in valley
 AMIT UKIL Where hunger lurks: The idyllic Borogora village 																								Ayodhya Hills, June 21: The sylvan surroundings of Borogora camouflage grim reality.																								Nestled in a valley on the other side of a tourist spot, the village is about 8 km from the hilltop. Two-wheelers just about traverse the dirt track. The last 2 km has to be on foot, through narrow passages and inclines. 																								Less than 60 km from Purulia town, and about 300 km from Calcutta, the village is a far cry from the picture of prosperity the government wants rural Bengal to be seen as. You are the first to visit us in months. Three months ago, four people had come with polio drops, said an elderly Kartik Pahari Mura, one of his four grandchildren in arms.																								Thirteen families, comprising 60 people, manage to stay alive at Borogora. No, no one has died of hunger here, thanks to Garam Devata (the deity of the hills) and the jungle, said the adivasi, who could barely see with his left eye because of cataract. But malnutrition and poor health have led to frequent illnesses and disease. Many of us have died premature.																								For at least five days a week, these villagers live only on roots and rice water. Sometimes we go on fast simply because there is nothing to eat, said Sushila Mura, Kartiks neighbour. 																								On festival days  one or two in a year  they sacrifice one of their few goats and feast with meat and rice.																								With hardly any land to cultivate  the terrain makes it almost impossible  and no water except a thin stream 300 m away, the villagers earn their livelihood, or whatever it may be called, by collecting branches and cutting wood.																								Every Friday, some of us go to the haat (market) at Urma. It takes us the whole day to go and come back on foot. A head-load of firewood fetches between Rs 25 and Rs 30. With the money, we buy whatever rice and muri we can. When we need clothes, we save by hurting our stomachs, said Mohan Mura, a middle-aged man with a thin frame but still better built than Kartik.																								No one in the village knows that they are residents of a state called West Bengal. Nor do they know of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee or his claim that there are several schemes to help people of their ilk.																								Education is a much lesser priority, and would be if the nearest school  at Chhatrajhora  is a one-and-a-half hour trudge through hilly tracks.																								Kartik said none of the villagers was born in a health centre. The closest health facility is at Urma; its no use taking any one there. They die on the way.

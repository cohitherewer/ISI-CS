 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Wife, baby burnt to death
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Dhaniakhali (Hooghly), March 7: Rashida Bibi, a 22-year-old housewife, and her infant daughter were burnt to death this morning in a grisly murder that her father blamed on dowry demands. 																								The womans husband, Sheikh Safique, his mother and two sisters have been arrested from their house in Manickpur village under Dhaniakhali police station, 60 km from Calcutta. Safiques elder brother, Rafique, is absconding. 																								In his complaint, Rashidas father Sheikh Mohiuddin Sarkar, a resident of nearby Chandanpur, accused Safiques family of beating her up frequently to force her to ask for money from her father  a charge Manickpur villagers corroborated. 																								My daughter has been killed by my son-in-law and his family. They used to torture Rashida and told her to ask for more money from me. I did not know that my son-in-law is a drunkard. I have given my daughters in-laws a lot of things, including money, but could never satisfy them, he said.																								Villagers said last night there was a quarrel in Safiques house. Early this morning we were woken up by an alarm over a fire raised by Safique and his family members. We ran towards the house and saw smoke billowing out, said Sheikh Bapan. 																								When villagers entered, they found Rashida and her one-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Jyoti Parveen, in bed in flames. There was an empty kerosene can beside the bed. 																								What appeared strange to the villagers was that there were no shouts of help from Rashida after she caught fire. Also, we found both Rashida and her daughter lying on the bed as if in sleep. There was no sign of movement or struggle. We suspect Rashida and her daughter were first suffocated to death with the help of pillows and then set on fire, said Sheikh Karim, a villager. 																								The angry villagers gheraoed the family, but Rafique managed to escape. Police arrived later and arrested Rashidas husband, mother-in-law and sisters-in-law. Earlier, local CPM workers prevented the villagers from beating up Safique and his family. 																								Safique, a train hawker, claimed his wife had killed his daughter and committed suicide but could not put forward a plausible motive.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Wait for skeletons in twin reports
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SOUMI BHATTACHARYA				 	 A policeman stands guard outside the Rabindra Bhavan entrance on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta Santiniketan, March 30: Two  probe reports, Tagores missing memorabilia and action against  a host of senior officials will be on the agenda when the  emergency Visva-Bharati executive council meets tomorrow.																								The first, and more important, report, which will be tabled before the council members at 3 pm, will reveal the names of those held directly responsible for security lapses that led to the audacious theft of Tagores Nobel medal along with 51 other pieces of memorabilia. 																								As the executive council is meeting after a long time, and both reports are available, they will be discussed at length, Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Sujit Kumar Basu confirmed. 																								The second report, perhaps more damning for the university, will contain the names of senior academic and non-academic officials responsible for giving affiliations to a number of fake institutes between 1996 and 2000. 																								The inquiry initiated in end-2002 and conducted by former judge Moloy Sengupta is learnt to have identified key officials who had allegedly helped about 40 institutes across the country get Visva-Bharati affiliations. The probe report was submitted to the vice-chancellor 10 days ago.																								A secret probe initiated by the Union government in 2000 following complaints from students groups revealed that many institutes among the 40 were either fake or did not have the merit to deserve affiliation. The judicial inquiry followed.																								However, the campus was agog with speculation on the content of the memorabilia theft report which, according to some probe panel members, has indicted two to three officials responsible for handling security in and around Bichitra, particularly the museum.																								The National Volunteer Force personnel and the universitys internal security team, with about 10 members, have been found guilty of negligence. It is up to the executive council to decide their fate, which could range from suspension to removal from service, a probe committee member said. 																								The volunteer force members criticised the university for not taking steps to clear the undergrowth in the museum backyard or provide enough lights. We are being made scapegoats, said Bishnu Charan Laha, who was among the members of the force removed from their posts today.

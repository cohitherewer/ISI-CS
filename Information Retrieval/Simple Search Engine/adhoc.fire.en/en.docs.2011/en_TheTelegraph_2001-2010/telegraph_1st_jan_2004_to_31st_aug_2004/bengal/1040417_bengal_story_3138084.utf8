 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 HC note to polluting civic bodies
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 16: The high court today reminded 44 civic bodies of their duties by directing them to let it know their plans to check the pollution of the Hooghly.																								The order followed a report of the state pollution control board that said the municipalities had failed to build effluent treatment plants to control the pollution.																								The board told the court that untreated sewerage from the municipalities drainage outlets along the Hooghly was polluting the river. This is causing delay in implementing the Ganga Action Plan in the state, the report added.																								The board also said it had called all the 44 municipalities to a meeting to discuss the problem. Thirty of the municipalities attended the meeting, the board told the court.																								The green bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee observed that the court would have to take an initiative on this score and asked all the municipalities to be parties to the case.																								On the basis of the courts earlier orders, the board had acted against several industries on the banks of the Hooghly for discharging untreated effluents. The court was first petitioned by activist Subhas Dutta.

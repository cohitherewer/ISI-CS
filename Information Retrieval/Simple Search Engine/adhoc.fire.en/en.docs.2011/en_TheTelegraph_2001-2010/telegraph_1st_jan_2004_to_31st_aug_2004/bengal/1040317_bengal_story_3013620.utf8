 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 After farmer suicide reports, potatoes set sail
 OUR BUREAUHooghly, March 16: An initiative of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government following a suggestion from consultants McKinsey led to the first ever export of potato from the state today.																								Reports of potato farmers committing suicide after successive years of high yield prompted the government to step in.																								About 30 tonnes of potato were packed in two containers in the presence of industries minister Nirupam Sen to be sent to Singapore and Malaysia. Sudhanshu Sil, the CPM legislator who led teams from Sens department to Tarakeswar in Hooghly and Memari in Burdwan, oversaw the operation. 																								Each potato weighed more than 150 grams. Initially, 10 tonnes of potato would be exported every week. That would fetch about Rs 6 crore annually.																								McKinsey, which was engaged by the government to help it prepare road maps for growth in agriculture and information technology, had recommended emphasis on export of agricultural produce. 																								Tarakeswar Cold Storage and Bhola Shankar Cold Store at Memari were centres of activity today. 																								The CPM, under pressure following a spate of complaints from farmers, was closely involved in todays operations. At Memari, CPM zonal committee secretary Sukanta Konar supervised the packing. 																								According to the agricultural marketing department, the state produces 75 lakh tonnes of potato every year. Hooghly, which grows 70 per cent of the total, is considered the potato bowl. With the price of potato in the wholesale market sliding, Bhattacharjee had advised Sen to take the initiative to export potato.																								We are starting with an order of about 40 tonnes per month, which is a small amount considering that Malaysia purchases 200 tonnes of potato every year from Bangladesh, said Bijoy Musaddi, the chairman of BG Group, which has bagged the export order.																								Sil said export is the only hope for potato farmers. He added that the growers are now getting Rs 2.50 a kg and the price might go up to Rs 3.50 if the export continues.

 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Atal visit puts probe in shade 
 OUR BUREAU																								Santiniketan, March 31: Investigations into the heist at Visva-Bharati University have received a setback with law-enforcing agencies engaged in beefing up security for Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit on Friday. 																								Its exactly a week since burglars cleaned up the Rabindranath Memorial Museum but the investigation has almost ground to a halt. It is not because of a job well done and wrapped up, but because almost every senior and middle-ranking official has been pressed in to help in preparations for the Prime Ministers Santiniketan visit.																								Every officer, from assistant sub-inspector to inspector-general, was found busy discussing what sort of security ring should be thrown around Vajpayee and the route he would take.																								Birbhum superintendent of police Akhil Roy had no idea where the CBI team was at 5.30 this evening, hours after the officials arrived in Bolpur. I have not been able to contact them and I have no idea where they are. We are all very busy with the Prime Ministers visit, Roy said.																								Officer in-charge of Bolpur police station Mrityunjoy Banerjee had no idea either. Please, I dont have time to talk. There is a lot to be done before the Prime Minister arrives, he said.																								Police officials say they may be losing valuable time. Till Monday night, we kept conducting extensive raids. Since the moment we heard (on Tuesday) about the Prime Ministers visit, we have had no time to think about the investigation, said a senior official of the district police.																								The effect of the Prime Ministers visit was also felt at the emergency meeting of the Visva-Bharati executive council.																								The meeting finished in a record time of only an hour, whereas it normally takes two to three hours. I had to meet people from the SPG in view of the Prime Ministers visit, vice-chancellor Sujit Basu said.																								The fair ground at Santiniketan  where the helipad was being set up  had become the epicentre of activity. The senior officials spent almost the entire day on the ground and engaged in mock-drills with two Indian Air Force helicopters. 																								Inspector-general of police (intelligence branch) Sandhi Mukherjee, accompanied by Roy and other senior officials, was seen conversing with the four SPG officials who reached here from Delhi this morning.

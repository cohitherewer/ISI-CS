The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Extremist hoax at Loreto Convent 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Maoists inside? Onlookers at the Loreto Convent entrance. A Telegraph pictureDarjeeling, April 20: Parents rushed to the Loreto Convent here panic-stricken after unknown callers told some of them that Nepal Maoists had sneaked into the institution.																								Though only a handful of parents were contacted over the phone, the news spread like wildfire, throwing life out of gear for over two hours as they waited anxiously outside the school.																								Only after police arrived was it confirmed that the calls were someones idea of a prank.																								Binod Rakacha, a parent, said: I rushed to the school immediately after I received a phone call from a friend who told me that a person who refused to identify himself told him over the phone that Maoists had entered Loreto Convent.																								P.D. Bhutia, a Tungsung resident, said: My granddaughter is a student of Class III and as soon as I heard about the incident, I rang up the school authorities. Though they told me it was only a rumour, I decided to come over just to make sure everything was all right.																								Residents of the town were flooded with phone calls from concerned relatives and friends in Kurseong and Kalimpong, enquiring about the incident. 																								Min Liwang of Kalimpong said he wanted to come over to Darjeeling and was enquiring whether everything was normal in the school.																								The fear of Maoist strikes has gripped the Darjeeling hills after hundreds of rebels torched all government buildings at Pashupati Nagar, 36 km from the district headquarters, last week. This was the first ever incident of a rebel attack so close to Darjeeling.																								The parents anxiety is understandable, considering that the rebels have been on an abduction spree not very far from the India-Nepal border.																								Maoists have, in the past two days, abducted 22 youths from Kanyam area, forcing them to attend classes on political training.																								While 14 people were abducted from Gugane village in Illam district, which borders India, eight others were kidnapped from Tanpu village. Sources said the increased Maosit activity in the eastern district of Nepal has triggered an exodus with youths moving to Darjeeling district.																								Though school authorities refused to give details of the incident, it is learnt that they were unaware of the situation and realised something was wrong only after seeing the crowd waiting outside the school gate. 																								Parents were refused entry into the school and the convent had classes as usual.																								Darjeeling superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said: We are trying to find out who made the calls. Investigations are on.

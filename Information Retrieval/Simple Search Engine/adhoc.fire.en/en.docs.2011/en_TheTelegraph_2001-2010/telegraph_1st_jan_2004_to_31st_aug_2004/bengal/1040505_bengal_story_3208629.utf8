The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Bose goes ballistic on observers 
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Bose: Boom-boomCalcutta, May 4: Stung by the Election Commissions tough measures to ensure free and fair polls in its bastion, the ruling Left Front today opened a front against Nirvachan Sadan. 																								It charged a section of observers deployed in Bengal with acting like political leaders and warned them against crossing their jurisdiction in discharging duties. 																								In an emergency meeting at Alimuddin Street, the Front decided to ask the poll panel to rein in these observers. It also described the commissions decision to deploy polling personnel in Bengal from other states as an insult to the people of Bengal. 																								Front chairman Biman Bose named Ratnamala Rowla, observer for the Asansol Lok Sabha seat, and charged her with creating panic among the electorate in Ranigunj  a segment under the Lok Sabha seat. She met some voters in Ranigunj and asked them why they are voting for the CPM in every election. She also told the voters that this time she would make it difficult for the CPM to win the Asansol Lok Sabha seat. She also wanted to know whether the voters she met received any bribe from the CPM or whether the CPM organises booth-jamming during election days. We feel that the observer concerned has no right to ask such questions to the electorate, Bose complained.																								He also referred to Diamond Harbour observer A.Y.R. Krishna Rao and said he is trying to influence senior police and administrative officers to work according to his directives. 																								He accused that some observers in the Katwa Lok Sabha constituency of hiding their identities and asking voters whether the CPM used revolvers during election days. When the local people challenged them, they disclosed their identities as observers, Bose complained. 																								He claimed that similar reports were received by the party leadership from Bankura and South 24-Parganas. Observers are free to move anywhere in the state. But the manner in which they have been functioning make us feel that they are working for a political party, he further alleged.

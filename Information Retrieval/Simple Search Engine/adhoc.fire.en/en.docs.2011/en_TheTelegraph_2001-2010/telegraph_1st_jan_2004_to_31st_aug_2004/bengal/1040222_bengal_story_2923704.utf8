 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Suri, Feb. 21: Agitated over the delay in admitting two girls injured in a road accident, a mob ransacked the state-run Suri Sadar Hospital this morning and heckled a doctor there.																								According to police, a speeding bus hit Doli Bagdi, 18, and her sister, Sunita, 8, from behind around 10.15 am.																								The girls, residents of Tilpara and students of Netaji High School in Suri, were cycling to school when the accident occurred. The driver sped away, evading arrest.																								After rescuing the girls, locals took them to the Suri hospital, 204 km from Calcutta. But there were no doctors to attend to the injured. The ward master and the hospital superintendent were also not present.																								Paritosh Saha, one of those who rescued the girls, said the nurse on duty in the emergency department issued a call book to the on-duty doctor.																								But the doctor was neither in his quarters nor in the hospital, Saha added.																								After much effort, the hospital authorities contacted an off-duty doctor, Chanchal Chattaraj, and asked him to handle the case.																								According to the locals, the hospital authorities allegedly dilly-dallied for more than 40 minutes before admitting the critically injured girls for treatment.																								Irked by this, a mob  comprising hundreds of locals  gathered on the hospital premises. Already on a short fuse, the mob started breaking windowpanes and ransacked the hospital.																								It was amid the commotion that Chattaraj reached the hospital and fell prey to the fury of the agitated people.																								He managed to extricate himself from the clutches of the mob and later treated the injured girls.																								The police reached the spot after being informed by the hospital authorities and brought the situation under control.

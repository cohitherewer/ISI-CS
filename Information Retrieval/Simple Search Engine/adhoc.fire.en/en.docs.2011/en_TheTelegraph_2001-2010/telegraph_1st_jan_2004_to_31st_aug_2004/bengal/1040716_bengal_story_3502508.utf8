 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Digha tough on plastic 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, July 15: The rampant use of plastic despite a ban has spurred the Digha authorities to be more vigilant. 																								The Digha-Shankarpur Development Authority has decided to set up check-posts on the approach road to Digha to search cars and tourist buses for plastic bags. 																								We will hold these search operations without any previous notice. We want to take tourists by surprise. The details will be worked out at a meeting on July 24, said chairman Anandadeb Mukhopadhyay. 																								He said surprise checks would also be held in hotels in Digha, visited by 12 lakh tourists a year. 																								Officials said hotel owners in Digha have been told not to use plastic.

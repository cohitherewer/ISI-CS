 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Sudip knocks on Cong door
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, May 15: Trinamul Congress rebel Sudip Bandopadhyays return to the parent party seemed imminent today after he met former state Congress chief Somen Mitra and working president Pradip Bhattacharya at the party headquarters.																								Bandopadhyay, who unsuccessfully contested from Calcutta Northwest as a Congress backed-Independent candidate after being denied a Trinamul ticket, said he would take a formal decision at a political workers convention at Haryana Bhavan on May 22. 																								The Calcutta Northwest MP who lost his seat to the CPMs Sudhangshu Seal told reporters after his meeting with the PCC leaders that several Trinamul functionaries, including a few legislators, were in touch with him and would take a joint decision about returning to the Congress at the proposed convention.																								Mitra welcomed Bandopadhyay, saying the Congress door is open for all those who had left the party. Those who are ready to follow the policies and programmes of the Congress are welcome to join the party.																								Bhattacharya said the discussions today focussed on the procedure to accommodate him in the Congress. The state Congress has not yet taken any decision on the organisational post to be offered to Bandopadhyay after he rejoins the party.																								Sources said Bandopadhyay, who was merely a PCC executive member when he left to found the Trinamul Congress with Mamata Banerjee, may be made a general secretary.																								Bandopadhyays actor-wife Nayana, who is a Trinamul MLA from Bowbazar, is yet to make up her mind about switching sides. I have not given any thought to the matter. I was profoundly shocked by the Trinamul Congress performance in the Lok Sabha polls and almost decided to give up politics and concentrate on films. However, our close associates have persuaded me to remain in active politics, she said.																								She runs the risk of losing her Assembly membership under the anti-defection law if she decides to join the Congress.

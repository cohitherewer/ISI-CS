 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 KLO duo in net, AK-47s seized
 OUR BUREAU																								Alipurduar/ Cooch Behar, Jan. 24: Two KLO militants, Gobinda and Asim, were arrested from different parts of north Bengal today.																								Both are members of the fourth batch of cadre trained in KLO camps.																								Asim, alias Rabi Burman, is a resident of Nayarhaat Panigram in Mathabhanga. He was arrested by Cooch Behar police this morning from Echhaganj, also in Mathabhanga. 																								Police sources said Asim had sneaked into India on January 19 after the Royal Bhutan Army launched Operation All Clear. Senior police officials are interrogating him, they said.																								Gobinda, also known as Ranjit Roy and a resident of Jateswar area in Alipurduar, was rounded up by the Jalpaiguri police late last night from Salugara near Siliguri. 																								Two AK-47 rifles and 92 rounds of cartridges, were seized from him. 																								At a news conference this afternoon, the Jalpaiguri superintendent of police, Siddh Nath Gupta, said: Last November, during a police encounter at Lepchakha at Buxa Hill, two KLO militants were killed while five had managed to escape. Gobinda was one of them.																								Gobinda and six others, including a militant called Helatu Das, were at that time trying to enter India through Dalndi village on the India-Bhutan border adjacent to the Buxa Hill. 																								Gupta said the group escaped into the forests of Dooars on seeing the army posted on the border. Gobinda and Das, along with two other militants, Parimal Basunia and Pahar Singh, decided to hold a meeting at Changmari after a month and then they scattered in different directions. 																								They had with them three AK-47 rifles and 152 rounds of live cartridges, Gupta said. 																								Last Sunday, Das surrendered at Kumargram. 																								It was he who told us of Gobinda during the interrogation, the police official added.																								Gupta also claimed that substantial evidence was found to link Kamptapur Peoples Party leader Atul Roy with the KLO.																								Giving further details on this, he said: On January 2, Anirban, a second batch KLO militant, was killed in a police encounter at Maynaguri. A mobile phone was found on him. After analysing the information in the SIM card, the police found that till December 12 last year, Anirban had made several calls to Atul Roy, the ex-president of the KPP.

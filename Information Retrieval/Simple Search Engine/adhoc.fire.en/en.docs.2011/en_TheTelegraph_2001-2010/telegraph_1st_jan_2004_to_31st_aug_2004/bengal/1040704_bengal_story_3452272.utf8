 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 Khudirams noose strangles girl 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Krishnagar (Nadia), July 3: Last night, they watched mesmerised as freedom fighter Khudiram Bose walked to the gallows on the television screen his head high. Today, nine-year-old Jharna was strangled as she and her little sister tried to do a Khudiram. 																								Father Ram Das, who owns a grocery shop, left for work as usual this morning. Mother Nivedita asked Jharna and five-year-old Jhuma to play on their own as she paid a visit to a local doctor. 																								They could not have dreamt the turn of events in their Pepulberia residence, about 70 km from Calcutta. 																								The sisters had begun a playful drama based on the martyrs life. Jharna told her little sister to fasten a gamchha (towel) in a knot round her neck as their show reached its climax  the hanging. Little Jhumas efforts proved fatal and Jharna was accidentally asphyxiated. 																								As she lay inert, the little girl rushed out screaming: Didir phashi hoyeche. Alerted by her cries, neighbours rushed in, undid the knot and took her to a local hospital. It was too late. Jharna was declared brought dead around 2 pm. 																								Last night, the sisters avidly watched the movie Khudiramer Phasi on television. Jharna went to attend school and spent a lot of time animatedly discussing the story of the hero with her friends, said an officer of Hanskhali police station. 																								Jharna had just returned from school when Nivedita told both the children to remain indoors while she went to see the doctor, said police superintendent Biswarup Ghosh. We have sent the body for post-mortem, though it is evidently a death by accident, he added.																								Seven days ago, 10-year-old Reshmi was strangled to death in Calcutta when she tried to tie a towel round her neck like a cape as Shaktiman, a television superhero, does.

 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Highway heat on land owners 
 RABI BANERJEE																								Krishnagar, Feb. 19: The governments decision to ban buying and selling of land on either side of national highways has put the commoner in a spot. 																								The order issued last June bars transfer of land within 75 m from the centre of the highway unless it is meant for setting up an industry. The government took the decision after being prodded by the National Highway Authority of India to remove hurdles in the way of developing and widening highways. 																								Days before the circular was issued, Nirapada Ghosh, a farmer, got more than Rs 1 lakh against a portion of his land off national highway-34 at Muragachha in Nadia, about 55 km from Calcutta. 																								Ghosh spent the money on his sisters marriage. A few days later, the buyer came and demanded the money back citing the circular. I did not know that the government was coming up with such a circular. Now I am in a debt trap. I dont know when I can get out of it, said Ghosh.																								Joydeb Kundu was lucky. A bicycle trader at Ranaghat, Kundu was diagnosed as suffering from peptic ulcer. To undergo treatment in a Calcutta nursing home, he got Rs 10,000 against his five-cottah plot off NH-34. 																								As in Ghoshs case, the man who bought the land wanted his money back. Kundu had not spent the money and was able to return it. Like Ghosh and Kundu, many others who own land off national highways are at a loss. 																								Nadia magistrate Kanwaljeet Singh Cheema said: Eight months ago, the authority asked us to suspend all kinds of buying and selling of land on both sides of the highway. However, we have been asked to allow purchase of land linked with investment. The authority said land within 75 m of the centre of the road could not be transferred. We implemented the decision after discussing it with senior officials at Writers Buildings.																								All national highways in the state are being developed as part of the Golden Quadrilateral, said Cheema. We are simply carrying out orders.																								But in the absence of an awareness drive, land owners are confused. Land department officials admitted that there have been cases where plots have changed hands because neither the seller nor the buyer knew about the circular or because they did not know if their land was within the 75-metre mark. 																								Land reforms officer Bhabani Prasad Paul said: If during transfer of land there is some confusion about the distance of the plot from the highway, the buyer will have to sign a declaration saying his registration will be cancelled if it is found to be within 75 m.																								Shikha Ghosh of Bethuadahari, whose husband recently suffered a cerebral attack, said: I have to take him to a good nursing home. But I cant sell my land.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 21: Most judges and criminal lawyers of Calcutta High Court want hanging to be replaced by the administration of a lethal injection as a civilised mode of execution.																								The judges and lawyers have already conveyed their views to the Union law ministry in response to the governments query regarding the Justice Malimath Commission favouring administration of a lethal injection as the mode of capital punishment.																								The need for an alternative method of execution has been debated in the wake of the hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was sentenced to death for raping and killing a schoolgirl in Calcutta.																								At least 30 high court judges feel the method of execution should be changed immediately. The mode of execution must be entirely painless. Compared to hanging, application of lethal injection can be regarded as a civilised method of execution, observed a judge.																								Criminal lawyers of Calcutta High Court also urge that hanging be replaced as the method of execution by the administration of a lethal injection. Some of them want capital punishment itself to be abolished.																								The chief justice of Calcutta High Court, through a notice, asked us to give our opinions on a change in the prevailing mode of implementing capital sentence. It is obviously a matter of debate. But most of the high court judges support lethal injection as the mode of execution, said a sitting judge who preferred to remain anonymous.																								The National Democratic Alliance, which was in power at the Centre, had asked Justice Malimath, a former judge of the Supreme Court, to review the Criminal Procedure Code as the nature of the crime across the world was undergoing rapid changes.																								Once the Malimath Commission furnished its report, the Centre had sought the opinions of the judges of the apex court and the high courts, lawyers, law institutes and bar councils on the panels recommendations.																								The law ministry will place their views before Parliament, said Bengal law minister Nisith Adhikari.																								Most of our members favour a change in the mode of implementing capital sentence, Uttam Majumdar, a former secretary of the Calcutta High Court Bar Association told The Telegraph today.																								Personally, I am against capital punishment. But as long this punishment exists, I want the most painless method to be adopted to execute the sentence. Hanging is a primitive and uncivilised method and society does not want it to continue, said Jaymalya Bagchi, a criminal lawyer of Calcutta High Court.																								Bagchi said the process of execution by means of lethal injection would also be easier to carry out, as a doctor or even a para-medical worker could undertake the job.																								A day will come soon when hangmen will not be available, as nobody would like to put someone else to death, said the lawyer.

 PRONAB MONDALCalcutta, July 2: Calcutta police have done what their colleagues in Nadia couldnt  help restore a slightly mentally challenged girl to her elderly, distressed parents.																								Walking an extra mile, Calcutta police today sent back 18-year-old Asmoni Khatun to her home in Nakashipara, 140 km from here.																								The daughter of a farmer, Asmoni was found in a semi-conscious state on the Maidan by officers of Hastings police station while on patrol on June 10.																								She was reported missing in the second week of June from her home at Muragacha village. Mozammel Mallik and Chhabi Bibi rushed to Nakashipara police station to lodge a missing diary on their daughter.																								But they were not expecting what followed. Officers refused to help the elderly couple. Why should we waste stationery on a mad girl? Go home, your daughter will return on her own, one of them said.																								Asmoni nearly did return on her own, thanks to Hastings police station. She was groaning and clutching her abdomen (when we found her). We rushed her to Chittaranjan Hospital, said .D. Paul, officer-in-charge of the station.																								But it was 10 days before she spoke out. Asmoni uttered two words  Nakashipara and Muragacha. That was enough clue for the Calcutta policemen.																								We took photographs of the girl and sent 10 copies to Nakashipara police station. I spoke to an officer there who assured me a feedback within a day. More than a week passed, but there was no response, Paul said.																								Hastings police then decided to get cracking. After a green signal from Anuj Sharma, the DC (south), an officer was dispatched to Muragacha village. The moment he displayed the photograph, the villagers identified Asmoni, Paul said.																								My officer brought her parents here and they identified their daughter in the hospital, Paul added.																								The policemen showed as much concern for the couple as they had shown for their daughter. Mozammel and Chhabi were allowed to stay at Hastings police station for two days. 																								The aged couple had no place in the city where they could stay. They were in no position to afford a hotel room. They were not only allowed to stay here, officers served them meals, Paul said. 																								Even after identification, we could not hand over the girl to her parents. We had to wait for a directive from court, he added.																								Nakashipara police, however, still failed to be of any help. No one came to us to lodge a missing complaint in the past one month, an officer said over the phone.																								The chief metropolitan magistrate today directed Hastings police to hand Asmoni to her parents. A woman constable and an officer saw off the family on the Lalgola passenger train at Sealdah station this afternoon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 08, 2004 				 Digging deep for coal
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								Asansol, May 7: The second shift of miners at Bansra colliery was preparing to go down when 50-odd motorcyclists arrived.																								The revving engines and a cloud of dust heralded Maloy Ghatak, the Trinamul Congress candidate for Asansol.																								The scorching sun could not distract the miners as Ghatak said: Who said the Centre will close down the mines? The CPMs job is to misguide common people by telling lies. 																								And if the Union government shuts down a mine here, the CPM cannot reopen it because it does not have the strength to organise a movement in Delhi. The party is confined to Bengal and Tripura and is seeking your help because it wants to play a power broker in Delhi.																								The CPM has reasons to be worried about its chances here, about 230 km from Calcutta. Party nominee Bikash Chowdhury won with a not-so-comfortable margin of 37,864 votes in 1999; moreover, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee is now the Union coal minister. 																								In the 2001 Assembly elections, the CPM and Trinamul won three seats each in the Asansol Lok Sabha area. The Forward Bloc bagged the seventh, Kulti. Trinamul won Asansol, Hirapur and Baraboni and the CPM Ranigunj, Jamuria and Ukhra.																								Workers of nearly 90 Eastern Coalfields mines  about 35 per cent of the 10,98,687 voters in this constituency  are capable of influencing the outcome. Chowdhury and the Left trade unions know that. 																								Khadan theke sabaike daak. Bikashda esechen, meeting korben (Call everyone from the mine. Bikashda is here and will hold a meeting), cried out a Citu leader as Chowdhury arrived at a Lower Kenda colliery.																								A lift carrying a dozen miners made its way up. 																								About 55 per cent of the voters in this constituency are non-Bengali, mostly settlers from Bihar and Jharkhand. Chowdhury said in part Bengali, part Hindi: I know you are busy, I wont take much time. You still remember New Kenda (where several miners had died on January 25, 1994). The coal ministry is planning to close down most mines. You have to oppose this to protect your own interest. We are fighting the Centres move and I hope you will support us, Chowdhury said. The miners cheered.																								The New Kenda blaze in which 65 miners were burnt inside the mine still haunts miners and their families.																								Remember who was the coal minister then? Ajit Panja. He is now with Trinamul and seeking re-election from Calcutta. Had he contested from Asansol, New Kenda would have ensured his defeat. You wont get an opportunity to defeat Panja, but you can ensure the defeat of his party colleague, said Chowdhury.																								The CPM was robbed of some of its thunder after Mamata convinced Delhi to put off its decision to close some of the mines. 																								Ghatak was confident that the CPM would face a reversal but he warned against the Lefts terror tactic.

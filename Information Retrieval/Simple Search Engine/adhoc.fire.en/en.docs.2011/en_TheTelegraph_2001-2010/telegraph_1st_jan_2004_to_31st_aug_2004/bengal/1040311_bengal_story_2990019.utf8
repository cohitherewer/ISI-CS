The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 CPM steps into Sudip seat 
 							 - Jorabagan MLA nominated after talks with RJD collapse  OUR BUREAU 				 	 Sil: New role																								Calcutta, March 10: The CPM today announced MLA Sudhansu Sil would be its candidate for the Calcutta Northwest parliamentary constituency after seat-sharing talks with the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Delhi over the past few weeks broke down. 																								We are going to field Sil now that our talks with the RJD can be said to have ended, said state CPM secretary Anil Biswas. 																								The MLA from Jorabagan  which falls within Calcutta Northwest  is also the party chief whip in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in addition to being an important functionary of the CPMs Calcutta district committee, which recommended his name. 																								I am confident of sailing through as the people here would vote for me to ensure the defeat of the communal forces, Sil said after his nomination. 																								The Trinamul Congress has put up mayor Subrata Mukherjee from Calcutta Northwest while party rebel and sitting MP Sudip Bandopadhyay intends to fight as an Independent. In the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, Rajdeo Goala of the CPM lost to Bandopadhyay by a substantial margin. 																								Biswas said the CPM will field Prasanta Majhi for the Khandoghosh Assembly seat in Burdwan, bypoll to which will be held as the seat fell vacant following the resignation of MLA Jyotsna Singh. Driven by poverty, Singh has taken up a government job. 																								Sources said the CPM believes it stands a good chance if the rebel Trinamul MP ends up splitting the Opposition votes. The party reckons Bandopadhyay, who enjoys goodwill in the constituency, will eat into Trinamul as well as Congress ballots. 																								The Congress is yet to name its candidate for the seat; Bandopadhyay is soliciting its support. I will certainly talk to PCC chief Pranab Mukherjee when he returns to Calcutta to clinch the matter, Bandopadhyay said this afternoon. 																								The Congress is insisting that either Bandopadhyay join the party and contest on the hand symbol or criticise the NDA and accept Sonia Gandhi as his leader if he wants to contest as an Independent with its support.  Kabuliwala catch 																								The state BJP roped in Sushmita Bandopadhyay, who rose to fame by penning her experiences as an Afghans wife in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. 																								Around 3,000 families in Satgachchia  Jyoti Basus former constituency  in Burdwan who are members of a CPM-controlled fishermens cooperative also switched over to the BJP.

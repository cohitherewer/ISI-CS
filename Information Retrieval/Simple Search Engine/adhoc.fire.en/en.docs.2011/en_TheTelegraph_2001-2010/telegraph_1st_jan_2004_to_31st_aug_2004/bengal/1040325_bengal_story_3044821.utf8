 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Maulvis and madarsas strike at bias against girls 
 MITA MUKHERJEE  Calcutta, March 24: For  the first time in recent memory, the maulvi, one of the  traditional arbiters of the Muslim community, pledged today  to get more female students to Bengals madarsas where text  books, curricula and teaching strategies are seen to be  loaded in favour of male students.																								In the present days of womens equality and empowerment, we have unfortunately been following a curriculum that has a lot of in-built gender bias. We have to work together with the madarsa board to eliminate the bias, said Sheikh Abdul Rahman, one of 30-odd maulvis who attended a three-day discussion aimed at devising ways to ensure more access for female students to madarsa education. 																								Rahman and the other maulviss pledge was significant in that it meant the female students would be allowed to learn theology till the highest level which has always looked like a male preserve. The courses that are taught at the senior level are based mostly on theology  amin, fazil, kamil and mamatajul mahaddessin  and draw only a small number of girl students. 																								Our religion does not offer any room for discrimination against anyone on the grounds of gender, said K.H. Hassanuddin Ahmed, head of a senior madarsa, after the meeting at Calcutta Madarsa.																								On an average, 2,500 students appear in the amin examination every year which is equivalent to the Madhyamik of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. The number of female candidates in amin is less than 30 per cent of the total examinees. Their number is even fewer in the corresponding higher levels  fazil, kamil and MM. 																								During the last three days meeting, the madarsa board organised a random review of the mathematics and Bengali syllabi taught to students in the senior madarsa schools. 																								We are surprised to find that names of girls are hardly mentioned in the arithmetic books. It is only names of boys which find place in the sums of the arithmetic text books. Such a system is defective because in this way young children get to develop a gender-biased attitude from a tender age, said Mohammed Refatullah, a senior official of the madarsa board. 																								The maulvis, too, admitted this as a flaw and demanded that the board take necessary steps to ensure that there is at least 50 per cent female names and characters in the text books. 																								According to the principles of Islam, mothers and wives hold a very respectable position in Muslim society. But somehow much importance is still not given to promoting women education in the society. We are now prepared to take all possible steps to increase womens participation in madarsa education, said Mohammed Abdul Hakim Mollah, head of the Amdanga Senior Madarsa in North 24-Parganas. 																								The board, apart from bringing about changes in the text books, has also asked the heads of senior madarsas to engage more girls in extra-curricular activities in the schools.

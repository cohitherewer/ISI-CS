The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Raw deal for cement
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan 18: Several cement-manufacturing units in the Asansol-Durgapur belt are on the verge of closure because of acute shortage of raw material for the past six months.																								The essential raw material, clinker  a mixture of limestone, stone dust and iron dust  is carted to these units from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in railway wagons. However, the non-availability of wagons at Jabalpur and Bilaspur  under West-Central Railway  has severely affected the functioning of the cement units in the state.																								The Durgapur plant of Durgapur Cement stopped production on January 2 and other cement producers such as L amp;T, ACC and Ambuja Cement have been forced to reduce production drastically.																								Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen has written to railway minister Nitish Kumar that production in cement units in Bengal has been severely affected by the shortage of railway wagons available to transport clinker.																								The normal movement of clinker has suffered heavily since mid-October, 2003, due to diversion of wagons for the movement of coal, wrote Sen. The situation worsened in December, added the minister. 																								Sen requested Kumar to ask the south, eastern and central railways to provide adequate wagons for the movement of clinker from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to the cement plants in the state.

 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 CBI raid on colliery
 OUR BUREAU																								Burdwan/Durgapur, Jan. 10: The CBI today raided the Sankarpur colliery in Burdwan run by the Eastern Coalfields Limited, barely 24 hours after Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee took over as Union minister for coal and mines.																								The coal ministry had asked the CBI to probe complaints from several parties that they had received sub-standard coal.																								A seven-member team, led by an officer of the deputy superintendent rank, carried out the raid early today.																								While going through the documents  despatch slips and stock register  we found that the colliery had not maintained its records properly, a CBI source said.																								The figures in the record book did not tally with the amount of coal supplied, added the source. More than 27,000 metric tonnes of coal were supplied without any entry being made in the record books, the source said.																								The CBI has handed over a report of its findings to Eastern Coalfields authorities who have served showcause notices to three senior officials of the colliery.																								The assistant general manager of Sankarpur colliery, R.K. Kakari, admitted that the raid took place and said showcause notices have been served on general manager Mohammad Taslim, manager D. Kumar and his deputy H.C. Srivastava.																								Eastern Coalfields is also conducting a parallel investigation to find out the involvement of other staff. All those found guilty will be punished, Kakari said.																								Burdwan superintendent of police Kailash Chandra Meena said the district police were not informed about the raid. We have not been informed, but if they require any help from us, we are ready to provide it, Meena said.																								Eastern Coalfields sources admitted that some senior officers of the colliery were involved in digging out coal illegally from abandoned mines in the area.

 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Lakes find saviour
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER Calcutta, Feb. 6: The Centre  has included Rabindra Sarobar in the National Lakes Conservation  Project, which makes the murky Dhakuria lakes eligible for  funds and renovation.																								The conservation project now covers only 10 urban lakes. Out of the initial Rs 125 crore sanctioned for the project, Rs 6.96 crore will be spent on beautifying Rabindra Sarobar, now a haunt for bathers and utensil-washers.																								Manju Raina, the joint director of the National River Conservation Directorate, today filed an affidavit before a division bench of Calcutta High Court, stating that Rabindra Sarobar has been enlisted in the conservation project.																								The affidavit followed a public interest litigation seeking a court directive to the authorities concerned to make Rabindra Sarobar a pollution-free zone. The PIL was filed by environment activist Subhash Dutta. Other individuals and organisations joined in later.																								Under the project, Rabindra Sarobar will be cleaned up and all pollution control measures taken.																								Besides, lights on the bank and bathing ghats will be renovated. Boating facilities and a garden along the bank are also part of the project.																								As a custodial and nodal agency, the Calcutta Improvement Trust will have to take the responsibility of improving the conditions of the surrounding area.																								Dutta said he had received hundreds of letters from residents of south Calcutta, requesting him to carry on with the good work and save the lake from pollution. 																								The request prompted me to raise a demand for central allocation of funds for the development of the lake. I am happy that at last the Union environment and forest department has agreed to treat the lake under the project, he said.																								After the PIL was filed, the Calcutta Improvement Trust, in June 1998, declared the authorities were yet to sanction the Rs 201 crore proposed for the beautification drive.																								It was then that Dutta appealed to the court to let the lake be considered part of the Centres conservation programme.

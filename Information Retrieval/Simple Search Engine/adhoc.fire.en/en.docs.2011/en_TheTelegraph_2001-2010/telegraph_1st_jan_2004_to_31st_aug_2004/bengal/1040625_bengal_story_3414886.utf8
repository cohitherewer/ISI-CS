 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Children gasp, nurses go missing
 OUR CORRESPONDENTBurdwan, June 24: Sukumar Khetrapal, a one-year-nine-month-old child, was suffering from respiratory distress. The parents, who had brought him from Memari, 20 km away, could only watch helplessly despite having got the necessary injection because there was none to administer it at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.																								Eleven children like Sukumar suffered equally because nurses on duty did not turn up last night. The mothers sat through, injection syringes in hand.																								Trouble broke out today with the angry parents gheraoing the hospital superintendent. 																								The children were in rooms five and six, adjacent to the intensive care unit.																								The authorities handed over to the parents yesterday afternoon a list of injections to be bought. The parents said they informed the authorities when they returned with the injections but no nurse turned up. 																								They made us wait from 6 pm. But the nurses were nowhere to be seen, said Uttam Majhi, whose seven-day daughter Sagari is in the paediatric ward. The doctor had prescribed injections for my child for the evening and night. But whenever I went to call the nurses, there was no response, Majhi alleged.																								The nurses told us that the injections could not be administered at night. We had to buy fresh medicines today, said Sukumars grandfather.																								Hospital deputy superintendent Manju Murshed said: The parents have lodged a complaint. We have asked the nurses to state why the injections werent administered last night.

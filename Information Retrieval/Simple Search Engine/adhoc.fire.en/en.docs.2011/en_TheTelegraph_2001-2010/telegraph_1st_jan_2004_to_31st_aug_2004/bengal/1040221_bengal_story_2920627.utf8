 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Boy of six killed for witness link 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, Feb. 20: A six-year-old boy was kidnapped and strangled in Murshidabad in a suspected attempt to silence his uncle, who is the main witness to the murder of a local CPM leader.																								The body of Ahmed Saifulla, a student of Class I, was found in a field at Gobindopur village, 240 km from Calcutta, police said.																								Ahmed returned home from school yesterday afternoon and went out on the street in front of his house. He was missing since then. The body bore bloodstains in the nostrils and we think he was throttled, Domkal subdivisional police officer Chirantan Nag said.																								We suspect the boys murder is linked with the murder of Shamsuddin near Gobindopur last month because his uncle was one of the main witnesses to it, he added. 																								My brother Abdul Hamid, who was accompanying Shamsuddin, was also attacked but he escaped. Abdul is the main witness to the murder and so we were living in fear. I never imagined my son would be targeted, Nazrul Ali Mandal said.Father kills baby																								A man poisoned his 19-day-old boy to death in West Midnapore on Wednesday, police said, apparently because it was a love child.																								Though Jitmohan Das of Jaguli village married his lover and cousin Krishna two months ago after village elders ordered him to, he tried to get the heavily pregnant woman to undergo an abortion. But the doctor refused.																								Police said Jitmohan poisoned his son while Krishna was busy with chores. She raised an alarm, leading to his capture by neighbours.

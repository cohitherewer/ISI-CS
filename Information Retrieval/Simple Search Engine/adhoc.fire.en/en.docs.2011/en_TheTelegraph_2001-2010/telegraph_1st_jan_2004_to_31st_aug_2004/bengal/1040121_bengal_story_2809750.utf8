The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Mamata to replay B-team tune
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Jan. 20: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has asked her party to use the CPM move to support the Congress in areas where it is weak into a major poll plank during the Lok Sabha elections.																								Trinamul leaders drawing up pre-poll programmes say Mamata thinks her party is on a stronger wicket now that the CPM is ready to support the Congress since this helps her revive her old allegation that the Congress works as the CPMs B team.																								(The) CPM can only fight on its own strength in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. So, it means in most places in the country the CPM will support the Congress. This will provide us with a very vital handle against the communists, a Trinamul leader drawing poll strategies said.																								Mamatas antipathy towards the Congress has grown since the 2001 Assembly polls, when Trinamul allied with it and won a mere 60 seats. This time, Mamata has decided to launch an intensive campaign against the Congress, identifying it as a CPM ally to minimise division of anti-Left votes, a colleague said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, February 22, 2004 				 Buddha recipe for enterprise
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 21: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today urged students, particularly those studying secondary and higher secondary courses, to take vocational training at the school level so that they can start businesses on their own after finishing education.																								Addressing a Left Front rally in Dum Dum, Bhattacharjee said: Every year lakhs of students appear in the secondary and higher secondary examinations. It is not possible for everyone to score first division marks or fare extremely well in the examinations. So, what will happen to ordinary students?																								He said the government has introduced vocational training and courses so that mediocre students could avail of them after school education. 																								I ask you to take vocational training in your schools and start your own business without waiting for a government job, Bhattacharjee suggested.																								He also admitted that about 7 lakh children in Bengal are not going to schools.																								The dropout may be due to discontinuation of the mid-day meal scheme in the primary schools across the state. Now we have re-introduced the scheme and are expecting a better turnout in the primary schools. We know it is impossible to learn anything in empty stomach, the chief minister said.

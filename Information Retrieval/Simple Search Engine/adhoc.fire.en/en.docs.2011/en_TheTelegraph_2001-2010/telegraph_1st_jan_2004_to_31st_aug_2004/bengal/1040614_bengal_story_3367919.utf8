 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Glare on Howrah caterers 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, June 13: The Howrah Municipal Corporation has ordered a probe after 200 people fell ill after having a prawn and parwal dish at a marriage reception at Nabanaritala in Howrah on Saturday afternoon.																								Sixty-one of them, including women and children, have been admitted in the Satyabala Infectious Diseases Hospital and Howrah District Hospital, where the condition of five was stated to be serious. 																								Those who attended the marriage said the particular dish was the tastiest and most invitees had tucked into it. 																								The victims in hospital  on saline drip  complained that they have vomited repeatedly and experienced excruciating stomach ache. Some of them also fell unconscious. 																								They are under treatment and their condition is stable. However, the condition of five are serious, said Dulal Das, a medical officer of Satyabala hospital.																								We could not imagine that this will happen to us, perhaps the catering agency that served the food supplied contaminated food, said Khokan Bag, a patient in hospital. 																								Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee said the quality of food catered by agencies in Howrah town would be probed. The corporation will introduce licences for catering services, he added. 																								There will be a monitoring system for these catering services to ensure there is no such incident in the future, the mayor said. 																								The owners of catering services supported the proposal. There are several caterers who provide poor quality food. A monitoring system will curb malpractices, said Anindya Das, owner of a catering service.

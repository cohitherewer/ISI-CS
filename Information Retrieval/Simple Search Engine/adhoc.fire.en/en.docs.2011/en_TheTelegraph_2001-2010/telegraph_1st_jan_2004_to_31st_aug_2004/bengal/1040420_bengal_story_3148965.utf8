 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 RG Kar rejects plea to waive fees
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, April 19: Amrit Das overcame extreme poverty to qualify for the joint entrance examination.																								But his long-cherished dream of becoming a doctor seems to be heading to a crash end with RG Kar Medical College and Hospital turning down his appeal for a fee waiver.																								Amrits four sisters are married and two elder brothers live elsewhere. He stays with his third brother and at 65, his father is not strong enough to work anymore.																								I went to the principal with certificates from (the) proper authorities stating my financial condition. I gave a written application to him to waive my fees but he turned me down, said Amrit, who is from a remote village in Sagar island in South 24-Parganas.																								The state government had announced that 10 per cent of MBBS students would be granted free education. But although I am facing severe financial constraints, they do not want to consider my case, he added.																								Utpal Dutta, the RG Kar principal, denied the allegation. There are some technical problems. He must apply for merit-cum-means scholarship to the state government. The principal has nothing to do with it, Dutta said.																								He can apply for a Scheduled Caste scholarship, but getting fees waived would be better for him. I can definitely forward his application to the proper authorities, he added. 																								A students body opposed to capitation charge and fee hike is standing by Amrit. Amrit and many others like him are not being able to go for higher studies due to the governments policies, alleged Mridul Sarkar, the convener of the body.

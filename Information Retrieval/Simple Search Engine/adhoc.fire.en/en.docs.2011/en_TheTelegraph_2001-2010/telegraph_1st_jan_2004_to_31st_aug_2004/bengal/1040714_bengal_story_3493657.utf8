The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Flight from Maoist republic 
 PROBIR PRAMANIKKakarvitta (Nepal), July 13: Santosh Singh risked an encounter with animals in the wild to escape the Maoists wrath.																								Pay up Rs 2 lakh by tomorrow or pay with your life, the guerrillas told him on Friday. 																								The manager of Chilingkote Tea Estate knew better than to take the threat issued by the rebels lightly. In the remote Sinchari jungles of northeastern Nepals Ilam district, the Maoists frame their own law.																								That night, Singh fled with his wife and B.K. Das, the manager of Saptim Tea Estate, who had also been issued an ultimatum. They trekked 12 km through the forest in driving rain to reach Danabari Bazaar. A tote bag with a towel, toothbrushes and a comb was their only luggage. That was all we had time to take, Singh said on reaching Kakarvitta, over 100 km away, on a borrowed motorcycle.																								He narrated his ordeal to the Royal Nepal Army and policemen on the Indian side.																								Hope of help died early. Major Manbir Tamang, the Nepal army commandant of Jhapa district, told The Telegraph: Tyeihan shaheed hunu janu? (Why would we go there? To become martyrs?)																								Rebels rule there, Tamang said. The Maoists have declared the area liberated.																								The superintendent of police in Chandaguri, Prem Bahadur Chand, said: The area is under the jurisdiction of the Ilam district authorities, but the Maoists call the shots.																								Faith in the law shattered, Das headed to his home in Calcutta while Singh began making arrangements to reach his wife at her Patna residence.																								I will travel to Kathmandu and settle my dues with the company. Being out of a job is better than being killed, Singh said. His employer is a Kathmandu-based businessman of Indian origin who owns over seven plantations in Jhapa and Ilam districts.																								About six months ago, when the Maoists set up training camps in the dense Sanichari-Danabari jungles bordering Chilingkote and Saptim, armed rebels barged into our bungalow and demanded that we give them 25 per cent of our salary every month, Singh recalled. That was the beginning of the trouble. We bowed to their wishes because they threatened us with death.																								The demands increased. The rebels began asking for food grain and livestock and plantation vehicles to carry injured cadre to nursing homes in India. The vehicles were also used to ferry arms from India to camps at Danabari. 																								We never put up any resistance for fear, Singh said. Fridays threat was the last straw. We did not have the money and fleeing was the only option.																								We slipped out of the bungalow around 9 pm and trekked 12 km through the jungle to Danabari Bazaar. There, we woke up a grocery supplier and borrowed his motorcycle. It was a treacherous ride through the jungle with three of us on one two-wheeler, made worse by blinding rain and the fear of wild animals and Maoists. From Danabari, we travelled to Sanichari to Birta More, Singh said. 																								The trio reached Kakarvitta around 5 am yesterday.

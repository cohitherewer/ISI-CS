The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Cong slander has Subhas in a huff
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Chakraborty: Seeing red																								Calcutta, Jan. 16: Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty walked out of a function today when a Congress councillor criticised his government.																								The minister was sitting on the dais when the councillor of the South Dum Dum municipality, Mriganka Bhattacharya, began to address a gathering at the inauguration of three traffic signals. 																								When Bhattacharya launched into a tirade against the insensitive Left Front government, Chakraborty lost his cool and left the dais in a huff. 																								He reportedly expressed anger at the district police for allowing such men to participate in the programme.																								State public works department minister Amar Chowdhury, special inspector-general of state police Narayan Ghosh, inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee and district magistrate H.K. Divedi, who were also on the stage, looked visibly embarrassed. 																								The programme had been jointly organised by the Public Works Department (PWD) and North 24-Parganas police for the inauguration of traffic signals at Golaghata, Lake Town and Bangur Avenue.																								Bhattacharya was unfazed by the fracas and continued his speech. 																								He said he had set up the auto-manual signal at Bangur Avenue a year ago, but the PWD pulled it down, saying it was illegal. It is strange that the signal is being inaugurated today on the same spot by the PWD and the North 24-Parganas police administration. Whats the logic behind it?																								The councillor went on to say: The state government has been insensitive in not taking any step for so long at a spot where 16 persons have died in eight accidents in the past one year. 																								Some Trinamul Congress activists, who were present at the function, lent their voice to Bhattacharyas outburst. 																								The signalling systems are part of a project to provide traffic safety to commuters on VIP Road. The roads running parallel to VIP Road have also been opened today for public use. Now people can drive along the stretch from Dakshindari to Bangur Avenue without entering VIP Road. Our district police along with the PWD have provided funds for the project, which will cost about Rs 5 lakh, Basudeb Bag, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police, said.

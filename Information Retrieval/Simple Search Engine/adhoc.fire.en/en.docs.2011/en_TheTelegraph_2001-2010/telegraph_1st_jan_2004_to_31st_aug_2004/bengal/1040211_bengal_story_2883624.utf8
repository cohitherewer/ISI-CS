 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 To home from circus, after 16 yrs
 MEHEDI HEDAYTULLAH																								Islampur, Feb. 10: Had Manmohan Desai been alive, he would have got a storyline. A man and his son, missing for the past 16 years, were reunited at a circus yesterday.																								As constable Dhunkar Singh strolled around the crowded circus tent, pitched here since yesterday, on a routine inspection, little did he imagine he would stumble upon his missing son who had run away from home 16 years ago.																								For 26-year-old Bharilal Singh, who first saw his father walking past the big top, the first reaction was to hide. 																								I told the two other circus fellows accompanying me that the policeman standing outside the tent was my father and I was afraid to face him, said the youth, who performs sword-swallowing stunts.																								As Bharilal disappeared into the tent, the two men walked up to the constable and asked him whether his son was missing. It took me a minute to realise that they might be knowing where my son was. When I told them that my son had run away from home many years ago, they led me to Bharilal. We both did not know what to do for a moment and then I just hugged him, said an elated Dhunkar. 																								Both father and son returned home after the circus. 																								Bharilal was all of 10 years when he walked out of home on a March day in 1988. Since then, the family was clueless about his whereabouts.																								I had never imagined that I would get my son back. What happened today is nothing short of a miracle, only it would have been a more happy occasion had his mother been alive today, Dhunkar said. His wife died five years ago.																								Dhunkar said his son left home after being scolded for wanting new clothes. I had told him we were too poor to afford new clothes. I did not see him after that.

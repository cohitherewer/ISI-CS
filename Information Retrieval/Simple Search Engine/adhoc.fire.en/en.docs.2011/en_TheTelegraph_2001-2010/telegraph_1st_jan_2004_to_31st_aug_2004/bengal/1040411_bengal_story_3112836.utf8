 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Cloud over wife death
																								Baranagar, April 10: Housewife Mithu Kundu, 28, has died under mysterious conditions at her Neogipara residence in Baranagar on the citys northern fringes, says a staff reporter.																								Mithus husband, Abhijit, 35, was arrested after her father Nilratan Kundu lodged a complaint with Baranagar police station.																								The police said Mithu was found unconscious in her bedroom this morning. She was rushed to a local nursing home where she was declared brought dead.																								Initial investigation has revealed that she had had an overdose of sleeping pills, Bhuban Mandal, sub-divisional police officer at Belghoria, said.																								In his complaint, Nilratan said his daughter had been mentally and physically tortured by her in-laws since marriage.																								Abhijit often forced her to come to our house to collect money from us. We used to comply with all the demands, though sometimes the amount demanded was exorbitant. We did this since we were afraid that our daughter would suffer otherwise, he said.

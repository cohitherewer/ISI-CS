 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Power cuts for third day running
																								Calcutta, Aug. 13: The districts experienced long spells without power for the third day following poor generation by the National Thermal Power Corporation at Farakka and the state-run Bandel plant.																								The city and its adjoining areas, too, experienced power cuts as the CESC failed to revive its 250-MW unit at Budge Budge that collapsed on Wednesday afternoon. 																								At Farakka, two 500-MW units are out of order.																								Power department sources said generation was also affected at CESCs Titagarh plant because of wet coal. The combined shortfall in the CESC and the state electricity board-served areas shot up to 415 MW in the evening peak hours.

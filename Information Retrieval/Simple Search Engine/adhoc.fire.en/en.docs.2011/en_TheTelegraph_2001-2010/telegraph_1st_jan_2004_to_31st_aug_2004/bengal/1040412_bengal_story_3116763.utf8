 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Mamata in sound bar row
																								Calcutta, April 11: BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu today accused the CPM of misusing state machinery even as the Hooghly administration said it would start a case against the Trinamul Congress for violating a high court order on loudspeakers.																								Trinamul chief, coal and mines minister Mamata Banerjee arrived around 8 tonight at the Jeerat College ground in Hooghly, about 80 km from Calcutta, and found that police had the loudspeakers disconnected. She ordered supporters to re-connect the boxes and held the meeting. 																								Deputy superintendent of police Arun Roy said Mamata violated the court order. This is a non-residential area and there are no HS examinees around. No order is flouted, said Mamata.																								Addressing the media, Naidu accused the police of being partisan. The CPMs base is eroding. Its government cannot even utilise development funds.

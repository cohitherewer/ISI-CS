- Teacher sheds tears of joy after court unlocks benefits
 OUR LEGAL REPORTERCalcutta, April 27: A schoolteacher was denied retirement benefits for nine years and salary for 13 years before that because he was appointed by the Maharaja of an independent state.																								Today, 74-year-old Parameswar Sharma sobbed like a child when the high court ordered the government to clear all his dues with interest.																								Sharma was appointed teacher at Saheberhat ME Junior School in Cooch Behar in 1948, the year the Maharaja of the erstwhile state founded the institution.																								The education department refused to recognise Sharmas services because Cooch Behar was not part of Independent India till 1950. It became a district of West Bengal five years later.																								The teacher literally ran pillar to post. Between 1995, when he retired, and 2004, he came all the way from Cooch Behar to Calcutta High Court at least 20 times. 																								In his verdict, Justice P.K. Roy asked the government to realise the amount to be paid to Sharma as interest from the salaries of employees responsible for the humiliation.																								Those responsible for the mess will have to pay the amount of the interest so that such things do not recur. The governments exchequer should be spared, the judge said.																								Sharmas lawyer said the order exposes the governments callousness towards thousands of retired schoolteachers who are knocking on the courts doors for justice. 																								Sharma, he added, was almost starving over the years. He had to stop his sons education midway for want of money. He got a fresh lease of life today.																								After it came to power in 1977, the Left Front government decided to bring schools under its control and bear the burden of teachers salaries. In 1982, Saheberhat ME Junior School was declared a government-aided institution. 																								The same year, the education department appointed a headmaster at the institution and asked Sharma to hand over responsibility. Sharma protested against the appointment and the government freezed his salary. But the teacher in him refused to budge. 																								Sharma continued to attend school and take classes till he turned 65. 																								Salary he did not get for years. Pension he was not going to get.																								Sharma moved the Cooch Behar district court but lost the case. He appealed to the high court. Then Justice T.K. Chatterjee asked the government to pay his salary after verifying his service documents.																								In 2003, the district school council refused to pay the retirement benefits saying that Cooch Behar was not in India when the teacher joined the school. 																								Sharma moved a fresh petition in the high court. After hearing the education department and the district school council, Justice Roy allowed Sharmas petition and asked the government to provide Sharma all the benefits due.

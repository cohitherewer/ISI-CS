 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Bihar pistols, Bangla buyers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, Aug. 7: Guns from Bihar are finding a way into Bangladesh via Behrampore. 																								Carriers, mostly unemployed youths, bring arms and ammunition made in Jamalpur and Munger in Bihar to Behrampore and hand them over to takers at the porous international border. 																								Police are sure of the trend after arresting Majrul Sheikh and Rafiqul Sheikh from Raninagar on Friday night with six 9 mm pistols, five other guns of different bores and 30 live 9 mm rounds. This is their third strike at the gun dealers. 																								Majrul and Rafiqul, residents of Dhanirampur and Tiktikipara, respectively, in Murshidabad, had boarded a bus with tickets to Dhanirampur, a hamlet very close to the border. The duo was carrying the arms in large bags when they were held.																								In the face of intense grilling, they said one Shaidul Sheikh had employed them to carry the goods. Sleuths have arrested Shaidul from Charkamari village, about 1 kilometre from zero point. 																								They added that they would have earned Rs 1,800 each if they had delivered the consignment to their contact across the border. Police said these carriers would take a bus from Behrampore to Rampurhat in Birbhum before moving to Jamalpur to procure the firearms. 																								Earlier, it used to be pipeguns from Munger. The arms that are coming now are far more sophisticated. We have informed our counterparts in Bihar on numerous occasions in the past, providing all the information on the racket, but to no avail. Despite repeated pleas, no action has been taken to check the problem at its source point, said Gyanwant Singh, Murshidabad superintendent of police.

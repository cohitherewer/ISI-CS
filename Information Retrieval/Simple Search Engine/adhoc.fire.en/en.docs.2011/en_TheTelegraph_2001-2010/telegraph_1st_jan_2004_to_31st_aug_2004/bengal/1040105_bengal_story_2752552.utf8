 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 BSF to foot bills three decades after war
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Siliguri, Jan. 4: Battle won, a Binaguri-based motor spare parts company, is gearing up for the war ahead.																								More than three decades after the Bangladesh War of 1971, the Union home ministry has directed the 73rd battalion of the BSF, now stationed at Dantiwada, Gujarat, to pay Sanjoy Goyal, the owner of Sanjay Trading Centre, Rs 83,000 for services rendered during the campaign.																								The amount has been sanctioned as ex-post-facto, which means it will not come from the allocations for the BSF in the annual budget.																								The battalion had, during the 1971 war, requisitioned Goyals father Raj Kumar to supply motor spares. The bills, 223 of them totalling Rs 83,600.24, however, remained unpaid. I got a notification from the 73rd battalion on December 26, 2003. The force wrote it was ready to pay me the capital amount of the dues, Goyal said.																								He is happy about the hard-fought victory but Goyal, who now runs the spares shop, is not ready to forfeit the interest. Eighteen per cent compound interest annually for 32 years amounts to Rs 1.5 crore.																								Since the war, the Goyals have been writing to the BSF authorities and the headquarters of the 73rd battalion. Goyal went to Jammu, Delhi, Rajasthan and Gujarat, whenever the battalion moved base, to plead for justice.																								My father had supplied motor spares to the BSF, then posted at Kadamtala, during the 1971 war. We had claimed Rs. 1.5 crore, comprising the capital amount and 18 per cent annual compound interest, Goyal said. 																								I will continue my fight. Calcutta High Court, where I had filed a writ petition in October 2002, has kept options open for me to appeal to the apex court or the ministry of home affairs, said Goyal.

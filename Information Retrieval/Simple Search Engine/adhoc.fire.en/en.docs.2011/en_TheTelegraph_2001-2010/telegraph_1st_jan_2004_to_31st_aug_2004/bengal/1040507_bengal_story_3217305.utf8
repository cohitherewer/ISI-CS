 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Mobile phone parts a mother and son, forever
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, May 6: A sons tiff with his mother over buying a mobile phone climaxed in her attempt to commit suicide and his death.																								Sanjeeb Das, 18, hanged himself yesterday afternoon, thinking that his mother had died by consuming sleeping pills after their fight. 																								The purchase of a phone had been a bone of contention at the Das household in Habra, about 50 km from the city, for the past few days.																								Sanjeeb had been pestering his mother Mili to buy him a mobile phone. She turned down the demand, saying they could not afford one. 																								He did not relent. I will not talk to her if she does not give me what I want. All my friends are carrying mobile phones. What is the problem if I get one, too? Sanjeeb had said.																								Peer pressure had blinded him to the fact that his father Samir, an employee at a local cloth store, could not afford to equip his son with the gadget that would have made him fashionable to friends.																								Yesterday morning, things came to a head. The teenager turned abusive when Mili showed no signs of giving in. 																								Enraged, the mother locked herself in a room and gulped a handful of sleeping pills. She lost consciousness and did not respond to Sanjeebs repeated knocks on the door.																								He broke in to see his mother on the bed, unconscious. Sanjeeb called his father, who was in an adjacent room. 																								Samir rushed to a telephone booth to tell his married daughter what had happened. When he rushed back, Sanjeeb was nowhere to be seen. The father went looking for him at the kitchen last. Sanjeeb was hanging at the end of one of his mothers saris. 																								Both Mili and her son were rushed to Habra State General Hospital, where doctors declared Sanjeeb dead. The mothers condition improved by evening.																								Officer-in-charge of Habra police station Manas Sarkar said: Preliminary investigations revealed that Sanjeeb committed suicide as he presumed that his mother had died because of him. Samir muttered that a mobile phone claimed his sons life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Super hospital invite to southern clinic 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 7: The government has invited the Hyderabad-based Asian Institute of Gastroenterology to set up a hospital exclusively for gastro-intestinal diseases in Bengal.																								Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said the government will provide land to the institute for the hospital, which will be along the lines of its centre of excellence in south India. 																								The centre is renowned for its advanced research, especially in manufacturing stents for gastro-intestinal diseases.																								After inaugurating a two-day workshop in therapeutic endoscopy at Kothari Medical Centre, Mishra asked D. Nageshwar Reddy, the chief gastro-enterologist and director of the Hyderabad hospital, to start operations in Bengal.																								We need a speciality hospital for gastro-intestinal diseases here, especially keeping in mind the soaring cases of GI diseases. We would be keen to help you in every regard, Mishra said.																								The government plans to give Asian Institute of Gastroenterology free land at a suitable location and also provide logistical support. The Hyderabad hospital will in turn set up a state-of-the-art facility here and provide free treatment to every third patient.																								The institute has classified its patients into three groups in Hyderabad. The first group of patients is provided free treatment, the next group is provided costs for drugs and medical equipment while the third, which is under the corporate sector, pays medical fees along with the cost of equipment and medicines.																								The governments proposal is very interesting... we will work on a feasibility report and perhaps come back soon for more detailed talks At the moment, the governments clause of providing free treatment to one-third of the total patients seems acceptable, because it follows our own model of treatment, Reddy said. 																								He added: We will also speak to Kothari Medical Centre to see whether a three-way arrangement can be worked out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 ... And tries to wriggle out of BJP alliance
 ANUPAM DASGUPTA Subash Ghisingh: Shylock?																								Siliguri, May 17: The elections won, the Congress is desperate to create its own political space in the hills. 																								The immediate dilemma for the Congress, which rode piggyback on the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), is whether or not to remain in the Peoples Democratic Front (PDF), an alliance of five parties opposed to the GNLF. 																								The PDF, which includes the BJP and local outfits  the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League, the CPRM and the GNLF(C)  was formed to oust Subash Ghisinghs party from the autonomous Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, which the GNLF has controlled since inception in August 1988. 																								The Congress, though, is having guilt pangs for being part of a pact that includes the BJP. Sources said the party is uncomfortable being part of the PDF. 																								Local leaders pointed out that the party is about to form a government in Delhi with outside support of the CPM and it would be incongruous if they were seen as part of a grouping that is in alliance with the BJP and opposed to the Left. 																								A section of Congress leaders feels it would not be prudent to be part of the PDF, whose main target is Ghisingh. It is true that we are a part of the PDF, which is a conglomerate of anti-GNLF and anti-CPM forces. The equations have changed significantly after the GNLF decided to support us in the general elections. It might not be morally correct to remain with the PDF, said a senior Congress leader of Siliguri who did not wish to be named. 																								The Congress also realises that the passport to Parliament for Dawa Narbula has come for a price. The GNLF has already sounded the Gorkhaland bugle and told Narbula to be Gorkhalands man in Delhi first and an MP later.																								If the Congress gives voice to the Gorkhaland call, it would bring the party in direct confrontation with the CPM, which has alleged that the GNLF is trying to whip up passion by harping on divisive issues. 																								Speaking to reporters in Siliguri recently, Narbula tried to quash fears that he may let Ghisingh have his pound of flesh. Narbula said he would not raise the Gorkhaland issue in Parliament. But party leaders admitted in private that would be easier said than done. 																								Darjeeling Congress president Shankar Malakar said: In view of local political compulsions and Subash Ghisinghs support to us, we need to review our position vis--vis the PDF.																								The party will hold a brainstorming session once Narbula returns from Delhi.

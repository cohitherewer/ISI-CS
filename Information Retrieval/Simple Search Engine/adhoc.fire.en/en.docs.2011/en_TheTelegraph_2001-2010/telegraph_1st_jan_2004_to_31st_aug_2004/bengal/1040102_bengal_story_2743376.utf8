 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Paulsonda, (Murshidabad), Jan. 1: Missionary institutions in the district are feeling insecure in the wake of the attack on Don Bosco Vocational Institution on Christmas Eve. 																								They are also tense because of inadequate police arrangements despite an assurance from district superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh. 																								When this correspondent today went to the missionary institutions in the Nabagram police station area, 220 km from Calcutta, no policeman was in sight on the campus or outside.																								The superintendent had yesterday said elaborate police arrangements have been made in all missionary institutions of Murshidabad.																								On Christmas Eve, a gang of 22 dacoits scaled the wall of the Don Bosco institution at Badarpur in Behrampore and entered the nuns hostel. They allegedly molested a nun, heckled the priest and fled with Rs 66,000.																								The police had asked the institution not to inform the media about the incident. However, it became public on December 29. Singh then told reporters that it was not disclosed earlier for the sake of investigation and to prevent a feeling of insecurity among the minority community.																								But the police arrangement that he said was in place was nowhere to be seen today. No picket was found near the educational institutions, boarding houses and churches here on either side of National Highway 34.																								Singh had said that he had ordered the posting of pickets in front of all Christian missionary institutions to restore the confidence of the community.																								Father John of the church here said: I have not seen a policeman around. We had invited some policemen on Christmas. Since then, no other policeman was seen here.																								Sister Jiva, an inmate of the hostel run by the church, said: After the Badarpur incident, we are obviously feeling insecure.

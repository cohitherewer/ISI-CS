 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Maoist arrest tells on border walkers
 PROBIR PRAMANIK																								Panitanki (India-Nepal border), April 4: Ganesh Man Shrestha, a Nepal national on his way to Siliguri for a medical check-up, wears a look of distress. 																								A resident of Bitra More in eastern Nepal, Shrestha sits outside the Raniganj police border check post waiting his turn to be questioned by Indian immigration officials. 																								Like Shrestha, hundreds of citizens of the Himalayan kingdom crossing over into India daily are now being subjected to thorough questioning by Darjeeling police under whose jurisdiction the India-Nepal border check post falls.																								The increased vigil on the border comes in the wake of Maoist leader Mohan Baidyas arrest from a Siliguri nursing home last week. Intelligence Bureau sleuths had picked up Baidya from the clinic where he was undergoing a cataract operation. 																								The step-up in checks, however, has inconvenienced the large number of people from Nepal who usually walk into India every day with little formality.																								We were asked by the Indian policemen to alight from the Siliguri-bound jeep at Kakarvitta and proceed to this outpost. They want us to prove that we are bonafide Nepal nationals. They enquired about our purpose of visiting this country. Earlier, this was unthinkable, said Shrestha.																								According to the terms of the Indo-Nepal Friendship Treaty (1950), nationals of either country can travel across the borders without any travel documents. Most visitors from Nepal come to India for medical treatment, shopping in towns like Siliguri or to attend the weekly market at Naxalbari.																								Earlier, we were simply waved through the border check post. But since Baidyas arrest, the Indian police are questioning Nepal nationals and often harassing them in the process. They are asking us to produce documents to prove our nationality and state the exact purpose of our visit, Shrestha said.																								And it is not just the Nepal nationals who are facing the heat. Indians of Nepali origin are also being subjected to such stringent checks. The police asked me to prove that I am an Indian, said Roshan Baraily from Darjeeling.

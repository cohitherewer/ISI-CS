 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Ghisingh robs pact of punch 
 OUR BUREAU																								May 3: Subash Ghisinghs decision to throw his weight behind the Congress, an ally in the Peoples Democratic Front, is aimed at smothering Opposition attack against the GNLF and keeping his partys votebank intact. 																								With the real battle  the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council polls  months away, the seasoned leader has turned the heat on the PDF and brought the Opposition juggernaut to an abrupt halt by deciding to favour the Congress in the May 10 elections. 																								The move, analysts feel, would force the PDF to stop accusing the GNLF of having an understanding with the Left Front and betraying the Gorkhaland cause. 																								In the past, the Opposition had harped on the fact that Ghisingh had almost given up the Gorkhaland demand for power. 																								The Gorkhaland agitation ended in 1988 after the GNLF and the state government signed the DGHC accord. Since the deal, the GNLF had only sparingly raised the demand for a separate state. 																								Now, with the GNLF supporting Congress candidate from Darjeeling Dawa Narbula, the Opposition  the GNLF(C), Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists, the Congress, the BJP and the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League  will have to change its campaign strategy.																								Ghisinghs move is a brilliant ploy to curb the rising popularity of the PDF. This was the only way he could stop the Opposition from eating into the GNLF votes before the crucial council elections, said a senior PDF leader.																								Madan Tamang, the PDF chairman, admitted that he was taken aback by the hill leaders decision. Ghisingh has supported the Congress for his own political survival. He definitely would not want the people to know before the DGHC election that his vote bank has eroded, said Tamang, who was instrumental in making the recently united Opposition a strong force. This is an act of desperation. It will not stop us from winning the council elections, he added. 																								Darjeeling Congress (plains) president Shankar Malakar said the GNLF support will pave the way for a smooth Dawa Narbula victory. The CPM, he added, has been stripped of its political crutch in the hills. 																								The CPM had won the Darjeeling seat in 1996, 1998 and 1999, with the GNLF boycotting all the three elections.

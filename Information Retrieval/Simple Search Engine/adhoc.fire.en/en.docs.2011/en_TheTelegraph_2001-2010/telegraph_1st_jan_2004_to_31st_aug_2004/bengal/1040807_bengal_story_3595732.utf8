 MAIN UDDIN CHISTI																								Sitai (Cooch Behar), Aug. 6: Villagers near the Bangladesh border here lynched a duo this morning whom police identified as militants of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation. Two others fled after shooting a villager, an alleged linkman.																								The police said the dead militants were Gautam Singha alias Bibek Barua, a resident of Kharibari in Darjeeling district, and Nemai Dutta alias Bimal Burman, who is from Cooch Behars Sitalkuchi. Jagdish Basunia, a hardcore militant and a resident of Mathabhanga in this district, and Netai Burman of Jalpaiguris Mainaguri escaped.																								The series of events began around 5 am at Dhumerkhata, when the gang was crossing over from Bangladesh. Three villagers spotted them and began asking questions. Witnesses said villagers pursued the four, who were on a rickshaw-van, on foot. After travelling some distance, the quartet got off the vehicle and confronted the villagers. An argument followed and one of the villagers, Nazrul, suddenly caught one of the four by his collar. He was shot through the hip. A bullet just missed Sirajul, another villager.																								The villagers raised an alarm and soon people came out of homes and began chasing the militants. After a 2-km run, two of the militants were cornered. One of them lobbed a grenade, which burst without injuring anyone.																								A large mob thrashed the two. The police rescued the duo but they died in hospital. The other two fled on bicycles snatched from villagers heading to the fields.																								Nazrul, also known as Chocolate Miyan, is now in hospital. The police said he was a KLO linkman and had met the group to provide it a safe transit. Sources also said that he was shot at for demanding a hefty sum for his services.

				 Rape bid on hospital premises

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Calcutta, Jan. 23: A married girl of 18 waiting outside the Baruipur State General Hospital in South 24-Parganas was dragged inside and molested on the campus on Tuesday. 
																								Additional superintendent of police Dilip Banerjee said Pinta Ali Mondal, a resident of nearby Bedepara, about 25 km from the city, has been arrested and charged with being one of the culprits. His accomplice is absconding.
																								Asit Ghosh, a carpenter living at Baruipurs Paddapukur, had come to collect money from a shop adjacent to the hospital with his wife. As he went ahead to get the dues, the wife waited in front of the hospital.
																								Two youths gagged and pulled her into a toilet behind the female ward of the hospital. They fled the scene when the woman finally managed to scream for help. The police traced Pinta following the description provided by the woman.
																								Hospital authorities, however, denied knowledge of any such incident on the premises. We are investigating that, said an official. South 24-Parganas chief medical officer of health Pradip Kumar Mandal said: I have heard about the incident. However, details like the exact spot where the molestation took place are not clear.

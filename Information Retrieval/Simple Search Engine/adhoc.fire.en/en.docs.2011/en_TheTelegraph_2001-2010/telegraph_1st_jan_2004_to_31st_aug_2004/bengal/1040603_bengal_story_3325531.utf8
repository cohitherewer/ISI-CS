 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Hope for Tibet visit minus visa
 VIVEK CHHETRI																								Darjeeling, June 2: If the Sikkim government has its way, tourists would be able to visit China-controlled Tibet without a visa. 																								Waking up to the trade and tourism potential waiting to be tapped once Nathu-la is reopened, the Pawan Chamling government is mulling introduction of transit passes that will allow visitors to visit the Roof of the World.																								The state has already made provisions for traders to save them the trouble of going through the formalities of procuring a visa to enter China. 																								All that an Indian businessman needs to do is obtain a trade pass from the commerce and industries department of Sikkim, said Mahendra P. Lama, the chief economic adviser of Sikkim.																								Those having the pass can go to Lhasa, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, for trading purposes. We are seriously thinking of introducing a (similar) transit pass for tourists once Nathu-la is reopened, he added. 																								Sikkim is expected to reap rich dividends from the tourism sector if the Chinese government accepts the transit-pass proposal. Gangtok is around 527 km from Lhasa and droves of tourists are expected to use the route to visit the mystic land. 																								The hill state is also looking forward to attracting visitors who use the Kathmandu-Lhasa route, a backbreaking 1,300-km journey. 																								We have not spoken to the Chinese authorities on the issue of the (tourist) transit pass because we will need to work out a complete agreement. But dialogue is expected to begin soon, Lama said. 																								The process can be initiated only when the Sikkim government gets the nod from the external affairs ministry. 																								Hopeful that the suggestion will not be shot down, the Sikkim government has begun giving serious thought to the impact the tourism boom will have on the environment. 																								We are studying the effect large-scale tourism will have on the state, which is well-known for its pristine environment. We will come up with ways to ensure that the tourist traffic does not take a toll on the greens, Lama said.																								He has visited Lipu Lekh in Uttaranchal and Shipki-la in Himachal Pradesh, which were opened for trade with China in 1992. 																								Sikkim is also studying closely the items that the state can trade with China. 																								In the pre-1962 period, India used Nathu-la to export beef, pork and incense sticks and import wool. The trade route, once reopened, will also benefit countries like Bangladesh, which currently uses the maritime trade route, Lama said.

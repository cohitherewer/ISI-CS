The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 08, 2004 				 Left ups the ante in fight against monitors
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, May 7: Two days before the state elects its representatives in the Lok Sabha, the Left leadership stepped up pressure on the Election Commission to rein in its observers.																								CPM politburo member Prakash Karat, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan and CPM Rajya Sabha member Chittabrata Majumdar met chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy this evening and complained about the role of some of the special observers in the state.																								The delegation named five observers who allegedly overstepped jurisdiction and tried to influence voters. 																								The Left had earlier complained to the commission about excesses committed by the observers. In Calcutta, Left Front chairman Biman Bose had even questioned the commissions neutrality.																								The poll panel has already sought an explanation from Ratnamala Rawla, the Asansol observer who allegedly went around asking voters if they were bribed by the CPM.																								A.Y.R. Krishna Rao, the Diamond Harbour observer who had allegedly been asking Muslim voters why they favoured the CPM, has apparently been asked to submit a report.																								The Left petition also names K.C. Varma, who apparently asked voters in Bishnupur if they were terrorised.																								In Serampore, Rakesh Garg went into a police station and asked for records of local crime. He pressured the officer on duty to issue an arrest warrant, a CPM leader said. In Basirhat, A.K. Tandon allegedly threatened a flag march in certain villages.																								Special observers are expected to inform the district administration about any breach or violation of election norms and procedure. They can recommend or request the administration to take steps but cannot direct the police officers to order arrests, the Left petition says. Two-wheeler bar																								In Calcutta, state chief secretary Asok Gupta said tonight five or more two-wheelers would not be able to move together from 5 pm tomorrow till polling is over on Monday.

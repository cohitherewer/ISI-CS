The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Job wait on after 18 years amp; 1,144 letters
 SUNANDO SARKAR 																								Calcutta, Feb. 18: Mohammad Rafique wrote the first letter to the state government in 1986 after his wife died while on duty at the Bidhannagar state general hospital. He asked it to provide a job to his son, Mohammad Sajju, on compassionate grounds. 																								Its now four years into another century and Rafique has written 1,143 more letters in the last 18 years. Still the government job the 70-year-old wanted for his son is out of reach. 																								Rafiques only victory  if it can be called that  has been his success in convincing the government about the merit of his case. The health department has agreed that Sajju should get a job but by the time it made up its mind another government order  freezing recruitment at the lower levels of the health department  had come into force, blocking the familys search for a job. 																								Sajjus mother, Shakila Bibi, was a Group D staff with the health department. Hers was the only secure job the family  staying in Metiabruz  had and it fell on hard times after her death. 																								Rafique, at 52, considered himself too old for a new job. So he applied, in accordance with government rules, for a job for his younger son. The file started moving only in 1993, seven years after Shakilas death. 																								It was moving slowly  as Rafique kept up his efforts to get the governments attention  when the first speed-breaker came. It came from within the family  Sajjus elder brother Mohammad Jamshed wrote to the government, saying he should get the job. 																								Rafique stepped in, writing a few more letters. Jamshed was living separately with his family and had a job of his own, his father said. A job for him would not help the majority of the family that his wife had left behind. 																								It took some time  and letters  for the health department to be convinced. It consulted its legal section and agreed that it was Sajju who should get the job. 																								As Sajju waited for the appointment letter, he received a missive that asked him to prove his age. His father wrote back, saying Sajju did not have a birth certificate. But the government could verify Sajjus age, he added. 																								It was a few more years  and letters  after which the government had Sajjus age tested (by ossification) and was satisfied with its results. After being prodded by the West Bengal Human Rights Commission and the National Commission for Minorities, the department finally agreed to give Sajju a job.																								But by then its rules had changed. With the state governments finances in a poor shape, it froze recruitment of Group D staff. 																								The department will act as soon as all the parameters  for Sajju getting a job  are satisfied, said director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee. We cannot go against the rules, he added, signalling that Sajjus wait will continue.

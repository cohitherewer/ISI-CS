The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Ministers beg votes, babus munch muri
 SWATI SENGUPTA 				 	 Writers: Ceasework?																								Calcutta, May 5: With ministers and power brokers of the ruling coalition busy in rush-hour campaigning, Writers Buildings has shuddered to a halt. 																								The corridors of power wear a deserted look in the absence of heavyweights. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and jails minister Biswanath Chowdhury are in north Bengal, industries minister Nirupam Sen is in Asansol and the list could go on... 																								Kamal Guha, Abdur Rezzak Mollah, Bansogopal Chowdhury, Anisur Rahman, Anju Kar, Sushanta Ghosh, Chhaya Ghosh, Dinesh Dakua, Amalendralal Roy, Narayan Biswas, Hafiz Alam Sairani, Jogesh Barman, Naren Dey, Kanti Ganguly, Nandagopal Bhattacharya, Nayan Sarkar, Prabodh Sinha, Sailen Sarkar, Srikumar Mukherjee																								Those who are in the city are busy canvassing for Left Front candidates in and around Calcutta.																								There wouldnt be much work done before the results are out, a Writers babu said. His colleagues nodded, munching their staple mix of shasha-muri-chanachur, sitting cross-legged in a ministers air-conditioned office and reading newspapers. 																								Several ministers are away for 20 to 30 days, their office staff members said. 																								Law minister Nishith Adhikary, labour minister Mohammed Amin and fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee were the only ones at the seat of governance late into the afternoon. 																								Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, transport minister Subhas Chakroborty, fisheries minister Kiranmay Nanda and public works department minister Amar Chowdhury left in a hurry by mid-afternoon. 																								Needless to say, youth affairs minister Mohammed Salim, the CPM candidate from Calcutta Northeast, did not attend office. 																								Not just ministers, a chunk of bureaucrats, too, was missing. Most of them have been deployed as election observers. 																								Writers, it was apparent, could return to work only after the counting of votes was over.Mobile bar																								Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee today said mobile phones would be banned within 100 metres of polling booths, even if they are switched off. 																								Any mobile phone found in the zone would be seized and returned to the owner after the elections are over. Only police and poll personnel on duty would be allowed to carry phones in the restricted area.

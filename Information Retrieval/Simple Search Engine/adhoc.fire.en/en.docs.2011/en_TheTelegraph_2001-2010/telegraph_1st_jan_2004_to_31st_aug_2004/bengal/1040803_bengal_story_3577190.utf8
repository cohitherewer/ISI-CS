 VIVEK CHHETRI				 	 Ghisingh in Darjeeling: Doctor Badmash																								Darjeeling, Aug. 2: Subash Ghisingh today warned disciples against playing Judas.																								The Gorkha leader, who maintains an iron grip on hill politics, said he was aware that he was surrounded by people ready to crucify me and cautioned them with the promise of a fitting reply.																								In a rare public appearance in Darjeelings Captiol Hall, Ghisingh said: Jesus Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples. I have many such disciples in the hills who are ready to do the same. However, they should also be careful. 																								Ghisingh was ambushed near Kurseong on February 10, 2001. The attack was allegedly masterminded by Chattre Subba, a disciple of Ghisingh who fell out with his mentor. Todays statement made it clear that Ghisingh is aware of more enemies within. 																								Badmashi ko line ma ta mo pani doctorate ho (I am also a doctorate in badmashi), Ghisingh said, sending the audience in ruptures. 																								He can dance like Shiva during tandav  which could destroy the world  the hill chieftain added.																								For Ghisingh, fighting is an art, not infighting. That is why people should be involved in religious activities.																								People just like to hit or kill someone from the back. This is kal yug, the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council chairman said. 																								During the current tenure of the council, three senior Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) leaders, including the president of its Darjeeling and Kalimpong branch committee, have been killed.																								Ghisingh, who was given a discourse on the right way to perform the Bol Bom ritual, a Hindu practice in which holy water is offered to Shiva during the month of Shravan, said people these days do not know how to worship God. He extolled the masses to worship in the right context.																								Though Ghisingh spoke on religion and the ritual, his warning to disciples indicated the lack of trust in his own party leaders.																								The chair (as chairman of the DGHC) I am occupying is such. Right now, everyone wants to occupy the chair, even if he is a gardener. If everyone wants to occupy the chair where will we go? said the Gorkha leader who once led a violent movement for a separate Gorkhaland state.																								Today, he said: It is true that people need some money for themselves, but if one indulges in luxury too much, it will be suicidal.

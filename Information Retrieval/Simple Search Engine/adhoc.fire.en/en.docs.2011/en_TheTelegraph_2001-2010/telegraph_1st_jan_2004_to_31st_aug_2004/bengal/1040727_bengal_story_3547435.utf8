 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Stampede in army entrance scramble
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, July 26: About a dozen youths among 40,000 who queued up here since last night for jobs in the Indian Army were injured in a stampede early this morning.																								The army had set up a two-day camp at the sports stadium to recruit personnel in 60 posts.																								A mad rush began when the main entrance to the stadium, about 200 km from Calcutta, was opened around 3.30 am to let in a car. Thousands who were jostling in the queue thought it was opened to let them in for the medical test. 																								As the youths bounded towards the gate, many fell and were trampled. The injured were admitted to Behrampore Sadar Hospital, where the condition of three is said to be critical. 																								Superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh said the crowd was unmanageable as even those who did not qualify in terms of age and height had assembled for forms. 																								The result could have been worse but for police intervention and a lathicharge, said an officer camping at the stadium.																								Two touts, who were collecting money from the youths promising them a smooth ride to the armed force, were arrested.																								From his hospital bed, Rahim Sheikh said: When the gate opened, those behind rushed assuming that they would be examined first. I fell down. I do not know how many trampled me. 																								However, Colonel Upender Singh, who was overseeing the recruitment drive, said there was no disturbance inside the stadium. We are not bothered about what happened outside. It is up to the district administration to manage the law and order situation.																								Last year, two youths were killed and several injured in a stampede during an army recruitment drive near Fort William in Calcutta.																								Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Jalangi in Murshidabad, had apparently prompted todays recruitment drive.																								District magistrate . Manjunatha said: More than 40,000 youths had turned up for 60 posts. We have made adequate arrangements to prevent recurrence of such an incident tomorrow.

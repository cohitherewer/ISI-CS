The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Top varsity duo under microscope
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SOUMI BHATTACHARYA				 	 Dutta and Bagdi being taken to court on Monday. Telegraph picture																								Santiniketan, April 12: A day after two Visva-Bharati employees were arrested in connection with the broken lock at the Uddyan Vibhag gate, two administrative officials of the university were put under surveillance.																								The high profile officials, whose names also feature on the CBIs list of suspects in the burglary of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal and other memorabilia, were mentioned by arrested gardener Gopal Bagdi and peon Sunil Dutta as the brains behind the Vibhag break-in. 																								CID officials said the duo has been identified by police and is under constant watch.																								They were apparently not arrested because the police want to verify Bagdis statements. The officials named are quite well known and we want to be sure that what Bagdi is saying is true, a senior official said.																								Based on Bagdis interrogation, the police conducted raids in several districts. The cutting implements seized by the CID from Duttas house have been sent for examination to ascertain if they were the ones used in the Rabindra Bhavan heist.																								Dutta has reportedly confessed that Bagdi promised him a hefty sum and drugs for breaking the lock. In his turn, Bagdi blurted out the names of the two administrative officials and claimed that they were the ones who employed him to rope in Dutta. 																								The motive, according to the CID, was to divert attention from the Nobel heist and get even with the vice-chancellor Sujit Basu-led administration. The varsity authorities have stepped up security on the campus and are set to table a report before the executive council on an alleged scam over university affiliations to spurious institutes. The scam involves key officials who were allegedly part of a racket that saw 42 fake institutes get the affiliation in the 1990s.																								Breaking the lock of a place where no valuables are kept and under the nose of the cops seems to be aimed at signalling that the culprits can play around with the existing security and project the authorities in poor light, a senior police officer said.																								Dutta and Bagdi have been remanded in custody. On Friday, Dutta, who was supposed to lock the Uddyan Vibhag gate, broke it with a hacksaw and took the lock home. Next morning, he raised alarm saying the door is ajar.

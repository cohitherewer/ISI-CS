 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 Bribe slur on Burdwan officials
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, April 3: The Burdwan district administration today transferred five employees of the treasury department for allegedly demanding bribes from state government contractors. 																								In complaints lodged with district magistrate Subrata Gupta, the contractors said the five refused to approve their payment by March 31 last year allegedly because they had not paid them commission. The contractors have threatened to stop working for the government unless their dues are cleared by the district administration.																								Gupta said it is the duty of the treasury department to send the contractors bills to the district treasury  from where the dues are paid  by March 31. We have received a spate of written complaints from the contractors, and on the basis of those we have decided to transfer the five accused. If it is proved that they are guilty, we will take punitive measures against them, Gupta added.																								According to officials, the Burdwan district treasury department is infamous for such irregularities.																								If contractors refuse to pay bribes, the officials of the department block their payments, they said.

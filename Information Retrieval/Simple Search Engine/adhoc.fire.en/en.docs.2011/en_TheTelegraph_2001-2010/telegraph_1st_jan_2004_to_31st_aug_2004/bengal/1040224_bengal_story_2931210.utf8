 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 Polio boycott backfires on leader
 OUR CORRESPONDENTSuti (Murshidabad), Feb 23: A Congress leader who instigated villagers to boycott the pulse polio programme yesterday has become the butt of ridicule among his own party workers.																								Congress workers joined hands with their CPM counterparts to denounce Ramadhar Mishra, the assistant sabhadhipati of the Congress-led zilla parishad, for his irresponsible act. The partys Murshidabad district leadership today showcaused Mishra.																								Mishra acted in a most irresponsible manner by rallying behind the villagers who had boycotted yesterdays government-sponsored programme. As a peoples representative, he should have encouraged villagers to participate in the programme, said Adhir Chowdhury, the district Congress chief and Behrampore MP.																								Mishra, said Chowdhury, was moved by the plight of five villages, in the Suti and Raghunathganj police station limits, whose residents had been protesting against the governments delay in repairing the eroded embankments along the Bhagirathi.																								People of the affected villages may have genuine grievances about the governments apathy. But he (Mishra) should not instigate them to boycott the pulse polio programme as a mark of protest, Chowdhury said.																								An unfazed Mishra said he acted correctly. Whats the use of taking their children for the polio immunisation programme if their homes are exposed to danger due to steady erosion? he asked.

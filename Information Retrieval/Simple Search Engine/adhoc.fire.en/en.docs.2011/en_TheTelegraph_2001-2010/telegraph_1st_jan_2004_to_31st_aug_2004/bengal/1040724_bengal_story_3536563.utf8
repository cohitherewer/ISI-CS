The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Flood fightback trips on words
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, July 23: As if fighting floods was not enough, the district is now struggling to control the undercurrents of tension between the administration and the irrigation department.																								Waters turned murky today after irrigation department officials decided to wash their hands of flood control in protest against the loose statements made against the department by additional district magistrate Abdul Karim.																								Karim had been quoted as saying that it would make more sense if the money spent by the irrigation department to make embankments  which are in any case washed away  is used to relocate people.																								Offended irrigation department officials said they had written to the chief engineer and the irrigation minister informing them of their decision to stay away from duty.																								The boycott call comes at a time when the spectre of floods looms over the district.																								I do not want to be drawn into a controversy, but the statements were in bad taste. The anger and hurt of the personnel is not unfounded. They work hard trying to tackle the floods and erosion and all they get in return is ridicule, said Pundarikakshya Roy, the executive engineer of the irrigation department.																								Roy said preventing erosion is a tall order but it is possible to control floods. The situation would not have been as serious if political parties and villagers had let us do our job. We were prevented from building the ninth embankment that would have controlled floods to a great extent, he said.																								Zilla parishad sabhadhipati Gautam Chakraborty said: A 1,500-m embankment had prevented flooding in vast areas last year. I do not know what suddenly irked the irrigation department but I will find out.																								If they carry out their threat, vast areas will be doomed, Chakraborty said.

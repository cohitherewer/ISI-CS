The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 Anil hints at obliging Laloo
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 29: CPM state secretary Anil Biswas today hinted that the party might give the Calcutta Northwest Lok Sabha constituency to Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal.																								Politburo member Sitaram Yechury had seat-sharing talks with Laloo Prasad recently. Sources said once the RJD agrees to leave two seats to the CPM in Bihar, the party will not field a candidate in Calcutta Northwest.																								Laloo Prasad, who will be here tomorrow for a debate organised by CPM mouthpiece Ganashakti, is likely to raise the issue with the CPM brass. 																								Biswas said an RJD candidate had contested from Calcutta Northwest in 1999. This time, too, we can give it to any party. Our partners in the Left Front will not object if we give the seat to RJD, said Biswas.																								On the poll schedule, Biswas said: We had urged the commission to hold the elections in Bengal any time after April 26, when the Higher Secondary examinations will be over. We are happy that they accepted our plea.																								Biswas said the party has made changes in its campaign mode keeping the board exams in mind. We will hold indoor meetings and go by the guidelines regarding use of loudspeakers. We must keep in mind the plight of lakhs of examinees during campaign meetings.

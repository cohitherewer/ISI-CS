The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Two years, and no hospital bed
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 24: Two years of waiting has still not got a poor patient a free bed at a government-run hospital in the city.																								On April 6, 2002, Naseema Begum was advised immediate admission at the NRS Medical College and Hospital for bone TB treatment. But the 25-year-old has as not yet been admitted.																								What she has got are 70 stamps by doctors on her out-patient department cards  she got a second one when the first was exhausted  and assurances that she would get a bed as soon as one is available. This despite 70 per cent of the beds at NRS being free.																								I have no means to pay for a bed and thats why I requested the doctors for a free bed. But no one would listen to me. They have told me that either I pay or forget getting treatment at NRS Hospital, said Naseema, barely able to speak.																								Naseemas plight comes to light in the backdrop of the state government having set up hi-tech control rooms in all hospitals to ensure that all patients are admitted. If a bed is not available at one hospital, the patient has to be accommodated in another. However, these rules have not been followed  at least in Naseemas case.																								In March 2002, Naseema, accompanied by her father Masiruddin of Chatu Babu Lane met Dr D.C. Saha at NRS with complaints of chronic back pain. In April, Saha asked Naseema to get admission immediately for bone TB treatment.																								Masiruddin approached the emergency department for a free bed for his daughter, but was curtly told that none was available and he would not get even a paid bed immediately. I told them that I dont have the means to pay for a bed and requested the authorities to allot me a free one as, in any case, I will have to pay a lot for medicines, he recounted. But this did not move the hospital administration.																								Naseema then started going to the hospital every week hoping to get a free bed, but in vain. She has now approached Medical Bank, a voluntary organisation, for help.																								We were shocked and have written to the NRS Hospital authorities for help. Hopefully, they will finally offer her a bed, said D. Asish, its secretary.																								D.K. Jha, the deputy superintendent of NRS, said the hospital would have made some arrangement had they known about her case. We will definitely try to solve her problem, he said.

 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Jailbreak jolt sparks revamp
 PRONAB MONDAL																								Calcutta, Feb. 2: The jail and social welfare department has decided to throw three central prisons into a high-tech security ring.																								Sophisticated security devices are being installed at Dum Dum, Alipore and Presidency jails. The decision to go hi-tech follows the jailbreak in Dum Dum on September 25 last year.																								Five hardcore criminals, including Sheikh Binod and Myanmarese national Baitha Kima, who was arrested during the citys biggest drug haul from the ground floor of former CBI officer Upen Biswas Salt Lake house, had scaled the wall with the help of a ladder and fled.																								Immediately after the incident, we placed several proposals before the government to improve jail security, said Joydeb Chakroborty, the inspector-general, prisons.																								The jail and social welfare department accepted some of Chakrobortys proposals and agreed to sanction funds. 																								According to officials at Writers Buildings, powerful and sophisticated lenses will be used in hidden cameras that are already in place. The number of cameras in strategic locations will be increased, an official said. 																								This time, the cameras will be focused on the boundary wall of the jails and will cover as much area as possible. Besides, those entering and leaving the jail through the main gate will be screened through close-circuit televisions, he added																								The jail and social welfare department is also set to introduce round-the-clock video recording in the three prisons. The security revamp, officials said, will be extended to all the jails in the state with time.																								Jail authorities have requested the government to increase the number of guards. Each central jail has 350 to 400 employees and 70 to 90 of them work in each shift. Keeping an eye on 1,200 prisoners is next to impossible, said a Dum Dum official.

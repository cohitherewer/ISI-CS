 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Priya files papers, mob files in
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Raiganj, April 22: It seemed more like a victory procession than a nomination rally. 																								Outgoing Lok Sabha MP Priya Ranjan Das Munshis journey to file his papers for the Raiganj seat was a roadshow of frenzied supporters who danced, sang and shouted slogans as they followed their leaders vehicle that had a huge tricoloured hand (the Congress symbol) planted in front of the bonnet. 																								Das Munshi, standing in the open jeep, waved to the crowd, a tilak and tricoloured shawl in place. Wife Deepa was wearing a matching tricoloured sari.																								The supporters had started gathering at the towns Kasba More since 11 am. 																								Dot at 12 noon, Das Munshi, who was the Congress chief whip in the 13th Lok Sabha, set off for the districts administrative hub at Karnajora. 																								Trailing his jeep was a long row of two-wheelers. Waiting at district magistrate Manish Jains office were over 300 women supporters. We are sure Priyada will win, said a jubilant Haji Sajjad, a former MLA. 																								I have come on my own. Priyada asked us to stay and work for the polls but I could not resist being here at such an important moment, Sajjad said. 																								Das Munshi kept glancing at his watch before stepping into the district magistrates office. I will submit my papers between 2.35 pm and 3 pm. That will prove lucky, he said. The time for filing the nomination had been set after looking into the Hindu almanac. 																								He began filling up the form seconds after 2.15.																								Analysts have predicted a close fight in the constituency, which has seen the CPM rule most part of the 1990s. Das Munshi, who was fielded from the constituency in 1998 and lost the round to the CPMs Subrata Mukherjee, trumped the latter in the 1999 elections.

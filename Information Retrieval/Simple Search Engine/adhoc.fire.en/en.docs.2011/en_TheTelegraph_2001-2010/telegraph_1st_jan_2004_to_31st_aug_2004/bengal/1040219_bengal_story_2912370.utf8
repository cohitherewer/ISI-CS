 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Toddler strangled 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Durgapur, Feb. 18: The body of a three-year-old boy, missing since yesterday evening, was recovered from a playground near the Eastern Coalfields Limited colony here, about 200 km from Calcutta. 																								Preliminary investigation revealed that the boy was strangulated to death. There were strangulation marks on the boys throat and his hands and legs were tied up. We are yet to find the motive behind the gruesome murder, said superintendent of police K.C. Meena. Two persons have been detained for interrogation. 																								Little Prince Yadav went to the playground near his house around 4.30 pm yesterday with his father Shyam Sundar, an ECL employee. Shyam Sundar was playing cards after leaving his son at the playground. Late in the evening, when he came to take the boy home, he could not locate him. Around 10 in the night, they lodged a missing diary at the Laudaha police station, Meena said. The police could not trace the boy during an overnight search. 																								A worried Shyam Sundar came to the playground again at 10 in the morning and noticed a pair of sandals beside a heap of sand. I immediately called in the police who later recovered the body by removing the sand, he said. 																								A sniffer dog was pressed into service to locate the miscreants. We picked up a person from a nearby tailoring shop which the dog first entered. Then we detained the son of the Gogla gram panchayat member. We are interrogating the duo, said a policeman.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Barrackpore, March 1: Sixty-two-year-old Bibhuti Nath had to sit on a coupler between two coaches of the Lalgola Fast Passenger at Belghoria to travel back to Dum Dum after failing to reach his office here.																								Amit Roy, 20, a commerce student of Gurudas College, had to pack himself into a goods train to attend his annual examination.																								Thousands faced a similar fate following a blockade at Belghoria station that paralysed train services for nearly three hours in the Dum Dum Junction-Naihati section of Eastern Railways Sealdah division today.																								CPM councillors of Kamarhati, Hemanta Bose and Kajal Das  with supporters from a local club  blocked the track from 10:15 am to 1:20 pm demanding improvement of drainage facilities along the tracks.																								Many passengers, including school students and office-goers, were stranded at several stations till the blockade was withdrawn. But the passengers ordeal continued till late evening.																								Police allegedly did not force the demonstrators away. We were outnumbered by the demonstrators, claimed Gouranga Mitra, deputy superintendent of government railway police (Ranaghat).																								However, railway officials said normal train services resumed at 1.20 pm. Seven pairs of EMU trains had to be cancelled and 17 other local trains were detained for more than two hours on an average.

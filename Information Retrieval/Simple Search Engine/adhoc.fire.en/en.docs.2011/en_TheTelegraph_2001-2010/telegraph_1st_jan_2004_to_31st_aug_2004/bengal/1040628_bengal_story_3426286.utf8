 OUR BUREAUCalcutta, June 27: One person was killed when CPM and Trinamul Congress supporters clashed at Maheshtala on the citys southern fringes this morning as violence rocked polls to 18 municipalities. 																								Turnout was high at 75 per cent, said state election commissioner Ajoy Sinha. 																								Repolls have been ordered in six booths  four in Madhyamgram and one each in Asansol and Naxalbari. The election results will however be on schedule Tuesday.																								Inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said 50 people were arrested across the state and four firearms, 13 rounds of cartridges and two four-wheelers seized.																								In Asansol, a Congress candidate allegedly took away some ballot papers and the Trinamul symbol had appeared in ballots against the name of the Congress candidate by mistake, Sinha said.																								Trouble erupted at a booth in Gazipara Primary School in South 24-Parganas Maheshtala when CPM and Trinamul supporters blamed each other for booth jamming and intimidating voters. 																								A scuffle turned violent when someone hurled a bomb. Firearms were whipped out by activists of both parties and a battle ensued. When police arrived, they were attacked. The force fired 12 rounds to disperse the warring groups. 																								Raju Seikh, 28, was hit by a bullet but it was not clear if he died in the police firing. We are conducting an inquiry, said Deben Biswas, inspector-general of police (south Bengal).																								CPM MP from Diamond Harbour Shamik Lahiri said Raju had worked for the party during the elections.																								There were stray skirmishes in Dum Dum and South Dum Dum municipalities. Trinamul supporters led by MLA Arunabha Ghosh blocked Jessore Road to protest alleged rigging.																								Congress leaders, too, said the polls were not fair.

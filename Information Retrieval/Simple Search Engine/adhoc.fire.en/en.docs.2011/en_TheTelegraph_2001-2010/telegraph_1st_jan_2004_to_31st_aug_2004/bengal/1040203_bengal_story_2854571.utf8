 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Scissors on civic aid to Trinamul
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Calcutta, Feb. 2: The government has slashed grants to seven Trinamul Congress-run municipalities in Hooghly that had not paid for filtered water.																								Officials said the civic bodies of Serampore, Rishra, Konnagar, Uttarpara-Kotrung, Baidyabati, Bhadreswar and Champdani had not paid the government charges due to it for filtered water supplied by the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority. 																								None of the seven municipalities had imposed water tax as directed by the government.																								Writers gives the amusement tax it collects as grants to municipalities across the state. The total deduction for the seven civic bodies was said to be around Rs 1.03 crore.																								Political circles are seeing the governments decision to prune the grants as a retaliation against the municipalities defiance of the directive on water tax. The levy was imposed on all households in civic areas in January 2003.																								Since June, the seven municipalities had deposited Rs 50,000 every month as water charge. But they were informed about the deduction  more than Rs 10 lakh from each of them  in a recent circular. 																								The Chandernagore Municipal Corporation, Bansberia and Chinsurah-Hooghly municipalities, which are all run by the CPM, have been spared the slash in grants. 																								Secretary of the municipal affairs department Dipankar Mukhopadhyay said it had been decided at a meeting in early 2003 that the municipalities would have to pay for 50 per cent of their monthly supply of filtered water and an additional 5 per cent of an amount the municipalities owed to the water supply authority. 																								At a later meeting with municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and the authoritys chief engineer, R.. Chatterjee, it was decided that the civic bodies, irrespective of whether they had imposed water tax, would have to pay Rs 50,000 every month for the filtered water.																								However, recently, the water supply authority said in case of some municipalities, including the seven in Hooghly, the monthly payment does not cover the condition agreed upon at the earlier meeting  50 per cent for the supply and an additional 5 per cent to square up previous dues.																								Describing the governments move as politically motivated, Pinaki Dhamali, the chairman of Uttarpara-Kotrung municipality, said: My civic body is financially sound. If we are in a position to pay the price of filtered water without taxing people, why is the government bothered? 																								The chiefs of several other affected municipalities echoed Dhamali. The government has no business interfering in the day-to-day functioning of the municipalities. After it was decided that a payment of Rs 50,000 per month would suffice, the decision of a previous meeting does not hold good, said Kesto Mukherjee, the chairman of Serampore municipality.

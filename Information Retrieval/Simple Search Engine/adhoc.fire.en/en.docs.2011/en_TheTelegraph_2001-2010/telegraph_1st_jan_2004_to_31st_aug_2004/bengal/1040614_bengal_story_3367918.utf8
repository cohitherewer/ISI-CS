The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Left MPs line up wish list welcome 
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Laloo Prasad: Bump ahead 																								Calcutta, June 13: Leaders of Calcutta and its suburbs are preparing to welcome railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, scheduled to pay his first visit as minister on June 16, with a wish list of over half-a-dozen of projects. 																								Soon after the formation of the Left-backed United Progressive Alliance government, CPM MPs who wrested three seats in the city from the Trinamul Congress began to dust files containing their demands. The party wants to improve the rapid transit system in the city and suburbs with central aid. 																								The wish list includes:  The entire stretch over the Metro Railway from Belgachhia to Tollygunge to be laid with concrete. Estimated project cost: Rs 120 crore  Construction of a terminal at Chitpore at a cost of Rs 200 crore. The government wants the project to be funded by the railways Extension of the circular railway to Kidderpore and electrification of the entire stretch  Construction of a terminus at Shalimar. The project was formally flagged off in 1999 but there has been no progress in work  Extension of Metro Railway from Dum Dum to Barrackpore. Railway ministry had given a green signal in 2002 and allotted funds for carrying out technical feasibility report. The project has been tied up in files  Initiative to get financial assistance from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation for implementing the Rs 2,000-crore East-West Metro project. The Centre has allotted funds for preparing the final feasibility report after the Japan Economic Trade Organisation said the project is viable  Funds for building four railway overbridges and three underpasses at Birati, Barrackpore, Barasat, Nagerbazar, Patipukur and Ultadanga  Development of roads connecting the Metro and circular railway stations. 																								A day before Laloo Prasads arrival, a team from the railway ministry will assess the pending projects and schemes on the demand list. 																								Instructed by CPM leaders, MPs Sudhangshu Sil (Calcutta Northwest), Mohammad Selim (Calcutta Northeast) and Sujan Chakraborty (Jadavpur) have started lobbying at Rail Bhavan in Delhi to open the files sent from Calcutta but virtually untouched for five years. 																								A delegation led by CPM leader Basudeb Acharia met the railway minister in Delhi on Thursday and prepared the ground. 																								It is not any kind of Bengal package, we have placed demands necessary for the city and suburbs. Besides, there is no question of creating pressure on the railway minister or to take any advantage of him being the supporter of the central government. We have tried to convince the railway minister of the necessity of the projects, said Sil. 																								He said Laloo Prasad had promised to consider their demands. We expect he will not make any empty promises like his predecessors Mamata Banerjee and Nitish Kumar, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Prices rocket, strike rolls on
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 25: Prices of most commodities spiralled in city markets as the indefinite truckers strike entered its fifth day today.																								The All India Motor Transport Congress has called the strike to press for reduction in service tax, the motor vehicles levy and toll tax and for increasing security to curb highway robberies.																								Stall owners at some of the major city markets said lack of supply of fruits and vegetables had forced them to hike prices.																								Everything which comes to Bengal from outside, especially perishable commodities, have become dearer, said Shah Alam Laskar, a vegetable seller at Gariahat market. 																								Prices of everyday items like onions, ginger and green chillies have shot up by Rs 2-5 a kg. Eggs are being sold at around Rs 4 more a dozen compared to five days ago. But potato prices have remained steady as Bengal is one of the biggest producers of the tuber. Laskar said prices of capsicum and tomatoes have also risen, by Rs 8 to Rs 20 a kg.																								The cost of rohu and katla brought in from Andhra Pradesh has soared by Rs 10-15 a kg since Saturday. Hilsa is more expensive by Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kg.																								Traders said stocks of various goods are depleting. Due to lack of trucks, vegetables and fish are also arriving late in markets, said Gobindo Kundu, a vegetable seller at Lake market.																								Inspector-general of police (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said at Writers Buildings the government is keeping a strict vigil against hoarding and profiteering. However, we do not fear any immediate scarcity of essentials as we have stock for the next eight to 10 days.																								But fruit and vegetable vendors at New Market said some traders had stowed away items in cold storage and are releasing them gradually at higher prices. The government should take immediate steps to check hoarding of goods as customers are suffering, said Nemai Nandy, a fruit seller at the market.																								The hardship for customers seems set to continue as K.K. Bansal, the Calcutta spokesperson for the transport congress, said: We will carry on the strike until our demands are met

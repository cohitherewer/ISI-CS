 VIVEK CHHETRI																								Darjeeling, March 20: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees one-to-one meeting with Subash Ghising fuelled suspicion of a tacit understanding between the CPM and the Gorkha National Liberation Front.																								The half-hour meeting at Richmond Hill was a closely-guarded secret. Scribes were not allowed in and leaders from either party were also not present during the meet.																								Ghising, who also took Bhattacharjee to the recently renovated Shurberry Park where the two leaders watched cultural troupes perform, said no issues were discussed with the chief minister.																								It was only a courtesy visit and we sat by a fire. Then I invited him to high tea in the park. I only told him to upgrade the Bagdogra airport into an international one, he said.																								Bhattacharjee said he had visited the park to boost Ghisings initiative.																								Ghising said the GNLF would announce its election plan after the nomination process starts. Parliamentary elections are routine for us. I have not thought of it now and will take a decision only in April, he said.																								The maverick leader, who had boycotted three successive parliamentary elections and indirectly helped the CPM sail through, did not rule out the possibility of yet another boycott call. We might contest the elections and anything can happen. Let me first take a decision, said Ghising.																								If the GNLF does not contest, the CPM is likely to win the elections outright because of a split in anti-CPM votes.																								The GNLF leader said he was not bothered about the heightened activities of the Opposition in the hills. The GNLF is getting stronger, he said.																								Though the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League had won two seats in the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council elections, the two had switched over to the GNLF. At the end, this is important, Ghising said.																								The chief minister today backtracked from his promise to solve the water crisis in the hills within six months, saying today that I had never made such promises.																								The bonhomie among the two leaders bloomed with Ghising reluctant to antagonise Bhattacharjee prior to the hill councils election. The GNLF-led council had earlier refused to take charge of the school service commission, but Ghising today said they were willing to do if the school panel was handed over.																								The council chairman also refused to blame the state government for the severe water crisis in the hills.																								The council cannot go ahead with the Balason project as it costs around Rs 40 crore. However, we are working on the Rungdung project from which water will be pumped to Darjeeling. We have also started rainwater harvesting in Mirik, Kurseong and Kalimpong and will also start in Darjeeling. There is no major crisis in Darjeeling and it is because of the tourists inflow, said Ghising.

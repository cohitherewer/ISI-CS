 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Power lines to homes cut
																								Howrah, March 4: The management of Bally Jute Mill, which is shut since Monday, snapped power lines to the quarters of 3,600 labourers on the premises last night.																								The management had cited low production for declaring the suspension of work. None of its representatives turned up at a meeting called by the labour commissioner. Howrah district magistrate S. Kishore said: I am talking with officials to solve the impasse as early as possible.																								The workers are now without water as the the power snap rendered the pumps inoperative.

				 																																	Calcutta, June 14: The high court today granted bail to Kajal Garai, a mentally challenged 20-year-old arrested for killing his mother. 				 																																	Father Kashinath pleaded before the division bench with folded hands that his son was mentally unstable and hit his mother with an axe without realising the consequences. Please allow me to take custody of my son. I assure you that I will take care of him, the resident of Galsi in Burdwan, about 140 km from the city, told the court. The court allowed the prayer and asked Kashinath to get his son treated. We want a progress report from time to time, it said.				 																																	Around 12 noon on February 2, Kajal asked his mother to serve him lunch. His mother was then busy with other chores. Angry over the delay, he hit her with the axe kept in the kitchen. The 48-year old woman died immediately. The boy later told the police that he thought she did not love him.				 																																	Krishnagar: A day after the Ranaghat subdivisional court accepted a womans FIR accusing sessions judge Shyamal Sengupta of rape, he attended office. 				 																																	The fast track court judge, who is hearing the Dhantola rape, loot and murder trial, entered his chamber amid tight security. On Friday, a 23-year-old woman separated from her husband alleged that the judge had raped her in her house, where she lived with her widowed mother and year-old-child.				 																																	Behrampore: An RSP fact-finding mission in Murshidabad has blamed the CPM for the Left Fronts Lok Sabha drubbing here. Left candidates were trounced in all three Murshidabad seats because of an understanding between the Congress and the CPM, an RSP leader said.

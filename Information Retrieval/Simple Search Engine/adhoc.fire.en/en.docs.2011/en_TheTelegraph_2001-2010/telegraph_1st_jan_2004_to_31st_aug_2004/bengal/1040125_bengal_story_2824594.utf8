 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kalna (Burdwan), Jan.24: The death of a housewife under mysterious circumstances at Kalna Block II sparked a rampage by residents this morning. 																								The locals of Kadampur, were up in arms against police personnel who came to investigate the death of 32-year-old Namita Mondal. The housewife was allegedly strangulated to death at her in-laws house. They later tried to pass the death off as a suicide, police said.																								Agitated locals gheraoed policemen for over five hours for their delay to appear at the scene of crime. They also damaged a police vehicle and tried to stop the police from taking away Namitas body for a post mortem. 																								An FIR has been lodged with the Pandua police by Namitas brother Sudeb Das. He alleged that the in-laws took Namita to the terrace of their three-storied building, strangulated her and then allegedly set her body ablaze to pass the incident off as a suicide. The complainant also told the police that some residents, who had witnessed to the incident, came to his house at Chotto Sarsha village in Pandua to inform him.																								When the police reached the spot, Namitas in-laws, her husband Biswanath and his elder brother Sankar had escaped. 																								We have launched a massive hunt for them. As soon as we round up the two culprits (Biswanath and Sankar), the motive behind the murder will be unveiled, said a senior official.

 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Faceoff across Bangla border 
																								Balurghat, Aug. 1: Villagers along the border at Samjia in the Kumarganj area of South Dinajpur have begun fleeing homes following a standoff between the BSF and Bangladesh Rifles.																								BSF sources said the BDR, which had been inching into Indian territory over the past few nights, had been challenged. Their advance has been temporarily halted.																								But the Bangladesh force has apparently raised the number of troops in its camps heightening the tension. The deputy inspector-general of the BSFs Malda range, .K. Biswas, said tension has been brewing over a 4-km stretch on the border.

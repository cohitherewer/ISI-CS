The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Congress booms bandh threat 
 OUR BUREAU 				 	 A supporter protests at the state Congress headquarters against BJP leader Sushma Swarajs threat to tonsure her head if Sonia Gandhi took over as Prime Minister. Picture by Amit Datta 																								Calcutta, May 19: The Trinamul Congress is down to one seat and its tally has doubled, reason enough for the Congress to find its voice in the state. 																								The resurgent party, further buoyed by its return to power in Delhi, today trained its gun on the ruling communists  ironically the partys partner in Delhi  and threatened to call a bandh next month against the state-sponsored post-poll violence in the districts. 																								If the chief minister fails to contain the violence within a fortnight, we will go for a Bengal bandh to put pressure on the government, former state Congress chief Somen Mitra said at Writers Buildings minutes after calling on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								Though we are against bandhs, a strike is inevitable as CPM activists have unleashed terror on innocent party workers across the state soon after the polls in connivance with police. We have to raise our voice against such terror tactics, he said.																								Mitra and state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya will leave for Delhi tomorrow to meet newly elected Congress Parliamentary Party leader Manmohan Singh, who will be the next Prime Minister. 																								Asked if such a move would strain the partys relations with the CPM at the national level, Mitra shot back: Why should it be so? The CPM is our main enemy in Bengal and we shall oppose its anti-people policies tooth and nail. 																								Reacting to Mitra, the chief minister said: We are attaching no importance to the state Congress bandh threat. 																								Pradip Bhattacharya said CPM activists have been terrorising Congress workers in West Midnapore, Murshidabad and Nadia districts since May 13 when the poll results came out. 																								The CPM did not even spare Nadia district president Shankar Singh whose house was ransacked. A written complaint with the district administration and police have fallen on deaf ears, he complained. 																								He said the CPMs attacks are perhaps the worst in Murshidabad, where communists lost in all three seats to Congress candidates. Unable to bear the humiliation, the communists have let loose terror in the entire district by constantly harassing our workers. It is unfortunate that police in Murshidabad have become stooges of the CPM, he added.																								Over 300 party workers have been unable to return to their homes in different villages across the state in the wake of the post-poll violence. A fear psychosis grips them as the CPM threatens them with dire consequences if they return to their villages, Pradip Bhattacharya maintained.

 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Murmu stirs in Amlashol wake
 OUR BUREAU 																								Durgapur/Bankura, June 23: Shaken by reports of five starvation deaths in Amlashol village of West Midnapore district, Paschimanchal Unnayan Parishad minister Maheswar Murmu is touring the districts to oversee development projects in tribal-dominated areas. 																								After meetings with district officials of West Midnapore and Purulia, Murmu today held talks with the Burdwan administration to expedite implementation of several development programmes. District magistrate Subrata Gupta and Burdwan zilla parishad sabhadhipati Uday Sarkar were among those present. 																								After the meeting, Murmu admitted: There is slow development and poverty still exists in some villages along the Bengal-Jharkhand border of West Midnapore district. He had earlier contradicted the chief minister, who accepted that condition of starvation prevailed in pockets of the state. 																								Murmu, however, accused that the local panchayat in Amlashol, run by the Jharkhand Party, does not work properly. We provide the requisite amount to the panchayat but it has not been utilised. We are trying to upgrade rationing system across the state and have also urged the central government to co-operate with us, he added.																								He announced that the parishad has identified 10 tribal-dominated and underdeveloped blocks in Burdwan. Later, district magistrate Gupta said the parishad has provided Rs 1 crore for development of the blocks. 																								The Bankura administration and the district planning committee has decided to submit a proposal to the Planning Commission for implementation of the centrally-sponsored Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana for uplift of the weaker sections, particularly the tribals.

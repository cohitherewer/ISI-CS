 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Sangma and Pawar split
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sangma after the split. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Jan. 24: The Nationalist Congress Party suffered a three-way split today as P.A. Sangma got himself named party president in Sharad Pawars place, paving the way for a poll tie-up with the National Democratic Alliance.																								Chhattisgarh leader V.C. Shukla also parted company with Pawar. Shukla has decided not to stay in the NCP, which he joined three months ago, but form a regional outfit that will align with the NDA.																								We claim to be the real NCP and will urge the Election Commission to take cognisance of the facts and the new reality, Sangma said after a meeting of his supporters at his official residence here. He will approach the poll panel on January 27. The meeting authorised Sangma to work out an electoral understanding with the NDA and also form the partys executive.																								Pawars supporters termed his replacement as party chief illegal and expelled Sangma and five others for anti-party activities, adds PTI. But the Pawar camp took no action against Shukla, as he had not attended the convention at Sangmas residence.																								Other than Sangma, those who face the axe are working committee members Salamutallah, Gurusharan Singh Dadawoo, B.B. Dutta, Bolin Kuli and Veena Nayyar, president of the NCPs mahila wing, party general secretary Tariq Anwar said.																								Earlier, Sangma and Shukla held an hour-long meeting at party spokesman Praful Patels residence. The two leaders  who stuck to their stand of not aligning with the Congress headed by Sonia Gandhi  held a separate 45-minute meeting at Sangmas residence. They then jointly announced their separation from Pawar.																								We two will work together under the NDA umbrella, though we will have separate identities, Sangma said in Shuklas presence.																								Sonias foreign origin, Sangma said, was the battery of the NCP. Without it, the NCPs clock (the party symbol) will not run, he said. 																								But Patel dismissed Sangmas claim of being the new NCP president. Hundred per cent Sharad Pawar is the NCP president, he said.

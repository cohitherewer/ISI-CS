 Sunday, March 21, 2004 Lahore stage for do-or-die 
- Industry top guns in stands
 INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Sachin Tendulkar talks to Inzamam-ul Haqs son as the Pakistan captain looks on at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. (AFP) 																								Lahore, March 20: When Sourav Gangulys men step on to the Gaddafi green for the make-or-break match tomorrow, they will not be short on support.																								The Ambanis, J.J. Irani, Jinnahs grandson Nusli Wadia, Gayatri Devi of the Jaipur royal family and Bollywood stars will lead the thousands of screaming Indian fans in the stands  and the nail-biting millions back home  in cheering the team.																								Music will also be blaring. Daler Mehndi, the king of bhangra pop who is performing in Karachi today to raise funds for Imran Khans Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital, is expected to lend his lung power in Lahore.																								It is now up to Souravs XI to make the day for India. Having surrendered the lead in Peshawar yesterday, they have to ensure the goodwill series stays alive in Lahore.																								Team India hasnt failed on this count in recent times and Sourav was drawing comfort from the past. It has been a trend that we play our best cricket when our backs are to the wall. I can only hope that we do it again.																								Rival captain Inzamam-ul Haq couldnt help but rub it in: They will have to live with it that its a do-or-die situation. The slightest of errors can prove very costly.																								Well try our best. We cant take India lightly and have to maintain our form, he added.																								A full-strength Indian team lost the high-scoring warm-up match at the Gaddafi against Pakistan A by six wickets on March 11. 																								In its last short tour, in 1997-98, Ijaz Ahmed had blown away India with a whirlwind 139 off just 84 balls.																								Sourav blamed the lack of aggro among pacers and the spinners ineffectiveness for the last loss but felt losing the toss made the biggest difference. Still, we managed to claw back with a few early wickets. Abdul Razzaq then took it away from us. 																								Indias performance here has raised comparisons with the showing in Australia. Inzamam agreed with Sourav that they had lost close games, saying its not that India are not playing to potential. Both teams have played intense cricket and the difference has been made only in the last five-six overs during which the scales have tilted in one teams favour. 																								If the toss proved decisive, the Indian bowling failed to reap the benefits from the pitch. The absence of Ajit Agarkar and the two spinners, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, has proved costly. Zaheer Khan, too, has struggled with his rhythm. 																								The bowling has been hampered by injuries. Kumble and Harbhajan have been an integral part of our success. Im, though, not trying to cite this as an excuse, Sourav said.																								Though Javed Miandad today flayed doubts being raised over Shoaib Akhtars action, saying it will lead to bad blood flowing between the two teams, Inzamam didnt agree. The series is being played in a very friendly atmosphere. Theres hardly any aggression shown when you compare it with the series Down Under.Come tomorrow, the circumstances might just be different.

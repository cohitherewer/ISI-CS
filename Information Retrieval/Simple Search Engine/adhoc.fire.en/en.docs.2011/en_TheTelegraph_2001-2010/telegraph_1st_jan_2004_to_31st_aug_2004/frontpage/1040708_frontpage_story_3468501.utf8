 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Lapang at Delhi door
																								New Delhi, July 7: Meghalaya chief minister D.D. Lapang today requested the Centre to solve the longstanding boundary dispute between his state and Assam, reports our correspondent.																								A violent flare-up along the Assam-Nagaland border saw the eviction of Naga villagers from the area. 																								The chief minister met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at his residence and explained to him the background of the inter-state border dispute. 																								Sources said the urgency to put an end to the dispute may have been prompted by fears of recurrence of last years violence between the Karbis and the Khasi-Pnar communities in Assams Karbi Anglong district.

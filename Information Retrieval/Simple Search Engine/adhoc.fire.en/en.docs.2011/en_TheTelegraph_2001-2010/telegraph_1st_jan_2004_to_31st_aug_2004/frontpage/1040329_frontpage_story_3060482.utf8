 DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Calcutta, March 28: What was an open-door sign in Calcutta read no-entry, please in Bangalore. 																								Authorities at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta did not object to the Murli Manohar Joshi ministrys eleventh-hour replacement list before Fridays board meeting to discuss the governments fee-cut move. 																								IIM Bangalore did, citing clauses in the memorandum of association (MOA) between the institutes and the government. The Bangalore board met yesterday. 																								The human resource development ministry sent names of five new representatives to the board late Thursday evening. The move was against sub-section IV of rule 6 of the MOA. Both the chairman and the director were aware of the malpractice, but the new nominees took part in the meeting, said an IIM Calcutta source. 																								The inconclusive meeting gave chairman Y.C. Deveshwar the responsibility to frame a resolution on the fee reduction. The Bangalore board did the same, authorising its chairman, S.M. Dutta, but it did not permit replacements.Prakash Apte, the director of IIM Bangalore, said: We were informed about the replacements, but we made it clear we wont allow them. Though one of them, P.N. Rajdan, turned up, he wasnt allowed to vote or take part in the discussions. 																								Under the MOA, a replacement on the board is allowed only in the case of the three representatives from the Centre and two from the state government. But none of the replacements was in these categories. Going by the rule book, they were nothing but rank outsiders and thats why the meeting is illegal and its outcome can be contested in a court of law, said the IIMC source.The disputed names include businessmen P.D. Chitlangia and R.S. Goenka (who finally did not turn up), P.N. Rajdan, director, All India Council for Technical Education, Hulas Singh, director, HRD ministry, and S.K. Dubey, director, IIT Kharagpur. 																								Shekhar Choudhury, the director, IIMC, said: I cant say anything on this. You will have to get in touch with our chairman. Deveshwar was not available for comment.

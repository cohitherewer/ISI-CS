Declaration stuns Sachin

	 The only other player to return to the pavilion unbeaten in the 190s because the captain declared the innings is Frank Worrell, the legendary West Indian. At Bridgetown against England in 1959-60, Worrell was 197 not out when Gerry Alexander declared on 563 for 8. The match was drawn.
	 West Indian Everton Weekes and Australian Rodney Marsh are the only two players to be stranded in the 90s because of a declaration.
	FOOTNOTE: Rahul Dravid was 91 n.o. at Sydney when Sourav Ganguly declared last January. Dravid, however, had been struck on the earlobe and needed two stitches.																								Multan, March 29: Even 22 years after Imran Khans declaration in the Hyderabad (Sindh) Test against India, Javed Miandad remains unhappy he wasnt asked to speed up towards a triple. He stayed unbeaten on 280. Pakistan won by an innings.																								One hopes Sachin Tendulkar wont be cut up for too long over stand-in captain Rahul Dravids declaration, which left him six short of what could have been his fourth double century.																								Dravid declared on 675 for five in the final session on Day-II of the first Test. At stumps, Pakistan was 42 for no loss.																								No individual is bigger than the sport and the teams interest must be foremost. Yet, an awful communication gap occurred at the Multan Cricket Stadium, which threatens to spoil the excellent Team India dressing room spirit.																								Yes, its disappointing to miss the double. Getting so close and.... The declaration took me by surprise as I was under the impression another two-three overs would be played. We were averaging fine, said Sachin, now one short of Sunil Gavaskars record of 34 centuries.																								Of course, he did add: What is done is past.... What has happened has indeed happened.... We have to get on with the game.... 																								His uncharacteristically pointed comments have stunned the touring party. A very senior member initially didnt believe Sachin actually spoke in the manner he did.																								Is that what he said? he asked, distinctly troubled. 																								Later, he indicated a damage control exercise would be necessary. It wont surprise if coach John Wright moves to ensure hard feelings dont remain.																								While Sachin insisted he wasnt sure of the declaration, sources pointed out that messages were sent through Murali Kartik. What happened is a mystery, but just about everyone feels Sachin ought to have been given an over more.																								Or else, Dravid  he wasnt available for a reaction  should have declared earlier. As it became touchy, the handling ought to have been sensitive.																								That Sachin didnt take the field for the Pakistan innings encouraged a million whispers, but the maestro clarified he stayed in the dressing room as he had tweaked his left ankle.No matter how upset Sachin is, we believe that.

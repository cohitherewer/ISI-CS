 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Holi hooligans crush protester to death
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA AND SUNANDO SARKAR				 	 Shankar Pal with his wifeCalcutta, March 7: Shankar Pal of Dum Dum died on Saturday as Bapi Sen did over a year ago.																								Pals head was smashed beyond recognition because he ticked off drunk Holi hooligans who were watching and teasing women bathing in a neighbourhood pond.																								After the fracas, 37-year-old Pal, who has a 10-year-old son, was lured out of his residence by the revellers  all staying in the same locality  with the promise that they would make up with a drinking session.																								He was taken to a nearby factory shed and, heavily outnumbered (like Sen), beaten up with blunt weapons for around two hours. Pals limp body was dropped off near his residence in front of several witnesses.																								But the similarities  between the 2003-eve incident in Bowbazar and the Holi fracas in Dum Dum  end in both being acts of courage against perverts and their idea of fun during festivals. For, if Pal  driver of a key CPM functionary of South Dum Dum Municipality  was alive, he would have found police trying to pass off the murder as an accident.																								Dum Dum police denied that the daylight incident was murder. Pal was hit by a motorcycle and that resulted in his death, officer-in-charge Sudip Ray said. No one came forward to tell us what happened, forcing us to frame a case of a mishap, he added.																								The key to the case is Tapan Das, one of Pals friends, who has gone missing. Das, too, was picked up along with Pal but escaped with a thrashing. He came back but went to a doctor on Saturday afternoon itself, his brother Subhas said.																								It was around 11 am on Holi when Pal was standing outside his Kaltala residence near Baguiati. Some of his neighbours  all women  were bathing in the locality pond when they were spotted by the drunk revellers.																								According to witnesses (and an internal report prepared by the CPM), Pals resistance drove them away. The youths  all known faces in the locality  left, but returned in a few minutes. According to witnesses, they came and called Pal  and Das  out for a drink, telling them that bygones should be just that.																								But a couple of hours later, Pals near-lifeless body was dumped on the road, less than 100 metres from his residence.																								Some of his neighbours clammed up on Sunday and the family, whose home had a direct view of the spot where Pal was dropped, left soon after the Saturday incident. But a few said Pal was beaten up at an unused factory-shed in the locality. We knew what was happening but felt it prudent not to get involved, one said.																								After the assailants went away, Pals neighbours informed his wife Kamala and son Jaydeep and shifted Pal to a nursing home.																								Pal was bleeding severely with deep gashes in his ears and some of his teeth were broken, Aditya Nursing Home administrator Sanjay Datta said. Some blunt weapon must have been used on him. 																								The key CPM civic functionary, whose car Pal used to drive, said he would try to ensure that there was no miscarriage of justice.If a daylight murder in front of so many people is passed off as a mishap, it will be a severe betrayal of Pals courage and sense of duty to society, chairman-in-council (conservancy and health) Atin Ray said.

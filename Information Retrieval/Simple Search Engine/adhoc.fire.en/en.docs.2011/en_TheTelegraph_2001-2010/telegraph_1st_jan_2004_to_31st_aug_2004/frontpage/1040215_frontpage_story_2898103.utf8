 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 Boy sacrificed at brick kiln
																								Patna, Feb. 14: A five-year-old boy was kidnapped and sacrificed at a brick kiln at Dhuranbigaha village in Bihars Aurangabad district. 																								Vikas Kumar, the son of a labourer, was allegedly thrown into a fire after his eyes were pierced, tongue and ears cut off and throat slit. 																								Two kiln workers, one of them a tantrik, had gone around the village saying they were looking for a healthy male goat to sacrifice to keep the kiln fire burning.																								Vikas was found to be missing on February 5 and was probably killed on the evening of February 9. His body was recovered from under a haystack by villagers two days later.

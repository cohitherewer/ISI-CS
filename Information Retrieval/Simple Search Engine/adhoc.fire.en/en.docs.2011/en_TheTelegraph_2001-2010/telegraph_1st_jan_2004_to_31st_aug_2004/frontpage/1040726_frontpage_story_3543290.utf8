 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 25: Fear of police prised three boys away from Saroj Singh as the teenager drowned in a pool in the heart of Calcutta. Fear for his parents lives forced Sarojs younger brother Amit to sleep over the drowning without uttering a word.																								A tragic tale of a Saturday evening swim gone horribly wrong emerged around the College Square tank, from where the body of 17-year-old Saroj was fished out this morning. A missing complaint lodged by his father Ramadhar Singh, a railway employee, helped the police identify the Class IX student.																								The police said Saroj and three classmates sneaked into the tank for a swim yesterday. Bathing at the tank is not allowed and that is the reason why they chose a secluded spot and entered the water, a police officer said.																								Seeing Saroj struggle to stay afloat, the three boys fled without raising an alarm, fearing that the police would catch them. Only this morning, the incident came to light, said Suman Pal, a local shopkeeper.																								One of the three boys met Amit later. When he told me, I went to the spot with a friend but could not find Saroj. We saw his clothes and picked them up and hid the parcel in the railway yard near my house, Amit, 15, said.																								Amit said he thought his parents would not be able to withstand the shock and did not inform them. The police, however, could not find the clothes and said investigations would continue till foul play is ruled out.

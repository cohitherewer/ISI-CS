 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Cracked: mystery of Mona Lisa 
 															- Research homes in on merchants wife as da Vinci model BRUCE JOHNSTON 				 	 Mona Lisa 																								Rome, Aug. 1: Leonardo da Vincis Mona Lisa, the worlds most enduring symbol of feminine mystique, is actually a portrait of the virtuous wife of a family friend, who had five children, including two daughters who became nuns. 																								After four centuries in which historians have debated the identity of the artists subject  with theories ranging from his mother to a Florentine prostitute  new research has supported the claim first made in 1550: that she was Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy silk merchant. 																								Giuseppe Pallanti, a teacher from Florence who has spent 25 years researching the citys archives, has discovered the first clear evidence that da Vincis family was closely connected to the silk trader, Ser Francesco del Giocondo, who married Lisa in 1495. 																								Pallanti has also established that Giorgio Vasari, the Italian biographer of Renaissance artists who, in 1550, named the silk merchants wife as the subject of the portrait, was a credible source, having known the Giocondo family personally. 																								For centuries, the Mona Lisa portrait has also been known by the alternative name, La Gioconda, in acknowledgement of the Vasari claim. However, the enigmatic nature of the work and the inscrutable smile of its subject have spawned many alternative theories  encouraged by the fact that, unlike most other portraits of the time, the panel is unsigned, undated and bears nothing to indicate the sitters name. 																								Among those who have been suggested as possible subjects are Isabella dEste, Isabella Gualanda and Cecilia Gallerani, Italian society figures of their time and various courtesans and prostitutes. 																								The artists mother has also been identified as the sitter. Yet another theory  based on the discovery that da Vincis own facial features can be closely aligned with those of the Mona Lisa  has the painting as a playful self-portrait of the artist, now widely believed to have been homosexual, in female form. 																								Now, after delving deeply into Florences state archives, Pallanti has discovered that Leonardos father  a local notary, Ser Piero da Vinci  knew Ser Francesco del Giocondo for many years. 																								Ser Piero, it transpires, drew up a number of deeds for Ser Francesco and his brother, including one in 1497 to settle a dispute with friars in Florence over the terms of a loan. 																								All the indications are that Leonardos father and Mona Lisas husband knew each other before she was painted, and socialised together, said Pallanti. The two lived almost round the corner from each other. 																								The portrait of Mona Lisa, done when Lisa Gherardini was aged about 24, was probably commissioned by Leonardos father himself for his friends, as he is known to have done on at least one other occasion.																								This would have been Ser Pieros way of giving a helping hand to his son, who was hopelessly vague when it came to money matters.																								Pallanti also found the registration of the wedding on March 5, 1495, between Lisa, then 16, and Ser Francesco, who was 14 years her senior. His first wife, Camilla Rucellai, had died the previous year.																								The teacher found Ser Francescos will, which came into force on his death in 1538. In it, he described Lisa as his beloved and ingenuous wife  meaning loyal, honest and noble of spirit.																								Pallanti also uncovered records of the births of four of the couples five children: Piero, born in 1496, Camilla  apparently named out of respect for Ser Francescos first wife  in 1499, Andrea in 1502, and Giocondo in 1507. 																								Camilla and her younger sister later took religious vows and spent the remainder of their lives in convents. 																								Pallanti said he had found no record of Lisas death, which could have occurred any time between 1540  when the local registry of deaths was in chaos, with many blank pages  and 1570, after which diligent recording was resumed.																								But he did find a deed which Lisa made in 1539  the year after her husband died  in which she transferred ownership of a farm in Chianti, which had been her dowry, to her youngest daughter, the nun Sister Ludovica. Pallanti said this transfer had probably been done in exchange for the nun agreeing to look after her mother, who would then have been 60. 																								Pallanti has been praised by other scholars for helping to solve the Mona Lisa mystery. He presented his findings in a short book just published.																								Riccardo Nencini, the president of the council of Tuscanys regional government, which hosted the books presentation, said: It may not prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that Lisa Gherardini and the Mona Lisa were one and the same. But with the evidence it offers, it comes pretty close.																								The Daily Telegraph

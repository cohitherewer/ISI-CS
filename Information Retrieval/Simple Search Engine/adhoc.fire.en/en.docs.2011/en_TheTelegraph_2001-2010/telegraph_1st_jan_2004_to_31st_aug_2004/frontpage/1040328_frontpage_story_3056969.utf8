 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 27: The moment India won the war at Lahore, two children and their parents lost the battle of life.																								After Wednesdays match at the Gaddafi Stadium, Ketan Anuwadiya administered potassium cyanide to his 33-year-old wife, Kina, and two sons  Rushi, 10, and Devansh, 5  before taking the poison himself.																								For the 40-year-old, the decider of the India-Pakistan one-day series was a matter of life and death. Deep in debt as a result of a trade deal, the seemingly well-to-do merchant had lost about Rs 30 lakh that he bet during the series in a last-ditch attempt to get out of the financial mess.																								The police found the four bodies in their plush Kandivli home, in the suburbs of Mumbai, yesterday. Inside the locked bedroom, the businessman, who dealt in iron and steel, had left a suicide note. 																								I was cheated of Rs 1.35 crore by Vithalbhai Patel (a Rajkot-based businessman), hence I am ending my life, the eight-page note, copies of which Anuwadiya had also sent to some of his friends, said.																								The note said Anuwadiya had in February last year sent raw material worth Rs 1.35 crore to Patel, who never paid him. When he reminded Patel of the money and threatened suicide if the cash was not paid, the Rajkot-based businessman asked him to go ahead and do what you want. 																								Police sources said the one-day series was the last straw for Anuwadiya, who was heavily into cricket betting. He must have bet wrongly, said a source.

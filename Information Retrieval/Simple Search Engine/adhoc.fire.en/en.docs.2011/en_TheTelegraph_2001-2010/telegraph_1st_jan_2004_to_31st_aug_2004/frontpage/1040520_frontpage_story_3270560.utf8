 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Congmen carry out Sushma threat
 															- Minister leads tonsure campaign against bjp A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Ripun Bora, Assam panchayat and rural development minister, and Kishore Bhattacharjee, spokesperson for the Assam PCC, tonsure their heads demanding that party president Sonia Gandhi change her decision, at Rajiv Bhawan in Guwahati on Wednesday. Picture by Biju Boro Guwahati, May 19: Assam minister Ripun Bora and two PCC secretaries today tonsured their heads in protest against the BJPs persistent campaign against Congress president Sonia Gandhi. 																								Anti-BJP slogans rent the air as Bora, who is minister of state for panchayat and rural development in the Tarun Gogoi government, and PCC secretaries J.K. Pandey and Kishore Bhattacharjee publicly got their heads shaved.																								The three Congress leaders described their move as a riposte to Sushma Swarajs announcement that she would tonsure her head if Sonia became Prime Minister.																								Bora said BJP leaders such as Swaraj and Uma Bharti had undermined the peoples mandate and impeded the countrys development by harping on the Congress chiefs foreign origin. 																								The despondency in the state Congress headquarters over Madam declining to keep her date with destiny was, however, balanced by political unanimity over Manmohan Singh taking over the prime ministership.																								Setting aside their political differences, the BJP and the AGP joined the Congress in rejoicing over the Rajya Sabha MP from Assam being chosen for the countrys top executive post.																								Chief minister Tarun Gogoi said over phone from New Delhi that Singh knows the state very well and I dont have to brief him about our requirements. He said the state unit of the Congress was ready to sacrifice one MP to enable the former finance minister to be elected to the Lok Sabha.																								We are very happy that for the first time, an MP from the state will become the Prime Minister of the country, BJP Legislature Party leader Bimalangsu Roy said. 																								He hoped a local MP becoming Prime Minister would get the state more attention and financial assistance from Delhi. He has been sent to the Rajya Sabha thrice from the state. So, he will definitely have a soft corner for the people of Assam, the BJP leader said. 																								The Congress main rival in Assam, the AGP, expressed similar sentiments. AGP general secretary Hitendra Nath Goswami said the state would expect Singh to keep its interests in mind at all times. He said the soft-spoken Congress leaders clean image could add a new dimension to Indian polity.																								A motley crowd gathered outside the two-room rented house of the Prime Minister-in-waiting at Sarumotoria earlier in the day, prompting the police to intensify security arrangements in the locality. The house is located within the sprawling residential campus of minister Hemoprova Saikia, wife of the late Hiteswar Saikia. 																								It is a proud moment for Assam and like everyone in the state, I am very happy that he is going to occupy this position. He has always had a special place for Assam in his heart, she said, delighted that her tenant was on the verge of becoming Prime Minister.																								Sonia yesterday drew back from the chair before the last step, becoming the first democratically elected leader to decline the prime ministership. She appealed to her supporters to allow her to make her own decision, saying she was listening to the call of her inner voice.

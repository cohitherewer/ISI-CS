 OUR BUREAU 																								Santiniketan/Calcutta, June 27: For nearly a year, Calcutta police sat on a confidential report sent by Calcutta University stating that Mukti Deb, the arrested lecturer of Visva-Bharati University, had failed in her BSc exams and was never awarded a degree. 																								Former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Dilip Kumar Sinha, too, was held for his alleged involvement in appointing Deb on the basis of fake certificates and marksheets. 																								Visva-Bharati registrar Sunil Kumar Sarkar tonight said CU had informed them about Deb this April. While sending us a detailed report about the arrested lecturers credentials, CU also wrote to us saying that in July 2003 they had lodged a complaint with the commissioner of police after they found that Deb had never cleared her exams, Sarkar said. 																								Soumen Mitra, the then deputy commissioner of police (detective department), could not recall the complaint. We will have to check properly to see whether we did receive any such complaint, he said. 																								CU vice-chancellor Asish Banerjee confirmed they had informed the police a long time ago.																								Early last year, Deb, a lecturer in applied mathematics, sought permission to do a PhD. Visva-Bharati authorities asked for her original certificates, which she could not produce. She told us that she had lost her documents and accordingly, we asked her to lodge an FIR with the police and submit a copy of a certified application seeking duplicate certificates from CU, Sarkar added. 																								Deb got in touch with a few close friends in CU, who asked her to submit her application and promised to take care of the rest. But her luck ran out when a senior CU official decided to probe deeper. 																								It was found that that the registration number mentioned by Deb was false. She had not passed the BSc Part II examination in 1979, as she had claimed. 																								The CU authorities immediately informed the Calcutta police, hoping they would conduct a probe. But the police did not. 																								Visva-Bharati found out when vice-chancellor Sujit Basu sought a detailed report about Deb from CU. We were completely in the dark about this otherwise, he said. 																								The CID, which is investigating the case, has found that after failing in CU, Deb managed to get admission in Jadavpur University. She failed again. 																								In the next few days, we will get a clear picture about the entire admission procedure and who all are involved in the scam, said CID inspector-general Bhupinder Singh. 																								Deb also managed to get hold of a document claiming she was awarded a fellowship from CU to work under Rashbehari Professor Dilip Kumar Sinha. The CID is also looking into allegations that Deb got a person in Santiniketan to do all the critical problems before taking her classes.

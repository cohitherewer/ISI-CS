 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Levis to be made no more in US
 															- Last factories close down in country where jeans were invented K.P. NAYAR				 	 The Levi Strauss plant in San Antonio. (Reuters) Washington, Jan. 9: Once  upon a time, it was an emblem of America. Much more than  Coca-Cola or McDonalds and so valued that it was used as  unofficial currency in the Soviet Baltic republics of Estonia,  Lithuania and Latvia.																								But yesterday, Levi Strauss, the 150-year-old manufacturer of blue jeans, permanently shut down two of its last manufacturing plants in the US in San Antonio, Texas, sending abroad another 800 jobs in order to survive in business by outsourcing work to China, Cambodia and other Third World countries.																								Two decades ago, Levis, which was a craze among young people in India and elsewhere in the world, had 63 factories in the US and in 1996, the companys revenue peaked at $7.1 billion. By the end of March, its three manufacturing units in Canada will also close: there will be no Levis factories anywhere in North America after that.																								Levi Strauss spokesman Jeff Beckman said San Francisco will remain the headquarters of the jeans-maker and its design and sales staff will continue to be based in the US. It will also continue to run distribution centres in this country.																								Beckman stressed the companys Americanness by saying we are still an American brand, but we are also a brand and a company whose products have been adopted by consumers around the world. We have to operate as a global company. Levi Strauss entered the Indian  market in June 1995, long after the hunger for its jeans  had gnawed an entire generation that peopled college campuses  in the sixties and seventies, when the border between the  world of radical Leftwing politics and hippiedom got blurred  at times. Wearing Levis - as exclusive in India then  as in the Soviet bloc - was an expression of non-conformism. Business analysts said the malaise  affecting Levi Strauss was that its products had lost their  exclusivity, which customers once valued and the company  was slow in following the practice of competitors of out  sourcing manufacturing to the Third World. Sales have been falling steadily  for eight years in a row: in 2002, Levis sold products  worth $4.1 billion and Beckman said the figure for last  year would be about 3 per cent lower. In India, too, it is trailing  competitors like Lee.  In an effort to boost morale within  the organisation and reinforce the traditional Levis  image, once personified by film stars like Marlon Brando,  the company last May held a huge 150th birthday bash at  the landmark Levis Plaza in downtown San Francisco  which recreated the Wild West atmosphere. In a symbolic twist to Levis  place behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War years,  San Franciscos mayor Willie Brown had then declared  that May Day in San Francisco would be observed as Levi  Strauss Day.  In 1853, German immigrant Levi  Strauss sold his first clothing products in the West coast  of the US to other immigrants there who were exploiting  the gold rush. In 1873, he sold his first pair  of modern-day blue jeans and created what has since been  known as denim work pants.

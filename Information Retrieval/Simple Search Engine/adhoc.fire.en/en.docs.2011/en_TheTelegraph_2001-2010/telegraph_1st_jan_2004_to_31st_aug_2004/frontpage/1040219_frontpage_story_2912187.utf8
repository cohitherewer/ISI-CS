The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Worried, but raring to go
Calcutta, Feb. 18: India captain Sourav Ganguly today expressed concern about security during the Pakistan trip but affirmed that the full team, except spinner Harbhajan Singh who is unfit, will go.																								We are still concerned about the security but we are told it will be good. It will be just like any other tour and we will go to Pakistan to win, he said.																								There is nothing unnatural about feeling concerned about security arrangements, he added. Even you might feel insecure in the circumstances. But we will go. No one, including Sachin (Tendulkar), has contacted me to inform that he is unwilling to make the trip. Zaheer (Khan) is now fit. Only Harbhajan is unfit. So, we are physically and mentally prepared. Lets see what happens. 																								The Indian captain said he was confident of winning the series. If we can perform at 60 per cent of what we did against the worlds best cricket team, Australia, we will win the series.

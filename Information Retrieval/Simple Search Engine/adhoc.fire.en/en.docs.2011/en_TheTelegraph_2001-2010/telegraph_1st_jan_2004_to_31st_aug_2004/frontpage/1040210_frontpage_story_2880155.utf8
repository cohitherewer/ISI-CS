 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Truth test spills Telgi cash for cop
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 9: Sleuths probing the stamp paper racket today told a Pune court that former Mumbai police commissioner R.S. Sharma, jailed for allegedly abetting the scam, accepted Rs 22 lakh as bribe from the main accused.																								Quoting a report prepared on the basis of a narco-analysis test on scam mastermind Abdul Karim Telgi, the special probe team said Sharma took the money to go slow with the probe and for other favours to the accused.																								Also in Telgis payroll, the investigators told the court, was Telugu Desam Party legislator from Andhra Pradesh C. Krishna Yadav, who received Rs 32 lakh. Yadav, who is also in jail, had asked for Rs 2 crore but settled for Rs 32 lakh after a bit of haggling, they said.																								The report of the narco-analysis test or the truth-serum test, conducted on Telgi in Bangalore on December 22, has been handed over to special judge B.. Deshpande. 																								Sharma was Telgis good friend (and) helped him in the business to sell all his goods at Mumbai and other places, the report says. In return, Sharma was paid Rs 22 lakh by Telgi through Manoj Mehta, a close associate of his.																								The latest disclosures may have sealed Sharmas frantic efforts to get bail. Sharma  who retired last year and is among several top police officers to have been arrested for their role in the scandal  had gone to the extent of saying that the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act had been wrongly used against both him and Telgi.																								The report also mentions the dubious role of Anil Gote, a Maharashtra MLA. Gote, the report says, was a good friend of Telgi and helped the mastermind sell fake stamps in and across Maharashtra.																								Interestingly, the investigators have mentioned that Gote and Telgi even started their own political party and captured six seats. The Kisan Trust that was formed later by Gote, a Samajwadi Janata Party leader, received huge donations from Telgi, the investigators said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Sunday, February 08, 2004 				 At home with mum, penniless amp; cold
 															- I have nothing against the people of India: Bleach AMIT ROY Peter Bleach with  Jo Fletcher at Heathrow airport. (AFP)  London, Feb. 7: Standing  in the windswept garden of his mothers bungalow in Brompton-by-Sawdon  near Scarborough in North Yorkshire, Peter Bleach was today  missing Calcutta  well, sort of.																								Its bloody cold here, he quipped.																								More seriously, he requested The Telegraph, which I read in prison, to pass on a message to the people of India. I have no chips on my shoulder, he said. I have nothing against the people of India. I was badly treated by some prison officers in Calcutta but so were a lot of Indians.																								Bleach, who is back in Britain after receiving an Indian presidential pardon, got to his 83-year-old mother, Oceana, just before midnight on Friday and spent till 5 am on Saturday catching up on eight lost years.																								It was a very emotional time for her, he said, speaking on a mobile phone from his mothers garden. Its windy out here.																								The 52-year-old former arms dealer has protested his innocence and vowed to clear his name. He said he would be willing to make a return trip to India, especially if his appeal pending before the high court in Calcutta fails. If I dont succeed before the high court, I will go to the Supreme Court.																								Curiously, he added that I have now spoken to the Russians, who are apparently also going to pursue an appeal on behalf of the five Latvians who were released after President Vladimir Putins intervention.																								For the time being, Bleach, who is said to be penniless, is adjusting to life in Britain. He intends to stay for the time being with his mother. Driving up to her bungalow last evening, Bleach experienced typical English conditions. The weather and the traffic were horrible, said Jo Fletcher, his close friend.																								Fletcher, a former News of the World reporter who now works for Orion Books in London, said she would help Bleach write a book about his time in India.																								Referring to a man called Ian Drury, she said: My partner is also a publisher.																								She made it clear there was no chance of resuming her old relationship with Bleach, with whom she said she had split up before his arrest in India.																								Bleach said today he found it wonderful to go for a walk in his mothers beautiful garden  there was no one to stop me. But one thing unnerved him  finding the keys hanging on the inside.

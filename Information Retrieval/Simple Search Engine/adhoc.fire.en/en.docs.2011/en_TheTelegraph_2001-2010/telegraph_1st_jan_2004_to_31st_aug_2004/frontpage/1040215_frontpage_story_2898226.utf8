 															- More raps than pats for Tatas CityRover in UK AMIT ROY		 The CityRover: Bumpy rideLondon, Feb. 14: The CityRover,  the small Tata-built car which represents Indias bid to  enter a highly competitive sector of the UK automobile market,  is facing a bumpy ride with some very critical reviews.																								Among the trade magazines, Autocar Magazine has come close to being scathing, but the newspapers, notably The Daily Telegraph and The Independent, have been reasonably impressed.																								The consensus is that the car is overpriced by at least 1,000. Although it is roomy and handles well at low speeds, the interior finish is poor and the ride uneven at higher speeds, especially on the motorway.																								The CityRover is based on Tatas Indica model, with Ratan Tata describing the link-up with Britains MG Rover, which is selling the former, as a very serious relationship, not a flirtation.																								Only one CityRover model is available in the UK, priced at 6,495. With extras, this goes up to 8,895.																								Awarding the CityRover two of a possible five stars, Autocar Magazine says it is too little for too much (money).																								A gamble: thats the only way we can sum up Rovers decision to launch a lightly made-over Indian supermini in what is currently a very competitive market segment, say Autocars road testers.																								It sums up its findings thus: A small car that offers class leading space and performance, but dismal comfort, ride and interior quality. In a way, far from being just another average little car, the CityRover is a car of polar opposites: either pretty good or, more often, very bad. Some drivers will find what theyre looking for in the CityRover, but we simply cannot recommend a car that falls behind the class best in so many areas.																								The magazine complains of some poor paint finish in places and not the best panel fit. It says that in town the car manoeuvres well but up the pace, however, and things rapidly deteriorate. A ride which seemed fine around town cant cope with undulating surfaces at speed.																								It adds: The CityRover just doesnt have the composure that even an average small car has and, as such, cant help but feel crude and antiquated.																								It almost goes without saying that keen drivers should look elsewhere, it states. On the evidence of our test, a long and varied journey in the CityRover is not a prospect to be relished, it continues.																								To open the ashtray is to fear it coming away in your hand and a sister magazine reported a wounded staffer who cut his hand on the poorly finished plastic under the glove-box, it comments. The general standard of plastics really is pretty dismal.																								On newspapers, Autocars road testers are privately dismissed as boyracers who would much rather test Porsches.																								The Daily Telegraphs Paul Hudson says: Until the range expands, the CityRover is a first choice only if you require a five-door, 1.4 litre petrol car.																								He also comments: Uncritical acclaim would be doing MG Rover no favours, but the CityRover is worth considering. The British public will determine its fate  there will be no second chance in this cut-throat sector.																								He found that the interior is airy, the deep windows make it feel spacious, and any nagging doubts about Indian build quality are soon dispelled, as everything seems solid.																								He adds: It is undemanding to drive  the gearbox is slick, the pedals nicely weighted and the steering light. But what impresses most is the cosseting ride. Rovers engineers have done a fabulous job.																								In The Independent, Sean Grady compared the CityRover with the entry level Mercedes A-class, the A140 classic, which costs closer to 14,000.																								He says that the external finish of the CityRover was very good but goes on: MG Rover missed a trick by not having a much more thorough go at the interior before putting the converted Tata on the UK market. The indicators, for example, lack the Mercedess solid action, and everything feels less homely. There is lots of cheap plastic and exposed screw heads.																								He comes to a surprising conclusion: But note the nasty gearstick on the A-class... so perhaps we should leave our prejudices behind when we discuss whats usually called Rovers Indian takeaway. I must deliver my verdict, which is a straightforward one: 6,000 for a couple of airbags, better plastics and a three-pointed star on the bonnet is too much. Ill have the takeaway.																								The Sunday Times put the CityRover into a political context. Its correspondent, Ray Hutton, makes the point: At a time when British business is concerned about the cost-saving migration of call centres and clerical services to India, it is perhaps understandable that MG Rover doesnt advertise the CityRovers origins. But these days it shouldnt matter where a car is produced.																								The Sunday Times, too, thinks the CityRover is overpriced. The difference with Tata is that it didnt set out to make a world car. The Indica was intended as an inexpensive family model for India: simple, practical, no frills. MG Rover has priced the CityRover as if it is a state-of-the-art European or Japanese small car.

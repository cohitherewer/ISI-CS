 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Teachers wade into Rims storm
 							 - Promotion or strike, threaten staff members  OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rims students sit on a hunger strike. Picture by Prashant MitraRanchi, March 21: The crisis at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences threatened to further deepen with faculty members saying they would oppose tooth-and-nail any attempt to recruit teachers from outside if promotions due to them were not given.																								Acting director Jagannath Prasad is believed to have told the agitating students that chief secretary Laxmi Singh, who is also the chairperson of Rims governing body, had assured him that the process of publishing advertisements for teachers and paramedical staff would begin in two-three days and that the interviews would start within a week.																								The chief secretary could not be contacted for comment.																								Rims teachers association secretary Karuna Jha said they would oppose any move to appoint people from outside unless promotions due since 1992 were given. She said the teachers could also go on strike if the Rims administration did not listen to them.																								The move is impractical. When you could not appoint a full-fledged director in two years, what is the guarantee that you will appoint teachers in such a short span of time, Jha said.																								Rims students have been on a warpath against the administration over appointment of teachers. The institute faces a threat of derecognition by the Medical Council of India as 44 per cent of the posts of teachers are vacant. In an order earlier thus month, Jharkhand High Court put a bar on admission of students. 																								But Jha said the teachers had spent their entire life in Rims in one post and the governing body should first promote them before appointing people from outside. A similar experiment was done in Bihar but only two applications came and now they have decided to go in for in-house promotion to deal with the MCI de-recognition threat, she said.																								The Indian Medical Association said it would oppose the decision. 																								The students hardened their stand and began a hunger strike. Enough is enough. There has been only lip-service till now. Now we want action. We are firm on our decision to go on strike from March 23, said an agitating student.

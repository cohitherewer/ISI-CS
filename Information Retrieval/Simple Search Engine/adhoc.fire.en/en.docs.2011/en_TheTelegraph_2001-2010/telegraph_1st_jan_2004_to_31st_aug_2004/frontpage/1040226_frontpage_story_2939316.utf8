 															- Pay and watch, presidential order tells freeloaders LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Musharraf: New hatLahore, Feb. 25: Pervez Musharraf may have critics, but the President appears intent on changing the face of Pakistan. He has already re-written many rules and, now, has targeted the free loaders who gatecrash at venues hosting Tests and ODIs.																								In what is an absolute first in the region, the Presidents office has directed provincial chief ministers, home secretaries and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to ensure that no complimentaries are issued beyond the mandatory requirement in the forthcoming engagements featuring India.																								As the head of state, Musharraf is patron of the PCB.																								According to The Telegraphs sources, theres a sub-section on Free Loaders in the two-page order which also covers security and visa norms. Apparently, the language is unambiguous and the message loud and clear: No chamchas, no relatives and no friends of those in authority.																								In other words, no more free lunches.																								Actually, the directive couldnt have come at a better time.... After all, everybody will be wanting complimentaries for such a high-profile tour. Now, the PCB can simply cite the order from the Presidents office.... It has specifically said that those wanting complimentaries should be asked to buy tickets, is how one source put it.																								Complimentaries, one understands, are only going to be issued to the teams (75 each) and the sponsors  assuming theres a contractual obligation on the part of the PCB.																								In fact, security too will be improved as theres going to be greater control on who enters the stadia. Its not insignificant that Musharraf is himself taking personal interest, as another source pointed out, in the security that will be in place once Sourav Ganguly and Co. arrive here on March 10.																								Meanwhile, back home, the Board of Control for Cricket (BCCI) in India has confirmed the players are going to be briefed by government mandarins before boarding a chartered flight from New Delhi. According to BCCI secretary S.K. Nair, the exercise (by the home and, possibly, foreign ministry officials) will be gone through on March 7/8.

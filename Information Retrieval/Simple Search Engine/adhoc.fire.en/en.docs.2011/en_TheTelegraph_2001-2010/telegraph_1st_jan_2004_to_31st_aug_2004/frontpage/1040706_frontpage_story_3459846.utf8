 Tuesday, July 06, 2004 				 Boycott bid sends PM to ex-PM 
 							 - Singh takes House truce appeal to Vajpayee  OUR BUREAU				 	 Laloo Prasad drinks lassi in a kulhar at Rail Bhavan on Monday. Picture by Jagdish YadavNew Delhi, July 5: When Laloo Prasad Yadav rises to unveil the railway budget tomorrow, the country will know not only what lies ahead for train passengers but also whether two of Indias most respected politicians can prevent the derailment of a parliamentary convention.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today spoke to his predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee in a bid to avert an Opposition boycott of the presentation of the railway budget over the tainted ministers stand-off.The extraordinary exercise  which also saw the Prime Minister making a renewed appeal to L.K. Advani  did not yield any blanket assurance. But Singh remained optimistic of a rapprochement, failing which a budget will be presented for the first time amid an Opposition boycott. 																								I spoke this morning to Vajpayee and Advani and repeated my request that regardless of our differences, we should let Parliament function and all these issues can be discussed, the Prime Minister told reporters in the evening.																								Asked what their response was, Singh said: Hopefully, it should be resolved by tomorrow. But let us see, we will know.																								The ruling United Progressive Alliance said it would neither remove the tainted ministers  Laloo Prasad tops the Opposition blacklist  nor apologise for sacking four governors on ideological grounds  another issue that has polarised the House further. 																								The coalition seems to be banking on the Prime Ministers persuasive powers and signs of differences within the Opposition alliance to break the impasse. The UPAs strongest bet for a truce appears to be the goodwill Singh enjoys across the political spectrum and the reputation of Vajpayee, now the chairperson of the Opposition NDA, as a defender of parliamentary propriety.																								The Prime Minister had spoken to Opposition leader Advani on Saturday. But the conversation did not have much impact and the Opposition today forced an adjournment of Parliament after the Rajya Sabha swearing-in was over.																								Referring to Singhs fresh initiative, Congress sources said that while Vajpayees tone with Singh was conciliatory  despite the former Prime Ministers sharp condemnation of the governors sack  Advani indicated that the governments action left little or no scope for reconciliation.																								But the BJP came under pressure from some of the other NDA constituents to find a face-saver. A meeting of the NDA this morning to finalise its approach was inconclusive. Another meeting will take place tomorrow morning. Sources said three allies the Shiv Sena, the Akali Dal and the Telugu Desam Party  privately voiced reservations about the proposed boycott.																								Boycott serves no purpose. We want to participate in the discussions and point out the possible lacunae in the railway budget, a Desam MP said.																								The Janata Dal (United) is the only constituent which backed the BJP to the hilt because of the Laloo Prasad factor and its impact on Bihar politics.																								NDA sources said the probable strategy could be to walk out when Laloo Prasad presents his budget and boycott the speeches and submissions made by the tainted ministers during the entire session.

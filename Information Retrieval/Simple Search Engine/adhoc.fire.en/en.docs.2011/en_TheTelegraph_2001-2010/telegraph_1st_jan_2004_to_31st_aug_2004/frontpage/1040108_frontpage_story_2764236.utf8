 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Jan. 7: A garbage vat outside a state-run hospital has become the deathbed of a patient in a grisly replay of a tragedy that occurred three months ago.																								Tapan Deyashi, an asthma patient who went missing today from RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, was found draped over a garbage vat outside the hospital, dead from severe cold and shock.																								The 40-year-old Deyashi, who lived in Ultadanga, had managed to walk out of the hospitals crowded medicine ward unnoticed, RG Kar superintendent Chandan Sen said.																								A search was ordered when one of the nurses on the morning shift found Deyashi missing around 7.30 am. The nurse initially thought that he might have gone to the toilet, but she became suspicious when he did not return to his bed after a length of time, Sen said.																								When Deyashis unsuspecting relatives, who had been visiting him routinely at the appointed hours for the past three days, reached the hospital and could not find him, they asked the hospital authorities to bring in police. A missing diary was lodged at Chitpur police station soon after.																								Around 9.30 am, a group of residents came across Deyashis body and alerted the hospital and the police as they surmised from the clothing that he was a patient.																								I saw the body lying almost across the garbage-filled vat, said the owner of a makeshift tea stall near the hospital. I gathered others and informed the hospital, he said.																								Deyashis relatives rushed him to the emergency ward, where he was declared dead. The relatives did not lodge any complaint with the police, officials said. A post mortem was conducted and nothing unusual was detected. He died due to severe cold and the harsh morning chill, Sen said.																								In the last three months, at least five patients have walked out of state-run hospitals with the authorities remaining in the dark. The most stark incident occurred in October when Santosh Hela, a patient of Howrah State General Hospital, was found dead near a garbage vat, a day after he went missing.																								In another incident, a patient was killed after he reportedly jumped out of a window from the second floor of BN Bose Hospital in Barrackpore.

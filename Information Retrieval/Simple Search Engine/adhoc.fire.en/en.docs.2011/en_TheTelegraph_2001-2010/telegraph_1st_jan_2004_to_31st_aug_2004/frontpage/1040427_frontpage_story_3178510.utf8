 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Quit, Meghalaya groups tell UCIL
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Khasi Students Union activists marching through Shillong on Monday. Picture by Eastern ProjectionsShillong, April 26: Human rights organisations and pressure groups in Meghalaya have served a quit notice to the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL), determined to oppose the proposal of uranium mining in Domiasiat under West Khasi Hills. 																								Four organisations, led by the Khasi Students Union (KSU), asked the UCIL to leave the land of the Hynniewtrep. 																								A section of the public and some organisations have expressed repeated apprehension about the hazardous side effects of uranium mining. The UCIL and scientists appointed by the Union government, however, have been making futile attempts to organise trips for different groups of people, including the media, to Jadugoda in Bihar to prove that uranium mining is safe and not harmful.																								We will not allow the UCIL to do any more talking. They have no business here, they must leave, said Samuel Jyrwa, president of KSU. 																								Jyrwa led a huge procession from Jaiaw to Dhankheti to mark the World Anti-uranium Day. The procession was jointly organised by the KSU, the Meghalaya Peoples Human Rights Council, the Heritage Environment Status Protection Organisation and the Hynniewtrep National Youth Front.																								Jyrwa refused to buy the UCIL claims that mining uranium in Domiasiat would be free from risks. 																								The five organisations have also requested the state government not to issue a no-objection certificate to the UCIL. 																								The organisations which have joined hands to oppose the UCILs uranium mission in Domiasiat, have linked influx of outsiders as a major risk. 																								The state government has decided to urge the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre to study the ecology of Domiasiat and submit a report on the feasibility of carrying out uranium mining in the area.

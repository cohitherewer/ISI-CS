 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Mamata mother attacked
 A STAFF REPORTER Mamata BanerjeeCalcutta, May 10: Mamata Banerjee alleged tonight that armed men descended on her house and roughed up her mother, who has been admitted to a nursing home.																								In a complaint filed with police, she said that around 9 pm, a group of 100 people barged into her house  30B Harish Chatterjee Street.																								The complaint alleged that led by Poltu Chowdhury, a Kalighat resident who Trinamul leaders claimed was a CPM activist, the mob pushed Mamatas 70-year-old mother Gayatri Banerjee.																								She fell on the floor and lost consciousness, following which she was taken to the nursing home, Trinamul leaders said. Doctors said Gayatri Banerjee, who is in the ICU, had suffered injuries to the head, face and stomach.Mamata said she was away at a TV studio when the attack took place. The Trinamul leader, who reached home at 10.10 pm, added that her sisters-in-law Lata and Kajori were assaulted by the CPM goons. Post-poll violence has started and the CPM has not even spared my mother, she said.																								The attack was apparently the culmination of a series of clashes starting from Kasba, where Mamata landed up around 6 pm and raised a ruckus over CPM cadre assaulting her party workers. The showdown site then shifted to Asutosh College, where rival groups clashed at 8.30 pm. According to the complaint, a mob then went to Mamatas house.

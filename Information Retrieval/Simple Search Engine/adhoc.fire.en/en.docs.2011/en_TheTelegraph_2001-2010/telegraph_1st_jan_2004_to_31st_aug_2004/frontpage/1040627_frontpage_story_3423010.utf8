 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Dilip in hospital, probe widens
 OUR BUREAU																								Santiniketan/Calcutta, June 26: Remanded in police custody, Dilip Kumar Sinha was shifted to SSKM hospitals intensive care unit tonight even as investigators tried to establish whether some members of a teachers representative body in Calcutta are linked to the fake certificate scandal.																								The former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor was picked up on Friday for alleged involvement in appointing Mukti Deb lecturer on the basis of fake certificates. Both Sinha and Deb were today remanded in custody for 12 days by a Bolpur court.																								While being brought back to Calcutta, Sinha, who recently had a bypass surgery, complained of chest pain and was admitted to SSKM.																								Inspector-general, CID, Bhupinder Singh said police would trace all those involved in the marksheet racket. We are interrogating the duo and have got vital leads and will question more people in the next few days, he said.																								The twin arrests have opened a Pandoras box, a senior CID official said. If required, more people will be arrested.																								A former top finance department official of Visva-Bharati and a former registrar of the university are likely to be questioned in connection with the fake marksheet case as well as for other questionable appointments during Sinhas tenure, officials said.																								It was also learnt that the CBI, which has been handed the affiliation scam involving recognition of 40 fake institutes by Visva-Bharati during Sinhas tenure, will question the former VC soon.																								Earlier in the day, Sinha and Deb were taken to Bolpur court on transit remand. A small crowd, with placards denouncing Sinha, had gathered in front of the court from early morning. The former VC trudged inside, Deb in tow, amid chants of Dilip Sinha hai hai. They were produced before sub-divisional judicial magistrate Debasish Haldar, who remanded them in police custody.																								Public prosecutor Abul Naseem asked for at least 14 days in police custody, but got 12. We need to keep Sinha in custody for the next 14 days for the sake of investigations, Naseem pleaded. The same plea was made for Deb, an undergraduate who has been accused of using fake BSc, MSc and MPhil marksheets.

 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Son sold for food
 SEKHAR DATTA																								Agartala, May 20: Last Monday, when the stock market greeted Sonia Gandhi with a nearly 550-point crash, at the other end of the country a farmer was bartering his son for 50 kg of rice.																								In the interiors of Tripuras Dhalai district, Rupanjay Reang gave away his three-year-old son to a childless couple so that his family could eat. Tripura is ruled by the CPM. 																								The incident came to light after Rupanjay met Congress leader Jadumohan Tripura. Rupanjay said he sold his son Tangsukha to Batharai Reang.																								All members of my family can make do with one meal a day, but my little son cannot. I could not bear to see him cry for food, Rupanjay said. 																								Three years ago, another tribal had sold his son for Rs 50. The Left Front government had, however, denied the incident.

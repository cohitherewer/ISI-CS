 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Jaya, BJP close deal
																								Chennai, Jan. 28: Jayalalithaa today bridged a five-year political gulf in a single tte--tte with BJP boss Venkaiah Naidu, agreeing to fight the general elections as friends but keeping her options on joining the NDA open.																								By way of bonus, the ADMK chief also declared support for A.B. Vajpayee as the next Prime Minister candidate. Taking a whack at Sonia Gandhi, she told a TV channel she was committed to having an Indian as head of government, which was why she had patched up with the BJP.																								The deal comes days after deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani looked her up in Chennai and promised funds to tackle the citys water crisis. He had also given her a tinkle on New Years Day.

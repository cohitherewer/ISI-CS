 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Sourav to fly back 
																								Multan, March 30: Sourav Ganguly is returning home on Thursday to consult a specialist. As of now, he has been ruled out of the second Test as well but, if the back pain doesnt become a thing of the past, he may not come back for the third (and final) one either.																								It depends.... I can only begin thinking of playing once the pain has gone.... Its terribly disappointing, but theres nothing I can do, Sourav told The Telegraph.																								 Sourav hurt himself fielding during last weeks deciding ODI in Lahore. Mohammed Kaif is joining the squad as his replacement.

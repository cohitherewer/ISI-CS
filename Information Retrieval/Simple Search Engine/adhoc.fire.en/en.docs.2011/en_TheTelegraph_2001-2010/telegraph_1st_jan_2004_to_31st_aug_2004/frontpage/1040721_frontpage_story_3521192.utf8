 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, July 20: She came in a milky white Toyota Camri and he came in a black Honda City. She wore a printed white sari and he wore a black suit. She was expected to be one of the inheritors of the Rs 5,000-crore property of the MP Birla group. And he had the windfall  some say unexpected.																								Nandini Nopany, K.K. Birlas daughter, and Rajendra Singh Lodha came face to face in the first meeting of the two sides in a corporate boardroom since Priyamvada Birlas will was opened just over a week ago.																								No, sparks did not fly today at Birla Corp, the flagship company of the MP Birla group, where the two are directors.																								The meeting was expected to be held at Birla Building, which houses family-owned companies. But the directors were informed fairly late of a change of venue to a five-star hotel.																								Word, however, got around as media representatives were already there to report on a board meeting of Haldia Petrochemicals and discovered a far bigger fish.																								Lodha was mobbed when he came out of the meeting, sporting a smile. Whatever has happened has happened for the good of the company, he said.																								Nandini Nopany, a picture of calm composure, walked by, wearing a shield of silence.

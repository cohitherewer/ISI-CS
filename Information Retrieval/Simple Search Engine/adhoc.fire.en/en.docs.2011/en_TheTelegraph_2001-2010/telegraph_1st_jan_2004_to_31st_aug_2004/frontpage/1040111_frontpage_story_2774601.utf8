 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Sop cry for bureaucrats
																								New Delhi, Jan. 10: The BJPs Delhi MPs are pressuring Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to announce fiscal sops for government servants who, along with their dependants, constitute some 8-10 million voters, reports our special correspondent.																								Today, tourism minister Jagmohan formally submitted a consensus list of financial sops to party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu.																								Topping the list is a demand to merge the 59 per cent dearness allowance that government servants get with their pay. If this is accepted, bureaucrats will get more by way of other allowances because perks like house rent assistance and deputation pay are calculated as a fraction of the salary. It also means higher pension and provident fund benefits.

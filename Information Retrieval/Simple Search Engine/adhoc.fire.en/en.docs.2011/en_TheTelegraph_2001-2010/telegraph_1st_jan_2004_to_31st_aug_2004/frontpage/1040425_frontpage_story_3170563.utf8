 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Rebels kill Chaoba kin 
 KHELEN THOKCHOM																								Imphal, April 24: Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL) militants shot dead former Manipur director-general of police L. Jogeshwar at his residence in Kwakeithel Mayaikoibi this evening.																								The outfit has claimed responsibility for the killing and said the former DGP was killed because he campaigned for BJP candidate Th. Chaoba Singh. The latters son is married to Jogeshwars daughter. 																								Last night, the KYKL killed a BJP worker, Nongpokpam Sarat Singh. He was first abducted and shot in the leg at Konthoujam village in Imphal West while organising a feast for Chaoba Singh.																								The proscribed outfit had banned campaigning by the BJP as the party had refused to obey its diktat of expelling Chaoba Singh. The outfit had labelled Chaoba Singh, who is the BJP state unit president, as a public enemy. The KYKL had also awarded a death sentence to the veteran politician and former Union minister last year.																								With the latest attack, the number of BJP workers shot by the KYKL gunmen this month has gone up to five. Three workers, including one councillor, were shot at in Bishenpur and Thoubal in separate incidents.																								In Dibrugarh today, deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani warned of harsh action against militant outfits of the Northeast which are unwilling to give up the gun.																								Repolling for Manipurs Outer constituency was held today. Barring the death of a CRPF jawan in a road mishap in Senapati district, no major incident was reported. Repolling in one more station in Chandel district was ordered by the Election Commission today since the centre, with a total electorate of 211, recorded casting of 212 votes on April 20. The district election officer, sub-deputy collector . Ibomcha Singh, was suspended for dereliction of duty today. The official notification also ordered the official to pay Rs 500 as fine.																								The Inner seat will go to the polls on Monday under tight security in view of the general strike called by the banned United National Liberation Front. Six candidates are in the fray for the seat, including Chaoba Singh. 																								The Congress has also not been allowed to campaign by the banned Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF). The outfit had said the Okram Ibobi Singh government failed to restrain the security forces from committing human rights violation in the state.																								Suspected RPF cadres had launched a series of strikes on the houses of three Congress ministers on Friday. The Congress candidates house was also attacked on Thursday by suspected RPF cadres. The RPF has also ordered residents of Brahamapur, Imphal East, to return some money donated by political parties for a feast.

 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Advani shakes off feel-good 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 28: The signature slogan of Elections 2004 was given a formal burial by its creator today. 																								Feel good and India Shining cost the BJP dear, Lal Krishna Advani admitted, coming out of the shell the BJPs top leadership had retreated into after the stunning defeat. 																								The former deputy Prime Minister confessed that feel good was a phrase he picked up for the election campaign, having heard it at a function hosted by a business daily in Mumbai. India Shining was coined by some advertising agency, he said.																								These phrases, though valid in themselves, were inappropriate for our election campaign. By making them verbal icons of our election campaign, we gave an opportunity to our political opponents to highlight other aspects of Indias contemporary reality  poverty and uneven development, unemployment among the youth, problems faced by the farmers  which questioned our claim.																								But the BJP leader insisted that the results  the most dramatic since Indira Gandhis defeat in 1977  were not the peoples national verdict. Describing the outcome as an aggregate of state verdicts, he said no single factor accounted for the partys defeat.																								Advani claimed Sonia Gandhis abdication had come as a big relief to the country. Asked if the BJPs foreign origin plank had backfired, he said the party believed a person of foreign origin should not occupy the top post. It is a political issue, not a personal one. Whatever has happened subsequently has brought relief in the country, he said, referring to Sonia declining the Prime Ministers office.																								Unapologetic about Hindutva and cultural nationalism, Advani told a news conference: We shall continue to wage an ideological battle against those who portray Hindutva as communal for their narrow political ends.																								We shall return to power, vowed Advani, who is tipped to be the leader of the Opposition.																								 The partys national executive would meet some time in the middle of next month to review the unexpected results.																								Advani blamed the defeat on anti-incumbency against state governments and party candidates, besides the caste factor. Ninety sitting MPs had lost, he pointed out.In some states, we suffered along with our allies. In others, we suffered because we did not forge proper alliances. In urban constituencies, where we fared poorly, the turnout of our supporters was low. In some states, our organisational weakness contributed to our setback, he said.

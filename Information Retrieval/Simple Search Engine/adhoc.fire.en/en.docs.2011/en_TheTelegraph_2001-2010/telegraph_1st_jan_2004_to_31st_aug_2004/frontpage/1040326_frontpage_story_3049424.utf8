 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Multan hinges on a miracle
 															- No slipped disc, Sourav should be fit for last two Tests LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Sourav Ganguly: UNCERTAINLahore, March 25: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly hasnt suffered a slipped disc, as was feared, but nothing short of a miracle will make him play the first Test, beginning on Sunday in Multan. He ought to be fine, though, for the last two Tests.																								From Souravs point of view, the MRI is quite good.... He does have an acute lower back injury (sustained while fielding in yesterdays decider), but the dehydration of one disc is related to wear-and-tear.... The diagnosis is that he has non-specific pain, in other words, spasms, informed physio Andrew Leipus.																								Speaking to The Telegraph moments after returning from the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Diagnostic Centre, Sourav himself had this to say: Im a bit relieved its not a slipped disc problem, but Im still in considerable pain. As of now, a miracle alone is going to enable me to play in Multan.																								So, for the second time this season, Rahul Dravid appears set to stand in for Sourav in a Test  the first occasion being in Mohali, versus New Zealand. If it comes to that, this time too the biggest beneficiary will be Yuvraj Singh.																								The MRI was scheduled for the early afternoon, but a communication gap between the security agencies and the local liaison personnel resulted in enough confusion to hold back Sourav and Leipus. 																								Indeed, they missed the teams flight to Multan as the MRI was rearranged for around 6.30 pm  this last-minute change only added to everybodys anxiety. In any case, Souravs injury took away even more fizz from the teams champagne-less celebrations  in Dravids room  last night.																								To talk of the confusion, Sourav was taken to the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, which is some distance from the hotel (Pearl Continental), and not the centrally located centre. The Imran Khan-built hospital doesnt have an MRI facility on its premises, but in the heart of the city. 																								Besides leaving Sourav and Leipus frustrated, that exercise worsened the captains pain  the back brace and pain-killers notwithstanding.																								This season, Ive already made so many trips to hospitals and clinics... doesnt at all make me feel good, but what to do? Sourav said, unhappy with the turn of events on one of the biggest days for Indian cricket. The last MRI was during the Melbourne Test, when he was struck by Brad Williams at the back of his head.																								According to Leipus, Sourav is going to be monitored on a daily basis. He added: Look, one cant put a date on complete recovery. But, yes, Ill be pushing on the physiotherapy and rehab front.... Basically, we must be positive as no abnormality has been reported.																								Sourav and Leipus intend to fly to Multan tomorrow morning. Incidentally, Anil Kumble, Ajit Agarkar and Akash Chopra arrived this afternoon from Delhi and left with the Dravids for Multan. See Sport

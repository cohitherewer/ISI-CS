 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, Aug. 29: The Manmohan Singh government today test-fired a new variant of the nuclear capable Agni II missile coinciding with its 100 days of power in a kind of celebration that harks back to the hawkishness of the NDA establishment.																								Within a week of the United Progressive Alliance government assuming power in Delhi in May, Pakistan had twice test-fired the Ghauri II missile. 																								The Indian security establishment at that time had ruled out tit-for-tat tests.																								As Pakistan had done, India is understood to have given Islamabad advance notice of todays test. India had also informed neighbouring countries and mercantile shipping as the impact point of the missile was in the high seas in the Bay of Bengal.

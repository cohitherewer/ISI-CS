 															- Revenue from liquor set to touch Rs 1000 crore SHANKAR MUKHERJEECalcutta, April 23: Heres final proof of India Shining. Champagne corks are popping in Bengal, too. And how!																								Excise collections are set to bubble over the Rs 1,000-crore mark for the first time. While Bengal drinks more, finance minister Asim Dasgupta (in picture) is worrying less about having to any day scrape the bottom of the barrel.																								Like many other things, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government could well be left wondering in private  and, dare one say, over a glass of something or the other  why it didnt recognise the states thirst for liquor earlier.																								Days were when liquor was a strict no-no for Bengals communists. After coming to power in 1977, it did not issue a single liquor licence for decades. Just as it pulled English out of primary schools, or believed that courting capital was a worse vice than the decadent culture of sipping whisky.																								Excise collections, as a result, used to come in a trickle  never more than Rs 250 crore, from only 150 liquor shops and bars throughout the state.																								Necessity is the mother of all inventions and the Left Front rediscovered liquor licences when Dasguptas cash box began to have a hollow ring about it.																								In 2000  around the time the bring-English-back official movement also gathered steam  the CPM-led government shed its inhibitions about liquor. Licences for off-shops and bars were issued and in four years excise on liquor has become the second highest revenue earner after sales tax in the state.																								Last year, we were able to earn Rs 616 crore from excise duties. This year, we expect collections to be around Rs 900 crore, said a smiling excise commissioner Satish Tewari. The amount is likely to cross Rs 1,000 crore if we continue issuing new licences. The process has already begun.																								Altogether, 375 off-shops, bars and clubs have come up between 2000-03. Over 100 bars opened for business last year alone, and 50 more are expected soon. The floodgates opened with a lottery of 250 off-shop licences in 2000. 																								Results of the liberalised policy were noticed when the revenue collection jumped to Rs 567 crore in 2002. Cheered by this rise in revenue, the government relaxed some restrictions for opening bars and started issuing more licences. The revenue increased to Rs 616 crore in 2003, officials said.																								Finding a cash cow  or should it be liquid gold?  the government again relaxed restrictions in a new excise policy in 2003, enabling it to issue 300 more licences for off-shops and an unlimited number of permits for bars.																								The new policy allowed anyone to get a licence for a liquor shop or bar after paying a fee and provided there was no hospital, educational institution or place of worship in the vicinity.																								At least Rs 200 crore is expected from application fees and excise duties from the new shops.																								Even after crossing the Rs 1,000-crore mark, we will still be far behind Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, where annual collections from excise are over Rs 3,000 crore. We may not be able to match these states, but we will be in a respectable position in a couple of years, Tewari said.																								Shall we raise a toast to liquor?

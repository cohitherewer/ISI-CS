 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Past, rest in peace at Pindi
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHIIslamabad, April 16: For a while, the Pindi Cricket Stadium ambience was surreal.... Perhaps, it couldnt have been otherwise as none expected India to thrash Pakistan twice within a fortnight, each time by an innings.																								In doing so, India won overseas for the first time since 1993-94. Victory had then come in Sri Lanka, under Mohammed Azharuddin. Pakistan hadnt lost at home after the 2000-2001 setback at the hands of Nasser Hussains England.																								Its a dream come true, acknowledged Sourav Ganguly, now the most successful captain numbers-wise (15 Tests), not just percentage. Team Indias dream, though, became a nightmare for Pakistan.																								Usually, everything associated with a Golden Jubilee is cherished. Inzamam-ul Haq and Javed Miandad, however, wouldnt want to recall the 50th Test versus India in their worst dream. Its another matter that the huge defeat is going to haunt them nevertheless.																								Not too long ago, the Wasim Akrams would taunt that the fear of losing kept the Souravs away from Pakistan. Almost 15 years after the last bilateral Test series on this side of the divide, its the home team which got clobbered.																								In fact, the Indians produced awesome cricket  in the ODIs (won 3-2) and Tests. Former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja, though, chose to describe it as stunning.																								If Multan saw history rewritten under stand-in captain Rahul Dravid, the Samsung Cup decider added a more glittering chapter. This afternoon, as Yuvraj Singh pulled Ramesh Powars leg by calling him motu and Man of the Match Dravid exhorted teammates to hip-hip-hooray India, nobody remembered Pakistans nine-wicket victory in Lahore.																								If the innings and 52 runs loss in Multan wasnt bad enough, Pakistan surrendered by an innings and 131 runs in Rawalpindi. 																								One expected at least a semblance of a fight, more so as the team is coached by Miandad, who never ever gave an inch without biting off something. Really, defiance would have been par for the course.																								As it turned out, the series ended not much after the rescheduled second session on Day IV. Lakshmipathy Balaji bowled beautifully  he could have swung the ball till his Chennai residence  to start with and, then, (highest wicket-taker) Anil Kumble got into the act.																								The injured Asim Kamal alone challenged India and his unbeaten 60 must have embarrassed peers. Inzamam admitted as much when he said Kamal showed it wasnt difficult to hold out. Pakistan lacked character and any post-mortem has to address that.																								Pakistan appeared demoralised by our total (600).... Having said that, people should appreciate the brilliant cricket played by India.... This team is hungry for success and wont ease off. Right now, its terrific being an Indian, is how former captain Ajit Wadekar put it emotionally.																								Smiling, he added: I used to be called a Lucky Captain.... Im a Lucky Ex-Captain, too, isnt it?																								The first hour was most dramatic: the bowlers took three wickets; the fielders dropped three catches. Luckily none proved costly, something which again reflects poorly on Pakistan, or else Sourav and coach John Wright may still have been plotting the last days strategy.																								Overwhelmed, Sourav told The Telegraph: This completes the best year or thereabouts of my captaincy from making the World Cup final to winning in Adelaide and claiming this series. However, much remains to be achieved.																								Official duties over, the captain called home and spoke to his parents and Dona and Sana. Laughing, he said: My daughter forgot about congratulating, but did remember to ask whether Id bought her red and pink salwar-kameez suits. At this age, her priorities have to be different from dads.Meanwhile, the record-scripting Indians  awarded a Rs 50 lakh bonus by the board  leave for home aboard a special Indian Airlines flight tomorrow evening. The departure is scheduled for 5.30 pm (IST). Man of the Series Virender Sehwag, due to wed in a couple of days, is the one most eager to quickly touch down in New Delhi.

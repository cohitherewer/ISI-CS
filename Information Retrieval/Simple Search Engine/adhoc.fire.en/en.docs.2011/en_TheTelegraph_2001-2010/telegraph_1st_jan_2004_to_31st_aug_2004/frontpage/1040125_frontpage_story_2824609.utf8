Sarita and Mahesh were on their way to Shabdo village, about 100 km Gaya, around 7 pm when they were stopped by unidentified gunmen. They were dragged away from the motorcycle, on which they were travelling, and shot dead.																								The two, in their thirties, started the Institute of Rural Research and Action, an NGO, two years ago, to teach the people of Shabdo.

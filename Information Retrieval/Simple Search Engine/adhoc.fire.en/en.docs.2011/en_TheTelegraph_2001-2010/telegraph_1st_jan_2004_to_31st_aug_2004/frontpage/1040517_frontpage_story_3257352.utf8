 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Bellini face rings a bell for Mellini, not too many others
 															- Old-timers in Sonias hometown speak of a nice, pleasant person who they didnt think would become PM  SHREYA DHOUNDIAL AND ADITI ARORA SAWANT				 	 Sonias house in Italy. (Reuters)Orbassano, May 16: The heat in Delhi  political as much as climatic  is quite a contrast to the pleasant environs of Orbassano.																								The small nondescript town Sonia Gandhi, then Sonia Maino, grew up in is a 45-minute drive from Turin. Our taxi driver, Marcus Mellini, is one of the few here who understand English, and the moment we mention India he produces a newspaper with Sonias picture and a detailed article on the surprise Congress win in the elections.																								He is also one of the few people in the town who recognises her. And most of them who do are elderly.																								Sonias two-storey ancestral house is located in a middle-class area, 14 Bellini. It is much bigger than most in the locality. We ring the bell but nobody is at home. Sonias sister, Anushka, and niece Aruna  who runs a curio shop called Etnica that sells Indian ethnic stuff  are away, too. We then do what most journalists would in such a situation  talk to the neighbours.																								She is a nice, pleasant person. I didnt know she is going to be Indias Prime Minister, says Maria, whose mother-in-law was Sonias classmate in school.																								She hasnt come to Orbassano in the last three years, but her mother goes to India often, says another neighbour, Nicholas Morrani, who has lived here for the past 45 years. Sonias mother, Paola, was in Delhi recently but has returned to Orbassano.																								Five km away from 14 Bellini, and in a relatively prosperous locality, is the Rajiv Gandhi Street. Named after the former Prime Minister was assassinated by Tamil militants, the street is deserted except for a young couple walking with their little girl.																								Gorgio has not heard of Rajiv Gandhi but his wife remembers Sonia. She went abroad to study at a very young age. Back then for someone from our town to go outside was a rarity. Then she married someone famous and went to India. I read in the papers about her and am happy for her. I hope she comes to Orbassano, she says.																								As with Sonia, those who do remember Rajiv Gandhi are the older residents. But most have shifted. The ones who are still here remember him as a nice, young fellow with no airs.																								There are hardly any Indians in this industrial town, which has a Fiat factory, and where many are in the construction business. Sonias father, too, was a building contractor. The town developed in the 1950s after World War II. 																								The only Indian the people of Orbassano are familiar with is the towns councillor, Awtar Singh Rana, who migrated to Italy some 50 years ago. He, of course, knows about Sonia. The only other Indian here is a man from Kerala.																								The Indian media have been very unfair to her, says Rana. They said she invested heavily in property here. All that is rubbish. If people of Orbassano can choose an Indian as their councillor, why cant an Orbassano girl be the Prime Minister of India? The people of India have chosen her to lead them.																								Rana also pays a compliment to Sonia. She is more Indian than I am, he says.

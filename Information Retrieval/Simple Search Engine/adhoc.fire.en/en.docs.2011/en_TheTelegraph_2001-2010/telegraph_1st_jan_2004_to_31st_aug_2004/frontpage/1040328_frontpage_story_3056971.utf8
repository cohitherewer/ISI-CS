 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sachin Tendulkar takes a break from practice in Multan on Saturday. (Reuters)																								Multan, March 27: Losing the captain at any time is bad enough. Its worse when that comes about on the eve of a Test series, that too against Pakistan. And, during a Revival Tour.																								Of course, Im confident well do well, Sourav Ganguly told The Telegraph, giving the state-of-the-art Multan Cricket Stadium (15 km from the city centre) an appreciative look. Yet, nobody quite believes the regular Team India captains absence wont make a difference.																								The opposition is more than convinced it will.																								Well try to take advantage of Souravs absence.... Any team would do so, acknowledged Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq. Incidentally, his roots are in Multan and the cricket fraternity has saluted his contribution by naming the pavilion after him.																								Its not that Rahul Dravid, standing in for the second time in a shade over five months, is going to be found wanting. But, whatever his few remaining critics may say, Souravs leadership is distinctive: Passionate and inspirational.																								For his part, Dravid is prepared for the rather heavy demands. Having been vice-captain for some years, Ive had a role in strategy.... Ive been making a contribution to our game plan, he pointed out.																								Dravid, however, will be hoping he has better personal luck than when he did the job in Mohali, versus New Zealand. After all, he failed in both innings (13 and 5) and dropped catches. In fact, but for V.V.S. Laxmans brilliance, that Test could have gone the Black Caps way.																								Actually, Souravs absence has cancelled out the psychological advantage gained by winning the ODIs. Its not that Test cricket is quite the same as the limited overs action, but irrespective of Dravids views  Im not for the psychological stuff and so on  a victory (equally, a defeat) does impact on the mindset.																								In Dravids opinion, the teams start evenly: Fifty-fifty.																								While the previous bilateral Test series was five years ago, both India and Pakistan rose above the script in their last appearance anywhere  India in Australia, Pakistan in New Zealand. Yet, it remains to be seen how much of that is going to influence the three-match series beginning tomorrow.																								For the millionth time, Sachin Tendulkar will be the cynosure. Among the many reasons one being he is the sole survivor from the last Indo-Pak Test in Pakistan (Sialkot, over 14 years ago).																								Characteristically, he is cool. I believe in keeping things simple.... It wont be any different this time.... Am I under more pressure? No.... There are others also to take care of that.... Basically, we must think positively and allow the positive energy to flow, he said.Thats not complicated: What we really need to make is an excellent first day impression. Thus far, no Indian side has ever won a Test in Pakistan.

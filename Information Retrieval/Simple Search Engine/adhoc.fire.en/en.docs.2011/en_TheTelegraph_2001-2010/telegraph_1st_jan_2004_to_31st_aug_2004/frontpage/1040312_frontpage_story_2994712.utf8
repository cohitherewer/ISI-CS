 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Shame and scandal in Cong attack on PM 
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, March 11: Snapping out of a stupor, the Congress has picked its prime target: Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								The Prime Minister was put on public trial by the principal Opposition party today when it released a 56-page chargesheet against the governments six years of sins, scams and shame in the most vocal and direct attack on Vajpayee in the run-up to the coming elections.																								The Prime Minister cannot disown his responsibility for the Centres omissions and commissions because the ultimate responsibility in a parliamentary democracy is the Prime Ministers, Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee said.																								The Congress so far has been concentrating on Sonia Gandhis roadshows and trying to drive home the point that its governments pioneered most of the steps that led to the perceived feel-good in the country.																								However, the partys reluctance to zoom in on the several scandals that broke during the BJPs rule had spread disquiet in the Congress ranks, strengthening a perception that the campaign lacked political teeth.																								Todays move to gun for Vajpayee is intended at countering the Atal factor that the NDA has been highlighting in its campaign. There is no Atal factor, Mukherjee said.The booklet  released in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Bangalore simultaneously  repeatedly mentions Vajpayees name while listing the scams and the governments failures. 																								The document also mentions his principal secretary, foster son-in-law and a relative. The concluding part details instances of Vajpayees doublespeak. 																								These (scams) may be known to you. But when 700 million people cast their votes, we want to remind them about these scams, Mukherjee said.																								BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu dismissed the chargesheet with characteristic disdain, describing it as stale and pale.																								The Congress charge that the NDA government has compromised national security dominates with the document asserting that the Prime Minister owes an explanation for reinducting Tehelka scam-tainted George Fernandes as defence minister.																								The document accuses the Centre of diverting Rs 22,000 crore collected as Kargil cess. Over Rs 49,000 crore was involved in 80-odd scams, including those on coffins, UTI, petrol pumps, land allotment and divestment, Mukherjee said. So much for the India Shining campaign.																								The most direct attack on Vajpayee is reserved for his flip-flop on Ayodhya, Fernandes alleged involvement in Tehelka, Gujarat riots, minorities and employment. India will (therefore) feel good only when the NDA is thrown out, the booklet says.

 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Pressure, not castles, in the air
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Sachin Tendulkar with Rahul Dravid at a training session in Lahore on the eve of the second Test. (Reuters)																								Lahore, April 4: Its not exactly a state secret, but this afternoon, Inzamam-ul Haq accepted that the pressure to win the second Test was immense and that the odds favoured India, already 1-0 up in the three-match series.																								Koshish to khoob rahegi, lekin haalat mushkil hain (Well try our best, but...), the Pakistan captain said candidly. In any case, he will be without first-choice wicketkeeper Moin Khan, ruled out owing to a groin injury. Then, there have been reports about Shoaib Akhtar offering to opt out after the Multan show.																								Worse, coach Javed Miandad continues to be peeved that just about everybody is holding him accountable for Pakistan being in an unprecedented corner in a home series versus India. Trailing is, well, calamitous.																								Clearly, Inzamam has been left with too much to do. The Indians, though, arent taking anything for granted. Stand-in captain Rahul Dravid cautioned Pakistan could hit back hard.																								To facilitate that, a greenish wicket has been prepared at the Gaddafi. However, its a Catch-22 situation: what if the surface is exploited to the hilt by the Irfan Pathans? Its not insignificant that the youngster was the pick among the quicks (on both sides) in Multan. 																								At the best of times, captains in Pakistan are under pressure from many quarters  about the only exception was Imran Khan in his later years. It gets unbearable after a defeat at the hands of India. So, if Inzamam has shrunk somewhat in the past few days, its not without reason.																								For the record, though, Inzamam is presenting a bold front. Im not thinking of losing the captaincy.... Today, my thoughts are towards winning here and in Rawalpindi, he insisted. 																								Incidentally, Inzamam believes one good session from his highly-rated quicks can bring Pakistan right back in the series. Equally, Dravid is of the opinion that fruitful back-to-back sessions are going to help consolidate Indias hold. Basically, we need to have a good first day, he added.																								Dravid made the point about not building castles in the air. He elaborated: Both teams will start this Test even stevens.... Right now, Multan is history and Im not looking at what may happen after five days.... Its going to be day-by-day and we must be consistent.... That done, the results will follow....																								A fortnight ago, Lahore saw unprecedented frenzy in the build-up to the fourth and fifth ODIs. This time, the response has been abysmal, forcing the Pakistan Cricket Board to halve ticket rates.																								Even then, a decent turnout isnt expected. Perhaps, it has much to do with Pakistans poor show. Also, it would have been different had the Tests been played first  this proposal was, by the way, shot down by India.																								Footnote: The Indians havent been impressed by foreign office spokesperson Masood Khans remark that the Multan defeat wasnt engineered and that it had nothing to do with the Confidence Building Measures with Delhi. Fact is we played consistently well to win by an innings. Thats it, Dravid said.

 BHARAT BHUSHANIslamabad, Jan. 3: Prime  Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will make a courtesy call  on Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in keeping with Saarc  conventions and protocol. He is scheduled to meet him along  with the other SAARC heads of government at a banquet hosted  by the Pakistan President tomorrow evening.																								Foreign secretary Shashank told reporters here today that Prime Minister Vajpayee had been briefed on this Saarc protocol. This was the closest that India was willing to come to admitting the possibility of a Vajpayee-Musharraf face-to-face interaction.																								Shashank also made a distinction between bilateral meetings that had been fixed between Vajpayee and the leaders of the Saarc countries and the interaction with the Pakistan leadership. Such interaction, he said, could take place during the leaders retreat at the Pakistan Prime Ministers residence or at the banquet hosted by Musharraf.																								Tremendous expectations have been aroused. Either we meet those expectations or interact in the context of Saarc, Shashank clarified. The interaction, Shashank said, could be one-to-one or along with others present.

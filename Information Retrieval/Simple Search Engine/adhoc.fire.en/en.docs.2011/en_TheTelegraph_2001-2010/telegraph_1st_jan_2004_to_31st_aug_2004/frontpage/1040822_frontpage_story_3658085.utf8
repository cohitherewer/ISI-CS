 KHELEN THOKCHOM																								Imphal, Aug. 21: A police commando raid on the Canchipur campus of Manipur University yielded a cache of sophisticated arms last night. 																								Police sources said an AK-56 rifle, a hand grenade and incriminating documents were seized from a room in the Manipur University boys hostel. 																								The raid followed the arrest of an activist of the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (Prepak) yesterday from Wangkhei area of Imphal East. A revolver and four rounds of ammunition were seized from him. 																								Manipur University vice-chancellor . Bijoy Singh, however, denied the police claim that the weapons were found in the boys hostel. 																								Police along with university officials had conducted the search operation outside the boys hostel building and recovered the arms from a bush outside the building and not from a students room, Bijoy Singh said.																								However, a statement issued by the Manipur University Students Union said the police had planted the weapons in the hostel to harass the students for participating in the movement against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.																								Another Assam Rifles battalion was mired today in a controversy. Villagers accused the 14th Assam Rifles battalion in Motbung (Senapati district) of coercing residents, mostly young boys and girls, to take out a procession at Kangpokpi under Sadar Hills district demanding continuance of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in the state. None of those who took part in todays rally could be contacted for comment. 																								Battalion commandant Col. Gurvinder Singh strongly denied the charges. 																								State director-general of police A.K. Parashar said the situation has started to improve in the state. He said altogether 80 protesters have been rounded up. Thirty-one of them have been booked under the National Security Act. 																								The DGP added that during the past few days, two underground activists have been killed and 11 arrested. 																								The indefinite bandh which crippled normal life for the past five days was called off today after the formal cremation of student leader Pebam Chittaranjan. Royal honours were bestowed at this symbolic cremation in his native place, Takhel Leikai of Imphal West. Manipurs titular king Leishemba Sanajaoba ordered a royal funeral for the patriot.																								The police and paramilitary forces put up barricades and stood guard on all arterial roads and diverted traffic to block thousands of agitators, who had threatened to take to the streets for the funeral. 																								An 11-hour public curfew was called from 5 am by a womens organisation, Kha Nongpok Apunba Nupi Lup, and the Meitei Council at Moreh. Unidentified persons set ablaze  the outhouse of MP Meinya Singhs residence at Khumbong  in Imphal East at 9 pm yesterday. A government settlement  office at Lamphel Pat here was also set on fire.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Match in pocket, team wins hearts 
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI A jubilant fan in Ambala. (PTI)Multan, April 1: Sourav Ganguly set out to create history, yet destiny willed that Rahul Dravid be remembered as the first Indian captain to plot a Test win in Pakistan. It took 21 attempts and almost half a century, but the wait made this mornings emotionally-driven innings and 52-run victory that much sweeter.																								Standing in for the injured Sourav, Dravid doesnt believe in momentum and psychological advantage, but its going to be difficult for the hosts to come back in this three-Test series. The last Pakistani wicket, centurion Yousuf Youhanas, fell in exactly two overs on the fifth day.																								The Revival Tour is, indeed, becoming pretty traumatic for Inzamam-ul Haq. First came the loss in the ODIs and, then, hell be taking to the second Test (Lahore, from April 5) in an unfamiliar position.																								We just didnt play well and must improve in many areas, the captain acknowledged, appearing to have lost weight in the past few days.																								Usually, a defeat at Indias hands is calamitous. The jury is out on the reaction this time.																								Understandably, there was a furious dash to collect the four stumps on offer as soon as Dravid caught Youhana (off a miscued pull). The stand-in captain himself grabbed one, but presented it to Man of the Match Virender Sehwag  Indias No. 1 triple centurion  who got left behind in that scramble.																								Few mementos will carry more value.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, a trifle overwhelmed Dravid said he dedicated the win to Indian cricket and all those who are so passionate about it.																								He added: More than anybody else, its for them.																								Given the laws of the land, bubbly couldnt be sprayed in the dressing room, but there was much shouting and cheering. That continued till somebody began playing CDs on computer analyst Ramakrishnas laptop, with Tere bina, Tere bina the first to boom.																								Later, in a gesture bound to influence more hearts (and certainly gladden Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee), Team India visited the SOS Childrens Village at short notice.																								The kids were thrilled and the office-bearers delighted. The Indians have honoured us, said Mahnaz Fareed, the institutions general secretary.																								The Pakistan team was also invited, but couldnt make the trip collectively  some players did visit the Village last evening  as an upset coach Javed Miandad ordered nets straight after the presentation ceremony. 																								Kaafi kaam karna hai, he insisted, chewing his favourite gutka.																								The team hotel (Holiday Inn) too wasnt found wanting in making a gesture: The staff lined up like a battalion and applauded the Dravids. Quite a few autograph books surfaced as well, but thats understandable in our region.																								Team India did lose Sourav before the Test, but beginning with the toss, nothing went wrong: An excellent 160-run opening stand between Sehwag and Akash Chopra  who lends much value, the record-erasing 336-run partnership for the third wicket between Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumbles eight-wicket haul and Irfan Pathans passionate effort in both innings.																								And, of course, Yuvraj Singhs out-of-this-world run-out of Inzamam on the fourth afternoon.																								Despite playing at home, though on a wicket which blunted the attacks potency, Pakistan got crushed under the weight of Indias 675 for five declared. Sachin wasnt happy at being left unbeaten on 194, but Dravids decision stands vindicated.																								Incidentally, while Sourav and Kumble left for the airport (en route home) from the stadium itself, the wives of four players Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Ajit Agarkar and Murali Kartik  are landing in Lahore tomorrow. Kumble returns on Saturday, by when wife Chetna would have given birth to their first child.																								Sourav is going to rejoin once the specialists give the all-clear to his back. I cant afford to miss all three Tests. Ive got to be part of the history this fantastic team is making, he declared. If all goes well, he should play the final Test, in Rawalpindi from April 13.																								Be it for what happened on the field or whats expected on the home front, Im feeling great, Kumble said.																								Today, that sentiment finds an echo in over a billion Indians.

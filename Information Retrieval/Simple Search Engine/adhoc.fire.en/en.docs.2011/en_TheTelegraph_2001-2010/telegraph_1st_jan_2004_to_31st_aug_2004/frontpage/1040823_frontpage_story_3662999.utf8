The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 CM spins candid charm 
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, Aug. 22: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee sat at the high table of Indian business to showcase Bengals investment opportunities last night at an event organised by ABP Ltd, the publishers of The Telegraph.																								Its not always that Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani share a table, that too flanking a chief minister from Bengal. Bhattacharjee did not disappoint such an audience.																								I tell you that they (the vocal members from the Left) will speak their minds to the finance minister (P. Chidambaram), but finally theyll agree to disagree, the chief minister told a galaxy of Indias best-known industrialists who attended a roadshow at the Taj Mahal hotels Crystal Room to highlight the virtues of Doing Business in Bengal.																								He was reacting to concerns about the Lefts strident opposition to foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in areas like insurance. 																								While making a strong pitch to attract investment into Bengal, Bhattacharjee said: I have told my Left colleagues at the Centre that I cannot oppose FDI. My governments views on the issue are fashioned by the practical realities of the present rather than the dogmas of the past.																								Our industry policy is open. We are not fools. We will welcome foreign investment, the chief minister declared, adding that the Left had tempered its fierce, antagonistic views towards the owners of capital.																								Bhattacharjee faced a flurry of questions from the industrialists about the Lefts stand on a range of economic issues and its doctrine of governance.																								Adi Godrej, who controls a gaggle of businesses ranging from soaps to poultry and call centres, lobbed the first question: Dont you think your colleagues in the politburo should tone down their rhetoric?																								The chief minister was disarmingly candid about some decisions of the past, especially the encouragement of militant trade unionism in the seventies, that had prompted industry to close down factories and invest in other states.																								Referring to the outspoken section within his party, especially those who had trade union backgrounds, he said: These people do not understand the present-day scenario. They dont understand the economy. All they know is to formulate a charter of demands, raise slogans and disturb production.																								He indicated that his government had distanced itself from these elements which were hurting the states image. 																								We will not support such undemocratic acts. We have acted firmly by calling in police when the unions turned militant at Bata and a Pepsi factory, he said.																								Industry, he said, had started to appreciate his governments changed stance and cited the example of Japanese investments in the state. It is now time for the domestic industrialists to join in, he added.Besides Ambani, Godrej and Tata, the industrialists who attended the roadshow included Venugopal Dhoot from the Videocon group, Asim Ghosh from Hutch and Harsh Goenka of the RPG group.

 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Dravid, Sachin declare all-clear
 															- Stand-in skipper takes initiative for one-to-one  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHIMultan, March 30: Last evening, Sachin Tendulkar appeared devastated by stand-in captain Rahul Dravids declaration, which left him six short of a possible fourth double century. Yet, today, he was passionate on the field and, by bamboozling Moin Khan on the last ball, made Team Indias hold on the first Test even stronger.																								The change in Sachins body language, one understands, had everything to do with Dravids praiseworthy decision to have a one-to-one with him.																								According to The Telegraphs sources, he either spoke to Sachin late last night or early this morning, before they left the Holiday Inn for the stadium.																								That an interaction had taken place was confirmed by Dravid himself when two members of the touring party approached him in the dressing room, intending to organise a quick face-to-face with Sachin before Day III got underway.																								Dravid, one learns, eased the duos tension by revealing he had already spoken to Sachin and that misgivings, if any, were cleared. Relieved, the gentlemen must have said a thanksgiving-prayer.																								Of course, Dravid wasnt obliged to explain anything  including the timing of the declaration. That he took the initiative to blow out growing heartburn, as one source put it, speaks much about the non-cricket qualities he possesses. He scores highly there, too.																								The touring party was stunned by Sachins unusually pointed comments on the declaration. Now, everybody ought to breathe easy.																								Sachin and Dravid had a nice chat. Actually, Sachin didnt really mean to question the declaration. His remarks were influenced by his being somewhat upset, explained another source.																								Incidentally, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq bluntly stated he wouldnt have declared had any of his batsmen been so close to a double. Every team has its strategy, so I wouldnt like to talk about what the Indians did. In principle, though, I wouldnt have called anybody in. Main do sau banane deta. quot;																								Pakistan, meanwhile, is gasping at 364 for six, replying to Indias 675 for five declared. They need another 112 to make India bat again -- a tall order given that only Abdul Razzaq and Saqlain Mushtaq can seriously push towards saving the follow-on.																								Inzamam, however, hasnt lost hope: Despite the enormous pressure, we batted well and were positive. If this effort continues, we should be able to make India bat again. Im proud of my players, who didnt get weighed down by the pressure of 675.																								The captain himself contributed a classy 77, while the gifted Yasir Hameed (batting at No.3) fell for 91 excellent runs. Inzamam, though, didnt appear pleased with Simon Taufels verdict.																								Among the bowlers, Irfan Pathan was the pick. However, as the Test progresses, Anil Kumble should be the most difficult to tackle. Or, even, Sachin.																								FOOTNOTE: If Multans district coordination officer (the most important bureaucrat in these parts) is to be believed, the ongoing series is fixed. Specifically, this is what he had to say: One of the reasons for a low turnout is that theres a perception the series is fixed. Even Ive... Thankfully, he clarified that he was just going by the public perception. But, by then, he had caused enough damage.

 															- Bill Clinton shares Grammy with Gorbachev and Sophia Loren K.P. NAYAR				 Not for his music  Washington, Feb. 9: If  five wins for half-Indian Norah Jones was the big surprise  of last years Grammy awards, last nights surprise at the  46th annual Grammys was the winner himself: former US President  Bill Clinton.																								And to cap the surprise, Clinton shared his win with former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.																								At one point during the glittering ceremony in Los Angeles, it appeared that politicians were invading the exclusive world of entertainment.																								One nominee who lost out was Clintons wife, New Yorks junior senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton.																								But she ought not have any regrets. In the years before she went into active politics and was forced to give in to special interests and Americas Jewish lobby to succeed, senator Clinton had bagged her own Grammy.																								Eight years ago, she was awarded a Grammy for the reading of her book It Takes a Village. 																								Her husbands win this year was in the category of Best Spoken Word Album for Children. The former President and Gorbachev, along with actress Sophia Loren, shared the Grammy for lending their voice to the Russian folk tale Peter and the Wolf. 																								The recording of the musical tale was in honour of the legendary Russian pianist, Sergei Prokofiev, who died 50 years ago, last year.																								Last nights Grammys took place in the shadow of singer Janet Jacksons wardrobe malfunction during a break in Americas most watched TV sports event, the Super Bowl night, 10 days ago.																								Justin Timberlake, her partner on the stage who ripped off her garment and exposed one breast, apologised at the Grammy awards for the incident.																								I apologise if you guys were offended, he said in his second apology since the event.																								CBS, which televised the Grammys and the Super Bowl Halftime Show, put in place a five-minute delay on its live telecast last night to avoid any repetition of the Jackson episode.																								Timberlakes apology came in response to a demand from the TV network. Jackson declined an invitation to apologise-and-appear on the show. Timberlake accepted.																								If that was politic, politics was not far behind at the Grammys in an election year dominated by the war in Iraq, tax cuts for the wealthiest and onslaughts on Americas civil liberties.																								Hillary Clinton was beaten to the award by author Al Franken, whose bestseller, Lies And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them won in the category for the Best Spoken Word Album.																								The book, which the author describes as a fair and balanced look at the right trashes Paul Wolfowitz, an architect of the Bush war in Iraq, Karl Rove, the Presidents chief political strategist and other leading lights of the American right.

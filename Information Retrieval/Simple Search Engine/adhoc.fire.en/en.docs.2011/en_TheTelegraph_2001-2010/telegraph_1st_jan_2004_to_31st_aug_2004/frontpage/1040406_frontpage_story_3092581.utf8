 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Yuvraj leads charge of the Young Turks
 															- Prospects of making way for Sourav do not worry centurion saviour LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Yuvraj Singh raises his bat after completing his maiden century in Lahore on Monday. (PTI)Lahore, April 5: On either side, it was a day for the Young Turks at the Gaddafi: Umar Gul rocked Team India with a career-best five for 31 and Yuvraj Singh authored a personal Test high of 112. Add Irfan Pathans career-best 49 and an extraordinary picture gets completed.																								The talking point at the start of the second Test was, of course, Rahul Dravids decision to bat on a greenish wicket with moisture. Yet, Gul and Yuvraj turned the spotlight on themselves, with Pathan not far behind. Among others, the latter was cheered by his parents, Mohammed and a burqa-clad Sameem Bano.																								Thanks to a mix of good deliveries and injudicious shots, the Indians were down for the count at seven for 147, but Yuvraj and Pathan  playing their third and fourth Test, respectively,  ensured a reasonably competitive total: 287.																								Given Pakistans appalling overrate, which doesnt speak highly of their strategy, stumps was pushed back by around 50 minutes and the floodlights became operational. By close, the hosts reached 61 for one in 23 overs.																								Just yesterday, Yuvraj had told The Telegraph he wished to make an impact in Test cricket. He did exactly that and actually taught a lesson to his peers. He counter-attacked superbly and inspired the gutsy Pathan to play a gem of an innings.																								More than that, Yuvraj brought some relief to Dravid, who would have been crucified had the tail not wagged appreciably. The stand-in captain, therefore, stands indebted to Yuvraj and Pathan, who creamed off 117 for the eighth wicket and, for almost two hours, put Pakistans version of the huddle on hold.																								Ironically, despite such a fine maiden hundred, Yuvraj will probably have to be dropped  unless a different permutation is thought of  once regular captain Sourav Ganguly returns. That doesnt worry me.... Im happy with whatever chances come my way, he insisted.																								Frankly, Dravid took the right decision as the much-vaunted line-up has to deliver in trying conditions. Moreover, the move wasnt much different from Souravs at Headingley, in 2002. That wicket wasnt as green, but the overcast conditions made life difficult. However, Sanjay Bangar stood firm and allowed the stalwarts to score big. India won by an innings.																								Had Dravid not opted to bat (after calling heads), he would surely have been slammed for being defensive. 																								At times, then, captains do get into no-win situations. Inzamam-ul Haq didnt mind losing the toss as he wanted to bowl.																								What would I have done? Well, if I had faith in my batsmen  and India, dont forget, declared at 675 for five in their last innings  I would have batted, opined former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja, currently the boards chief executive.																								Yuvraj, the toast of the Indian dressing room, acknowledged that staying till the end was a priority  fact is, he was the last out. It became a pressure game because of the earlier batsmen, but I decided to play the way I do.... Irfans support was a boon, allowing me to continue my natural way....																								Emotionally dedicating his effort to his parents (Shabnam and Yograj), who have separated, Yuvraj said: They have backed me the most.... At this moment, more than anybody else, Im grateful to them.																								Yuvraj appeared to have strained his left hamstring towards the end of his innings, but informed he would take the field tomorrow. The heat notwithstanding, he isnt one to miss out on action.

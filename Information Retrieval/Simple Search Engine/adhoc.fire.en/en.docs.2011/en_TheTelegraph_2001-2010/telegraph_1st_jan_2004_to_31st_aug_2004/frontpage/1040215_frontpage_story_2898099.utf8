The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 Hint of two-part trip split by poll
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Feb. 14: While the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has got the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments unconditional okay for the Revival Series, it shouldnt surprise if the Tests and ODIs are scheduled on either side of the general elections.																								Of course, one isnt suggesting that the BCCI has struck a deal. However, according to The Telegraphs sources, three factors cant exactly be discounted.																								First, while in Pakistan, the players wont be able to tolerate the siege-like atmosphere beyond a point. Then, they can do without a lengthy (and very taxing) tour within weeks of a hugely demanding one in Australia. And, finally, the BCCI may still make a gesture towards the home ministry, which is deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advanis fief.																								Although everybody in the corridors of power is now singing in unison, its no secret that Advani favoured a postponement till after the elections.																								Nobody will go on record, but indications are the home ministry leaks were actually aimed at sending a message to the BCCI. Essentially, that the Jagmohan Dalmiya-headed body announce a unilateral deferment without seeking a written advisory.																								The BCCI didnt play ball as doing so would have exposed it to claims possibly in excess of Rs 50 crore from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). At the same time, it dutifully maintained the governments decision would be respected.																								Now that the BCCI has got what it wanted, sources feel it wont be a bad idea if some regard is shown to the views initially expressed  albeit unofficially  by the Advani-headed ministry.																								However, for that to happen, the BCCI must first initiate a dialogue with Shaharyar Khan and Co. Perhaps, even the PCB wont mind hosting Team India twice over a specified period.																								 In fact, security agencies across the border should be more at ease with such an arrangement.																								Meanwhile, captain Sourav Ganguly has confirmed his availability. He said so during an exclusive chat before leaving for Lucknow this afternoon.																								Dalmiya, for his part, declared that nobody is going to be forced if he doesnt feel comfortable making the trip. After all, well be playing cricket, not fighting a war, he pointed out. The itinerary will be ready within  a week, after Dalmiyas return from an ICC meeting in London.

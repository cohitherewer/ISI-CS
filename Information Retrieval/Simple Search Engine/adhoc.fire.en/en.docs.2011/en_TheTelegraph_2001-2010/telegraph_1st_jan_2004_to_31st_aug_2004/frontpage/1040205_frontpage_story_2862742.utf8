Chief of army staff Gen. .C. Vij said here the camps of the Ulfa and other militant outfits like the KLO in Assam would be neutralised during the next two months. The Royal Bhutan Army had destroyed most of their camps in the Himalayan kingdom, he added.																								Gen. Vij said the recent operations against the outfits had made them extremely weak. He said that beginning of talks between Delhi and the NSCN (I-M) was a positive sign and hoped that the other rebel groups would follow the example.

Of the 1,000 people, about 350 surrendered to the army in North Bengal or Bhutan and 70 of them surrendered to the police, Gen. Vij said. 																								He, however, said there were some camps of the outfits in Myanmar and Bangladesh. But the bulk of their camps was in Bhutan. We will clear their remaining camps in Assam within the next couple of months. We have evidence that these outfits are going through a very bad phase in Assam, the chief of army staff said. Nearly 1,000 pieces of arms along with a large cache of ammunition had also been seized during the operations, he said.																								Gen. Vij today became the first chief of army staff in the country to commission a battleship.

 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Baby and threat for slapped woman
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 6: The birth of a baby boy early this morning was no relief for Sandhya and her husband Shontu Mondol as their harassment continued with a section of junior doctors at NRS Medical College and Hospital issuing veiled threats to the couple to withdraw all charges against them.																								After all, the welfare of the baby and the sick mother is in their hands. 																								Yesterday, the 27-year-old, admitted to the gynaecology ward, was slapped across her face and ear, causing bleeding and temporary deafness, to induce labour and make her cooperate. 																								Early today, even as Sandhya was delivering her baby, some junior doctors took her husband aside and pressured him to drop the charges against the guilty. Shontu later complained to the hospital authorities who assured him that utmost care would be taken of the newborn and the mother.																								The baby is underweight and has been put in an incubator. We have told her the reality and the fact that the possibility of her losing the baby exists, though we will do our best to save him, said P.K. Banerjee, under whom she was admitted.																								The hospital has identified the person who Sandhya said had slapped her as post-graduate trainee Supratik Basu. Basu, who has denied the charge, was barred from treating any patient and faces a three-member disciplinary committee that will decide his fate tomorrow. 																								D.K. Jha, the superintendent of the hospital, said: His denial makes no difference. We have enough evidence against him. Appropriate action will be taken tomorrow after the inquiry team gives its report. 																								A medical team conducted a test on Sandhyas right ear where the slap had landed. The blow has aggravated an earlier ailment she had been suffering from, a doctor said. 																								Shontu said there is a constant buzz in her ear which hurts if someone speaks loudly.Whatever the patient seems to have alleged appeared true. Her ear, lips and cheek were swollen. But she is being given adequate treatment now. I have assured her that the guilty doctor will be dealt with strongly, Jha said.

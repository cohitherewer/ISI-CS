 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Natwar salve on hostage father
 SEEMA GUHA				 	 Bains at Natwar Singhs residence on Saturday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, July 24: His son in the clutches of guerrillas somewhere in Iraq, Ram Murti Bains sat quietly in a corner of Natwar Singhs office and waited. Outside, scores of scribes and television crew jostled, not willing to miss a rare photo-op.																								Working lunch with Myanmar counterpart finally over, in strode foreign minister Singh. Quick to seize the moment, he pulled up a chair, positioned it in the middle of the courtyard and clambered on top of it.																								We are as concerned as you are, they are our sons, too, and we are doing everything possible to free them, he boomed at the man in the green turban as the TV cameras zoomed in, on minister, chair and all.

Calling out to ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna, Singh told him he should immediately get in touch with the PMO. Singhal looked pleased as punch, having already set up Bains date with the President.																								In the evening, not only did Bains get to speak to Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, too, made time for him. The President assured us that efforts are on to being back the hostages, Bains said.																								Late tonight, the government appealed to the abductors through TV networks in Iraq, Kuwait, Oman and other Gulf countries to let off the hostages.																								In a statement, the Kuwait and Gulf Link Transport Company employing the trio said: The company reaffirms that it is ready to take any measure to ensure the release of the hostages and it is negotiating with the kidnappers...

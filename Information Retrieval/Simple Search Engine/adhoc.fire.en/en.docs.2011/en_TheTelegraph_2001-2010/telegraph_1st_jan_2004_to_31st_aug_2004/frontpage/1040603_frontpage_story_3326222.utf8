 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 MP hats off to a topi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 2: Turbans and a topi ruled the day in the Lok Sabha today. Thats not to say, though, there were no other head-turners on the first day of the new House.																								Hat of the day: The award goes to M.A.A. Fatmi, a member of Laloo Prasads party. He came in a bright pink cap, with a feather tuck in. Even Sonia Gandhi was seen asking Laloo Prasad about this feather in his cap.																								Sartorial surprise of the day: In a white bandhgala suit, Somnath Chatterjee was the clear winner. Its not fashion, but convention, said the new Speaker, thats on his mind. Traditionally, Speakers have worn this uniform.																								Hero of the day: Manmohan Singh? Sonia Gandhi? Well, think again. Govinda may have missed the best-dressed award, very smart though he looked in a white ensemble, but the ladies had eyes only for him. Policewomen outside wanted to be clicked with him. And inside, a lady member of Opposition called out MP No. 1 as Govinda took oath.																								Deserter of the day: Calling Raghuvansh Prasad Singh a deserter may be a little unkind, but Laloo Prasads second man in the cabinet had a foot in the Opposition door. Poor man. Hes so used to sitting among the have-nots that he walked into the House from the Opposition side.																								Winner of the day: For A. Narendra, sides dont matter because hes always on the right side. In the last House, as a BJP member he sat on the treasury benches. This time, as a Telengana Rashtra Samiti MP, he continues to sit there. Smart.																								Loser of the day: Laxman Singhs luck hasnt changed. Former MP chief minister Digvijay Singhs brother was with the Congress when it was in Opposition and is now with the BJP. Forever a loser.																								Herd of the day: Actors Vinod Khanna, Dharmendra and Jaya Prada stuck to each other, though the lady belongs to a different party. Dharmendra and Khanna, both of the BJP, and Jaya Prada, a Samajwadi member, were seen exchanging notes even. Is another BJP-Samajwadi affair in the air?																								Disappointment of the day: Raghunath Jha wanted to take oath in Bhojpuri but couldnt its not an official language. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi chose Bengali. And, to much applause, Sonia said her vows in Hindi.

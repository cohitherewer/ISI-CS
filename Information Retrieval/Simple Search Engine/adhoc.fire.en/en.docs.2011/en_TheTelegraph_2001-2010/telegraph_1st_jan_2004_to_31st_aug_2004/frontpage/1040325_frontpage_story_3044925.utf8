 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTLahore, March 24: Usually, after a win, Sourav Ganguly thanks the deities and begins planning for a collective celebration. At the Gaddafi tonight, he was initially preparing to leave for the best medical facility for an assessment of his right lower back injury.																								Sourav hurt himself trying to stop an Inzamam-ul Haq drive. Though he was stretchered off, he headed for the pitch  wearing a supportive belt  once the last wicket was taken and history authored.																								Later, Sourav said he would undergo a scan first thing in the morning. Having managed to walk with pain-killing injections, he added the area was numb and that the pain would surely return once the injections effect was over.																								According to Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, the manager, Sourav had been desperate to resume captaincy in the last few overs. Persuading him to stay put in the dressing room wasnt easy, he told The Telegraph.

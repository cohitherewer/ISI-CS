The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 One Rahul roots for another
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHIKarachi, March 13: For a while this morning, the Rahul Dravids were upstaged by siblings Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka. The latters husband, Robert Vadra, was around too and the trios every movement at the National Stadium evoked attention worthy of the hottest stars in Bollywood and Lollywood.																								Of course, also very visible were about a dozen SPG personnel, who sanitised the areas visited by the lovely Priyanka and Co. Stop No. 1 was Pakistan board chairman Shaharyar Khans box and, then, came a brief contact with the janata. Later, they sat in the press gallery for well over an hour.																								At the break, it was back to the chairmans hospitality.																								The cricket bit apart, the visit had an element of a public relations exercise. And, if the response (of the public and the media) is an indication, the salwar-kameez sporting Priyanka starred in a blockbuster.																								Despite having gradually emerged a public figure, Priyanka remains very shy. In fact, when The Telegraph asked (in the chairmans box) whether she had a favourite in Team India, her initial response was a smile only. 																								Its when the question was repeated that Priyanka said: Actually, Im for the entire team but, if you insist, I reckon its Sachin Tendulkar Elder brother Rahul was more reticent. However, he too picked Sachin as his favourite.																								The trio, by the way, came armed with the Tricolour and the India hat. While Robert, wearing a suit as opposed to Rahuls shirt-trouser combination, seemed to cheer more vociferously, Priyanka quite enjoyed holding up the Tricolour.																								As first reported in these columns, they have been accorded state guest status. They return home from here itself.

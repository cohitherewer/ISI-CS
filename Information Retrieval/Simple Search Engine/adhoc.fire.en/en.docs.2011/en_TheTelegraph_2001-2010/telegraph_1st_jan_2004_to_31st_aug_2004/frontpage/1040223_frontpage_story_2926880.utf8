 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Malda, Feb. 22: The chief judicial magistrate of the district court, Dibakar Das, was arrested this morning on charges of molesting a state civil services officer and passing lewd comments at another.																								The two women, residents of Calcutta staying in Malda for year-long training in administrative and legal procedures, filed separate complaints at Englishbazar police station last night, a day after the alleged harassment took place. 																								The magistrate was later released on bail. District judge Alok Mukhopadhyay today said he has sent a report to the high court.																								The additional district superintendent of police, Manoranjan Saha, said deputy police superintendent Swapan Biswas is probing the charges. 																								One of the WBCS officers said in her written statement that on Friday night she spied someone outside the window of her flat in the Mahesmati state government residential complex. The person banged on her door shouting he was Dibakar Das and wanted to come in. I did not open the door and he came around to the window, passed lewd remarks and went away, she said. She lives in a block next to that of Das. 																								The second woman said in her complaint that around 9.55 pm on Friday, someone rang the doorbell. 																								I opened the door and saw Dibakar Das standing on the doorway. He rushed in and held me in strong embrace. He was reeking of alcohol. I began to struggle and shout. I managed to jostle him towards the door, push him out on the landing and shut the door, wrote the woman, who lives in the same block as Das.																								Sources said the women contacted leaders of the WBCS officers association in Calcutta on Saturday after they were asked by some of the district officials to mutually settle the matter with Das. They went ahead and filed the FIRs. 																								The complainants refused to comment when contacted in their quarters. Please go and ask the district magistrate, we are not going to make any comment, they said. 																								Das, who sat inside the Englishbazar police station officer-in-charges chamber for five hours after his arrest, did not speak to anyone. When a police jeep brought him back to the complex at noon, the magistrate, on seeing a group of journalists, rushed into the building.

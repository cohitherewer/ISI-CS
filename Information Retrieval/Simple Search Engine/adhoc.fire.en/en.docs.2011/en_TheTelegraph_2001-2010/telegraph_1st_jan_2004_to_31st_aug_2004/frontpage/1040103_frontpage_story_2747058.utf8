The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Blaster gives way to grafter
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sydney, Jan. 2: Less than  a week ago, Sachin Tendulkar didnt have the confidence  to take guard with a few overs remaining (on the third afternoon)  at the MCG. Today, at the SCG, he posted his best for this  four-Test series and looked good for more.																								At stumps on Day I, Sachin was unbeaten on 73  his highest since 176 at the Eden Gardens, versus the West Indies, in November 2002. More than the artist within, its the craftsman which dictated  whatever, nobody complained.																								India, of course, reached 284 for three. Given that the series is 1-1, Sourav Ganguly couldnt have hoped for a much better platform.																								Usually, Sachin doesnt talk during an innings. But, on returning to the team hotel (and his family, including in-laws), he did briefly speak to The Telegraph. 																								Yes, its definitely a good feeling.... Feels nice to have spent time at the wicket.... he said, indicating that those few words were enough.																								Among other things, Sachin is bound to make the Australians think hard overnight. Coach John Buchanan, though, attempted not to be too impressed. For somebody with a high average (56-plus at the start of this series), the law suggested he would get a big score.... He has weathered the storm and batted the longest thus far in any of the four Tests, he observed.																								Significantly, Sachin is within reach of his 32nd century, which will put him on a par with Steve Waugh. With 34 to his credit, Sunil Gavaskar remains the numero uno.

 															- Vegetable coaches from Bihar, healthcare without doctors next door  OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Laloo Prasad on a special train on the way to Delhi from Patna. Picture by Deepak KumarPatna, June 6: Laloo Prasad Yadavs gravy train will travel loaded with vegetables, he has promised.																								The railway minister  not of Bihar, as he has declared, but of all of India  intends to hitch special coaches to trains heading to Delhi and Calcutta that will carry vegetables from his home state.																								Not only will our poor farmers be able to extend their trade and get higher prices for their produce, but the people of the two cities can also enjoy fresh vegetables, he said. 																								Difficult to fault the reason or the rhyme  rich cities feed on fresh ladys fingers grown by poor farmers of Bihar. Why didnt some other railway minister, sitting as they do in the drivers seat of one of the greatest vehicles of development in history, think of this?																								Many of them, like Laloo Prasad, came from Bihar and only thought of new lines or trains or at best  such as immediate predecessor Nitish Kumar  setting up regional railway headquarters in their backyard. Not that splitting Eastern Railway to establish a hub at Hajipur  other than the traditional one in Calcutta  helped him in Barh. Kumar lost the seat but won from Nalanda. 																								Gravy trains, those that carry concessions, they ran too. Nothing else is expected from rail ministers. But since taking charge, Laloo Prasad has been making suggestions that are, well, innovative.																								First he said instead of plastic cups, earthen pots will be used on the railways to serve tea or coffee  apparently this is already being done in places in Bihar. He hinted at the possibility of extending his environment-friendliness to food packets  use leaves, he said.																								Now, the brinjal bogie.																								Its not that the minister doesnt care about the railways core responsibility of ensuring safe, punctual and clean travel.																								Yesterday, he travelled by a special train from Chhapra, one of the two seats from where he won the election, on an inspection tour, it seems. The journey may have been by a special train, he said, but that did not deter him from alighting at several stations to check the facilities out.																								He told party legislators at a meeting later that his agenda would be to make the railways clean and punctual. 																								Safety is quite something else. The ministers trip followed by a few days another of those routine train dacoities in Bihar on the Doon Express bound for Calcutta. Trains from Bihar carrying radishes rather than robbers might be a preferred option for many.																								Before taking off for Delhi, Laloo Prasad emphasised that he meant every word he said. The ministry has already been directed to make provisions for special vegetable coaches.																								India does not begin and end in Bihar  he emphasised that too. Laloo Prasad said he was equally concerned about states which have failed to get enough railway benefits since Independence.																								He promised to assess the conditions in these states and review projects in consultation with MPs of these states. From the response in his state, it appears the minister could get into some unexpected trouble there.																								If vegetable growers are to get their own coaches, why not the Yadavs  Laloo Prasads own caste of milkmen? 																								Why dont we demand special AC coaches to transport milk, doesnt he (Laloo Yadav) know milk gets spoilt in the heat? vendors were overheard speaking at Patna Junction last night.

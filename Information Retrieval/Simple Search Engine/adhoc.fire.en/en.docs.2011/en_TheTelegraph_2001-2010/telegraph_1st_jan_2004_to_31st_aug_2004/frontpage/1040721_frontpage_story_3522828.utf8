 Wednesday, July 21, 2004 				 Peace in pipeline, not bus link
 PRANAY SHARMA																								Islamabad, July 20: The proposed Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus might not bridge the gulf between the two Kashmirs, at least not in a hurry. But it looks as if the peace pipeline  the overland route through Pakistan to ferry Iranian gas to India might see the light of day sooner.																								The South Asian neighbours have clarified their positions ahead of the meeting between K. Natwar Singh and Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri tomorrow. The Pakistan foreign minister is slated to host a breakfast meeting for his Indian counterpart.																								No specific proposal has yet been made on the gas pipeline, but of late Pakistan has been stressing on energy as the key area of cooperation. 																								We welcome the emphasis being given to develop closer collaboration among Saarc states in the field of energy, Kasuri said. Pakistan has proposed the creation of a South Asia energy forum and the setting up of a Saarc energy centre.																								Singh is scheduled to meet Pervez Musharraf on Friday. He called on the Pakistan President today along with Saarc foreign ministers, but Fridays meeting will be an exclusive session.

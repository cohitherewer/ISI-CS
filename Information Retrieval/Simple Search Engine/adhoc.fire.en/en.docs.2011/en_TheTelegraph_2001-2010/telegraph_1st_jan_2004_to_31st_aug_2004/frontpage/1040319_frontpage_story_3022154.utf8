 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 War action replay in Peshawar
 															- How was that chuck at Shoaib?  INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly in Peshawar on Thursday. (AFP) 																								Peshawar, March 18: A war is raging some 250 km from here and a storm is gathering over the ground here  over Shoaib Akhtars bowling action.																								The fearsome fast bowler opened his mouth for the first time, two days after Indian captain Sourav Gangulys statement questioning the legality of his bowling action without saying so in so many words.																								Ive thrice been cleared by the International Cricket Council, once legally by its technical committee. If someone is now questioning my action, he is challenging the ICC, Shoaib said on the eve of the third one-dayer here.																								Sourav is not going on the back foot. The skipper stuck to what he had said after the Rawalpindi match when asked about Shoaibs action.																								I was asked if he was chucking or not, Sourav said. I said: Youre all seeing it on TV. I dont need to answer that. Everyone knows the truth.																								Pakistan manager Haroon Rashid extended the teams full support to Shoaib at a news conference. Ganguly is entitled to his own opinion, he said.																								The ICC rules have found no fault with his action. If any individual doesnt want to agree, we dont wish to give much importance to that. We feel his bowling is fine and he is following the rules that govern a legal action.																								Yusuf Youhana said: We are only aiming for a victory. Weve no other thought in mind.																								We cant afford to be relaxed, was captain Inzamam-ul Haqs opinion.																								Having put the Pakistanis in some discomfort with his comment, Sourav brushed aside suggestions of being hamstrung by medium pacer Ashish Nehras injury. Why should we have any negative thought? You cant help it if Nehra is injured. Irfan (Pathan) has done well and we can always put them under pressure, he said.																								After the two shirtfronts in Karachi and Pindi, the wicket here has a hint of grass.																								Although it was clear the Pakistan side would not want to stoke the controversy  but at the same time could not keep quiet and swallow Souravs loaded comment  it is casting a shadow over tomorrows match. 																								Peshaar, as the citys name is pronounced locally, is in any case tense because of the intensifying military operation to flush out al Qaida and Taliban suspects from tribal regions in south Waziristan.																								Casualties are mounting with each passing day in Yana, a village in the tribal zone of the North West Frontier Province near Fartabad. Last night, there were even whispers of an air strike from the base located here. 																								FOOTNOTE: President Pervez Musharraf has paid the Rs 4,500 price of a ticket for the Pindi match he watched. The Pakistan Cricket Board is trying to end the complimentary culture.

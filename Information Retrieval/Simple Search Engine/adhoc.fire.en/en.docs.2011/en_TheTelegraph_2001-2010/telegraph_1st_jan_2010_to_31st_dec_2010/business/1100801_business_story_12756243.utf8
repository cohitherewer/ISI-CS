	Calcutta, July 31: The coal and environment ministries will meet in the third week of August to consider the classification of forests into go and no-go areas for Coal India Ltd (CIL).        
	CIL hopes the disagreement between the two ministries will be resolved soon.         
	You can expect a positive statement in a month or two. The issue is (over) building consensus, CIL chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya said here today on the sidelines of a programme organised by CII-Suresh Neotia Centre of Excellence.        
	The environment ministry had divided forest areas into go and no-go areas, depending on the tree cover. The move was opposed by Coal India, which found much of its mining area reduced.         
	The two ministries had been negotiating a relaxation in the criteria for the demarcation. The meeting was scheduled after the intervention of finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.         
	The coal ministry is pushing for a revised classification of forest land into go, no-go and may-go areas.         
	While mining will be prohibited in no-go areas, access to the may-go zones will be given after proper evaluation, a source said.         
	But the environment ministry should fast track clearances for the go areas so that mining can start at the earliest, the source added.

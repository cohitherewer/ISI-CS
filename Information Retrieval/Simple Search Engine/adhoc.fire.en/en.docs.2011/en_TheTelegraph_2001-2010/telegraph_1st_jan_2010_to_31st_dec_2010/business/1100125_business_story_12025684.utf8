          SOUNAK MITRA                                        
	Calcutta, Jan. 24: Calcutta is projected to offer better employment opportunities than Delhi and Mumbai.        
	The net employment outlook index for Calcutta in January-March has increased 13 points from the October-December quarter last year.         
	Delhi and Mumbai, however, slipped by 24 and 10 points, respectively, on the employment outlook index for January-March 2010.         
	Hyderabad, too, showed a decline of 22 points, global staffing firm TeamLease Services said in its latest study.        
	While Calcuttas net employment outlook increased 13 points to 47 points, the net business outlook has also increased 19 points to 58 points.         
	For Calcutta, infrastructure is the biggest contributor to employment growth, followed by manufacturing, engineering and pharmaceuticals, the study said.        
	Pune is leading the recovery in the job market with the highest increase of 50 points, followed by Chennai (20 points) and Bangalore (14 points).        
	The study, which covered 501 companies, focused on the employment growth potential, the business outlook and hiring forecasts.        
	The report serves as a reference for companies to understand the employment trend in major cities.         
	The study also indicates that India Inc remains cautious about hiring in the January-March period amid rising optimism.        
	Hiring sentiments have marginally improved this quarter in line with the industrys positive outlook. Our estimates show that there would be a leap of faith during the current quarter and trends will not just hold out, they will be bolder and result in higher employment gains, Rajesh AR, vice-president at TeamLease, said.        
	While the net business outlook index has increased 41 points for the January-March quarter, the employment outlook index at 47 points is just one per cent higher than the previous quarter.         
	Employers are cautious and are placing stronger emphasis on skill and employability. It must be noted that the intention to hire is still weak. The jitters have been shaken off, however, and the numbers are now likely to ramp up steadily, the vice-president said.        
	The hiring trend is on the rise for most sectors, except telecom and pharma.         
	The growth potential for IT-enabled services has risen the most, by 31 points.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ONGC to pitch for royalty sharing
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ONGC to pitch for royalty sharing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 11: State-owned ONGC is likely to approach the government seeking proportionate sharing of royalty on crude produced from Cairn Indias Rajasthan oilfields.        
	We have sought legal opinion on the royalty issue and expect to get a reply soon. We plan to move the oil ministry soon on the issue as the government had earlier promised to reimburse the royalty, a senior ONGC official said.        
	ONGC has sought the solicitor-generals opinion on whether it will have to continue to pay the entire royalty on the crude output in Rajasthan even after Vedanta Resources buys Cairn Energys stake in Cairn India.         
	While Cairn India has made huge profits from the project, ONGC has got negative returns on its investment because it has to pay cess and royalty on the entire production, including Cairn Indias portion. ONGC gets a 30 per cent share of crude from the Rajasthan fields, and Cairn owns the rest.        
	Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal today said the royalty payment is an issue between ONGC and the government. There is no question (of Vedanta paying royalty). The Government of India had contractually agreed to the liability, he said. ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said the government had assured the company that its royalty payout would be reimbursed.        
	The state-owned firm will feel the pinch of the royalty payout with the rise in production. According to earlier estimates of peak production at 175,000 barrels a day, ONGC will have to pay Rs 12,000 crore over the life of the Barmer field at an oil price of $60 a barrel. This is expected to go up further because the peak output has been revised to 240,000 barrels a day.        
	ONGC is likely to drop its objection to the Vedanta deal once the royalty issue is settled. The burden will be either passed on to the Centre or Vedanta may be asked to share the bill.        
	According to a government regulation in 1993, PSU companies were asked to bear the entire royalty burden to woo private companies to oil blocks. State-owned firms did not feel the impact in the beginning as the oil blocks had not started full operations.        
	On the Vedanta deal, a senior oil ministry official said regulatory issues surrounding the production sharing contracts covering Cairn Indias blocks would be sorted out by year-end. We have two-and-a-half months. That should be enough time to reach a decision. We responded (to Cairn Energy) that as per the production-sharing contract, they need government clearance, petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said.

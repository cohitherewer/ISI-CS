                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Canon bets big on small cities 
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Bharadwaj: Steps to success                                  
	New Delhi, June 26: Canon India is doing better business in small cities and towns.        
	We are clocking over 50 per cent of our revenue from smaller cities, which is expected to increase to 70 per cent in the next five years, Alok Bharadwaj, senior vice-president of Canon India, told The Telegraph.        
	Higher purchasing power and exposure to better photographic devices through use of mobile phones has opened a huge market in small cities that Canon is aiming to tap.        
	Only 3 per cent of Indian households have cameras compared with over 70 per cent overseas, according to industry data. There are only 6 million digital cameras for 230 million households in India.        
	With people getting access to cameras on their mobile phones, the necessity to purchase a better device has increased and we are trying to address that need, said Bharadwaj.        
	Analysts said Canon was also benefiting from the growing demand for single-lens reflex cameras as the customer base has spread from professionals and camera enthusiasts to casual users.        
	The Japanese camera maker, which is focused on expanding the market, has started a Canon on Wheels campaign to cover 38 towns spread over 18,000 kilometres by February 2011.         
	Seven trucks carrying Canon products will tour each of the towns for a week. These products will be displayed in mobile showrooms of 4,800-sq-ft area and are expected to see about 10,000 footfalls.        
	These roadshows give an opportunity to potential customers to experiment, touch and feel the devices and get a better understanding, said Bharadwaj. Through these roadshows, Canon is looking at a revenue of Rs 10 crore.

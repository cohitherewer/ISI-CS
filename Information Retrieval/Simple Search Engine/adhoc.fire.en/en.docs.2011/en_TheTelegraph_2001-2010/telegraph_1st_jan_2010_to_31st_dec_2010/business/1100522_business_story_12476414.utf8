The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Senate seal on Wall Street bill
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Senate seal on Wall Street bill
          DAVID M. HERSZENHORN                          CAUTION CALL                                  
	Washington, May 21: The Senate has approved a far-reaching financial regulatory bill, putting Congress on the brink of approving a broad expansion of government oversight of the increasingly complex banking system and financial markets.         
	The legislation is intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis, but also reshapes the role of numerous federal agencies and vastly empowers the Federal Reserve in an attempt to predict and contain future debacles.         
	The vote was 59 to 39, with four Republicans joining the Democratic majority in favour of the bill. Two Democrats opposed the measure, saying it was still not tough enough.         
	Democratic Congressional leaders and the Obama administration must now work to combine the Senate measure with a version approved by the House in December, a process that is expected to take several weeks. While there are important differences  notably a Senate provision that will force big banks to spin off some of their most lucrative derivatives business into separate subsidiaries  the bills are broadly similar, and it is virtually certain that Congress will adopt the most sweeping regulatory overhaul since the Great Depression.         
	Its a choice between learning from the mistakes of the past or letting it happen again, the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said. For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it didnt work.         
	The bill seeks to curb abusive lending, particularly in the mortgage industry, and to ensure that troubled companies, no matter how big or complex, can be liquidated at no cost to taxpayers. And it would create a financial stability oversight council to coordinate efforts to identify risks to the financial system. It would also establish new rules on the trading of derivatives and require hedge funds and most other private equity companies to register for regulation with the Securities and Exchange Commission.         
	Passage of the bill will be a signature achievement for the White House, nearly on a par with the recently enacted health care law. President Obama declared victory over the financial industry and hordes of lobbyists that had tried to kill the legislation.         
	The recession were emerging from was primarily caused by a lack of responsibility and accountability from Wall Street to Washington, Obama said, adding, Thats why I made passage of Wall Street reform one of my top priorities, so that a crisis like this does not happen again.         
	Obama also signalled that he would take a strong hand in developing the final bill, which could mean changes to the restrictive derivatives provisions the Senate measure includes and Wall Street opposes. It is also likely that the administration will try to remove an exemption in the House bill that will shield auto dealers from oversight by a new consumer protection agency.

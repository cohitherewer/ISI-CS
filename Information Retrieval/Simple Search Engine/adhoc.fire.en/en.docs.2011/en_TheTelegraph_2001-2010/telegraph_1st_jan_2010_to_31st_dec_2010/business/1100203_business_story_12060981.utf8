          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: The government may end Indian Oil Corporations monopoly in supplying petroleum products to Nepal, enabling the other state-owned refiners and private players to enter the Indian kingdom.        
	We are considering the issue  so far no decision has been taken, a senior petroleum ministry official said.        
	Nepals commerce and supplies minister Rajendra Mahato has recently written to the Indian government seeking revision in the agreement between IOC and Kathmandus state-run Nepal Oil Corporation Limited so that others from India can also do business.        
	Nepal is estimated to have an annual demand of 720,000 tonnes of diesel and 140,000 tonnes of petrol.        
	On the need to revise the agreement, Mahato said the Nepal government has decided to open up both the LPG and oil sectors.         
	While regulations have been drafted for the import and sale of LPG by the private sector, the government is working on similar regulations in oil.        
	Indian oil ministry officials confirmed that they have received a request from Kathmandu for a revision.        
	From its formation in 1970, Nepal Oil had an agreement with IOC to buy petroleum products.         
	According to the pact, Nepal Oil cannot buy from any other Indian company, while IOC can only sell to Nepal Oil.        
	IOC has reported a steep decline of 76.45 per cent in net profit at Rs 696.59 crore for the third quarter ended December.         
	Entry plea        
	Both state-owned refiners and private players such as Essar are lobbying the government for entry into Nepal.         
	Essar has also approached the Nepalese government. Sources in the company said, Discussions for both direct sales to refiners and retail business opportunity were held.        
	Sources said BPCL was keen to enter the Nepal market and was lobbying the oil ministry to amend the present notification that gives IOC a monopoly in the Himalayan kingdom.         
	BPCL is also keen to do away with the condition that restricts relationship only with Nepal Oil.        
	BPCL feels that as Nepal is opening up its economy, the requirement to deal only with one company should be done away with, and it should be free to carry out trade with any party in Nepal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Infosys numbers beat forecast
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Infosys numbers beat forecast
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                        
	Mumbai, Jan 12: Infosys Technologies beat the Streets estimates once again by posting a net profit of Rs 1582 crore in the third quarter ended December 31  and topped it off with a forecast of a 3.6 to 3.8 per cent increase in revenues for the full year ended March 31.         
	The infotech giant, which counts Goldman Sachs, BP and the BT group as its clients, said full-year income was expected to be in the range of Rs 22,473 crore to Rs 22,519 crore.        
	In dollar terms, it said revenues could rise by as much as 2 per cent to $ 4.76 billion.        
	The tide has clearly turned.         
	While announcing the second quarter results in October last year, Infosys had forecast full year income to be in the range of Rs 21,961 crore to Rs 22,055 crore, translating into a year-on-year growth of 1.2 to 1.7 per cent.        
	At the end of the second quarter, it had forecast full year dollar-denominated revenues of $ 4.6 to $ 4.62 billion, which would have meant a 1.3 per cent year-on-year decline.        
	Infosys earns 98.8 per cent of its revenues from outside India.         
	The latest forecast underpinned hopes of a surge in software orders, prompting analysts to revise their earnings estimates for the sector as a whole in 2010 after a subdued period last year.        
	The consolidated net profit of Rs 1582 crore in the third quarter marked a decline of 3.6 per cent over the corresponding period last year. However, analysts had expected the Bangalore-based company to report a net profit in the region of Rs 1470 crore, a drop of over 4.5 per cent.        
	The Infosys stock registered its biggest gain in two months as it closed at Rs 2587.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today, a gain of 3.97 per cent or Rs 98.90. The BSE IT index led the list of gainers, ending with a rise of 3.91 per cent.        
	Even though IT budgets are expected to be flat in 2010, offshore outsourcing is expected to benefit from the global economic recovery, said S. Gopalakrishnan, CEO and managing director.        
	Bank of America-Merrill Lynch upgraded Infosys to buy from underperform after the company announced its full-year forecast.        
	Shashi Bhusan, IT analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher who has put out an accumulate rating on the stock, said Infosys was able to post better than expected numbers during the third quarter as the banking, financial services amp; insurance (BFSI) sector had performed well. The big surprise was the robust showing by the telecom vertical.        
	The company also witnessed a strong volume growth and a pricing uptick during the period. As a result of the higher pricing, margins improved to 35.5 per cent from 34.6 per cent in the corresponding period last year.        
	The financial services segment has been the largest contributor to the Infosys topline, accounting for roughly 35 per cent of the revenues. Manufacturing is next in the pecking order, followed by telecom and retail.        
	However, Infosys gave a muted guidance for the fourth quarter ending March 31. Analysts said this was in line with the companys conservative outlook. Infosys said fourth quarter income was expected to be in the range of Rs 5675 crore to Rs 5721 crore, a year-on-year growth of 0.7 to 1.5 per cent.        
	Infosys said along with its subsidiaries, it had hired 8,719 employees in the December quarter. After taking into account attrition and other factors, its net addition stood at 4,429 employees. The company has 1,09,882 employees on its rolls.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      US job hope in India progress
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Anand Sharma, Montek Singh Ahluwalia: Assuring                                 
	Mumbai, Nov. 6: Two of Indias best-known policy makers today extolled the advantages of doing business with a country that is on the cusp of a 10 per cent GDP growth  which will lead to the creation of jobs in the worlds most powerful economy.        
	Union commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, said India  with its strong growth rate  provided productive opportunities to business houses from the US.        
	The strong sales pitch was made to a galaxy of global corporate leaders that included Jeffrey Immelt, chairman amp; CEO of General Electric, Indra Nooyi, chairperson amp; CEO of PepsiCo, Louis Chenevert, chairman amp; CEO of United Technologies Corporation, and Dave Cote, chairman amp; CEO of Honeywell.        
	In a special address at the US-Indian Business and Entrepreneurship Summit, held in Mumbais Trident Hotel at Nariman Point, Ahluwalia said Indias GDP would grow around 8.5 per cent in the current fiscal. But the expectation is that this would climb next year to 9 per cent  a level at which Indias growth engines hummed for four straight years before the global financial crisis erupted in 2008.        
	Ahluwalia added that the Prime Minister had targeted a growth rate of 10 per cent for the Twelfth Five Year Plan that begins in 2012. He said this was achievable even though the country would have to strive hard to achieve it.        
	According to Ahluwalia, while the growth in global economy is coming back, some of the advanced nations will not be able to recover the premier positions that they held a few years back. He said a slow moving global economy could impact emerging countries as there would be less demand for exports.         
	However, one big advantage for India given such a context is that it is not dependent on export demand as is the case with many other countries in the region.        
	Sharma, who also delivered a special address at the summit, concentrated on the critical issue of job creation. Sharma said one of the key contributions of corporate India to the US was the creation of over 314,000 direct jobs in America over the last five years.         
	For every $1 billion order of aircraft, nearly 10,000 jobs are created, he said, adding that with more aircraft deals in the pipeline, more than 250,000 jobs could be created.        
	On outsourcing, Sharma said: For every one job created through outsourcing, two higher value jobs are created in the principal country.

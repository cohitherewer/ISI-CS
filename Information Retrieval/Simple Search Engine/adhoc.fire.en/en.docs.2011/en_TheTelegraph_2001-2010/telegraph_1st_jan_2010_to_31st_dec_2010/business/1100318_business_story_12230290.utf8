          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Money Magic                                  
	New Delhi, March 17: Details of the governments Rs 16,500-crore capital infusion programme in PSU banks will be available by next month.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said in the budget that Rs 16,500 crore would be provided to PSU banks to achieve a minimum tier-I capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent by March 2011.        
	Bank of Maharashtra, Central Bank and Dena Bank are among the probable beneficiaries. Indian Overseas Bank, Syndicate Bank, Uco Bank and IDBI Bank are also likely to be on the list.        
	We will look at the credit flow (of public sector banks) at the end of March. After that we will look at capital-to-risk (weighted) asset ratio and tier-I capital to understand the capital requirements, financial services secretary R. Gopalan told reporters.        
	Of the Rs 16,500 crore, Rs 9,600 crore is likely to be infused by May, finance ministry officials said.         
	State-run banks will need another Rs 38,000 crore over the next two years. The government had infused Rs 1,900 crore in 2008-09 to maintain the tier-I capital of four public sector banks. According to the Reserve Bank of India, the minimum capital adequacy ratio of banks should be 9 per cent with a tier-I capital adequacy ratio of at least 6 per cent.        
	The move is expected to provide an impetus to public sector banks to increase lending to infrastructure, agriculture and other priority sectors.         
	Capital adequacy refers to the funds that banks have to set aside for every Rs 100 they lend. As on December 31, 2009 the tier-I capital ratio of at least four banks was less than 8 per cent. These are Uco (6.5 per cent), IDBI (6.6 per cent), Bank of Maharashtra and Central Bank of India (7.14 per cent).         
	Last year, the World Bank approved a $2-billion loan to enhance public sector banks capital.        
	Gopalan also said there was no plan to bar banks from entering non-core activities such as insurance and mutual funds.

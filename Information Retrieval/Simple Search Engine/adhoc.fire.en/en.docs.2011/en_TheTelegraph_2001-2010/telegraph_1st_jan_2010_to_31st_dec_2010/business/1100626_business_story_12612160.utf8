          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 25: The government today said it would assign wireless broadband spectrum within a week, enabling operators to roll out high-speed Internet services by July-end.        
	Broadband wireless access spectrum would be given to all the six winners within a week along with the letters of intent to start commercial services, said Ashok Chandra, wireless adviser to the department of telecommunications.        
	Revenues from the sale of 20 megahertz of broadband air waves for two slots in each of the 22 telecom circles are Rs 38,543 crore. The auction ended earlier this month.        
	The spectrum for third-generation mobile services  the government earned Rs 67,719 crore from its auctions that ended in May  will be given in September.        
	Anant Nahata-promoted Infotel Broadband Services Private Limited was the only firm to win a pan-India licence to offer broadband data services. Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries holds a majority stake in Infotel.        
	The other winners include Bharti Airtel, Qualcomm, Aircel, Tikona Digital Networks and Augere (Mauritius).        
	Broadband wireless spectrum allows companies to offer Internet with speeds up to 3 megabits per second (Mbps) and real-time data services such as video-on-demand and mobile TV.        
	Analysts said operators could eventually use the bandwidth for mobile voice services through Internet telephony, amid uncertainty over the grant of radio waves.        
	The spectrum can also be used to provide fourth-generation technologies such as long-term evolution (LTE), which can offer data transfer speeds of up to 10 Mbps.         
	Service providers should be able to get more data transferred out of their network and lower the cost of operations.        
	The government is pushing to increase broadband use. Only 9 million of the countrys more than one billion people have access to Internet.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India recently floated a consultation paper on developing a national broadband plan in which it said that tariffs offered by operators were still high because of a lack of competition.        
	Broadband spectrum is expected to give a boost to Internet connectivity in the country.         
	The country has set a target of 20 million broadband connections by 2010.

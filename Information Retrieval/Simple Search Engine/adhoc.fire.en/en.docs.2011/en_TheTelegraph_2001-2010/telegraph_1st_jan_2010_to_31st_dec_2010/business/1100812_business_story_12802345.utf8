          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 11: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today put out a discussion paper to seek the industrys views before its policymakers sit down later this year to review capital, ownership and foreign shareholding rules for new banks.        
	The central bank has to formalise game-changing rules for the industry before it hands out its first set of new banking licences since 2001.        
	The industry has time till September 30 to send in its views on the various options that the RBI has tossed in its discussion paper, which outlined the chequered experience with the 12 new banks that were permitted to start operations in the country since 1993.        
	The RBI is under pressure to balance the need to push the envelop on financial inclusion even as it tries to ensure that only the right sort of promoters get in through the door this time.        
	Big players        
	Large industrial houses  which werent allowed to own banks under the existing policy  may finally be able to squeeze in through the door as the RBI tweaks its policy to deal with issues such as the moral hazard over intra-group lending.        
	Several large industrial houses, including the Tatas, the AV Birla group, the Bajajs, and the Ambanis, have evinced interest in banking ever since finance minister Pranab Mukherjee announced in his budget this year that the RBI would shortly issue new licences.        
	The discussion paper said the minimum capital for new banks should be raised to at least Rs 300 crore from Rs 200 crore at present. It posited two other options: a minimum capital of over Rs 1,000 crore (which would leave only the large industrial houses in the fray) or a level between Rs 500 crore and Rs 1,000 crore.         
	The paper also said that the foreign holding should be capped at below 50 per cent. The paper said there were several advantages in allowing large industrial houses to set up banks. This view seems to have been shaped by the poor experience with local area banks, small NBFCs and individual banking professionals.        
	The paper noted that the large business houses had already been permitted to operate in other financial services sectors such as insurance or mutual funds.        
	Checks amp; balances        
	However, the paper mooted the creation of stringent safeguards to address the downside risk of allowing industrial entities to promote banks. It said industrial and business houses engaged in real estate, either directly or indirectly, should not be allowed to promote banks.        
	Some of the other safeguards that could be followed include a thorough check on the background of promoter directors and top executives of the group. No-objection certificate of the promoters credentials, integrity and background should be taken not only from banks and other regulatory agencies but also from investigating agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate, income tax authorities, etc, the paper said.        
	It added that the structure proposed for promoting banks should be such that a bank can be ring fenced from other financial and commercial entities in the group. There could also be stringent limits on transactions between the bank and other entities in the group to minimise the prospect of direct or indirect lending to other entities in the group.        
	The paper also mooted that as a pre condition for considering allowing industrial or business houses to promote banks, legislative changes should be made to empower the RBI to supersede the board if it is felt that the functioning of the board or the bank is not in the interest of depositors or financial stability.        
	Foreign shareholding        
	On foreign shareholding in the new banks, the paper mooted that total non-resident investment (FII, FDI and NRI) could be capped at below 50 per cent and this should be locked for a period of 10 years. At present, the aggregate foreign holding limit permitted in banks is 74 per cent. A cap below 50 per cent will allow for foreign technical collaboration in setting up domestic banks.        
	The discussion paper was well received by the stock markets. Shares of NBFCs such as Religare Enterprises rose to a years high during intra-day trading of Rs 472.70 and ended 3.67 per cent higher at Rs 430.35. Some of the other notable gainers included Reliance Capital and Bajaj Finserv.

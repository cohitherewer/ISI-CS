The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lenders throw $160bn lifeline at Greece
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Lenders throw $160bn lifeline at Greece
          DAN BILEFSKY AND LANDON THOMAS JR.                          George Papandreou in Athens on Sunday. (Reuters)                                  
	Athens, May 2: Greece has reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union on a long-delayed rescue package that is expected to be worth as much as 120 billion euros ($160 billion).         
	The deal aims to help the country avoid debt default and prevent economic contagion from spreading throughout the region. Prime Minister George Papandreou urged the nation to accept great sacrifices to avoid a catastrophe.        
	I have done and will do everything not to let the country go bankrupt, he said. I want to tell Greeks very honestly that we have a big trial ahead of us.         
	Finance minister George Papaconstantinou set out some of the details of the austerity measures that are required for the bailout package, which were expected to be disclosed in Brussels later.         
	He said that Greece would make budget cuts of 30 billion euros, or $40 billion, to reduce the budget deficit to less than 3 per cent by 2014.         
	The funding from the rescue plan will cover a large part of Greek borrowing needs for the next three years.         
	The country faced a choice between collapse and salvation, he said.         
	Papaconstantinou, who was to fly to Brussels for an emergency meeting of euro zone finance ministers, said Greece had agreed to raise its value-added tax to 23 per cent from 21 per cent, to cut civil servants wages and to eliminate public-sector annual bonuses amounting to two months pay.         
	He said special rules allowing for early retirement of civil servants would be tightened.        
	The government also intended to increase taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcohol by about 10 per cent.         
	In tough negotiations with the IMF, EU and the European Central Bank, Greece had succeeded in avoiding cuts to private sector salaries. Whether the government would relax rules on laying off public workers was, however, not specified.         
	Papaconstantinou forecast a recession of 4 per cent for 2010 and 2.6 per cent in 2011 before a return to growth of 1.1 per cent in 2012.                                             
	However, Papaconstantinou did not address the issue of               
	whose generous salaries and benefits have been a major cause of Greeks debt problem. Until now, the government has not been able to lay off civil servants, whose employment rights are in effect constitutionally guaranteed.                           
	We will be in recession for the next few years, which means that we have to run faster to reduce the deficit, he said.               
	The government will submit special emergency legislation to Parliament, which is expected to approve the measures by Friday.               
	After months in which Germany balked at the prospect of bailing out the euro zones most profligate members, European leaders have in recent days been racing to hammer out the package for Greece with new urgency after ratings agencies downgraded Greeces debt ratings to junk status.               
	The bailout amounts to 45 billion this year, followed by more aid in the following two years.               
	In return, Greece pledged to squeeze cost savings and tax increases amounting to an estimated 24 billion, or 10 percent of the countrys gross domestic product. The measures include 4.8 billion in belt-tightening steps announced in March.               
	While the economic lifeline for Greece is expected to reassure jittery markets, doubts remain whether Greece will be able to follow through on what amounts to a cultural revolution in the social contract between state and citizen.               
	The shakeup of longstanding aspects of Greek life, from endemic tax evasion to overstaffed offices of idle employees, has prompted fears that widespread social unrest could unhinge a Greek recovery.               
	And while most economists agree that the austerity measures are long overdue, some fear that if they push Greece into an even deeper recession, the political will to follow through on the changes will be undermined.               
	The governing Socialist party of Mr. Papandreou has 160 seats in the 300-seat Parliament, giving it enough of a majority to implement laws. Mr. Papandreou in recent days has likened Greeces plight to Odysseus, Homers heroic survivor who took 10 years to return home from war. He has thus far largely escaped blame for a crisis that has been pinned on the profligacy of his predecessors. But analysts warn he could face a fierce backlash if the austerity measures do not deliver visible economic gains soon.               
	The governments proposals for deep spending cuts already have stoked strong resentments in a country where one in three people is employed in a civil service that, until now, has guaranteed jobs for life.               
	In a sign of the challenges ahead, tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets across the country Saturday. Some in Athens chanted, No to the I.M.F. junta!  a reference that conflated the International Monetary Fund and the hated military regime that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974.               
	Some analysts feared that the Saturday demonstrations, in which dozens of black-clad anarchists threw Molotov cocktails and stones at the police, might prove to be the beginning of protracted social unrest. Unions are planning mass demonstrations for Wednesday.               
	The protests have thus far been largely peaceful and muted, suggesting that most Greeks realize they have few options other than to endure and wait.               
	Over the past few days, Greeks have reacted with anger and wounded pride as their country has been derided as the economic sick man of Europe.               
	Alluding to the film Apocalypse Now, the cover of The Economist this week showed a picture of the Acropolis under the headline Acropolis now, with I.M.F. and European Union helicopters hovering above and a picture of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, decked out in military fatigues. The horror, the horror, it continued.               
	Yannos Papantoniou, a former finance minister from the Socialist party, said Greek patience with the cost-cutting measures could run out, in particular, if the large population of poor Greeks were hit hard, if recession did not give way to growth and if already high unemployment increased.               
	My impression, having managed this type of situation in the 1990s, is that Greeks are not patient people, he said in an interview.               
	For Greeks to endure cuts for the next three years, they must be shown results and be convinced that the government is hitting its targets. It is essential that the government follow pro-growth policies to avoid a deep depression.               
	Yet economists warn it could take years for the cost-cutting measures to lift incomes. According to a report to appear Monday in the German magazine Der Spiegel, the I.MF. believes it will take 10 years for Greece to overcome its financial crisis, Reuters reported.               
	And while economists say the bailout package will reassure markets in the short term, some fear that a credit crunch could persist, undermining already depressed consumer spending and depriving businesses of much-needed funding. That threat was underlined Friday when Moodys Investors Service cut the credit ratings of nine Greek banks.               
	Platon Monokroussos, head of financial markets research at Eurobank EFG, one of the biggest banks in Greece, predicted that the austerity measures would keep the country in recession until at least late 2011. He forecast at least two years in which the economy would contract by 3 percent or more before the measures in the austerity package provided a lift.               
	While E.U. and Greek leaders have insisted that Greek debt restructuring is not an option, some economists argued that a debt restructuring, in which private creditors would take a hit by not receiving back all of their money in the agreed time, should not be written off as an option in the future.               
	It would reduce the overall debt burden on Greeces economy but would also create the heavy risk of pushing spooked investors to deny Greece access to credit markets.               
	If Greece fails to implement its cost-cutting measures and European governments and the public grow wary of propping up the country, some economists predict that the possibility of a restructuring could once again emerge. But Yiannis Stournaras, a leading economist and former economic adviser to the ruling Socialist party, argued that the close monitoring by the I.M.F.  and intense scrutiny by the E.U.  would prevent the Greek government from deviating from the path of reform. A restructuring, he argued, would return the country to an economic ice age. The I.M.F. will be here every few months and will be keeping a close eye on Greeces every move, he said. Alluding to a mythological battle in which Greek soldiers attacked the enemy after hiding in a giant hollow wooden horse, he added: People havent trusted the Greeks since the time of the Trojan War so this is nothing new.

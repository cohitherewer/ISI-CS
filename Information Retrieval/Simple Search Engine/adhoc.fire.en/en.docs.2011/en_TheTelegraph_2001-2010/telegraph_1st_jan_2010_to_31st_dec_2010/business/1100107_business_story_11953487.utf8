	Calcutta, Jan. 6: The Bengal government today said the Centre should allot coal blocks to companies that would add value to the state where a block was located. Jharkhand and Orissa have made similar demands for their iron ore.        
	State industry minister Nirupam Sen said the Centre should give priority to Bengals industry instead of asking firms to participate in an auction.        
	The chief minister and I have taken up the issue with the coal minister. The chief minister spoke to the Prime Minister but nothing has happened so far, Sen said at an Assocham meeting here today.        
	However, the states effort failed to please industry, which is in dire need of coal. Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot, who plans to put up a steel and a power project in Bengal, slammed the state for not doing enough. It is not enough to be assertive. They should demand. They should say the coal blocks are mine, Dhoot said. Dhoots project, along with those of Kalyani, Bhushan and Adhunik, are put on hold for want of coal.        
	The Centre used to allocate coal under the state dispensation route where the state had a say in allotment. The Bengal government had allocated coal blocks to steel companies such as JSW Bengal and Jai Balaji Group under the state dispensation route.        
	Now, the Centre wants all coal blocks to be auctioned.        
	A demand for special quota by Orissa and Jharkhand had cost Bengal dear with many big players skipping the state for having no iron ore.        
	Many then decided to buy the ore from the open market and hoped Bengal would give them cheap coal to produce power for captive use in steel plants.        
	Industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said the Centre had said it would look into the states demand after seeing the outcome of blocks allotted to JSW and Jai Balaji.        
	It would take 5-6 years to start production. Why should other industry wait so long? he asked.

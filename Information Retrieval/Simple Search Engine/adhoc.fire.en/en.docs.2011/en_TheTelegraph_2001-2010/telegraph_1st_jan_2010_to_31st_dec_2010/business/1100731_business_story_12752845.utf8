          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, July 30: The Union cabinet today approved the payment of Rs 4,868 crore as subsidy on short-term farm loans with an upper limit of Rs 3 lakh.        
	Officials said the money was meant for public sector banks, regional rural banks, co-operative banks and Nabard.        
	The interest rate on the loans is 9 per cent, but borrowers get to pay 7 per cent because of a 2 per cent subsidy.        
	If farmers pay up in time, there is another 2 per cent subsidy, meaning the rate is 5 per cent.         
	Short-term crop loans mean credit to farmers to buy seeds etc at the beginning of the cropping cycle and are usually payable within a year.         
	Since 2006-07, the government has been subsidising the loans. While farmers have been getting loans at a concession of two per cent in lending rates, those paying back in time started getting one per cent additional discount last fiscal. This year, the amount of concession has been increased to 4 per cent.        
	In the last fiscal, according to the officials, credit to farms at Rs 3,67,000 crore was 13 per cent higher than the target of Rs 3,25,000 crore.        
	Loans were given to 4.82 crore farmers, with new farmers numbering 91 lakh.        
	According to official data, public sector banks lent Rs 2,75,000 crore, while co-operative banks and RRBs loaned Rs 58,000 crore and Rs 34,000 crore, respectively. In 2008-09 loans stood at Rs 3,02,000 crore.        
	The subsidy to farmers comes in the backdrop of weak agriculture growth, with farmer suicides reported from some regions. An official said the mandate for banks was to bring more farmers into the fold of institutional credit.

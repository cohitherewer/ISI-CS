The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Exports still a cause for concern
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Exports still a cause for concern
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee: Cautious                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 13: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the economy was still not out of the woods and exports should be augmented to restore trade balance.        
	Laying the foundation stone for the countrys second financial hub at Rajarhat here today, Mukherjee said, While a prudent financial management by the government has helped the Indian economy overcome the global financial crisis, exports need to be beefed up to get out of the rut.        
	Look at the external sector...trade imbalance is increasing because of shortage of exports, not in absolute terms but in comparison to imports.        
	He said the country would have to diversify into eastern and Far Eastern markets to address the increasing trade imbalance with Europe, North America and Japan.         
	We should focus on Asian neighbours as export destinations rather than depending on Europe, the US or Japan, which together account for 60 per cent of total shipment. We have to diversify and need to look at our Asian neighbours where demand and absorption capacities have increased significantly, he said.        
	Exports in August were up 22 per cent to $16.64 billion, while imports grew 32 per cent to $29.7 billion, resulting in a trade gap of $13.06 billion.        
	He said the financial hub would provide infrastructure and institutional support to facilitate trade with the eastern countries.        
	Keeping in tune with the Look East policy of the government, the financial hub will play a major catalytic role in the economy, he said.        
	The hub will be set up in collaboration with Orion IT Tech at an investment of Rs 16,000 crore.        
	Mukherjee said achieving a double-digit GDP growth was a big challenge. Double-digit growth is not a fancy statistical figure but it is part of our effort towards rebuilding and reconstructing the nation, he said.

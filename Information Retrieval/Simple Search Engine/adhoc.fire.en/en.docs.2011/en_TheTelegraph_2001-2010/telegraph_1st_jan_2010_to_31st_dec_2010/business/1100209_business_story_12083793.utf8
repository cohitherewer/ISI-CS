The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telecom cop puts 4G tech on fast track
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Telecom cop puts 4G tech on fast track
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          New call                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: The telecom regulator today started consultations for fourth generation (4G) mobile technology, while its predecessor  3G  is trapped in a legal quagmire.        
	Yes. We are starting the process and will come out with a consultation paper to look into various issues relating to 4G telecom services, said Trai chairman J.S. Sarma.         
	Long Term Evolution (LTE), or 4G, technology can be offered in the 2.1-2.3 MHz spectrum band, and the department of telecom (DoT) is looking at the availability of this frequency.        
	The launch of third-generation (3G) mobile services has not even reached the bidding stage; legal complications have arisen over the payment of the bid amount and the receipt of spectrum at a later date.        
	The delay has made some operators review their strategy and look at the possibility of upgrading straight to fourth generation technology such as LTE.        
	LTE allows more data to be transferred over the same bandwidth used by 3G technology and at a higher speed.         
	Compared with the 3Mbps (mega bytes per second) speed offered by third generation services, LTE can offer up to 10 Mbps. As a result, service providers should be able to get more data transferred in their network and possibly lower the cost of running their networks, too.        
	CDMA plea        
	CDMA operators have requested Sam Pitroda, adviser to the Prime Minister on information infrastructure, to identify and auction spectrum for fourth generation mobile services.        
	To ensure that we do not lag behind in 4G technologies, it is humbly suggested that the DoT take immediate action for the auctioning of 4G spectrum, CDMA operators body AUSPI said in a letter to Pitroda.         
	Sarma said, 3G has been delayed badly. I dont want 4G or LTE (long term evolution) to meet the same fate. Other countries are catching up with 4G and that is why we are taking advance action.        
	LTE is already being tested in various parts of the world by Motorola and Ericsson.        
	Motorola had recently said it would approach the DoT to seek spectrum for testing their equipment in India.

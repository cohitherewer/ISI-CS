          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Wipro chairman Azim Premji (right) with CFO Suresh Senapaty in Bangalore on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, April 23: Wipro  the countrys third largest software maker  today rewarded its shareholders with a bonus offer of two shares for every three held after announcing a 21 per cent growth in fourth-quarter profits at Rs 1,209 crore.        
	The bonus offer was laced with a final dividend of Rs 6 per share.        
	This is the fourth time that Wipro is paying a bonus. The last time it offered free shares was in 2005 when it came out with a 1:1 bonus.        
	Wipro isnt the only one rewarding its shareholders with a bonus this year. On Thursday, Rallis India announced a 1:2 bonus issue. Earlier, Engineers India Ltd declared a bonus in the ratio of 2:1.        
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the stock initially leapt to a days high of Rs 728 after it opened at Rs 710. But the stock fell to Rs 692.95 at the close  a drop of 1.42 per cent over its last close  as investors were disappointed with the weak guidance for the April-June quarter.        
	Analysts had expected Wipro to post a net profit in the region of Rs 1,200 crore in the January to March quarter.        
	The 21 per cent growth in its bottomline was largely on account of its IT services business that grew 7 per cent to Rs 5,260 crore over the same quarter last year.         
	The company reported a net profit of Rs 4,593 crore for the full year ended March 31, up 18 per cent from Rs 3,876 crore in the previous year. Net income from operations stood at Rs 27,124 crore against Rs 25,534 crore in 2008-09.        
	We have seen another strong quarter of broad-based, volume led growth. We saw good recovery in our challenged verticals of technology and telecom. The business environment is returning to normal, Wipro chairman Azim Premji said.        
	Wipro forecast that revenues from its IT services business would be in the range of $1190-1215 million for the quarter ending June 30, a sequential growth of 2 per cent.        
	Analysts were, however, not too enthused by the guidance. It is not a great forecast, said an IT analyst who did not wish to be identified.        
	Premji told reporters in Bangalore that the companys conversations with CEOs of large companies indicated they were more confident for the period ahead and were ready to make decisions.        
	Last year, the key problem was that the budgets sanctioned were not spentIT budgets will be more this year and, more importantly, IT budgets will be spent, he said. Premji added that while pricing was stable, the deal pipeline was also likely to be healthy. The company also hopes to strike bigger deals this year.        
	Suresh Senapaty, chief financial officer, said the company had delivered close to the upper end of its guidance with revenues of $1,180 million in constant currency.         
	He added that the company was successful in increasing margins by 60 basis points despite headwinds of wage increase, rupee appreciation and the impact of cross currency.        
	In the fourth quarter, IT services added 27 new clients and saw a net addition of 5,325 employees. Among its various business, consumer care and lighting revenue grew 27 per cent, while IT products recorded a 2 per cent growth in revenues.

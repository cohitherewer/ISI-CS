	Calcutta, Aug. 13: McNally Bharat Engineering Company Ltd is in talks with a few firms in west Europe for possible acquisitions, with a view to bringing in advanced technology in areas such as water treatment.        
	The company can spend up to $40-50 million for each acquisition. We are looking to bring in technologies in India that will be scaled up for use in the domestic market, McNally chairman Deepak Khaitan said here today.         
	McNally is also keen to acquire firms in oil amp; gas and cement for technology, Khaitan said. The companies should help us break into these sectors where we have little footprint. The company will make the foreign acquisitions through its Singapore subsidiary  MBE Mineral Technologies Pte Ltd.        
	According to Khaitan, McNally aims to generate 20-30 per cent of its revenues from overseas in the next two years. The company has orders of Rs 150-200 crore from Indonesia, Mongolia and Zambia.        
	This year our overseas business will contribute around 10 per cent to the total business, he said.        
	During the April-June quarter of this fiscal, McNally Bharat reported a 15 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 6.15 crore compared with Rs 5.31 crore in the year-ago quarter.         
	Total income stood at Rs 283.48 crore, 11 per cent higher than Rs 253.04 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

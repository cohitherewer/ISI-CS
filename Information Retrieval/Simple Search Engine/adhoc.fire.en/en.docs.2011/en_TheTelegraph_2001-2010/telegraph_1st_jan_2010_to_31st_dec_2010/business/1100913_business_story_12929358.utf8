          SAMBIT SAHA                          Pranab Mukherjee with Sudip Dutta at Hoera on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Hoera (Hooghly), Sept. 12: Ess Dee Aluminium  the largest aluminium foil manufacturer in India  today commenced operations again at its Hoera plant in Bengal, with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee present at the opening ceremony.         
	The unit, closed for nearly six years, belonged to India Foils Ltd before Mumbai-based Bengali entrepreneur Sudip Dutta took it over a couple of years ago.        
	Dutta, chairman of BSE-listed Ess Dee Aluminium, has put in about Rs 112 crore in India Foils to revive the company.        
	India Foils, earlier owned by Anil Agarwals Vedanta, had three units in Bengal  Kamarhati in North 24 Parganas, Hoera in Hooghly and Taratala in Calcutta.         
	Dutta had revived the Kamarhati facility in late 2008 and has now re-opened the Hoera unit, about 70 kilometres from Calcutta.        
	We have inducted 54 workmen in the plant. The number will go up to 150 as we expand here, he said.        
	The plant is spread over 35 acres. There is vacant space within the premises to facilitate further expansion. It will make 10,000 tonnes of aluminium foil, mostly for captive consumption. It will also sell around 400 tonnes to tobacco major ITC to be used in cigarette packaging.        
	Ess Dee makes customised aluminium packaging material for pharmaceutical companies in 10 facilities across the country.        
	The Hoera plant is a step towards backward integration. Dutta indicated that he would put up a caster here.         
	Aluminium ingots are put into casters, or hot rolled, to make the foil. Typically, an efficient unit can save up to 4-5 per cent by going a step backward.        
	Dutta recalled the state of the unit when he had entered the premises for the first time. The factory building had collapsed. There were overgrown bushes and snakes all around. We had to rebuild almost everything, he said.        
	The finance minister praised Duttas initiative in reviving the sick unit. He showed that it is possible to do it in Bengal, he said.        
	Dutta pleaded his case before Mukherjee to resolve the title dispute over the Taratala plot. The area is owned by the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and leased to Sterlite, the erstwhile owner of India Foils. The CPT had cancelled the lease following a dispute.

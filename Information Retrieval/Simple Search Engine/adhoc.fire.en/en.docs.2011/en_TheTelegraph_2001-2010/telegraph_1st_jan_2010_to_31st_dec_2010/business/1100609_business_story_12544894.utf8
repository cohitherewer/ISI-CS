	New Delhi, June 8: Vodafone Essar  the countrys third largest mobile operator  will soon bring Apples iPhone 4 to India.        
	Vodafone Essar will launch iPhone 4, the thinnest smartphone in the world with the highest resolution display, in India in the coming months, a company statement said.         
	Though Vodafone did not give any details about the date of availability, or the price, company executives told The Telegraph that a locked version could be available as early as July.        
	Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, unveiled the iPhone 4 at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco yesterday. The iPhone 4 will go on sale from June 24 in the US, France, Germany, Britain and Japan, and will be available in 18 more countries in July. It is also slated for release in 88 countries in September.        
	The 16-gigabyte model will cost $199 in the US and the 32-gigabyte version will be priced at $299. Pricing in India will be around Rs 35,000, as has been seen in all Apple iPhones, industry experts said.        
	According to the experts, the unlocked versions of the new iPhone would be available in the grey market at a discount of Rs 5,000-8,000.         
	Although it is easy to unlock the iPhone, a customer will not get the warranty associated with an operator nor some features that are specific to the service provider, analysts said.        
	Earlier versions of the iPhone are officially available in India through Vodafone and Airtel.        
	The new iPhone, which is 9.3mm thick, is 24 per cent thinner than the iPhone 3GS. Jobs said the new design was the biggest leap since the range was first launched.        
	The iPhone 4 has a front-mounted camera as well as a 5-megapixel rear-mounted camera with LED flash  both of which can be used to shoot high-definition video and for video calls using Apples new FaceTime software.        
	The front and back of the device are made of chemically-strengthened glass, while the rest of the body is made of stainless steel.        
	Apple faces competition in India from Nokia, Samsung, LG, the smartphones built on Googles Android operating system and Research in Motions BlackBerry.         
	Tax dispute        
	Bombay High Court today adjourned till July 8 the hearing on an appeal filed by Vodafone International in its income tax dispute.        
	The court also stayed the ruling passed by the income tax department on May 31.        
	The dispute relates to Vodafones tax liability after it acquired Hutchison Internationals stake in Hutchison-Essar in a $11.1-billion deal in February 2007.

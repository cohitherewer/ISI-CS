          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 4: The sensex today surged 103 points to a 30-month high, led by frontline IT stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys.         
	Braving negative global cues, the 30-share BSE barometer extended its gains for the third straight session to end higher by 102.61 points, or 0.57 per cent, at 18217.44, its best close since February 2008.        
	Similarly, end-of-day demand for blue-chip stocks helped the National Stock Exchanges wide-based 50-share Nifty to add 0.52 per cent to settle at 5467.85 points.        
	In a volatile session, the sensex fluctuated between a high of 18249.46 points and a low of 18093.03 points.        
	Software companies stole the show and were the top gainers in the sensex pack. The BSE IT index, too, was a leader with an over 3 per cent rise.        
	Nasdaq-listed Cognizants announcement yesterday of a 22 per cent rise in June quarter profit at $172.2 million fuelled investor optimism.        
	Analysts said a fall in the value of the rupee against the dollar helped the rally in the IT stocks.         
	A weak rupee means the earnings of software exporters from overseas sales will improve when converted into domestic currency.        
	TCS, the countrys top software exporter, rallied 4.4 per cent, the most in the BSE-30 pack. Wipro rose 3.96 per cent and Infosys, 3 per cent.        
	The increased thrust on offshoring budget of clients is reflected by this strong growth, which will benefit other large Indian IT vendors, PINC analyst Rohit Kumar Anand said.

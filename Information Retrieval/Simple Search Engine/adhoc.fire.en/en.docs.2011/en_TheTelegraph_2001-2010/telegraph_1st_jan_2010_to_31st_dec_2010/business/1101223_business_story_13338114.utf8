                              New turn                            
	Gurgaon, Dec. 22 (PTI): Maruti Suzuki, the countrys largest car maker, today said it would reorient the production of the Swift and the DZire at its Gurgaon and Manesar facilities to enhance output.        
	According to the plan, the company will shift the entire assembly of its sedan DZire to Gurgaon by July next year. It will shift the production of Swift to Manesar sometime in the future.        
	At present, the hatchback is being produced at both the plants.         
	Our plan is to fully shift the DZire to Gurgaon and the Swift to Manesar to enhance productivity. The shifting of assembly of the DZire will take place by July next year and that of the Swift will take place in the future, M.M. Singh, managing executive officer (production) of Maruti Suzuki India, said.         
	He, however, declined to comment on the increase in volume after the reorientation exercise.        
	At present, the company manufactures about 10,000 units of the DZire and 12,000 units of the Swift every month.        
	The companys hatchbacks  Swift and Ritz  have a 3-4 month and 1-2 month waiting period, respectively, while customers are willing to wait for 4-5 months to own a DZire sedan.         
	Singh also said the company would launch an upgraded variant of the Swift by the end of next year.        
	The company is expecting up to 30 per cent sales jump in the domestic market during this financial year.

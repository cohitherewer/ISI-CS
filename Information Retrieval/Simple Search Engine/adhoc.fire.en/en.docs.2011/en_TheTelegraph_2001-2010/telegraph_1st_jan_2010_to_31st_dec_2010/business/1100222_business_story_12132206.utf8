The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dear daughter
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Dear daughter
                                My daughter will get married soon. I want to gift her and my son-in-law a good amount of gold ornaments, cash and other things. Will these gifts attract tax?          M. Sinha, Purulia 
                    Effective from October 1 this year, an individual or a Hindu Undivided Family receiving gifts in money, immovable property, shares and securities, jewellery, or any art work exceeding Rs 50,000 shall be liable to pay tax under Section 56 (2)(vii) of the Income Tax Act. However, gifts received from close relatives such as parents or on the occasion of marriage shall not be taxable. So, neither you nor your daughter or son-in-law have to pay tax on the gifts.                                  Nominee claim      Can the nominee of a deceased person, who has investment in a Senior Citizen Saving Scheme, submit Form 15H or Form 15G for non-deduction of tax at source?        G. Sengupta, Burdwan
                    Yes, the nominee of a deceased account holder in SCSS can submit Form 15H or Form 15G to the bank where the SCSS account has been opened. The Reserve Bank of India had already issued a circular in this respect in June last year (circular number RBI/2008-09/493; reference number DGBA.CDD.H-10566/15.15.001/2008-09, dated June 5, 2009) which stated that the Central Board of Direct Taxes have now clarified, vide their office memorandum F.No. 275/36/2009-IT(B) (dated May 14, 2009), that the nominee of a depositor of SCSS could also produce Form 15G (for non-deduction of taxes at source) at the time of payment after the death of the depositor.                                  Interest income      I am 58 years old and a housewife. My total interest income from bank fixed deposits is around Rs 3,50,000. How would I pay income tax on this income?         Juthika Saha, Howrah
                    From financial year 2009-10, if ones income tax liability exceeds Rs 10,000, he/she will have to pay advance income tax under Section 208 of the Income Tax Act. Given the income tax rate applicable for women, your tax liability is more than Rs 10,000. But if you have some tax saving investments and your tax liability thus has come under the Rs 10,000 limit, you may pay the tax before filing returns.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pricey IPOs under Sebi lens
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Pricey IPOs under Sebi lens
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 24 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is mulling ways to rein in erring merchant bankers regarding the overpricing of IPOs and hyping public issues through misleading advertisements and media reports.        
	The regulator is considering bringing out a draft resolution to seek public comments, sources said.        
	The issue is likely to be discussed in the Sebi board meeting tomorrow and thereafter, the regulator might issue the draft guidelines for public comments.        
	Sources said Sebi could propose stringent actions with regard to overpricing, unnecessary hype and violations of a standard code of conduct and business ethics.        
	The matter holds significance in the backdrop of Sebi warning merchant bankers against creating a hype in the case of the recently concluded mega IPO of Coal India, which is looking to raise over Rs 15,000 crore. Although, the Coal India float was widely considered as a well priced public offer, a number of recent IPOs, especially by private firms, have been criticised for being over-priced.        
	Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave had rued the trend of over-priced IPOs at a merchant banking summit last month. He had urged the bankers to price the offers reasonably as high pricing was keeping retail investors away.        
	He said the issuers were not willing to leave enough on the table for retail investors. In a bid to maximise returns for the promoters, merchant bankers are not looking at the interest of retail investors, he had said.        
	Besides pricing of the offers, Sebi could also propose ways to discourage bankers from quoting near-zero fees to get the mandate for managing the public offers, sources said.         
	Sebi will tomorrow consider giving more teeth to retail investors by allowing them a larger pie when firms go public and a better price when they are acquired.         
	The market regulator will consider final guidelines on IPOs and takeovers after taking into account the public comments for the draft guidelines.        
	Sources said Sebi would consider the final form of the new takeover code, which, among other changes, proposes to bring in retail shareholders on a par with the promoters in terms of price received in the M amp;A deals.        
	The Sebi board is also likely to consider final approval to the recently proposed draft on enhancing the purchasing power of retail investors in IPOs. In the draft guidelines, Sebi has proposed to raise the ceiling for retail investors to Rs 2 lakh in public issues from Rs 1 lakh.

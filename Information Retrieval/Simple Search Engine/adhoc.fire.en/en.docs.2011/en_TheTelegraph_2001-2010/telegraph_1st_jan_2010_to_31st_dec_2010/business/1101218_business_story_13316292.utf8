The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Microfinance tip to RBI
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Microfinance tip to RBI
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          MONEY MATTERS                                  
	Hyderabad, Dec. 17: The Andhra Pradesh government has asked the Reserve Bank of India to ban microfinance institutions (MFIs) from accessing capital markets.        
	In its representation to the Y.H. Malegam committee, the Andhra government advocated for a statutory cap on the interest rates being charged by the MFIs.        
	We propose a cap of 8 per cent on the interest rate spread of MFIs. The implementation of this cap should be left to the states, which have the machinery and the wherewithal to verify the situation in the field, the 37-page report said.        
	It also blamed the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) and other nationalised banks for not following norms while giving priority sector advances through microfinance institutions without monitoring their activities.         
	There has been widespread violation of the RBI guidelines of November 2009 by the banks which calls for a detailed investigation and the need to fix accountability of banks, the report said.        
	According to the report, the lure of high returns is drawing private equity (PE) investors to microfinance.        
	These PE investors are not social institutions and therefore drive MFIs to earn more profits, thereby defeating the very purpose of financial inclusion.        
	The report said there were 79 MFIs operating in the rural areas of Andhra Pradesh and 63 in urban areas and have given a loan of Rs 12,614 crore of which only Rs 6,704 crore, including an interest of Rs 1,328 crore, has so been recovered.        
	The MFIs had approached 80 lakh households and the average debt per household stood at Rs 30,000 to be repaid per annum. This means that 75 per cent of the households annual income will be spent on servicing the debt.        
	This is not tenable and beyond the capacity of the poor, the report said.        
	The microfinance problem in Andhra Pradesh started in 2005. Discussions were held with MFIs and a code of conduct was worked out to reduce interest rates and stop unethical practices.         
	However, the MFIs were quick to violate the code of conduct and continued the same old practices, the report said.        
	The report further argued that if states could successfully regulate interest rates charged by money lenders, there was no reason why they would not be able to do the same with MFIs.        
	It also recommended a three-year rescheduling of all MFI loans to help borrowers negotiate the present crisis.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Private banks put on alert
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Private banks put on alert
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, July 2: Chiefs and directors of private banks that fare poorly may feel a pinch in their pocket.         
	The Reserve Bank has proposed that if a private bank fails to perform then its CEOs salary hike should be limited to 10-15 per cent and if need be the compensation package should be slashed.        
	The proposals are part of the RBI draft regulations on compensation of private sector, local area and foreign banks and are significant given the fact that high salaries and bonuses of bankers (despite their institutions faring badly) were blamed for the 2008 global financial meltdown.        
	The draft regulations come within days of the US Congress passing a major financial reform bill to discipline firms on Wall Street.        
	Interestingly, a finance ministry panel has only this week recommended better pay for chiefs of public sector banks. Executives of state-run banks are perceived to get salary packages way below that of their private sector counterparts.        
	The countrys largest private sector bank ICICI Banks chief Chanda Kochhar got a remuneration of Rs 1.73 crore in 2009-10, against market leader and state-run lender SBI chief .P. Bhatts Rs 26.51 lakh.        
	According to the available data for 2009-10, the number of top executives at private sector banks getting remuneration in excess of Rs 1 crore a year is more than that of their counterparts in any other sector.        
	About 25 private sector bank top executives, including chiefs of ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and DCB, figured among the 200-odd such persons during the year ended March 2010.        
	While the government fixes the salaries for public sector bank chiefs, private banks need a clearance from the RBI for the remunerations of their top executives, but currently there is no cap.

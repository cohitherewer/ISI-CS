The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lupin clears Lipitor hurdle
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Lupin clears Lipitor hurdle
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 3: Lupin Ltd has been permitted by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to seek approval for a generic version of Pfizers blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.        
	Lipitor is one of the top-selling prescription drugs in the world with global sales of over $11 billion of which nearly $5.7 billion is in the US.        
	Lupin received a green signal from the USFDA to its citizen petition filed a couple of years ago. This petition can be used to urge the regulator to take an action or a step with regard to a particular drug.        
	Lupin plans to make generic Lipitor in capsules against the tablet version that is now being sold by Pfizer. It may be recalled that in 2008, Pfizer entered into an agreement with Ranbaxy Laboratories under which it was given a licence to sell generic versions of Lipitor from November 30, 2011.        
	It is learnt that Lupin will now have to go through the normal process taken to launch the generic version of a drug. Sources said it would take Lupin at least two years to launch a capsule version of Lipitor.        
	A Lupin spokesperson declined to comment. However, news of the USFDA green signal ignited investor interest in the Lupin stock, which closed with a gain of 1.48 per cent at Rs 365.90 on the BSE.        
	Lupins plan to come out with a generic version of Lipitor reflects the market opportunity presented by the impending Patent Cliff over the next four years. During this period a large number of drugs will be going off-patent. Lupin has seized upon this opportunity, and its cumulative filings for generic drugs with the USFDA stands at 130.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 4: Tata Motors today raised the size of its qualified institutional placement (QIP) issue from $525 million to $750 million to deal with a surge in demand for its ordinary shares and the differential voting right stock that were on offer.        
	Institutional investors were scrambling to scoop up the stock of the auto maker which has reported a dramatic turnaround in its fortunes this year.        
	In 2008, Tata Motors holding company Tata Sons had to step in when its rights offering was on the verge of devolving, and the latter had to pick up the unsubscribed portion of the issue.         
	Bankers said this time demand for the issue was more than three times the size of QIP.         
	On Monday, Tata Motors informed the stock exchanges, In view of the response received, the committee of directors today authorised that the size of the offering of the A ordinary shares be increased from $400 million to $550 million. As such, the total size of the ordinary shares and A ordinary shares placement would stand increased to $750 million.        
	The automobile company opened the share sale on Friday of $200 million of ordinary shares and $325 million of the A class of ordinary shares (that carry the differential voting rights), with an option to increase the A class of ordinary shares to $400 million.        
	Tata Motors plans to use the proceeds of this issue primarily to trim the debt on its books, which stands at over $4 billion. A part of the proceeds will be used to meet capital expenditure, long-term working capital requirements and general corporate purposes.        
	Sources who did not wish to be identified said the share sale was made at a discount of roughly 4 per cent and 46 per cent for the ordinary and A class shares, respectively, when the issue opened on Friday.        
	Citigroup Global Markets India Private Limited and Credit Suisse Securities (India) Private Limited are acting as the lead managers for QIP.         
	Last year, Tata Motors sold shares worth $750 million in convertible bonds and GDR offering as part of the effort to bring down debt on its books.        
	According to an October 1 report by Angel Broking, auto sales in September posted a double-digit growth for the fourth month in a row. Tata Motors reported a 23.1 per cent year-on-year growth in total volumes with the passenger vehicles segment growing 32.4 per cent year-on-year and the commercial vehicles segment growing at 18 per cent year-on-year during September, the report said.         
	On Monday, Tata Motors said it had acquired an 80 per cent stake in Trilix Srl, a Turin-based design and engineering company, for a consideration of 1.85 million euros.        
	The Tata Motors scrip closed at Rs 1,139.60 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, an increase of nearly 2 per cent over Fridays close.

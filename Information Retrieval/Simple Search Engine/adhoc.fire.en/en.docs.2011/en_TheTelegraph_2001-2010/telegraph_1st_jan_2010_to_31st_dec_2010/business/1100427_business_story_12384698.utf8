The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | FDI policy set for a tweak
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      FDI policy set for a tweak
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 26: The process of big-ticket reforms could be set in motion next month with the government planning to bring out discussion papers to allow foreign direct investments in sectors such as multi-brand retail, agriculture and defence.        
	All the issues that are troubling you will be covered (in the discussion papers), R.P. Singh, secretary in the department of industrial policy amp; promotion, said when asked if multi-brand retail would figure in the discussion papers.        
	He said the department would come out with the discussion papers in the middle of next month, which would seek views from a cross-section of people and encourage public debate before formulating the policy.        
	Sources said the government was contemplating 51 per cent FDI in multi-brand retail other than primary goods (foods, groceries and vegetables), with some stiff riders.        
	Commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma, however, today ruled out any immediate policy change to allow foreign investment in multi-brand retail. Not as of now, Sharma said. He said the back-end chain strengthening is more important because that ensures better remuneration to farmers, value addition and job creation.        
	Under the existing rules, FDI is not allowed in retail, except for trade of single brand products, where up to 51 per cent investment is permitted. FDI up to 100 per cent is allowed in wholesale cash-and-carry trade.        
	In its first term, the UPA government had shelved plans of opening up FDI in multi-brand retail because of opposition from the Left parties.        
	While multinationals such as Walmart and Carrefour along with Indian industry associations are pitching for the opening up of the multi-brand segment, a parliamentary panel has proposed a blanket ban on the entry of corporate houses into this unorganised sector employing millions.        
	The government may want to hike FDI in defence production from 26 per cent to 49 per cent as the existing policy has failed to attract investment. In 2001, defence was opened up to private players. However, around 70 per cent of Indias military requirements are still imported, while defence budgets continue to rise.        
	In agriculture, 100 per cent FDI are allowed in allied activities such as horticulture, floriculture and animal husbandry. The government feels the norms can be tweaked to allow FDI into capital intensive agriculture activities.        
	On pharmaceuticals, Singh said the department of pharmaceuticals was not averse to FDI but was demanding a review of the policy.        
	They (department of pharmaceutical) are not opposing. They are only saying that the FDI (policy) should be reviewed and it should not result in Indian companies being purchased by outsiders, he said.         
	India allows 100 per cent FDI in drugs and pharmaceuticals through the automatic route.

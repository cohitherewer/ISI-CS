	New Delhi, Oct. 8 (PTI): Tea exports in August declined 21.4 per cent to 16.84 million kg from 21.42 million kg in the corresponding month last year, according to the Tea Board of India.        
	In value terms, exports dipped nearly 28 per cent to Rs 227.06 crore from Rs 314.7 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Fall in exports is in line with the dip in production during the month of over 12 million kg.        
	Production in August dropped nearly 9 per cent to 122.73 million kg from 134.37 million kg in the same month last year because of heavy rain and pest attack in Assam, the largest producer.        
	Output dropped both in north and south India during the month to 107.82 million kg and 14.9 million kg from 114.36 million kg and 20 million kg, respectively, during the year-ago period, Tea Board data revealed.        
	During the first eight months of this year, exports rose nearly 9 per cent to 124.13 million kg from 114.65 million kg in January-August last year.        
	India  the worlds second largest producer and biggest consumer  accounts for about 28 per cent of the global output and 14 per cent of the trade.         
	There are about 1,600 gardens in the country, and the industry employs over two million.         
	India had exported 190 million kg in 2008-09.        
	The country exports CTC (crush-tear-curl) mainly to Egypt, Pakistan and the UK and the premium orthodox variety to Iraq, Iran and Russia. India faces competition from Kenya and other African countries in CTCs.         
	For the orthodox variety of tea, competition comes up from Sri Lanka and Indonesia.

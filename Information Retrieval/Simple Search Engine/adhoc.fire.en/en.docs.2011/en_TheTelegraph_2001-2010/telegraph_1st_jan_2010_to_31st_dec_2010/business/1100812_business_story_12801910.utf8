          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today said the oil spill off the Mumbai coast would not disrupt supplies as the refineries had enough stock.         
	There is no problem at all anywhere. There is enough stock to last till this oil spill is cleared, Deora said.        
	He said his ministrys officials had told him that there were no fears of disruption in supplies. All refineries are fully prepared to meet the situation.         
	The Mumbai port and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust are closed to cargo traffic after oil started to spill from the sinking MSV Chitra. The ports are expected to resume operations from August 15.        
	Operations at the Mumbai refineries of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) have not been hit as ONGC has raised crude supplies from its Bombay High fields, officials said.        
	An official of BPCL said operations were normal, with the company using crude from its inventories and pipelines from Bombay High oil field. The refiner is also sourcing crude through a pipeline from ONGCs Bombay High field to make up for the blocked shipments.        
	They said three ships carrying 1.5 million barrels of crude for its 138,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Mumbai have not been able to unload because of the closure of the port. According to the government, 32 ships have been stranded in the ports or were waiting to dock.         
	Officials in HPCL said the refinery had crude oil stocks for 15 days in addition to pipeline supplies.        
	BPCL operates a 12-million-tonne-a-year refinery in Mumbai, while HPCLs refinery has an annual capacity of 6.5 million tonnes. The two refineries together process 249,500 barrels of crude per day, accounting for 7 per cent of the countrys refining capacity.

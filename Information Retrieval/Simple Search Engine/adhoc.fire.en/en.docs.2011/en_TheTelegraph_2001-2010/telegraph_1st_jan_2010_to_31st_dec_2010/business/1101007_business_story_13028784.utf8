	Calcutta, Oct. 6: The Godrej group is looking at the merger of Godrej Consumer Products Ltd and Godrej Household Products Ltd.         
	Godrej Consumer in May had picked up Sara Lees 51 per cent stake in their joint venture Godrej Sara Lee, which was renamed Godrej Household. After the deal, Godrej Household became a 100 per cent subsidiary of Godrej Consumer.         
	Now we are looking at all possibilities, including merger or reverse merger between Godrej Consumer and Godrej Household because the integration of operations of the two firms will save costs and increase profit margins, Godrej group chairman Adi Godrej said.         
	Besides, the two companies bring in a lot of synergies. GHPL has a strong presence in southern India, while GCPL has a strong visibility in the North.         
	However, he declined to give any timeframe for the merger or reverse merger. The two firms are separate legal entities and the merger regulations are undergoing change. It may happen soon, it may get delayed. We are examining the possibility, he said.        
	Godrej Consumer, the listed company, will set up a soap manufacturing facility at an investment of Rs 150 crore. Initially we were looking at a place in Andhra Pradesh. Since there are problems regarding statehood (the Telengana agitation), we are now looking at a different location. But nothing has been finalised. The new plant with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes per annum will be set up at some sea port area, he said.        
	The company has a manufacturing capacity of 1,25,000 tonnes per annum.        
	Godrej Industries, created nine years ago by carving out the non-soap business of Godrej Soaps, will set up a new unit at a cost of Rs 150 crore to make oleochemicals used in making vegetable oils for soaps. According to Godrej, Godrej Consumer will hike soap prices by 3-5 per cent following the rise in vegetable oil cost.         
	Godrej Consumer, which has acquired four companies, including the Sara Lee stake, between April and June, is keen on acquiring FMCG firms, particularly in hair colouring, household insecticide and personal wash segments in Asia, Africa and South America.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | StanChart priority to Asian service
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      StanChart priority to Asian service
                              SPECIAL TIES                            
	London, Aug. 16 (Reuters): Standard Chartered plans to hire 800 bankers in the next 12-18 months for a new service aimed at affluent Asian consumers not served by private banks and the priority banking arms of commercial banks.        
	The London-based bank, which derives most of its earnings from Asia, also plans to expand online stockbroking services to customers beyond Hong Kong, India and Taiwan, StanCharts global head of premium banking Foo Mee Har said.        
	In Singapore, StanChart will offer investors access to 15 stock markets from next month, she said. Foo said this would be more than other banks and stockbroking firms were offering.        
	Most of the focus so far has been on high net worth individuals and the affluent who are private banking or priority banking targets. Yet, emerging affluent is the fastest growing (segment) in the affluent space and the absolute size is significantly larger, she said.         
	Bank of America         
	The Bank of America Corp is considering a reduction in its stake in asset manager BlackRock Inc, which is viewed as a non-core asset, a source said.        
	North Carolina-based Bank of America had inherited a stake in BlackRock through its 2008-2009 acquisition of Merrill Lynch.        
	It owns a 34.1 per cent economic interest in the asset manager. As of March 31, the bank valued its BlackRock investment at $14.1 billion.        
	The Bank of America has for some time been looking at its non-core assets and weighing whether to sell or keep them, said the source. The BlackRock asset is not considered core, so the bank is also weighing whether that should be reduced, the source said.        
	The Bank of America has been selling other assets. It struck a deal in 2009 to sell a long-term asset management business, part of its Columbia management division, to Ameriprise Financial Inc for about $1 billion.        
	It recently reduced its private equity investment business, with the spin-out of its mid-market private equity business, now called Ridgemont Equity Partners.        
	The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported that it was considering reducing the BlackRock stake.        
	Another factor, which may contribute to a decision to sell is that far-reaching rules proposed recently by the Basel Committee of Bank Supervision, known as the Basel III capital requirements, will effectively prevent banks from holding big stakes in other companies.        
	The Bank of America and PNC Financial Services Group Inc may be forced to sell their stakes in asset manager BlackRock under those rules, Reuters had reported earlier in August.         
	In the US, banks rarely own large chunks of other companies. But the Bank of America and PNC  through a unique series of deals  together own nearly 60 per cent of BlackRock.

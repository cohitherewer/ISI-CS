          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 2: Anil Ambani is looking to merge Reliance Natural Resources (RNRL) with Reliance Power Ltd (RPower). The boards of the two companies will meet on July 4 to decide on a merger.        
	The move to merge the two is seen as a fallout of the Supreme Court verdict on May 7 when RNRL lost the battle with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) over the supply of gas from the latters Krishna Godavari basin.         
	A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan had then ruled that the government had absolute powers to fix price, quantity and tenure of gas supply. The apex court had said that any sale by a private contractor (RIL) to another party (RNRL) had to be within the parameters laid down by the government.        
	Under the terms of the original deal, a major part of RNRLs business was supposed to come from buying gas from RIL at a price of $2.34 per mBtu and selling it to other Anil Ambani group companies. The Supreme Court verdict  which upheld the governments position that gas could only be sold to an end-user  had raised serious questions about the rationale for RNRLs existence which faced the prospect of turning into a shell company.        
	RNRL, which was set up after the split of the Reliance empire, is engaged in the business of sourcing, supply and transportation of gas, coal and liquid fuels.         
	It has four coal bed methane (CBM) blocks, with an acreage of about 3,251 sq kms. The company has also been awarded an oil and gas block with acreage of about 3,619 sq km in the state of Mizoram under the sixth round of Nelp.

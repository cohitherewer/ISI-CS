          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 27: The government has given the RBI governor a higher position than the other financial sector regulators in the proposed joint mechanism to address differences among them over hybrid products, partially allaying the apex banks fears of its authority getting undermined if it was treated on a par with the other regulators in the joint panel.        
	RBIs elevated status is incorporated in the Securities and Insurance Laws (Amendment) and Validation, Bill 2010  introduced in the Lok Sabha today by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee  that seeks to replace the Ulip ordinance of June 18. The ordinance put insurance regulator IRDA in charge of Ulips and proposed the dispute settlement mechanism.        
	While introducing the bill, Mukherjee said the joint mechanism is for resolving future differences of opinion on whether any investment or securities market instrument or a component of money market instrument falls within the jursdiction of the IRDA, RBI, PFRDA or Sebi.        
	The RBI governor has been designated as the vice-chairman of the committee, with the finance minister as the chairman.         
	The chiefs of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) are the members. Others in the panel are the secretary in the department of economic affairs and secretary (financial services).        
	Finance ministry officials said the government had maintained the normal pecking order.        
	The RBI governor is higher in rank to the Sebi or the IRDA chairmen and this is reflected in both the warrant of precedence and in the way all meetings where these gentlemen are present are conducted.         
	However, the officials said, the committee is significant in the way it gives political executives the right to intervene in case of turf wars among the regulators. The RBI and Sebi had objected to this.        
	The bill states that the sectoral regulators will directly move the joint panel rather than the government to resolve disputes.        
	Prior to the ordinance, a turf war had raged between Sebi and the IRDA over Ulips, which have the features of an insurance product and a mutual fund.

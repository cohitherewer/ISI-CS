The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Calcutta court sets stage for DPSC share transfer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Calcutta court sets stage for DPSC share transfer
										      SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 27: Insurers LIC and GIC are likely to follow a Calcutta High Court order to conclude the sale of their respective holdings in power generator DPSC Ltd in favour of a Srei consortium.        
	The high court had directed Andrew Yule and the two insurers to transfer their combined 57.17 per cent holding tomorrow to highest bidder Srei and get paid on Friday.        
	Jyoti Poddar, director of Indian Power Company Ltd, the Srei consortium partner, said the LIC and the GIC wrote to them on Monday confirming their readiness to conclude the deal according to the court order.        
	The two public sector insurers, whose intention to sell was in doubt for the past two months, hold around 42 per cent in DPSC while the other PSU, Andrew Yule, holds 15 per cent.        
	The LIC and GIC could not be reached for comments. When contacted, Yule chairman Kallol Datta confirmed that the Centre had given the go-ahead to follow the court order. Heavy industry ministry is the nodal ministry for Yule.        
	We have received the ministrys nod, Datta said.        
	Srei and IPC had emerged as the highest bidder on November 20, 2009, to buy Bengal-based DPSC, formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Corporation Ltd, with an offer of Rs 710 a share that trumped Descons bid of Rs 705 a share in an auction.        
	A court appointed special officer who conducted the auction would preside over the proposed transaction tomorrow.        
	However, there could still be some last-minute drama.        
	Descon is believed to have moved the Supreme Court. Descon is the single largest shareholder of DPSC with a 32 per cent stake.         
	Descon believes the Calcutta court has not mentioned the mandatory open offer by DPSC. Poddar said Srei-IPCL would come out with the open offer shortly after the deal was over.

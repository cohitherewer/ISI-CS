The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | How the ABC rate IT
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      How the ABC rate it
          THE TELEGRAPH PUTS FIVE QUESTIONS TO STUDENTS OF THE COUNTRYS TOP THREE BUSINESS SCHOOLS        
	 (a) How do you rate the budget on a feel-good scale of 1-10?
  (b) What is the  budget rsquo;s big idea?
  (c) Where has the FM scored?
  (d) Where has he failed?
  (e) If you were the FM, what would you have done to keep the economic recovery going?

	(a) 7         
	(b) The strong emphasis placed on outlining a clear road map to reduce fiscal deficit with the primary focus on curtailing expenditure is a   very positive step. Also, this assumes greater credibility given the fact that the government is expected to be in power for the next three years and can actually convert the road map into reality         
	(c) The finance minister has presented an extremely balanced budget. The rationalisation of income tax slabs for individuals, steps to partially roll back the fiscal stimulus in a non-disruptive manner, increased focus on renewable energy and stepped up allocations for social welfare schemes are the highlights        
	(d) Although there are no major failures, the increase in Minimum Alternate Tax for companies from 15% to 18% has been a disappointment   
	(e) The finance minister has addressed most of the important issues. However, we would have liked to see him reduce corporate taxes (inclusive of surcharge) to 30 %. The finance minister could also have raised the exemption limit for income tax from Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh to boost private consumption

	(a) 8         
	(b) The focus on promoting inclusive growth while reining in the fiscal deficit in the long term, gradually from 5.5% of the GDP by 2010-11 to 4.1% by 2012-13 (if the finance minister walks the talk)         
	(c) By increasing the priority on physical and social sector spending. The FM has also scored on structural reforms: by altering the blanket fertiliser subsidy to a more specific, nutrient-based subsidy. The tax reforms should boost growth        
	(d) The FM could have done a better job in a few areas, the most important being measures to ensure efficient execution of social spending. Further clarity on the divestment planswould have helped solidify the fiscal position. The budget has not addressed long-term infrastructure spending plans        
	(e) Subsidies should be more specific instead of blanket ones so that the right sections of society are targeted. Some concrete measures should have been taken to ensure food security

	(a) 8         
	(b) Inclusive growth and managing the fiscal deficit are the buzzwords in the budget. The corporate sector and the common man seem to like this idea. The remarkable points are definitely the divestment targets of Rs 25,000 crore in FY 2010 and Rs 40,000 crore by FY 2011 and the huge spending boost provided to rural and urban infrastructure (Rs 1,46,000 crore)        
	(c) The burgeoning fiscal deficit has been looked into with increase in taxes on large cars and SUVs. Reducing customs duty on raw gold imports and increasing them on finished gold will boost the jewellery industry. The clean energy cess of Rs 50 per tonne on coal produced in India is a commendable step. The changes to the income tax slabs will enhance the consumption capability of the salaried individual        
	(d) By increasing indirect taxes and reducing direct tax. A chunk of the population is already suffering from inflation and they wont benefit from the lower direct taxes but will be affected by inflation induced by indirect taxes. Agricultural reforms are missing         
	(e) The spending on the agricultural sector, which took ahit because of the bad monsoon this year, could have been higher. The export sector could have been given more indirect benefits to help control the current account deficit

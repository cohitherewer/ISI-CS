	Calcutta, Sept. 2: India will have a new companies act by the end of this fiscal, corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed said today.        
	The Centre plans to table the new companies bill for the approval of Parliament in the winter session. It has received vital suggestions from the standing committee during the monsoon session, which closed recently.        
	We are very keen to table it in the winter session but given the mammoth task (considering the suggestions of the standing committee) ahead, it could be a tall ask. In that situation, the bill will be placed in the budget session, Khursheed said.        
	He was speaking at a programme of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry here today. The bill will replace the Companies Act of 1956 and will seek to address issues such as the role and responsibility of independent directors and auditors, cap on management remuneration and the power of minority shareholders compared with the promoters.         
	Khursheed said his ministry was discussing with the finance ministry on the right of minority shareholders.        
	The bill will try to address how much the companies should spend on social responsibility programmes, but the final decision may be left to the firms. Similarly, there is unlikely to be any cap on remuneration, though a guideline will be issued.        
	Earlier in the day, while speaking at the 38th convention of the Company Secretaries of India, the minister said the bill would prevent the repetition of the Satyam fraud. Handling of the Satyam case has given India a higher standing in the world. Learning from it will be reflected in the bill, he said. The bill will stress on greater accountability at various levels, strengthen the Serious Fraud Investigation Office and put in place an early warning system.

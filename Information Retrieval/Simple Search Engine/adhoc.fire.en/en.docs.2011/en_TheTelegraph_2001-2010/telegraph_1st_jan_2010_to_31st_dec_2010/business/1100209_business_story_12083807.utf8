          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Takeoff TIME                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 8: Kingfisher Airlines, Indias second largest airline by passengers carried, has hired Seabury Aviation amp; Aerospace of the US to help restructure its operations and improve its performance.        
	Kingfisher Airlines hired Seabury just weeks after it reported a net loss of Rs 626 crore in the third quarter ended December 31 while rivals posted profits. Sources said, Seabury has been hired to come in and assist us in sustaining long-term profitability by further strengthening the operational and financial performance of the company.        
	The idea is to ride the upturn in the airline market and capitalise on this opportunity using the best global practices.        
	Seabury provides expertise to the aviation sector and aerospace industry in the areas of strategy, business planning, network development and fleet optimisation.        
	Kingfisher claims the losses in the third quarter were on account of initiation costs of international operations and exchange rate impact.        
	Rivals such as SpiceJet and Jet Airways (India) posted good results in the same period. While SpiceJet reported a net profit of Rs 108.95 crore for the third quarter of 2009-10 against a net loss of nearly Rs 18 crore in the same period last year, Jet Airways posted a profit of Rs 105.80 crore during the quarter against a loss of Rs 214.18 crore.                                            
	The Kingfisher Airlines scrip today ended marginally higher at Rs 52.30, a gain of less than a per cent. The stock opened at Rs 52.80 compared with its previous close of Rs 51.80.        
	The airline has a fleet of 66 planes and a market share of nearly 24 per cent in the domestic market.

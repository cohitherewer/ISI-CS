	New Delhi, July 14: Inflation remained above 10 per cent for the fifth straight month in June, raising expectations that the Reserve Bank of India may hike interest rates for the second time this month.        
	Wholesale prices rose to 10.55 per cent in June from 10.16 per cent in May.         
	The figure for April, however, was revised to 11.23 per cent from 9.59 per cent earlier, suggesting that inflation in the coming months may be stronger than what policymakers had feared.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee sees a moderation in prices after the kharif season.         
	On an annual basis, he expects inflation to be around 5-6 per cent in 2010-11.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Infrastructure gets a boost
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Infrastructure gets a boost
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 20: The Reserve Bank today said investments of banks in bonds issued by infrastructure companies could be classified under the held to maturity (HTM) category.        
	This means banks will no longer have to mark to market their investments in such bonds. Under the mark to market system, the value of any investment, whether it is in commodities, securities or derivatives, is calculated on a daily basis. Such a method of calculation makes investments in these assets a risky proposition.        
	While the latest RBI move will encourage banks to invest in such bonds, it will also widen the scope of infrastructure companies to raise funds.        
	At present, bank investments in such non-SLR bonds are either classified as held for trading (HFT) or available for sale (AFS) and they are subject to mark to market requirements.         
	Though the RBI allowed banks to classify such bonds under the HTM category, it laid down a condition that these bonds should have a minimum residual maturity of seven years.        
	Considering that the long-term bonds issued by companies engaged in infrastructure activities are generally held by banks for a long period and not traded, it is proposed to allow banks to classify their investments in such bonds under the HTM category, the RBI said in its annual policy statement.        
	The RBIs measure led to infrastructure shares posting good gains on stock exchanges today.         
	The central bank also lowered the provisioning on infrastructure loan accounts classified as sub-standard to 15 per cent instead of the current 20 per cent.         
	However, the RBI said if banks wanted to avail themselves of the benefit of lower provisioning, they would need to have a clear and legal first claim on such cash flows.        
	In another move that would benefit toll companies and those setting up road projects, the RBI said annuities under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model in respect of road/highway projects would be treated as tangible securities. Annuities are payments made by the government to the developer of a project.         
	Many private companies engaged in road and highway projects are keen on annuities since they are not exposed to the risk of lower tolls in the event of less traffic on roads.

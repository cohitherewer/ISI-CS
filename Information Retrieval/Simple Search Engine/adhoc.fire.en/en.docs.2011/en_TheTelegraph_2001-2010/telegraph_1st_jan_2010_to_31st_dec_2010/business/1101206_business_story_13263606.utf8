        Buying term insurance plan on the Net is hassle-free and cheap, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                        
	Arun is 30 years old and his annual salary is Rs 5 lakh. At 40, his annual income will be Rs 13 lakh assuming an annual increment of 10 per cent. Imagine how much income Aruns family will lose if he suddenly dies at 40; it would be around Rs 87.5 lakh  the income that Arun would have earned in 20 years till his retirement at the age of 60.        
	But how many of us have an insurance cover of Rs 87 lakh to protect our families from any eventuality?         
	One may argue a person having an annual income of Rs 5 lakh cannot afford a premium for a Rs 87-lakh cover. But then its all about choosing the right product. You cant afford a large cover if you want any survival benefit from that plan.         
	However, a person having an annual income of Rs 5 lakh can definitely afford a Rs 87-lakh policy if he chooses a pure risk cover, called term insurance, without any survival benefit.        
	Cheap and effective        
	When an insurance plan comes with an investment or a savings component, the premium shoots up, making it difficult for many of us to afford plans with high sum assured.        
	Term insurance products have traditionally been the least expensive. Now insurers are increasingly coming out with online variety of term insurance plans making them even cheaper.         
	After the launch of iTerm plan (a term insurance which can be bought online only) by Aegon Religare Life Insurance company, at least four other insurers  ICICI Pru Life Insurance, Met Life Insurance, Kotak Life Insurance and Future Generali Life Insurance  have unveiled their online plans.         
	All these online plans are cheaper than policies sold by the insurers through agents.        
	The difference in premium cost between an online term insurance plan and a conventional term plan is significant when the sum assured is more than Rs 25 lakh.        
	Now, at the age of 30, you can buy a Rs 1-crore life cover for a 25-year term by paying a premium of only Rs 9,900 per annum.        
	Let us review these policies that can be bought over the Internet.        
	Help yourself        
	These policies are available only on the Internet. They provide you instant life cover with a simple online application process. As on date only five insurers offer online term insurance plans  AEGON Religare (iTerm plan), ICICI Prulife (iProtect), Kotak Life (e-term and e-preferred term), MetLife (Met Protect), Future Generali Life (Smart Life). Other terms and conditions of these plans are similar to the term insurance plans sold through agents.        
	So, why are online plans cheaper than conventional plans?        
	A company sells online plans directly without any intermediation of agents. Hence, there is no distribution or agency commission involved in online selling.         
	The saving in the distribution cost is passed on directly to the policyholders by reducing the premium.        
	Besides, the target customers of online policies have higher education and income levels. So, the risk of underwriting a policy is lower for the insurer. A lower underwriting risk means a lower premium.        
	Hence, in general, the minimum sum assured of online term insurance policies is much higher than conventional term insurance plans.         
	However, when the sum assured is high enough, one has to go through the requisite medical tests and the documents have to be sent to the insurer. Otherwise, the purchase of online term insurance involves easy steps.        
	Moreover, you can choose the level of sum assured and associated premium cost by working on the do-it-yourself tools provided online.         
	You can buy an online insurance plan from anywhere, home or office, and at your convenient time. You just need to have an Internet connection.         
	Careful about disclosures        
	You shall have to be careful about the disclosure of your previous illnesses correctly. If you fail to make a correct disclosure, the insurer may repudiate any claim later on the grounds of suppression of information.        
	For making online payment of premium, you can either use your credit or debit card or Internet banking account. The use of any third party credit/debit card or bank account will not be accepted.         
	You can claim tax deduction under Section 80C on the premium paid like any other life insurance plan.         
	If you are 30 years old (non-smoker) and looking for a term insurance plan for 25 years, Kotak Lifes e-term and e-preferred term plans are the cheapest for a sum assured of Rs 60 lakh. For plans with higher sum assured, ICICI Prus iProtect is the cheapest.        
	Another advantage of these plans is that they would qualify for tax deduction even in the direct taxes code. The new code proposes tax deduction for life insurance plans where the sum assured is 20 times the annual premium (see chart).        
	However, like conventional term plans sold by different insurers, online policies also vary widely in terms of the available riders, the minimum and maximum sum assured, the maximum age at maturity, the minimum age at entry and the premium paying frequency.         
	For example, while ICICI Prus iProtect provides for accidental death benefit on payment of additional premium, Kotak Lifes e-term offers the flexibility to increase or decrease the cover based on ones needs.         
	One great disadvantage of online term insurance plans is that they are offered only in select cities.         
	Time will tell        
	Since these plans have been launched recently, little is known about the claim settlement process. The buying process could be hassle-free, but to know for certain that claim settlements are also easy, one has to wait for some more time till more data are available.         
	Till that time you can continue with your conventional term insurance plan.         
	Before you settle for an online term insurance plan, look for the lowest premium among the five insurers and across different sum assured. Insurers give premium discount on higher sum assured and these levels of the sum assured vary from insurer to insurer.

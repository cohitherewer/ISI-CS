The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New faces on Tata Sons board
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      New faces on Tata Sons board
          PIYA SINGH                                  B. Muthuraman, S. Ramadorai, Ravi Kant: Fresh challenges                                 
	Mumbai, May 16: Tata Sons, the promoter of key Tata group companies, will bring in fresh blood into its board by June.        
	Former Tata group CEOs  Ravi Kant of Tata Motors, S. Ramadorai of Tata Consultancy Services and B. Muthuraman of Tata Steel  are likely to join the board of the holding company of the $71-billion Tata group.        
	The appointments are widely expected as the number of vacant positions will go up to three when Tata Sons vice-chairman Noshir A. Soonawala retires next month.        
	Soonawala, on the board of Tata companies such as Trent Ltd and Indian Hotels, will hang up his boots on turning 75, the retirement age for the groups non-executive directors. He has spent more than 40 years with the Tatas and is a close aide of group chairman Ratan Tata.        
	Last year, Syamal Gupta, another old Tata hand, retired from the Tata Sons board on reaching the retirement age of 75. The third vacancy came up after Alan Rosling quit the group last year.        
	When asked on the appointment of the three directors, a company spokesperson said, We do not wish to comment on speculation.         
	The three senior Tata executives, who are likely to be inducted by June-end, are currently engaged in more of a strategic role rather than dealing with day-to-day operations as vice-chairmen of their respective companies after they retired as chief executive officers on reaching the age of 65 years.         
	The trio had spearheaded international acquisitions, including the buyout of Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus and British brands Jaguar and Land Rover, playing key roles in expanding the groups overseas footprint.        
	Once they are on the Tata Sons board, they will join existing directors, including Cyrus Pallonji Mistry (who is also a major shareholder of Tata Sons), Farrokh K. Kavarana, Jamshed J. Irani , R. Gopalakrishnan, Ishaat Hussain, R.K. Krishna Kumar and Arunkumar Gandhi. Ratan N. Tata is the chairman of Tata Sons.         
	Core group        
	The three Tata executives, likely to join Tata Sons, may also become part of the group corporate centre (GCC), a forum to review the broad policy for the growth of Tata companies. It is a powerful body within the Tata group and several Tata Sons directors are members of GCC.

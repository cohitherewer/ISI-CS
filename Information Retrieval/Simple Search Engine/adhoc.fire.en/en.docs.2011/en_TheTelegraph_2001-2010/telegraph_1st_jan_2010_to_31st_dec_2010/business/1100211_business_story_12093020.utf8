The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telenor hikes Uninor stake
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Telenor hikes Uninor stake
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          New call                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: Norways Telenor today acquired 7.15 per cent in Unitech Wireless, a subsidiary of realty major Unitech, taking its stake to 67.25 per cent.        
	In the last round of the four-tranche deal, Telenor will pay Rs 2,022 crore to Unitech Wireless for the 7.15 per cent stake. Telenors total investment in Unitech now stands at Rs 6,135 crore, up from Rs 4,113 crore in January when it paid Rs 1,493 crore to raise its stake to 60.1 per cent from 49 per cent.        
	The remaining 32.75 per cent of Unitech Wireless will remain with the New Delhi-based Unitech group, the company said.         
	The Indian government had, in October 2009, given its nod to Telenor to increase its stake to 74 per cent in Unitech Wireless, but the company has no plans to hike its shareholding further.        
	The agreement with Unitech says our ownership is 67.25 per cent. We have no plans to change that, Christian Storm, spokesperson for Telenor, told The Telegraph.         
	Unitech Wireless launched mobile services in December under the Uninor brand and has operations in eight of Indias 22 telecom zones. It holds a licence for all of India and is eyeing an 8 per cent share of the market by 2018.        
	The company will enter Mumbai, Maharashtra, Bengal and Madhya Pradesh over the next few months, while Calcutta will see the Uninor brand by March.         
	This injection of equity will provide Uninor with working capital to continue the rollout in new circles, and to secure customer growth in the circles where Uninor is present, said Sigve Brekke, executive vice-president of Telenors Asian operations.

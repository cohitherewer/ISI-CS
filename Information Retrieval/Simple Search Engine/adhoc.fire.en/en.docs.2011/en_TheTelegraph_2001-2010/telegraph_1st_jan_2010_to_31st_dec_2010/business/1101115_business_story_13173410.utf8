The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | For daughter
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      For daughter
                                I pay life insurance premium for my married daughter and her son as a token of gift. Can I claim tax benefit for this premium payment?          Y.C. Chakraborty, Dum Dum
                    Relief under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act is available for premium paid on the life insurance policies on the lives of adult children, irrespective of their status; for example, premium paid on a policy for a married daughter.                                  Legal help      I had made a fixed deposit of Rs 6,000 in July 2004 with Rahuta Union Co-operative Bank Ltd, Shyamnagar, 24 Parganas (N). The fixed deposit came up for maturity in July 2006. But till date the bank didnt pay me the maturity amount despite several written requests. I had also written to the RBI. The RBI replied on two occasions. How can I get back my money now? I am above 66 years of age.        Sadananda Mandal, Athpur
                    According to the reply from the RBI, the apex bank said it had cancelled the banking licence of Rahuta Union Co-operative Bank. This means the bank is no longer regulated by the RBI. The only means left before you is to approach the court of law and sue the co-operative bank for non-payment of the maturity amount. It is surprising why people deposit their hard earned money with such unscrupulous entities when there are mainstream commercial banks like the SBI.                                  Tax relief course      I retired in October 2009. I am receiving an interest of Rs 3,400 per month from a monthly income scheme (MIS). Is the interest amount taxable? Is there any tax relief available on the interest amount under the Income Tax Act?        S. Sensharma, Bansdroni
                    You get a monthly interest of Rs 3,400. This amounts to Rs 40,800 a year. The Income Tax Act specified that interest income above Rs 10,000 a year will be subject to TDS. If you are already an income tax payer, you shall have to include the interest income to your total annual income and pay tax there on. However, if you invest the principal amount deposited in the MIS in the dividend option of an equity mutual fund, you dont have to pay any tax on the dividend income.

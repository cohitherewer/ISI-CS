The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panel bars traders on bourse boards
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Panel bars traders on bourse boards
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jalan: Fixing norms                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 23: A committee headed by Bimal Jalan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has recommended that no trading or clearing member should be allowed on the board of a stock exchange.        
	It also said that only domestic institutions with a net worth of at least Rs 1,000 crore should be included as an anchor investor at a bourse.        
	The committee was appointed by Sebi to examine issues arising from the ownership and governance of market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) that include stock exchanges, depositories and clearing corporations.         
	The panel recommended that the concept of anchor investors be extended to stock exchanges. While public financial institutions and banks can fall under this category, a single anchor investor can hold up to 24 per cent. However, every anchor investor will have to bring down its holding to 15 per cent in 10 years from the time it is recognised as an anchor investor. The combined holding of all anchor investors should not exceed 49 per cent.        
	The panel said no trading member should be allowed to be on the board of a stock exchange since this would give rise to a conflict of interest since board members were privy to a lot of confidential information.         
	The committee was also not in favour of listing the MIIs.         
	The recommendations drew flak from Joseph Massey, managing director and CEO of MCX Stock Exchange.         
	We fail to understand that when the banking and insurance sectors  are allowed to raise capital through listing, why a case is being made for lesser competition in stock exchanges. It has also been recommended that stock exchanges should not be able to raise capital from market. This will prevent new entrants in the exchange space, he added.

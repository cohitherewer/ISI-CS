	Lucknow, May 7: Anil Ambani may not find land for his Dadri power project now even if he gets gas from his elder brother.         
	Almost 1,200 of the total 1,600 farmer families at Dadri, whose over 2,500 acres were acquired by Anil Ambani in 2004 for the project, have re-acquired their land after an Allahabad High Court order of December 2009 scrapped the land deal. Some others have filed petitions to reclaim their land. Late Prime Minister V.P. Singh had filed a petition to review the land deal in the high court on behalf of farmers in 2007.         
	District officials in Ghaziabad said 605 farmers had initially approached the district authorities in January. By the second week of February, 1,171 farmers had taken back their land after returning their payment. Today this figure stands at 1,200.         
	Every day some farmers are approaching the magistrate and filing re-claim petitions, Vinod Singh, a former aide of V.P. Singh, told The Telegraph.         
	Allahabad High Court extended its deadline for filing petitions to reclaim land by three more months in March till June. The deadline was to end in March this year.         
	Anil Ambani had filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against the Allahabad High Courts order.         
	The court refused to grant a stay and the petition is expected to come up for hearing in July this year.         
	Even if Anils company starts a fresh move to acquire land in Dadri honouring the order of the high court, it will be difficult because chief minister Mayavati is against the project. She would make it more difficult for Anil Ambani, a senior secretary in the industry department told The Telegraph.         
	But a spokesman for RNRL said the company would buy land at commercial rates from the farmers in the area.

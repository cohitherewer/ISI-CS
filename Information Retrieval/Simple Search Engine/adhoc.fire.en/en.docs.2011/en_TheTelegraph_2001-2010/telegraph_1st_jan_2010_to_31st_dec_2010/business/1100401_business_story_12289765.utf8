	 Genpact has denied that it is in discussions for a listing on Indian bourses (India Listing on Genpact Screen, The Telegraph, March 30). The report inaccurately interpreted a comment made by Pramod Bhasin, president and CEO of Genpact, to a television channel recently. The company has also said it isnt looking to dip into its cash reserves to buy out companies in areas such as travel, hospitality and infrastructure management services. We would like to apologise to Genpact for any confusion and anxiety that our report may have caused within the global investor community.

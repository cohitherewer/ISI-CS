          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 24: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today called for consolidation to bring down fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent by 2010-13.         
	Now time has come to revert to the course of fiscal consolidation as the path of fiscal expansion cant be sustained for a long time, Mukherjee said.        
	The countrys fiscal deficit had zoomed to 6.8 per cent last fiscal on account of the stimulus packages rolled out in the wake of the global financial crisis.         
	The government expects to reduce its deficit through windfall earnings from the sale of 3G spectrum and wireless broadband radiowaves.

          JAYATI GHOSE                          Welcome move                                  
	New Delhi, March 16: Microfinance institutions, which lend to the poor, plan to reduce loan rates and improve the rules of business.        
	Sa-Dhan, the national association of microfinance institutions, is coming out with a code of conduct, which will lay down strict rules to curb multiple lending (same borrower taking loans from several institutions), unethical recovery tactics and lending limits.         
	The code will also promote transparency, data sharing and corporate governance issues of such institutions.        
	Recently, the RBI issued a warning to microfinance institutions against wrong practices, including loans to cover up existing bad loans. The central bank had also sought a reduction in lending rates.        
	At present, microfinance institutions provide loans at 24-28 per cent.         
	There is a huge scope for lending rates to come down and members are in the process of reviewing the cost of funds and cost of operations to examine the possibilities of reducing lending rates, Mathew Titus, executive director of Sa-Dhan, told The Telegraph.        
	Industry estimates suggest that the break-even rate for micro finance lending is 24 per cent because of the small size of the loans.        
	We are also setting up a industry sourcing mechanism to bring down the cost of funds, Titus said.         
	At present, microfinance institutions negotiate with banks and financial institutions on an individual basis for loans, which does not give them access to the best borrowing rates.         
	Moreover, the cost of funds for MFIs has gone up 2-2.5 per cent over the last one year to 13.5 per cent as banks have turned conservative in the wake of the recent economic downturn, Titus said.        
	Jayshree Vyas, chairperson of Sa-Dhan, said, Once mobile banking takes off, the cost of operations would come down for micro finance institutions.        
	Vyas said apart from lending, Sa-Dhan is also looking at expanding the scope of MFIs to foray into collecting deposits and providing insurance and pension products.        
	Total outstanding loans issued by the Indian microfinance segment stood at Rs 11,700 crore in 2009, a 13- fold increase from the Rs 897-crore it was worth in 2005.        
	The Congress-led UPA government is also keen to promote MFIs to achieve larger financial inclusion goals.         
	In Budget 2010-11, the finance minister announced an additional Rs 100 crore for funding vehicles  Financial Inclusion Fund and Financial Inclusion Technology Fund  taking their corpus to Rs 600 crore each.         
	The funds are targeted at offering support to business facilitators, business correspondents, self help groups, micro finance institutions, NGOs and joint liability groups involved in the financial inclusion drive.         
	The government had set up the Financial Inclusion Fund and the Financial Inclusion Technology Fund with Nabard in early 2008 to take banking services to the unbanked areas.

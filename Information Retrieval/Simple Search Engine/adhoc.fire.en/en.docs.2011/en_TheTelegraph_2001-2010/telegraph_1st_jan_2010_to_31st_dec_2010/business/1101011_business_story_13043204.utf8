	Washington, Oct. 10 (Agencies): Emerging powers won a battle on Saturday for heightened IMF scrutiny of rich countries economic policies as world financial leaders sought to defuse mounting tensions over currencies.        
	The International Monetary Funds 187-member countries gave voice to the long running frustrations of emerging economies, which say the Fund has traditionally not been tough enough on its biggest shareholders, led by the United States.        
	Now, with the United States and Europe in the doldrums, and emerging economies providing the major growth engine for the world, the tables appear to be turning. Stronger and even-handed surveillance to uncover vulnerabilities in large advanced economies is a priority, the IMFs steering committee said in a communique.        
	The statement reflected the arguments of developing countries that weak finances and sluggish growth in the US are a fundamental cause of imbalances in the global economy, with US policies fuelling the dollar weakness that is causing strains for many emerging market currencies.        
	The IMF is no longer the institution designed to look after the developing countries solely, said Thailands finance minister Korn Chatikavanij. Its role needs to be more broad-based, and it needs to realise that mistakes in the larger economies have global impact.        
	The US, in contrast, has pointed its finger at China, saying its huge current account surplus and undervalued yuan currency are partly to blame for the imbalances that have caused the dollar to fall and raised concerns about a currency war.        
	Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India today said it might intervene in the foreign exchange market if FII inflows were volatile.        
	If the inflows are lumpy and volatile or if they disrupt the macroeconomic situation, we will do so (intervene). Our intervention will be to keep liquidity conditions consistent with activity in the real economy and to maintain financial stability, RBI governor D. Subbarao said at a panel discussion here.        
	No deal on currencies        
	World finance leaders struck no deal on currencies but their IMF communique sought to defuse these escalating tensions by acknowledging both sides points of view. But it laid out no concrete actions for addressing the problems of unbalanced global growth that underlies the mounting stress in foreign exchange markets.

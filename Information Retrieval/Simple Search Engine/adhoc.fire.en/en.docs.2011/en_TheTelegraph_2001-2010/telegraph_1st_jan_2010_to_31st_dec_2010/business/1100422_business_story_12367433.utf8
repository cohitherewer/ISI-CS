                              Corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed with Assocham president Swati Piramal in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                            
	New Delhi, April 21 (PTI): The government is keen to apply Sebis corporate governance norms on unlisted companies and may include them in the companies bill to this end.        
	We are harmonising... The appropriate best practices that are seen in Clause 49 (of Sebis listing agreement) will have to be brought in the new companies bill, corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed said.         
	Best practice standards have to be imposed on everyone appropriately, Khursheed told reporters on the sidelines of an Assocham event.        
	But the compliance cost has to be kept in mind, looking at different levels and sizes of the companies, he said.        
	The new companies bill was tabled in Parliament last year. At present, it is with a House panel.        
	Clause 49 of Sebis listing agreement requires companies to fill half of their board with independent directors if the chairman is executive and one-third if the chairman is non-executive.        
	The Companies Bill 2009 has slightly different norms for listed companies.        
	Clause 49 also requires companies to establish and maintain internal controls, submit a quarterly compliance report to stock exchanges, enclose a separate section on corporate governance in annual reports and have an audit committee.         
	Khursheed said the best of these provisions might be extended to unlisted companies as well.         
	Ulip impasse        
	Khursheed today downplayed fears that investors would lose confidence because of the row between Sebi and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority over market-linked insurance policies (Ulips), as the issue would be resolved in favour of either one regulator or the other by the courts.        
	Investors will have confidence that at the end of the day, even if there is disagreement between regulators, one regulator will prevail (over the Ulip issue). Its only a matter of time, one regulator will prevail. So investors need not worry, he said.         
	The two regulators are relatively new institutions, and there are bound to be overlaps in their functioning, Khursheed said.

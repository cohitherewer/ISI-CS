The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Holcim to cement local base
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Holcim to cement local base
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Kamal Nath in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: Holcim plans to invest $1.1 billion to set up two to three manufacturing plants in India.        
	The Swiss cement major, which controls both ACC and Ambuja Cements, aims to increase its capacity to 60 million tonnes (mt) per annum in the next five years.        
	We will set up two to three facilities with a capacity of 2-3mt each, Paul Hugentobler, executive committee member of Holcim, said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry on the use of concrete in highways.        
	Holcim holds a 46.21 per cent stake in ACC and 45.67 per cent in Ambuja Cements.        
	At present, ACC has a capacity of 26mt  which will go up to 30mt this year  while Ambuja Cements has 20mt capacity.         
	Hugentobler said the new plants would be set up in limestone-rich states but did not identify the locations. He did not divulge the investment amount, but according to industry estimates, setting up a 3mt plant costs around Rs 1,800 crore. Adding 10mt to capacity, therefore, will cost around Rs 6,000 crore, which is approximately $1.1 billion.        
	Speaking at the seminar, Union road transport minister Kamal Nath said the government might look at using cement instead of bitumen to construct over 18,000 km of expressways.

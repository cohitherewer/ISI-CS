	Calcutta, Aug. 5: Yamaha Motor plans to increase its market share in two-wheelers to 10 per cent within two years from 3.1 per cent now.         
	The Japanese company has plans to infuse Rs 200 crore to ramp up assembling capacity in India in the next two years.        
	We target to increase sales to over 3 lakh units in India this year from 2 lakh units last year. Exports from India will also grow up to 1.5 lakh units this year from 85,000 units last year, Koji Arai, director and chief sales officer, India Yamaha Motor, said here today.        
	The company will be manufacturing 4.5 lakh units during the current year. It has an installed capacity of 6 lakh units per annum at its Faridabad factory in Haryana.        
	Yamaha exports bikes to Latin America, Africa, the Philippines, the Saarc nations and Argentina.        
	If needed, we can ramp up capacity at this factory by increasing one more shift, Miwa Kunihiko, senior executive officer, Yamaha Motor Co Ltd, said.         
	The company has invested Rs 600 crore and committed an investment of Rs 800 crore.

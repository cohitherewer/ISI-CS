                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Go single this monsoon
        Single-premium Ulip is a better investment choice this season, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                      
	Come September, your employer will ask you to produce investment documents to claim income tax deduction to determine how much more tax will be deducted from your salary every month till March 2011. So, where are you planning to invest this time to save tax?         
	Life insurance policies have traditionally been one of the most preferred options for many, and unit-linked life insurance plans (Ulips) have become a craze since their launch.         
	After September, Ulips will give policyholders a higher return because of the rationalisation of cost structure under the new regulations.                   
	However, the minimum annual premium for regular policies will go up and most insurers believe the threshold annual premium across the industry will be around Rs 20,000 compared to Rs 6,000 now. Low-ticket customers will have to be satisfied with traditional plans.         
	But have you ever thought that single-premium Ulips can serve your investment and tax saving purposes more efficiently than any other instrument?         
	Investor myth        
	When it comes to buying a life insurance plan, most of us go for the regular premium policies thinking that single-premium plans are for those with deep pockets.                   
	But single-premium policies are more investor friendly than the regular plans. This is because the premium allocation charge in a single-premium policy is far less than in a regular scheme.         
	You can buy a higher cover and get a better return through a single premium than a regular policy or an equity-linked mutual fund.         
	To illustrate this, we considered three options  a single-premium Ulip, a regular premium Ulip and ELSS  for a 30-year-old investing Rs 1 lakh a year (this is in line with the maximum deduction available under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act).         
	For single and regular premium Ulips, we considered SBI Lifes Unit Plus III plan. The gross investment return (before all charges) for all the three investment options are assumed at 10 per cent compounded annually and the investment period is kept at 10 years.        
	Now, if the lock-in period in a Ulip is five years, the investor can invest Rs 1 lakh every year for six years to buy single-premium policies so that he can receive the survival benefits from all these policies at the end of 10 years. In the first year, he buys a single-premium policy for 10 years, in the next year he buys a policy for 9 years and so on.                   
	Here, we have assumed that the sum assured in each policy is five times the single premium amount, that is, a sum assured of Rs 5 lakh for a single premium of Rs 1 lakh. This is because under the current provision of the Income Tax Act, the tax benefit is not available for a premium amount which is more than 20 per cent of the sum assured.         
	Shun the regular        
	Table 1 shows that the investor will receive a total survival benefit of Rs 10,13, 357 from his six single-premium policies at the end of 10 years. If he dies between the sixth and the tenth year, his family will receive a death benefit of Rs 30 lakh.        
	Now, if he buys a regular premium Ulip for 10 years and pays an annual premium of Rs 60,000, his survival benefit at the end of 10 years will amount to Rs 8,86,713 at a gross return of 10 per cent per annum (see Table 2).         
	Here we have assumed the sum assured at 20 times the annual premium, or Rs 12 lakh (this is in line with the definition of pure insurance under the new direct tax code).         
	The survival benefit will be even lower if the sum assured is increased to 50 times the annual premium, or Rs 30 lakh.        
	Investment in single-premium Ulips is, thus, more beneficial than a regular premium policy, both in terms of insurance cover and return.         
	Mutual discontent        
	Table 3 illustrates investment in mutual funds.         
	As in Table 1, here the investor invests Rs 1 lakh every year for the first six years and after 10 years his investment stands at Rs 10,62,572.         
	Here, we have assumed that mutual fund has an expense ratio of 2 per cent.         
	A comparison between Table 1 and Table 3 reveals that the return from mutual fund investment is Rs 50,215 more than from single-premium Ulips. But the investor gets Rs 30 lakh insurance cover in a single-premium Ulip investment which is not there for mutual funds.         
	Thus, by choosing the single-premium Ulip over a mutual fund, the investor forgos Rs 50,215 for a Rs 30-lakh insurance cover. A sum assured of Rs 30 lakh for just Rs 50,215 is a great bargain.         
	Now, that you are making last-minute investments to meet your employers September deadline, a Ulip can be a good choice to address your twin concerns of tax savings and return .

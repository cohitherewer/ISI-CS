          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          C.K. Birla in Calcutta on Tuesday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 10: The CK Birla group plans to inject fresh capital into ailing Hindustan Motors so that it is not referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).        
	The company, which makes the Ambassador at its factory near Calcutta and the Mitsubishi range of passenger cars in Chennai, may sell real estate or some of its stake in auto component maker Avtec.        
	The company is also exploring opportunities to carry out contract manufacturing for foreign firms to utilise the excess capacity at its Chennai plant.        
	The company makes around 6,000 units in Chennai, while the capacity is for 24,000 units.        
	Hind Motors net worth stood at Rs 164 crore by the end of June 30, 2010 and its accumulated loss was around Rs 152 crore, representing an erosion of around 92.5 per cent of the net worth.        
	A company is referred to the BIFR and declared sick if its net worth is fully eroded. While such a status provides protection from creditors, it restrains the promoters and the management from independently running the company, which is generally put under the charge of an operating agency (bank or financial institution).        
	Hindustan Motors suffered a Rs 19.73-crore net loss during the quarter ended June 30 and the company would certainly be referred to the BIFR unless the promoters/management brought in money.        
	Speaking to reporters after the annual general meeting of the company, Chandra Kant Birla, chairman of Hindustan Motors, said the company would sell a building in Chennai for about Rs 20-25 crore.        
	If the deal is done, the company will tide itself over the crisis for the next one quarter. However, senior company officials said that was only one of the options the company was looking at.        
	The company may sell some stake to Mitsubishi. A senior official said the Japanese major had the choice to pick up a stake in the company.         
	Similarly, stake sale in auto component maker Avtec is an option. Hindustan Motors owns 49 per cent of Avtec, which was created in 2005 after carving out the ancillary business from the auto maker.         
	Private equity player Actis is the second largest shareholder in Avtec where some CK Birla group companies also have shares.        
	Hindustan Motors had been selling assets in the past to stay afloat. It had sold off excess land around the Uttarpara plant near Calcutta in 2007.        
	New Ambassador        
	Hindustan Motors managing director Manoj Jha said the company was working on a new Ambassador model, which would be different in terms of style and performance.        
	We hope to launch it by the middle of next year. Focus is on re-styling and improving reliability, he said. The model will be an entry-level sedan with a special focus on the diesel variant.        
	Hindustan Motors makes around 10,000 Ambassadors a year at Uttarpara and this could go up to 15,000 on an annualised basis by the end of this year.

	New Delhi, July 20: The Reserve Bank of India, which is keeping a close watch on inflation, will further tighten its monetary policy if there is excess liquidity in the system, cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar said today.        
	If inflation is on account of excess liquidity, then obviously it will call for more monetary measures. The RBI is constantly watching this issue and will be taking the right measures as it goes along, Chandrasekhar said.         
	He said, The RBI will have to take a call on whether inflation is on account of high money supply, certain sectoral reasons or supply constraints. The apex bank is slated to review its monetary policy on July 27 and is expected to hike its key policy rates  the short-term lending (repo) and borrowing (reverse repo) rates, which stand at 5.5 and 4 per cent, respectively.

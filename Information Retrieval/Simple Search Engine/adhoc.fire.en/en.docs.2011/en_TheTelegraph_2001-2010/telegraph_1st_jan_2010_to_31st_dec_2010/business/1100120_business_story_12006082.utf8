The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cadbury bites $19bn Kraft bait
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cadbury bites $19bn Kraft bait
                                          
	New York/London, Jan. 19 (Agencies): After months of fierce resistance, Cadbury agreed on Tuesday to an improved takeover offer from Kraft, worth about $19 billion, to create the worlds largest confectioner.        
	Kraft, the maker of Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, together with Cadbury, the producer of Trident gum and Dairy Milk chocolates, will have more than $50 billion in annual revenue and a big presence in markets from the United States to India.         
	The deal continues a trend seen over the last decade, where food companies have sought to gain scale by combining with one another. Most recently, Mars bought the William Wrigley Jr. Co. in 2008 for $23 billion.        
	Kraft had to inject more cash into its bid and drop the number of new Kraft shares in the offer to win over Cadbury and mollify the confectioners top shareholder, billionaire investor Warren Buffett.        
	Krafts cash-and-share deal values each Cadbury share at 840 pence, with shareholders set to get a 10p special dividend, bringing it to a total of 850p, which prompted a unanimous recommendation from the Cadbury board in favour of the deal.        
	The shares of Cadbury today jumped nearly 4 per cent to touch its year-high on the London Stock Exchange. The scrip jumped to a 52-week high of 838 pence in the morning trade over its previous days close of 805.5 pence.        
	The new bid consists of 500p of cash and 0.1874 new Kraft shares compared with Krafts original offer of 300p cash and 0.2589 new Kraft shares, which valued the shares in September when the deal was first proposed at 745p.        
	Roger Carr, chairman of Cadbury, who had used harsh language in fighting off the original bid, said in a joint statement that the new offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders.        
	Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and chief executive of Kraft, said for her company, the deal transforms the portfolio, accelerates long-term growth and delivers highly attractive returns.        
	Tuesday was the last day for Kraft to raise its offer under British takeover rules. Cadbury shareholders now have until 1 pm London time on February 2 to decide whether to accept it. While the terms of the offer are final, Kraft reserved the right to raise its bid if a rival offer is made.        
	The deal would bring to a close an often-acrimonious battle between the two companies. The Cadbury management called the original offer derisory and dismissed the prospect of being absorbed into what it called a slow-growing food conglomerate.        
	The prospect of a takeover of the 186-year-old British institution, especially by an American multinational such as Kraft, also had sent shudders throughout Britain and prompted a wave of public protests. The Mail on Sunday, one of Britains biggest-selling newspapers, ran a Keep Cadbury British campaign.         
	Politicians and unions have pointed to the loss of jobs and of national pride.         
	Cadbury had argued repeatedly that it would prefer to remain independent, pointing to faster-than-expected success in its turnaround programme.         
	Representatives for Cadbury had held talks with Hershey, the American company whom Cadbury viewed as a preferable merger partner, according to people briefed on the matter.        
	Other potential suitors, including Nestl of Switzerland and Ferrero of Italy, had dropped out.        
	The offer announced on Tuesday does not require the approval of Kraft shareholders, Kraft said.        
	Indian business         
	Cadbury today said India would remain a key market for its business.        
	Declining to comment on the implications of the takeover on the Indian business, a Cadbury spokesperson said India would continue to be a key market.        
	It is too early to talk about implications it will have but India will be a key market and focus will definitely be there. It (the Indian market) is already a significant contributor to Cadburys global business, the spokesperson said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sharp dip in food inflation
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sharp dip in food inflation
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 1: Food inflation declined 3.98 percentage points to 12.92 per cent in the third week of June because the price rise was less pronounced in vegetables and cereals.         
	The drop in food inflation will provide some respite to the government, struggling hard to control the prices of essential items. However, the reprieve may be short-lived as last weeks diesel price hike is expected to push up the prices again, analysts said.         
	Even for the week under review, items such as pulses, fruits and milk remained quite expensive. On a yearly basis, potatoes became cheaper by about 40 per cent and onion prices eased over 7 per cent because of rains.        
	The dip in food inflation was largely because of the high base effect, which means inflation was so high during the same time last year that the rate of price rise now looks comparatively lower. The base effect was responsible for lower inflation in vegetables and cereals, though in case of the latter improved supplies played a part.         
	It feels like there is still a sustained rise in food prices. Perhaps that is why food inflation did not come down as much as we anticipated. The increase in fuel prices will be more than the drop in food prices. The net impact will be a higher WPI number for June, N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said. In May, general inflation accelerated to 10.16 per cent from 9.59 per cent in the previous month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ITC in Oberoi stake reshuffle 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ITC in Oberoi stake reshuffle 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, April 5: In a surprise move, ITC has acquired the 14.98 per cent stake in EIH  which owns the Oberoi chain of hotels  from its wholly-owned subsidiary Russell Credit.        
	The tobacco-to-hotels conglomerate took control of the 5.88 crore shares in EIH from Russell Credit in an off-market deal valued at Rs 215.69 crore. The deal was sealed on March 30  a day before the close of the financial year.        
	EIH informed the bourses this evening about the stake transfer.        
	The off-market trade values each EIH share acquired at Rs 36.64. This seemed to be the historic cost at which the stake had been acquired by several ITC group companies through market transactions at different points of time.        
	The EIH stock closed on Monday at Rs 126.65. The stock has been sliding since the start of the year after touching a high of Rs 146 on January 6.        
	The transfer will immediately make ITCs books richer by a notional Rs 529.83 crore given that the market value of the 14.98 per cent holding in EIH is Rs 745.52 crore.        
	Prima facie, the stake rejig will not impact ITC shareholders as the shares are being transferred from a 100 per cent subsidiary to the parent.        
	The consolidated results of the tobacco major would have reflected the same gains.         
	When asked to explain the rationale for the inter se stake transfer, the ITC spokesperson sought time to come up with a reply, which didnt eventually come through.        
	The stake transfer has fanned speculation about ITCs intentions.         
	The group has held the stake for close to a decade, sparking talks of a hostile takeover. ITC has always maintained that the stake purchase was a mere investment decision.         
	But ITC couldnt explain why it came within a whisker of the 15 per cent threshold that would have automatically triggered an open offer for another 20 per cent in EIH under Sebi regulations.        
	Indias largest tobacco company initially bought into EIH in 2000 through Peninsular Investments and New Deal Finance.         
	Another group investment company Megatop Financial Services teamed up with the others during the April-June quarter of 2001.        
	ITC scaled up its holding to over 14 per cent but never crossed the critical threshold that would have triggered a takeover battle with the Oberois.        
	Virginia House decided to consolidate the EIH holding in a single entity  Russell Credit  during the April-June quarter of 2008.        
	Last year, ITC made a friendly overture to the Oberois proposing to develop hotel properties together and sharing of brand identity  which was immediately spurned.         
	The Oberoi family then tried to bring in serial entrepreneur Analjit Singh  an original promoter of Vodafone Essar  as a white knight to protect itself from ITC.        
	The deal between Analjit Singh and the Oberois has yet to be formally inked.         
	ITC may have started to see the futility of upping the ante now. If it chooses to sell its stake now, it can exit with a sizeable profit.        
	Tax issues        
	Tax experts say ITC may be able to save on taxes should it decide to sell its holding in EIH.        
	The transfer from Russell Credit to ITC would not attract any tax. ITC will also not have to pay any short-term capital gains tax if it sells within a year. ITCs cost of acquisition would be treated as the same as its wholly owned subsidiary, said a corporate tax expert.        
	Had Russell Credit sold the shares and booked a profit, it would not have had to pay capital gains tax either. However, it may have had to pay a dividend distribution tax if it wanted to transfer the profit to ITC through dividends.        
	Dividends and a merger are two of the simplest ways to transfer profits from a wholly-owned subsidiary to a parent company, said one tax expert.

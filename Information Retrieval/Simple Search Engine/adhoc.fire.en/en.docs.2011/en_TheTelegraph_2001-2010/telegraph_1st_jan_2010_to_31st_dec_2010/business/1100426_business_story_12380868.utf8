The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Power shift at World Bank
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Power shift at World Bank
                                          
	Washington, April 25 (Reuters): The World Bank on Sunday agreed to give emerging economies greater influence in the institution, a shift that puts China third in voting power behind the United States and Japan.        
	The agreement will increase the votes of developing countries by 3.13 per cent, contributing $1.6 billion to World Bank resources. In addition, members agreed to a capital increase of $3.5 billion for the bank  the first in more than 20 years.        
	We can feel proud that we have concluded agreements on a transformative financial and governance reform agenda, along with new capital for the World Bank and a new and more representative shareholding formula, US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner had said in a statement earlier in the day.        
	He also said that the US, which holds the largest voting share in the World Bank at 16.4 per cent, would not seek any increase for itself under a revised voting formula that is to better reflect developing countries economic heft.        
	Because we believe this overall outcome merits our strong endorsement, the US has agreed not to take up its full shareholding in this new arrangement, Geithner said.        
	Geithner said the World Bank deserved more capital to help it in efforts like helping Afghanistan to develop more productive farming and for relief efforts such as those it has undertaken in Haiti after it was struck by an earthquake.        
	The World Bank had asked for a capital increase of $3 billion to $5 billion, allocated proportionally among its members.        
	Geithner said he considered the World Bank had made a strong and compelling case for a $3.5 billion increase and said he would ask Congress to approve the US share of it.        
	IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, on Saturday, tipped journalists off to a possible World Bank agreement during a news conference, saying they achieved their shift in quota ... but at least I wont talk on behalf of (World Bank president) Mr (Robert) Zoellick.        
	The talks have been difficult because advanced economies, especially those in Europe, have been unwilling to give up some of their voting shares, and the US is holding on to its veto power.        
	Smaller European countries have been concerned that even a small change in their voting power would mean a marked reduction in their influence.        
	Earlier this week, World Bank President Robert Zoellick urged the Banks 186 member countries to set aside differences to reach an agreement by Sunday, the last day of the IMF and World Bank meetings.        
	Greece hope        
	The IMF said on Sunday it had accelerated discussions with Greece and will conclude talks on an aid package in time to meet Greeces funding needs.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 30: Retail investors in stocks may have a lot to cheer about but risk-averse people who prefer to park their money in dividend-yielding equity mutual funds may be forced to scout about for alternative options before the direct tax bill comes into effect by April 1, 2012.        
	Salaried people, who funnel their money directly into stocks, will be gung ho over the fact that they will not have to pay a capital gains tax on equity investments that they hold for more than a year  a tax break they enjoy at present and which the original bill had intended to scrap.        
	But even more attractive is the provision that says the short-term capital gains tax levied on stocks flipped before 12 months  will be linked to an individuals income tax slab.        
	In the case of investments held for less than one year, short-term capital gains tax will be levied in three slabs of 5, 10 and 15 per cent, respectively. This is 50 per cent of the marginal rate of income tax  10 per cent for those with an income between Rs 1.6 lakh and Rs 5 lakh, 20 per cent in the income bracket between Rs 5 and 8 lakh, and 30 per cent for those with incomes above Rs 8 lakh.        
	At present, the short-term capital gains tax is a flat 15 per cent irrespective of the tax slab that the investor belongs to.        
	Individuals in the low-income bracket will have to pay a capital gains tax of 5 per cent. Only those in the top income bracket will have to pay 15 per cent as they do at present. Tax experts say that if the surcharge is included the short-term capital gains tax actually goes up to well over 16 per cent.        
	Vishal Malhotra, tax partner at Ernst amp; Young, told The Telegraph that the changes proposed in the short-term capital gains tax should encourage small salaried earners to invest in stocks as they will be subject to a lower rate of tax than in the current regime.        
	Market circles also reacted positively to the new capital gains tax proposals.        
	These will induce greater investments in the stock markets, particularly from the retail end. The markets were apprehensive over the proposals pertaining to capital gains tax. It is heartening to see that zero long-term capital gains tax has been maintained, said a research head from a brokerage.         
	Mutual fund woes        
	The big blow to mutual fund investors is the fact that income distributed by mutual funds to unit holders of equity-oriented fund or that distributed by life insurer to policy holders of an approved equity-oriented life insurance scheme will be taxed at 5 per cent.        
	According to Gautam Mehra, executive director at PwC, this will impact returns from the stock markets.        
	Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research, said the 5 per cent dividend distribution tax would prompt mutual fund investors to move away from dividend-paying schemes and opt for growth plans.

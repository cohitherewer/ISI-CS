          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram: Holiday mood				                                 
	New Delhi, July 8: The government today granted a three-year rig holiday to oil explorers, helping Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Reliance Industries to retain oil blocks that they otherwise might have lost for not meeting their drilling commitments.        
	The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) has approved the grant of a drilling moratorium (holiday) of three years to all deepwater blocks where drilling commitments are pending as on January 1, 2009, home minister P. Chidambaram said.        
	Besides ONGC and Reliance, Italys Eni now gets time till the end of this year to complete drilling that was due to be over by 2007.        
	The objective of the holiday is to enable the contractors to meet the drilling commitments under various production sharing contracts, which have been adversely affected on account of the worldwide shortage of deep water rigs since 2007, because of the then prevailing high crude prices, Chidambaram said.        
	Soaring oil prices in 2007 and 2008 had caused a huge shortage of rigs, which had prevented companies from fulfilling their commitments. The oil ministry at ONGC and Reliances request had moved the cabinet in late 2008 to grant a holiday, but a decision was deferred several times.        
	Chidambaram said the moratorium would apply to 30 blocks  16 of ONGC, 13 of RIL and one of Eni  from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010.        
	The proposal will be implemented immediately and the contractors will be asked to complete their drilling commitments during the moratorium period, he said.         
	Deepak Pareek, oil amp; gas analyst at Angel Broking, said though the move was positive for ONGC and RIL, the financial implications on these companies could not be immediately quantified.         
	An official from a leading oil firm said the moratorium would mean that they would not have to surrender the blocks where exploration work could not be undertaken because of a rig shortage. This means that the government will not take back our blocks, he said.        
	However, if the work is not done by December, the companies will have to surrender the blocks and pay a fine.        
	Trinidad plan off        
	The CCEA has allowed ONGC to withdraw from oil and gas exploration in Trinidad and Tobago after its partner, an L.N. Mittal company, walked out of the project. ONGC had spent $1 million in Trinidad.        
	ONGC-Mittal Energy Ltd  the joint venture of ONGC and Mittal Investment Sarl  had in 2007 won an offshore block in Trinidad, which is estimated to hold in-place reserves of two trillion cubic feet of gas.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, April 20: Swapping funds between different term deposits even within the same bank may become difficult now.         
	The Reserve Bank today gave banks the freedom to formulate policies for customers moving from one term deposit to another.         
	So far, banks were told to allow speedy conversion of term deposits, daily deposits or recurring deposits so that depositors could immediately reinvest the amount with the same bank in another term deposit.         
	According to the old norms, banks cant charge a penalty on such deposits provided the money remains with the bank after reinvestment for a longer term than the remaining period of the original contract.         
	However, after a review of the current regulatory norms and to facilitate better asset-liability management, the RBI allowed banks to formulate their own policies on conversion of deposits.         
	Analysts are not ruling out the possibility of banks coming out with strict measures to discourage their customers from switching funds between various term deposits even within the same bank.         
	Such conversions are usually seen when interest rates are headed north. Banks may now make it more difficult for their customers to go for such conversions, an analyst said.

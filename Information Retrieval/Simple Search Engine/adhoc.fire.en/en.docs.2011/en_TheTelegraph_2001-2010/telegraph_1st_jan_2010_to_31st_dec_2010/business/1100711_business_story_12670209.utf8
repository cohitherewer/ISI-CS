	Washington, July 10 (PTI): India has been ranked second, ahead of the US and South Korea, in terms of manufacturing competence globally, a report by Deloitte has said.        
	China, India and South Korea have been ranked first, second and third, respectively, in the 2010 global manufacturing competitiveness index  a collaboration between Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and the US Council on Competitiveness.        
	In less than a decade, a new world order for manufacturing competitiveness has emerged along with a tectonic shift in regional manufacturing competence, the report said.        
	The rise in the manufacturing competitiveness of three countries in particular  China, India, and the Republic of Korea (Korea)  appears to parallel the rapidly growing and important Asian market, said the 56-page report.        
	The report notes that Chinas ascent to the top of the list is not surprising, given its rising eminence in the manufacturing sector over the past 10 years, particularly as a regional hub for foreign outsourced production, foreign direct investments, and joint ventures.        
	Perhaps more surprising is that India is now positioned at No. 2 and gaining an even stronger foothold on that position over the next five years, the report said, adding Indias rich talent pool of scientists, researchers, and engineers as well as its large, well-educated English-speaking workforce and democratic regime make it an attractive destination for manufacturers.        
	The report noted that since the mid-1990s, Indias software industry has escalated to new heights and post-economic liberation has also opened a pathway to unprecedented market opportunities for manufacturing.         
	The country is also expanding its capabilities in engineering design and development and embedded software development, which form an integral part of many modern-day manufactured products, it said.

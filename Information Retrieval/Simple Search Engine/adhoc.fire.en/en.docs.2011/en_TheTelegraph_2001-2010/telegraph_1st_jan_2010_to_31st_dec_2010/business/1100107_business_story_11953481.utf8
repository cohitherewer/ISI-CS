The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt wary of bailout overdose
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Govt wary of bailout overdose
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chawla: What next?                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: The finance ministry today hinted at selective withdrawal of the stimulus package as the economy is showing strong signs of recovery.        
	Too much of stimulus when the body is getting healthy may not be a good thing. It can be injurious to health, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said.         
	Only yesterday, the industry captains in their pre-budget meeting with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had demanded that the bailout should stay, arguing that the revitalisers were necessary to sustain growth.         
	Chawla referred to textiles and said that the stimulus for the sector was likely to face the chop as exports were picking up.        
	Textiles, jewellery and leather were hit hard after recession gripped the developed nations in October 2008, prompting government reliefs in the form of subsidies on bank loans and duty cuts to prevent job losses.         
	He, however, said the government might consider tax incentives for garment machinery and extending the present easy lending rates.        
	The government came out with various stimulus measures to fight global recession. Subsequently, the economy grew 6.1 per cent in the first quarter and 7.9 per cent in the second.         
	The government is expecting the economy to expand around 7.75 per cent after hitting a six-year low of 6.7 per cent during 2008-09.        
	Direct tax code        
	The government has completed its consultations on the proposed direct tax code and the contours of the new tax structure could be finalised soon.        
	The process of consultation is almost complete, said Chawla.         
	The new tax rule is likely to be implemented from 2011-12. Sources said the bill might be tabled in the Budget session.        
	The government has come out with the draft direct tax code that is aimed at making the tax structure in the country simpler and lower the tax burden by reducing exemptions. It will replace the Income Tax Act, 1961.        
	A draft of the tax code was placed in the public domain for comments.

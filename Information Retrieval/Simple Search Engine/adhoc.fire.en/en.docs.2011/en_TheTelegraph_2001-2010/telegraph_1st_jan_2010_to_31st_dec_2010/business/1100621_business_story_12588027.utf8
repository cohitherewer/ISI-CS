          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 20: Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications (R-Com) has entered into an agreement with Singapore-based Bubble Motion to launch a celebrity voice-chat service.         
	Similar to the micro blog ging site Twitter, subscribers to the service will get SMS notifications as soon as a celebrity records a message. Users will have to dial a number to listen to the message and can even leave a voice message in turn.         
	This technology will enable the celebrities to reach out to fans through day-to-day voice posts.         
	Bubble Motions platform will, therefore, enable R-Com to offer voice-mail-like service, which otherwise requires prohibitive infrastructure investments.        
	A top R-Com official said its deal with Bubble Motion was for technological support and estimated to be worth over Rs 250 crore.         
	It is a first of its kind voice-based mobile blog service. Bubble Motions unique technology will enable celebrities to make calls to their fans over R-Coms network. We expect this service to be launched at the end of this month, he said.        
	We have already engaged celebrities such as Amitabh Bachchan, Lara Dutta and John Abraham, quot; he said.        
	R-Com, which has a subscriber base of about 11 crore, expects to build a cache of over 80 celebrities for this service in the next one year.        
	We are looking at over one million registered users for this service during the current fiscal. This new service will be launched across our GSM and CDMA networks, the official said.        
	Operators will gain by charging users per message. They also have to shell out a premium subscription fee to follow the celebrities. Bubble Motion will pick up a share of revenue from operators.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 21: Mahindra and Mahindra today announced that its board will meet on January 25 to consider a stock split  which the pundits believe can mark the start of a new trend as a bullish sentiment pervades the market despite todays sharp slide.        
	A number of small and mid-cap companies have already announced plans to sub-divide their shares, which will make them easily affordable. When stock prices surge to high levels, retail investors tend to avoid those counters and the number of trades per day start falling.         
	The utility and tractor major said its board would meet to consider subdividing its shares that currently have a face value of Rs 10.         
	M amp;M shares ended flat on the BSE today at Rs 1,145.80 on a day when the benchmark index tumbled over 423 points.        
	The tendency to split stocks comes in the wake of a spectacular rise in the equity values since March last year.        
	In the past, several companies that include ITC, Siemens, Hindalco Industries, and Godrej Consumer Products have split the face value of their shares.        
	With the domestic automobile sector witness to strong order book since the second quarter of this fiscal, auto stocks have been huge outperformers over the past few months. In M amp;Ms case alone, its share had surged nearly 283 per cent in the calendar year 2009.        
	M amp;M is, however, not the only company to go in for a stock split in recent times.        
	The board of Unity Infraprojects is meeting on January 29 to consider a split. The board of another company called India Securities is meeting on the same day to mull a sub-division of its shares.        
	Then there are companies such as Atco Corporation and Bajaj Electricals where the face value of their shares has been split to Rs 2 from Rs 10 per share.         
	More recently, the board of Sterlite Technologies sub-divided equity shares of the company from the face value of Rs 5 to Rs 2 each.

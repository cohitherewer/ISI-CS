                                My husband and me are senior citizens and have individual PPF accounts. Both of us have PAN cards. We want to invest Rs 100,000 each in PPF in the current fiscal? Please clarify the maximum amount deductible under Section 80C. What is the annual basic exemption limit for both of us?          Kamalendu Chatterjee, Gariahat
                    e cannot invest more than Rs 70,000 in a PPF account in a financial year. The entire Rs 70,000 can be claimed as deduction from total annual income under Section 80C. The basic exemption limit for annual income for senior citizens (who are above 65 years) is Rs 2,40,000.                                    Tax query      I deposited Rs 9 lakh in a post office monthly income scheme. Some of these accounts are in joint names with my wife and my married daughter. In my tax return, I used to show the interest income from those accounts where I was the first account holder. Being a senior citizen, I am not filing returns as my income is much below the basic exemption limit. My wife has no other income and my daughter has got a service this year. My daughters income is taxable. What will the tax implication on the interest income from the MIS account for my daughter?        N. Banerjee, Calcutta
                    ce your wife doesnt have any other income, the interest income from her MIS account will have to be clubbed with your income. You didnt mention whether you had done this before and even doing it now. Your daughter now will have to show the interest income in her tax return.                                    No need to file return      I am an unemployed woman. If I earn some capital gain from sale of shares within 12 months of purchase, should I have to pay capital gains tax? My total annual income is below the threshold limit. Do I have to submit tax return?         Rekha Sarkar, Baruipur
                    The question of paying income tax arises if your annual income, including the capital gain, is in excess of the basic exemption limit. If it is not, you wont have to pay any tax. If you dont have any taxable income, you dont have to file a return.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil reserve to ensure supply
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Oil reserve to ensure supply
                            
	New Delhi, April 15 (PTI): India will complete building its first strategic crude oil storage by October next year to insulate itself from supply disruptions.        
	India, which meets 75 per cent of its crude requirement through imports, is building underground facilities at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Mangalore and Padur in Karnataka to store about 5.33 million tonnes. This is enough to meet the countrys needs for 13-14 days.         
	The storage at Visakhapatnam will be completed by October 2011, said Rajan K. Pillai, CEO of India Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd  the state-owned firm building the strategic stockpile. Visakhapatnam will have capacity to store 1.33mt in underground rock caverns.         
	Huge underground cavities, almost ten-storey tall and approximately 3.3km long, are to be built (in Visakhapatnam), he said.        
	A similar facility in Mangalore will have 1.55mt capacity and will be completed by November 2012. A 2.5mt facility at Padur, near Mangalore, will be completed by December 2012.        
	India will join the likes of the US, Japan and China in having strategic reserves. These countries use the stockpiles not only as a hedge against supply disruptions but also to buy and store oil when prices are low and release them to refiners when there is a spike in global rates.        
	However, the storage India is building is very small compared with the 90-day strategic stockpile of the US. The Centre was considering raising the storage capacity to 15mt to cover 45 days requirement, but no decision has yet been taken.        
	The over 5mt strategic storage facility, Pillai said, was being built at an estimated cost of Rs 2,397 crore (at 2005 prices).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Vodafone value shrinks 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Vodafone value shrinks 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jarring note                                  
	Mumbai, May 18: Vodafone Group Plc has taken a 2.3 billion (or $3.3 billion) impairment charge on its India operations that it bought in 2007 for $11 billion.        
	The value of the Indian operations has shrunk because of intense competition in the subcontinent.        
	The impairment charge involves writing off a portion of Indian assets in Vodafones books to reflect the current value of the asset that the UK telecom operator acquired three years ago.        
	On the results posted by the UK firm for 2009-10, CEO Vittorio Colao blamed the impairment charge on the rate war sparked by the new telecom players in the market. The introduction of six additional national mobile licences one year after our entry (in India) and the resulting intense price competition have led to a 2.3-billion impairment charge, Colao said.        
	The Vodafone CEO said Asia Pacific and West Asian service revenue increased 9.8 per cent, reflecting another strong contribution from India where service revenue grew 14.7 per cent.         
	During 2009-10, we attracted 32 million customers in India and, in March, we exceeded the 100-million customer mark. In a very competitive pricing environment, we were pleased to have confirmed our No. 2 position in the market, he said. In India, Vodafone runs its operations through Vodafone Essar where the Ruias-controlled Essar group is a minority shareholder.         
	Since 2007, Vodafone has gained about 1 percentage point per annum in revenue market share, added 72 million customers, moved the business into operating free cash flow generation and launched Indus Towers, the worlds largest tower company, which manages more than 100,000 towers.         
	A company release that included India performance shows that adjusted operating loss from the country has increased to 37 million in 2010 from 30 million a year ago.         
	Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), however, grew in 2010 to 807 million from 717 million in 2009. Revenues during the year from India grew to 3.1 billion from 2.7 billion in the last year.        
	Vodafone, like other telecom operators, is keen to notch up subscriber numbers in the country to pursue growth as business slows in mainstay markets such as Europe. The company is also facing legal issues in India. It is engaged in a legal battle with local tax authorities. The latter have slapped a $2-billion tax charge on the company for making the acquisition in India.        
	Worldwide, Vodafone Group Plcs net profits almost trebled to 8.64 billion in the year-ended March 31, 2010. The sharp rise in earnings was brought about by cost-cutting measures as well as increased sales of its broadband Internet services. We now generate 33 per cent of service revenue from products other than mobile voice reflecting the shift of Vodafone to a total communications provider, Colao said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Big plans                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 20: The JSW Steel board today paved the way for Jindals integrated steel and power project in Bengal by approving investment in a coal mine and power plant.        
	The company plans to set up two 800MW plants at an estimated cost of Rs 7,680 crore at Salboni in West Midnapur district.         
	Moreover, it would spend another Rs 2,000 crore in developing Ichhapur coal block for captive use.        
	The company has set March 2014 as the target date for commissioning the first unit, while the second one will go on stream a year after. JSW Steel will build the plant through subsidiary JSW Bengal Steel along with JSW Energy.         
	JSW Bengal, where JSW Steel has a 94 per cent stake, will bring a little over one fourth of the equity, while JSW Energy will fetch the rest.        
	The project cost would be funded through a 3:1 debt equity ratio. As a result, Rs 7,680 crore will be debt and Rs 2,000 crore will be equity. JSW Bengal Steel will have to pump in Rs 629 crore for holding a 26 per cent stake in the coal and power project.        
	Biswadip Gupta, CEO of JSW Bengal, said todays decision marked a significant milestone in building the steel and power plant here.        
	We have managed to debundle the Rs 35,000-crore project. Work on the steel plant, which is going to buy 51 per cent of the power, will follow this, Gupta said.        
	Net sales up        
	JSW Steel has posted a 45 per cent growth in net sales to Rs 4,822 crore in the third quarter over the same period last fiscal.        
	The company posted a profit of Rs 429.7 crore compared with a loss of Rs 183.83 crore on a like-to-like basis.

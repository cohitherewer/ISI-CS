                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Spotlight on optic fibre network
                            
	New Delhi, July 3 (PTI): Railway minister Mamata Banerjee has proposed to set up an expert committee for commercial utilisation of the optic fibre cables network, expressing concern over the slow progress of the project.        
	I propose to constitute an expert committe, headed by Sam Pitroda, the key person behind the telecommunication revolution in our country.        
	The committee will suggest further innovations, to utilise the optic fibre cables network of the railway and take information and technology to the door steps in remote areas, she said.        
	Optical fibre is used as a medium for telecommunication and networking, especially for long-distance communications.        
	Banerjee, during her last stint as the railway minister in 2001-02, had announced laying of optic fibre cable network along the railway track for commercial utilisation.        
	Railtel Corporation was given the responsibility.        
	However, Banerjee has made it clear that she finds little progress in the project.        
	Higher dividend         
	Indian Railways will pay a higher dividend of Rs 5,479 crore during the current fiscal, despite a dip of over Rs 3,000 crore in cash surplus because of higher wage bill following implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission award.        
	Unveiling the rail budget for 2009-10, railway minister Mamata Banerjee said, The railways paid their full dividend liability of Rs 4,717 crore in 200809 and will pay an even higher dividend of Rs 5,479 crore in 200910.                                      
	The railways will be paying a higher dividend despite the adverse impact of increase in working expenses due to the Sixth Pay Commission and sluggishness in earnings due to the economic slowdown.

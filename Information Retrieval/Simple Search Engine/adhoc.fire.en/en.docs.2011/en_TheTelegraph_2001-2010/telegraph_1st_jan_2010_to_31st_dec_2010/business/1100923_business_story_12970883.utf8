	Calcutta, Sept. 22: Core-sector finance companies such as REC and IDFC are planning to launch tax-free infrastructure bonds next month.         
	The government has allowed RBI-approved infrastructure finance companies, besides IFCI, IDFC and LIC, to issue 10-year infrastructure bonds.        
	By investing in these bonds, individual investors can claim a deduction of up to Rs 20,000 from taxable income under a new section (80CCF) of the income tax act. This deduction is in addition to the Rs 1-lakh benefit available under section 80C.         
	Last month, IFCI issued tax-free infrastructure bonds through a private placement and mobilised Rs 100 crore. Power Finance Corporation and the LIC are the other two institutions that are planning tax-free infrastructure bonds in the coming months.        
	State-run Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) received the status of infrastructure finance company from the Reserve Bank of India on Monday.         
	According to a senior official, the REC management will finalise the quantum of capital to be raised through the infrastructure bond route by next week.         
	We have got the approval from the Reserve Bank two days ago. We are currently studying the guidelines for issuing tax-free infrastructure bonds. However, we have not yet decided on how much capital will be raised. A final decision will be taken next week and well come out with an offer soon, said Ajeet Agarwal, general manager (finance and accounts), Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd.        
	IDFC is also planning to come up with its tax-free infrastructure bonds next month. The IDFC board has approved a proposal to raise Rs 3,400 crore by issuing bonds in phases during the remaining months of the current fiscal.        
	When IFCI floated its bonds last month, the coupon interest rates offered under different investment options varied from 7.85 per cent to 7.95 per cent.         
	The maximum coupon rate in tax-free infrastructure bonds cannot be more than the prevailing yield on the 10-year government securities, said a senior official at IDFC.         
	The yield to maturity for 10-year government securities was 7.98 per cent on the NSE debt market.        
	By investing in a core bond, an individual can save up to Rs 6,000 (30 per cent of Rs 20,000) towards tax outgo and earn an interest of close to 8 per cent per annum for 10 years. The bonds, however, come with exit options after five years.        
	The infrastructure finance company status helps institutions such as REC and IDFC increase their lending exposure to borrowers and allows them to raise up to $500 million through external commercial borrowings.

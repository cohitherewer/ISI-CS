          OUR BUREAU                          Andreas Schaaf in Gurgaon on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: BMW plans to enter the two-wheeler market in India with its BMW Motorrad bikes, which sport a price tag of Rs 10 lakh and above.         
	We are looking at bringing the BMW motorbikes in India and a decision shall soon be taken by BMW Motorrad. I dont see any reason why we shouldnt bring in our motorcyles here. They are a lifestyle product and if they worked in Korea, they could well work here too, BMW India president Andreas Schaaf said.         
	Established in 1923, BMW Motorrad has bikes in the G, F, R and K categories with engines ranging from 450cc to 1300cc. The company is set to invest up to Rs 180 crore by mid-2012 in India.         
	BMW India will also launch the X1 by the end of this year. The sports activity vehicle will be a completely knocked down unit and assembled at its Chennai plant. The company has ramped up production at its plant from 3,000 to 5,400 units per year on a single shift basis.         
	The company today launched its sports utility vehicle X5 in both petrol and diesel variants, priced at Rs 69.50 lakh and Rs 52.99 lakh, respectively.

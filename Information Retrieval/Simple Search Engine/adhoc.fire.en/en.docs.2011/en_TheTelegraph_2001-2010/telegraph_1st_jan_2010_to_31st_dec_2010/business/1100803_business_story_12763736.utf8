          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT              HOUSE PASSES ULIP BILL            Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                 
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: The Lok Sabha today passed a bill, replacing the Ulip ordinance, that sought to set up a joint mechanism to address disputes between the financial sector watchdogs after the government said that the autonomy of existing sectoral regulators would not be diluted.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said, The new panel on financial disputes called the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) will not be a super regulator.        
	Its true there were lots of apprehensions (on) whether we were going to dilute the regulators independence or autonomy. It will only be in the case of jurisdiction disputes between the regulators that the joint mechanism will be used, he said.        
	Mukherjee said regulators were supposed to resolve differences bilaterally, failing which spats could go to the High Level Coordination Committee on Financial Markets headed by the RBI governor and if a solution still eluded them, then only will it come to this (body) ... the buck has to stop somewhere ... the minister (for finance) is the man who is ultimately responsible to Parliament.         
	He said the FSDC would not take up any other issues apart from disputes. Besides, only the regulators can move the FSDC.        
	The panel would in no way interfere with the activities of the RBI. The RBI will be supreme (in matters concerning monetary policy).         
	Many MPs as well as some regulators had feared that the new body would encroach on the autonomy of the Reserve Bank.         
	The RBI governor will be vice-chairman of the committee, while the finance minister will be the chairman. Other members are the economic affairs secretary, financial services secretary and the chiefs of the three other regulators  the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority, the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority.        
	Unlike the co-ordination committee on financial markets, the RBI governor is not the head of the new body.        
	Mukherjee said it was not possible for the RBI governor to judge disputes involving the central bank as it was an interested party. That is why it has been decided that the finance minister will be the chairman.         
	A draft bill had actually placed the RBI on a par with other regulators, leading to protests by the RBI governor.         
	The Ulip ordinance promulgated on June 18, which the bill replaces, had proposed the dispute settlement body.         
	The ordinance gave the IRDA the power to regulate Ulips. This followed a bitter row between the insurance regulator and capital market regulator Sebi on who would regulate Ulips.

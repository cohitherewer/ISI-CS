          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Feb. 12: Bengal jute mill unions today called off their indefinite strike after 61 days following an agreement that would ensure a monthly hike of Rs 1,164 in wages, including Rs 321 in dearness allowance, to about 2.5 lakh workers in 52 mills.        
	The tripartite agreement for three years was reached at the intervention of the state labour department after a series of meetings at both the state and central levels.        
	Labour minister Anadi Sahu said a wage board for the workers would be formed within three months. He said the mill owners had agreed to clear the dearness allowance arrears in six installments.        
	The textile ministry, because of the strike, has already diluted the mandatory jute packing order.        
	Sanjay Kajaria, the chairman of the Indian Jute Mills Association, said, It would have been a disaster had the strike at the mills continued further. Immediate cost increase for the industry would be Rs 320 crore and could go up to Rs 1,003 crore by January 2014.        
	Five of the 20 odd trade unions, including the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), refused to sign the agreement as the workers would not benefit much. AITUC leader Debasish Dutta said the unions, however, would ask their members to join duty. It was agreed that the payment of gratuity arrears, estimated to be around Rs 300 crore, would be cleared in three years.

	New Delhi, Sept. 23 (PTI): Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said India would cross the growth projections of 8.75 per cent this fiscal but cautioned that infrastructure posed a challenge to bigger expansion.        
	I am optimistic that at the end of this year we will be able to surpass our GDP growth forecast of 8.5-8.75 per cent, Mukherjee said at a meeting of the Indo-German joint commission on Industrial and Economic Co-operation.

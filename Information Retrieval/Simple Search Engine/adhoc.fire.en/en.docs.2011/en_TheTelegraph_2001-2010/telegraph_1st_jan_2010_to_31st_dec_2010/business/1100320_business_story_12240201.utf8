          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                          Weaving dreams                                  
	Calcutta, March 19: The Union cabinet today decided to revive three jute mills  Kinnison and Kharda in Bengal, and Rai Bahadur Hadrut in Bihar.        
	It also decided to close three mills  National, Union and Alexandra. All the six mills belong to the central governments National Jute Manufactures Corporation (NJMC).        
	Proceeds from the sale of assets of National, Union and Alexandra  all are in Bengal  will be used to fund the revival of the three other mills.         
	The revival schemes provide for additional budgetary support in the form of interest-free loan to be refunded by the NJMC to the government from the sale of assets and internal generation, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni said in Delhi today after the cabinet meeting.        
	NJMC chairman and managing director R.C. Tiwari said the three mills would be revived as fully owned government undertakings, allaying trade union fears of privatising the entities.        
	Funds for revival would come from the sale of assets of National and Alexandra, located on the banks of the Hooghly, and Union, which is in Calcutta. Trade union sources said the value of land with the three mills was as much as Rs 1,000 crore.         
	According to Tiwari, who played a big role in working out the revival package, the proposal will now be put up before the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction.        
	The total annual production capacities of Kinnison  which is at Titagarh  Kharda and Rai Bahadur Hadrut, which is at Katiahar, could meet the packaging needs of 82,500 million tonnes of foodgrain. This is around 8 per cent of the packing requirements of government agencies. The revamped mills are proposed to be operated as model modernised units, Soni said.                          
	The revival scheme also includes a provision for VRS to officers and staff.

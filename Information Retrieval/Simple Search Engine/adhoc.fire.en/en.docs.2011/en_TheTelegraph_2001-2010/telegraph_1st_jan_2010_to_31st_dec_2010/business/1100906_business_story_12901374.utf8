The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Countdown begins
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Countdown begins
        Know what to expect from the new tax bill as Sushmita Basu and Amit Patni offer a quick review of the basic features                                            
	After a few rounds of revisions, the much-awaited direct taxes code (DTC) has finally been introduced in Parliament for debate and discussion.         
	DTC, if enacted, will replace the existing Income Tax Act, 1961, and the Wealth Tax Act, 1957, with effect from April 1, 2012.         
	The code is aimed at simplifying rules, improving efficiency and bringing about better compliance.        
	Changes in slabs         
	DTC had originally proposed to substantially raise the income tax slabs for individual taxpayers.         
	Subsequently, certain proposals have been tweaked and the indicative income slabs suggested originally were calibrated while finalising the code.         
	The preferential treatment for women has been withdrawn under DTC. According to the new tax bill presented by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, neither men nor women will have to pay tax on income up to Rs 2 lakh. Earlier, the tax-free threshold was Rs 1.6 lakh for men and Rs 1.9 lakh for women.         
	The new code will impose 10 per cent tax on income between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 5 lakh, 20 per cent on income between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh and 30 per cent on income above Rs 10 lakh, regardless of the gender of the taxpayer.        
	Extended incentives         
	Contributions of up to Rs 1 lakh in approved funds such as public provident fund will qualify for tax deduction.         
	The code also proposes exemption of up to Rs 50,000 on investments in insurance, including health cover, and tuition fees for children.         
	To enjoy deduction on life insurance, the annual premium should not exceed 5 per cent of the sum assured.         
	Retirement benefits        
	The EEE (exempt-exempt-exempt) method of taxation has been restored for approved provident and superannuation funds. The move to continue with the EEE model is the governments way of contributing towards the social security of citizens. The receipts from voluntary retirement schemes, gratuity and commuted pension will be tax-exempt, subject to limits, without making prescribed investments, as originally proposed.         
	The exemption for medical reimbursement has been increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000, which is a welcome move. The exemptions on HRA and leave encashment have been retained up to the prescribed limits under DTC.         
	Insurance income        
	The scope of taxation has been widened for life insurance policyholders. The amount received from life insurance policies will be subject to tax as Income from Residuary Sources unless:        
	 distribution tax of 5 per cent has been paid by the insurance company; or         
	 it is received on maturity; and         
	 received on maturity subject to satisfaction of certain conditions such as premium paid for any of the years not exceeding 5 per cent of the capital sum assured.        
	House property        
	Income from house property will fall under the tax ambit only if a house is let out. The proposal of introducing a fair market value in place of the actual rent received has been done away with.         
	A person will pay tax only on the actual rental income and not on notional one. This is more in line with the theory of tax based on the principle of real income. The deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh on interest on loan taken for self-occupied property stays, but the standard deduction on repair and maintenance has been reduced to 20 per cent of the gross rent from 30 per cent now.        
	Capital gains        
	DTC continues to encourage an individual to stay invested in the market for a long period as there will be no capital gains tax on sale of equity shares of a company or units of an equity-oriented fund held for more than one year if the securities transaction tax (STT) is paid on the transfer.         
	Individuals holding stocks for less than one year will be paying tax only on 50 per cent of the gains if STT is paid on the transfer.         
	The other bonanza is that the base year for the cost of inflation index has been pushed from April 1, 1981 to April 1, 2000, resulting in exemptions on the market appreciation in the intervening period.         
	On transfer of original assets held for one full financial year, capital gains will be exempt if a residential house is acquired, subject to conditions prescribed.         
	Wealth tax         
	The threshold for payment of wealth tax has been enhanced to Rs 1 crore from Rs 30 lakh under the existing law. However, the rate of wealth tax will remain at 1 per cent.         
	The definition of specified assets has been expanded to include among others, watches worth more than Rs 50,000, bank deposits outside India, archeological collections, drawings, paintings, sculptures or any other work of art, equity or preference shares held by a resident individual in a controlled foreign company.        
	The new code is a mixed bag of gain and pain for individuals.         
	The widening of the tax slabs and withdrawal of cess will make up for a few benefits that have been scrapped.         
	Though we can never have a tax code that will satisfy us all, but surely the finance minister has given individuals reason enough to cheer!

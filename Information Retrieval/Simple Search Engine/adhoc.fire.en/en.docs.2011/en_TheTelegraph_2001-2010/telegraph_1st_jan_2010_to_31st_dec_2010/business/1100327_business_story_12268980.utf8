The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spectrum fee hike stalled
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Spectrum fee hike stalled
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          CAll on hold                                  
	New Delhi, March 26: Telecom service providers will not have to pay more for the spectrum they use.        
	The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) has stayed the department of telecoms (DoT) move to hike the spectrum fee from April 1.        
	Operators had filed a case in the tribunal against the DoTs directive. The next date for hearing is on May 11.         
	The move would have put pressure on the profit margins of telecom companies that are already seeing their earnings decline because of the ongoing price war.        
	At present, all mobile services are offered on 2G. Operators pay 2-6 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) as spectrum charge.         
	The fee depends on the quantity of radio waves allotted to each operator in a circle.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had earlier recommended that the government increase the spectrum charge by 1 per cent only for those companies that hold more than 6.2 MHz of radio frequencies.         
	According to the DoTs notification, the fee for GSM players will be hiked by 1 per cent for up to 8.2MHz of spectrum and by 2 per cent for spectrum beyond 8.2MHz, effective April 1.         
	A similar hike was also to be levied on CDMA players with 7.5MHz as the threshold.        
	At present, GSM operators pay 4 per cent of their total revenue as spectrum fee.         
	Under the DoTs revised structure, the fee would have been 5 per cent for GSM operators having spectrum up to 8.2Mhz.         
	For spectrum beyond 10.2Mhz, operators would have had to shell out 6 per cent of their AGR instead of the earlier 4 per cent.        
	Analysts said the hike was expected to earn the government around Rs 4,000 crore more per year.        
	The hike in spectrum charges would have had an adverse impact on the upcoming third-generation (3G) auction.         
	The government has already decided that existing firms such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea, who are now paying 2-6 per cent of their aggregate revenue as user charges for 2G services, will have to pay an additional 1 per cent fee if they get 3G airwaves.         
	The hike in 2G user charges means operators will have to give 4-9 per cent of their total annual revenues to the government if they offer both the 2G and 3G services.

          JAYATI GHOSE                          Licence trouble                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: The mobile licences of Loop, STel, Allianz Infratech, Unitech and Videocon can be revoked if the telecom ministry is convinced that they have failed to meet eligibility criteria.         
	The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), which is probing the allocation of 2G licences in 2008, has submitted a report to the department of telecom (DoT) alleging the memorandum of association and articles of association of the five do not allow them to enter the telecom sector. They also did not have the net worth stipulated by the DoT at the time of application.         
	The DoT has asked the CAG to furnish documents to support the claim that these firms failed to fulfil their eligibility requirements and have submitted false documents.         
	Post internal scrutiny of the details provided by CAG, the DoT may issue showcause notices to the companies asking them to explain any discrepancies found, officials said.        
	A showcause is the first step towards the termination of a licence, analysts said.        
	On being pointed out by the audit, the department (the DoT) has asked for the documents for further processing the case and to issue a showcause notice for termination of the licences awarded to them, said the CAG in its report.         
	The termination of licence will result in an aggregate encashment of Rs 2,625 crore, comprising a financial bank guarantee of Rs 1,875 crore and a performance bank guarantee of Rs 750 crore, the report said.        
	Scrutiny of the memorandum of association and articles of association of certain companies also suggested that they had suppressed facts or had given misleading information along with their applications, the CAG said.         
	The auditor added that the fact that the DoT failed to verify the false or altered documents submitted by the companies and continued with the process of issuing licences based on these documents proved that the process of grant of licence in January 2008 was neither fair nor foolproof and was done in a hasty manner.         
	Officials said the telecom ministry was keen to find some answers before Friday, when the Supreme Court will hear the public interest litigation on 2G spectrum filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, Telecom Watchdog  an NGO  and some senior journalists.        
	The CAG said the licences were allotted in January 2008 at 2001 prices, which was unjustified  there were only 40 lakh subscribers in 2001, which had jumped to 30 crore by 2008.         
	According to the CAG, this has caused an estimated loss of Rs 1.40 lakh crore to the exchequer.

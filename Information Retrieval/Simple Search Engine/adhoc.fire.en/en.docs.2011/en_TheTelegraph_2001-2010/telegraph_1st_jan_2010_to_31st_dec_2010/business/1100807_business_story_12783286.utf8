          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Vijayan: Charting growth plans                                  
	Mumbai, Aug 6: The Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) is planning to invest Rs 2 trillion across various asset classes such as bonds and equity in this fiscal, up from the Rs 1,92,000 crore it had funnelled into various instruments last year.        
	T.S. Vijayan, LIC chairman, said here today that the countrys largest life insurer had already invested close to Rs 39,000 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal of which nearly Rs 10,000 crore had been channelled into equities.         
	We have internally targeted to invest Rs 2 lakh crore across asset classes by the end of this fiscal, Vijayan told reporters here after announcing a valuation surplus on investments of over Rs 23,000 crore in 2009-10.        
	While the LIC has targeted a premium collection of Rs 2,01,000 crore for the year, Vijayan did not provide details on the equity component of the Rs 2-trillion investment. He explained that the amount of money invested in bonds or equities would depend on the premium flow. If it comes more from unit-linked insurance policies (Ulips), the incremental investment into equities will be higher. On the other hand, if more premiums come from traditional plans, fresh investment will flow into corporate bonds and government securities.         
	In 2009-10, Ulips share in the total premium pie of Rs 1,85,000 crore was 75 per cent, and the total equity investments made by the LIC stood at Rs 61,000 crore.        
	If the markets are good, people invest in Ulips and if the interest rates are good, their preferences turn to non-linked policies, the LIC chief said.        
	Vijayan said the LIC also had a headroom to issue infrastructure bonds of Rs 5,000 crore this fiscal but had not yet decided on any timeline for it. Under a new policy, we can issue bonds worth 25 per cent of our incremental investments of Rs 25,000 crore in infrastructure sector last year, he said.         
	The life insurer is also targeting to invest Rs 1,000 crore in real estate and property this fiscal, Vijayan said. This could be used to turn the property into an office, float a housing scheme for policy holders or as a pure investment from which it could exit at a later date.                                                   
	Vijayan added that the corporation was in advanced stages of discussions to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary in Singapore.        
	He said the LIC had recorded an over 10 per cent jump in valuation surplus (difference between assets and liabilities) to Rs 23,478 crore in 2009-10 compared with the year-agos level of Rs 21,152 crore which helped it to pay a healthy Rs 1,029-crore dividend to the government.        
	The insurance giants first-year premium went up by 33.87 per cent to Rs 70,891 crore from Rs 52,954 crore in 2008-09. These numbers, he added, helped the life insurer to increase its market share from 60.79 per cent to 64.86 per cent in the period.         
	During the period, LICs total assets under management (AUM) increased 31.88 per cent to Rs 11,52,057 crore in the period.

	Calcutta, Sept. 22 (PTI): Nandan Nilekani, chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), today said the first set of identification numbers would be issued within a few days.        
	He was speaking on the sidelines of AIMA convention here.         
	He said in the first four years, 600 million people would be covered.        
	The UIDAI had discussed with the Reserve Bank to prepare the road map for financial inclusion with the help of micro-ATMs. Nilekani said a big challenge for UID was de-duplication. Giving UID number was akin to giving mobile identity to a person using biometric technology.

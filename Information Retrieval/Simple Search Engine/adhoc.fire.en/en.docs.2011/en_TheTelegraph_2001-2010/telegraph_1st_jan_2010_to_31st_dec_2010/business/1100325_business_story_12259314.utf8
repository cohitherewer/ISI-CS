	Mumbai, March 24 (PTI): The governments chief economic adviser, Kaushik Basu, today said economic growth was expected to rise to 8.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, while inflation was likely to be lower from May-end.         
	In the third quarter, economy did not do well as agriculture shocks were concentrated in the fourth quarter, we expect a growth of 8.5 per cent, Basu said.        
	 The economy grew 6 per cent in the October-December period, after expanding a stunning 7.9 per cent in the second quarter and 6.1 per cent in the first quarter.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      P. M. Sinha in Calcutta on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                
	Calcutta, May 27: Bata India, the countrys largest shoe retailer, plans to invest Rs 200 crore in two to three years to expand reach and scale up production.        
	The company will get Rs 100 crore as upfront payment for a township project being developed on the factory land at Batanagar. Bata will use bulk of this fund to open around 70 stores a year.        
	It has around 1,200 outlets in India, while it plans to close 24 loss-making ones.        
	Most of the new stores will be owned by the company.        
	Bata chairman P.M. Sinha said the company would open big showrooms with an average size of 3,000 square foot.        
	We want to open large global format stores even in small towns, Sinha said on the sidelines of the 77th annual general meeting of Bata in Calcutta today.        
	Last year, Bata renovated 40 stores, closed 73 small shops and opened another 69.        
	The company has begun setting up retail outlets for premium sub-brand Hush Puppies. There are four such stores apart from a few outlets in multi-brand stores.         
	Bata also plans to spend on plant and machinery.

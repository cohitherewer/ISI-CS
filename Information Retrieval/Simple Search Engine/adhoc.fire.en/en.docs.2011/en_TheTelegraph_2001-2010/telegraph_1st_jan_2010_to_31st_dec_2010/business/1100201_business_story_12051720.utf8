          SOUNAK MITRA                          SPOILT FOR CHOICE                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 31: Unitech Wireless, which offers mobile connections under the Uninor brand, is set to roll out services in Calcutta by March.         
	We emphasise on quality of services and we are preparing the best infrastructure before launching, executive vice-president (Calcutta hub) Akash Das told The Telegraph. The company also plans to introduce services in the rest of Bengal by March.         
	According to industry experts, the launch of mobile services involves an investment of $40-50 million in each circle.        
	Uninor plans to differentiate its product on the basis of customer service and not tariff. We want to build the quality of customer service as our strongest differentiator, Das said. The company wants to stay away from the ongoing tariff war and rely on better connectivity to build its subscriber base.        
	Uninor is a joint venture between Delhi-based real estate giant Unitech and Norways Telenor. Unitech had offloaded a 67.25 per cent stake in its telecom venture for Rs 6,120 crore to Telenor. In October last year, the government gave its approval to Unitech Wireless to sell up to 74 per cent to Telenor.        
	The company, which started launching services in December, has operations in nine of the 22 telecom zones. It holds a pan-India licence and is targeting an 8 per cent share by 2018. We aim to complete launching services in all the circles by year-end, Das said.        
	Uninor is present in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh (east and west), Bihar and Jharkhand. The company aims at achieving breakeven in gross earnings within three years and breakeven in operating cash flow within five years of the start of operations.

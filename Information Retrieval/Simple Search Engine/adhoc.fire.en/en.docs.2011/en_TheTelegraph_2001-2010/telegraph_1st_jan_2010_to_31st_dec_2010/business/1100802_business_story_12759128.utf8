The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi bid to stop price rigging on first day
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sebi bid to stop price rigging on first day
                              Trade trouble                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 1 (PTI): Market regulator Sebi is considering greater surveillance and preventive measures for possible price manipulation in stocks on their first day of trade through steps such as demand-driven price discovery.        
	Sebi has started an internal consultation process after receiving several complaints regarding price fluctuations on the first day of trading, a senior official said.        
	The problem is more acute for companies that list themselves following activities such as demergers, relisting after revocation of earlier listing, or suspension, and capital restructuring, the official added. The problem does not arise in the case of initial public offers (IPOs).        
	The stocks that get listed on the bourses after an IPO have a reference point for trading in their public issue price, but there is no such benchmark for pricing in non-IPO listings. This leaves room for manipulation.        
	Sebi is also looking to beef up its own integrated market surveillance system as well as of the other stock exchanges for a faster identification of rigging.        
	Another senior official said Sebi was investigating if there was any price rigging in Emami Infrastructure last week as there was a wild fluctuation in its prices on its first trading day. There was also a massive difference between the scrip price on the BSE and the NSE in early morning trade on July 28, when it got relisted after the demerger from the already listed Emami, the official added.        
	The stock opened at around Rs 600 a share on the NSE but tanked to a low Rs 86, a fall of over 85 per cent in about an hours time. However, on the BSE, the stock opened at Rs 250 and sniffed at Rs 300, before falling to a low of Rs 86  the same intra-day low as on the NSE.        
	While there is a mechanism that prevents any rise or fall of over 20 per cent in a single day in most of the stocks, the exceptions being mostly large-cap stocks and those where derivatives trade also happen, such price circuits are not imposed on the first day of trade.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bring home the cheer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bring home the cheer
        What are the assets to watch out for next year? Srikumar Bondyopadhyay finds out                                        
	Instead of hanging around in Park Street to celebrate New Years eve, Sandeep Roy this time has thought of inviting his friends to his new Behala apartment.        
	The second house that Sandeep had bought in January this year for Rs 12 lakh is now quoting at Rs 19 lakh, an appreciation of more than 58 per cent. He is naturally very happy that his decision to liquidate some of his equity investments last year and book a flat has paid off well, even if the gain from the property investment is only notional.         
	Buy land, they are not making it anymore, Sandeep will quote Mark Twain in support of his decision. In fact, looking down the current calendar year, Sandeeps instance epitomises the larger investment picture.         
	Realty rocks        
	If 2009 was the year for equities, 2010 belonged to real estate.         
	New projects as well as extension of some of the existing properties have fuelled real estate prices, particularly residential, in most metros and cities. Investors, who had invested in late 2009, have got almost 50-100 per cent returns this year on residential property.        
	Residential property prices, which fell in most metros in 2008 through the first half of 2009, started climbing up from the second half of 2009 and spiked in the last six months of the current calendar year.         
	According to the quarterly residential property market reports of real estate consultancy firm Cushman amp; Wakefield India, the first three months of the current calendar year saw residential property prices in Calcutta rise 10-14 per cent over the last quarter of 2009 calendar year. In the April-June period, residential property prices rose further by 12-14 per cent and in the third quarter through September, the price increase was 21 per cent.         
	A similar trend was witnessed in other metros and cities.         
	In Delhi and Mumbai, housing prices had fallen about 25 to 30 per cent after the global meltdown in 2008. The prices have again shot up and reached their peak level this year, said Anuj Puri, chairman, James Long LaSalle India.        
	Equity show        
	The increase in demand for residential properties can be attributed to the fact that investors reaped hefty profits from equity markets in 2009 which was then ploughed back into real estate. Easy availability of cheap housing loans also spurred property buys.        
	Return from equities in 2010 remained low at around 16 per cent till the penultimate week of the calendar year. However, equity indices yielded between 20 per cent and 23 per cent return till November 5 when all the indices touched their years high. Since then some odd developments, such as the 2G spectrum scam, the Adarsh housing scam and the debt crisis in Ireland and some other European countries hammered down stock prices by 15-20 per cent.        
	Metal magic        
	Like real estate, precious metals, particularly silver, sizzled in 2010. While gold gave a return of around 22 per cent, silver yielded a hefty 70 per cent return.         
	The demand for gold was dampened by the high price of the yellow metal, which soared to over Rs 21,000 per 10gm in November. However, since then gold prices have slipped a bit on the back of poor demand and selling pressure.         
	Silver, on the other hand, witnessed a significant increase in prices, from around Rs 26,800 per kg at the beginning of the calendar year to Rs 45,000 now.         
	Prices of precious metals, along with other commodities, surged this year following easy liquidity and low interest-inflation condition in developed markets. While renewed apprehension about the sovereign debt crisis in the European Union drove investors there for a safe haven in precious commodities, people in the US flocked towards precious metals because they could earn little by parking their funds in banks offering negligible interest.         
	But then silver ETFs have not yet taken off in the country because of a debate over whether trading will be allowed under market regulator Sebi or commodities market cop, the Forward Market Commission. This has deprived common investors from making profits from investment in the precious metal.        
	Outlook for 2011        
	Experts believe there is little upside left in property prices. Demand for residential properties from end-users has already slowed in the last quarter of the calendar year and further increase will dampen the demand further, said Anuj Puri of James Long LaSalle India.         
	Despite a steady decline in built-up stock at the current rate of month-on-month absorption, it would still require more than a year for all unsold stock to get absorbed, a Cushman amp; Wakefield report said about the residential property market for Calcutta. Besides, approximately 11,000 housing units are expected to be added to new supply by the end of 2010, it said. So, property prices are unlikely to give as much return in 2011 as they did in 2010.         
	The price of gold is also not expected to go up much from here given a better-than-expected economic growth in the US and other emerging markets, including India. However, the substitution effect in silver investment from gold may continue for some time in the new year.         
	As economic recovery in developed markets gathers momentum and India and China continue to chug ahead with an 8.5-9 per cent growth rate, investors appetite for risky assets such as equities will come back, fuelling the long-term bull rally in stock markets.         
	Domestic indices such as sensex and Nifty are estimated to give at least 15 per cent return in 2011. However, inflationary commodity prices, particularly of crude, can be the only challenge in 2011 which may push the GDP growth rate on a slow track.        
	But there is a silver lining: The governments revenue collection has been exceedingly good in 2010 so far which may not only reduce the fiscal deficit and the Centres borrowing programme, but also help the government to spend more to spur growth. If the fiscal deficit is maintained within the target level and the government announces higher spending on social infrastructure in the next budget, it will give stock markets a leg up, a senior analyst at Enam Securities said.

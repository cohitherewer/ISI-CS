          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          NETWORK JAM                                  
	New Delhi, April 8: The department of telecom (DoT) has cancelled ByCells licence to start telecom operations in India on grounds of security concerns.        
	According to a DoT notice sent to the Swiss telecom player, the applications for launching mobile services in five circles  Assam, Orissa, Bihar, Northeast and Bengal  have been withdrawn.        
	The 5 letters of intent (LoIs) are hereby withdrawn as the security clearance and all the FIPB approvals granted to the company have been withdrawn, said the DoT letter to ByCells CEO Alexandre Louzine.         
	DoT clarified that the withdrawal of the LoIs was subject to the final outcome of a writ petition before Delhi High Court.        
	The department will soon refund the entry fee and the performance guarantee totalling Rs 86 crore paid by ByCell to start operations in India, said officials.         
	ByCell holds a 74 per cent stake in an Indian telecom company floated jointly with Hyderabad-based Jayalakshmi Group that has interests in tea, tobacco, cotton yarn and power. The venture was announced in 2006.         
	While the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, in 2006, approved ByCells proposal to invest Rs 500 crore in the domestic telecom sector, security concerns were raised by the home ministry and the revenue department.         
	The FIPB is the nodal government body that clears all foreign investment proposals in India.        
	The revenue department and the home ministry had expressed concerns about ByCells shareholding structure, its source of funding and the lack of clarity about the company. It had said the company should be allowed to launch telecom operations only after it offered clarity on these issues.

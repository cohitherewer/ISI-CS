The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maruti to take on Toyota
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Maruti to take on Toyota
  - Opening bell: car makers ready with their models          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: Maruti plans to take on Toyotas Innova with a multi-purpose concept vehicle codenamed rIII.        
	Maruti may unveil the vehicle tomorrow at the Delhi auto expo. The vehicle has been built on a stretched SX4 platform and will be priced lower than the Innova, sources said.         
	Maruti Suzuki wants a vehicle that will compete in the niche segment that Toyota Qualis, Tata Safari and the Innova have fought over and it wants its vehicle to have a price advantage over Toyota, the bigger player in Suzukis home market Japan, said sources.         
	The whole challenge for Marutis designers was to give the comforts of a normal family sedan in an MPV ... which is what rivals were managing to do, they said.         
	Maruti also wanted the vehicle to be sporty and compact. The rIII took less than nine months to roll out from sketch to prototype to the final concept vehicle, sources said.        
	The rIII has a glass roof with a front grille and central aluminium wing and head lamps to accentuate the sporty look. The vehicle, which is likely to use the 1.3-litre Fiat diesel engine, will take another year and a half to hit the roads, sources said.         
	Maruti has a 50 per cent share of the Indian market but is increasingly feeling the heat from rivals such as Hyundai, Tata Motors, GM and Honda, especially at the lower end of the market.        
	Maruti will decide on fresh investments next month. It is likely to invest between Rs 3,000 crore and Rs 4,000 crore in updating and expanding production and research facilities. It plans to expand capacity to 1.5-1.7 million units by 2015.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bigger Picture                                   
	Mumbai, July 1: Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com) has acquired Digicable, the countrys largest cable TV operator, in an all-stock deal.        
	While R-Com did not disclose the financial details, the acquisition is expected to help it to offer Internet protocol television (IPTV). In IPTV, television programmes are provided to households through the Internet protocol such as broadband.         
	Digicable is present in Maharashtra, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh. It is believed to have more than 6 million subscribers.        
	R-Com said it was creating an entity, called Reliance DigiCom, in which it will integrate its direct-to-home (DTH), IPTV and retail broadband operations with Digicable.        
	According to R-Com, Reliance DigiCom will be Indias largest and the worlds fifth largest company to offer the full range of digital TV, high-speed broadband and voice services. Digital TV covers cable TV, DTH and IPTV.        
	As part of its offering, DigiCom will provide over 500 digital quality and 100 high definition channels besides video-on-demand and interactive gaming.         
	It is speculated that R-Com will look to offload 26 per cent in Reliance DigiCom to a strategic investor.         
	R-Com chairman Anil Ambani said, R-Com led the telecom revolution in India by growing its subscriber base to over 100 million in just five years. The digital TV and broadband space is poised for a similar explosive growth in the years ahead. We hope to lead the next revolution in digital home entertainment in India by offering a world-class TV experience and high-speed broadband capability to a billion people.        
	Digicable, which was established in August 2007, is promoted by Jagjit Singh Kohli and Yogesh Shah.         
	R-Com was silent on whether Ashmore Investment Management Ltd, a private equity investor holding 49 per cent in Digicable, will exit because of the acquisition.         
	The rest of the stake in Digicable is with Kohli and his associates.

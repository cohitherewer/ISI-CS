The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Essar Energy cuts London floor price 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Essar Energy cuts London floor price 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Power plan                                  
	Mumbai, April 30: Volatile market conditions and weak investor confidence have forced Essar Energy, the power, oil and gas exploration arm of the Ruia-controlled Essar group, to lower the price of its initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).        
	The shares will now be offered at 420 pence per share compared with the price band of 450-550 pence that the company had announced earlier.        
	According to a statement by the company, the offer will comprise approximately 303 million new shares, representing 23.24 per cent of the companys share capital.        
	Based on the revised offer price, Essar Energy expects to raise gross proceeds of $1.94 billion. Earlier, the company expected to raise $2.5 billion from this fund-raising exercise.         
	Essar Energys listing is the largest primary offering in London since December 2007. It is also the largest-ever London listing of an Indian company.        
	Proceeds from the IPO are expected to fund the expansion of its power plants and refinery in India, acquisition of coal mines and exploration of oil and gas blocks as the company bets on Indias increasing energy needs.        
	Volatile market        
	Essar Energy is not the only IPO that has been affected by the downgrade of Greeces sovereign debt earlier this week that prompted European markets to turn volatile.         
	Market conditions are difficult after a series of debt downgrades in Europe and investors are wary. Some companies do not have the confidence to pull off a sizeable issue as was evident from UralChem Holdings decision to put off its IPO, said a Mumbai-based banker.         
	Russian fertiliser producer UralChem Holding Plc, which was hoping to raise around $700 million, postponed its IPO in London this week as it anticipated weak demand from investors.        
	Essar Energy vice-chairman Prashant Ruia said, We are happy that the offer was fully subscribed within the price range initially announced. However, as this was our debut offering and given market conditions, we decided on a small reduction in price for our new investors.        
	The Essar Energy statement said based on the offer price, the market capitalisation of the company would swell to approximately $8.4 billion after the offer was completed.        
	It is expected that Essar Energy will be considered for inclusion in FTSE 100, it added.        
	In addition, an over allotment option of up to 30.3 million shares will be granted, exercisable once in a period of up to 30 days from the commencement of conditional dealings in the shares. Conditional dealing in Essar Energy shares is expected to kick off on May 4, while unconditional dealing is expected to place on May 7.         
	Deutsche Bank AG and JP Morgan Cazenove, part of JP Morgan Chase amp; Co, are bankers to the IPO.         
	Essar group chairman Shashi Ruia said, The offer gives us a strong platform from which to deliver our significant pipeline of growth projects. We have been humbled by the interest shown from a broad range of high quality blue chip international institutional investors.

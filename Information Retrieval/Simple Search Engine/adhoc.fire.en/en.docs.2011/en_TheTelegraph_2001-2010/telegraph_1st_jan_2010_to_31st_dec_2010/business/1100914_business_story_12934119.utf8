	Calcutta, Sept. 13: The countrys GDP growth in the July-September quarter will be lower than the first quarter of the current fiscal, said Kaushik Basu, the chief economic adviser to the finance minister.        
	The GDP growth in the second quarter could be well below the 8.8 per cent growth rate seen in the April-June quarter, Basu said at an interactive session organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	According to Basu, it was not difficult to achieve an 8.8 per cent growth in the first quarter because of a low base during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.        
	For the July-September quarter, Basu sees growth falling below 8.5 per cent. However, a lower growth rate in the second quarter should not be disappointing because during the same quarter last year the economy started picking up.        
	Both the agriculture and services sectors will grow slowly in the July-September quarter. But growth will pick up during October-March.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Murli Deora in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: ONGCs interest will be fully protected by the government in the Cairn-Vedanta deal, petroleum minister Murli Deora said at the Economic Editors Conference here today.        
	Anil Agarwals Vedanta has offered $8.5-9.6 billion to acquire 51-60 per cent of the Indian subsidiary of Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy.         
	Petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said ONGC, which holds a 30 per cent interest in Cairn Indias Rajasthan oilfields, has written to Cairn Energy saying they will require its permission before the stake sale to Vedanta.        
	Cairn Energy maintains ONGCs pre-emption right, or the right of first refusal, will not be triggered in a corporate deal. So far no response has been received from Cairn, Sundareshan said.        
	The petroleum secretary said the ministry was yet to examine the merits of the transaction.         
	Right now, we are deciding on the jurisdiction issue, Sundareshan said, adding that the government will decide on the deal by December. He said Cairn must seek approval for all blocks, which was the jurisdiction issue that was being sorted out in consultation with the law ministry.

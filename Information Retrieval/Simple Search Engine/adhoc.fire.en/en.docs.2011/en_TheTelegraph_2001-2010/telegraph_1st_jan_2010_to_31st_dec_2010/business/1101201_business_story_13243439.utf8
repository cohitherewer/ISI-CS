The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sibal sees little logic in JPC demand
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sibal sees little logic in JPC demand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sibal: Stern stance                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: Telecom minister Kapil Sibal today questioned the relevance of setting up a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the alleged 2G spectrum scam, adding that a CBI investigation monitored by the Supreme Court should suffice.        
	What would be the outcome of a JPC, except to act as an instrument to create controversy on a daily basis so that democracy becomes dysfunctional, said Sibal.        
	He said while the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was examining the issue of criminal culpability, the accuracy of granting mobile permits and adherence to rollout norms were being handled by the telecom ministry.        
	A JPC cannot decide on telecom policy as those are based on technology and market conditions. Moreover, the issue of loss to the exchequer can only be presumptive as indicated by the CAG ... so what is the rationale for a JPC? asked Sibal.        
	He added that the Opposition must explain the basis of its demand and the outcome of a JPC.        
	The telecom ministry yesterday cracked the whip on companies who cornered licences through an unfair selection process in January 2008 and then failed to meet rollout obligations.        
	Showcause notices would be issued to 85 mobile licensees for not meeting eligibility conditions and to 119 licensees who did not meet rollout obligations.        
	While Sibal asserted that the Centre was ready for monitoring by the Supreme Court of the ongoing investigations, the Opposition said it would not be satisfied with anything less than a JPC.        
	Monitoring by the Supreme Court is the best way to look into it. The investigating agencies are thoroughly probing the issue and we are all for transparency and justice, said Sibal.        
	The minister said a decision on a JPC should emerge through a consensus or when there is a national concern and not based solely on the insistence of the Opposition.        
	It is because of a few political parties, especially of the Bharatiya Janata Party, that Parliaments functioning has been stalled. The government is ready to discuss the issue on the floor of the House, he said.        
	The winter session of Parliament has been stalled for 13 days. At an all-party meeting called by Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar today, the Opposition made it clear that it would not allow Parliament to function till a JPC on 2G spectrum allocation was set up.

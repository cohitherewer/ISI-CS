The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Firms fare well in February
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Firms fare well in February
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 12: Industrial production grew 15.1 per cent in February, the third consecutive month of robust growth. However, part of the increase is because of the rise in prices.         
	Todays numbers may prompt the Reserve Bank of India to raise interest rates to suck out excess liquidity from the system. The logic being that less liquidity means less demand and lower inflation.        
	The index of industrial production rose 15.1 per cent in February from a year earlier, government data showed. Growth, however, was slightly lower than around 16.7 per cent growth in January and 16.8 per cent in December.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Lucknow that the recent release of the index of industrial production series clearly indicates that it (industry growth) has reached 10 plus per cent. Now, it is quite optimistic that we will be able to achieve the target (of 8.25-8.75 per cent GDP growth), which we are hoping for the year 2010-11.        
	Manufacturing rose 16 per cent in February from a year earlier, while the output of capital goods and consumer durables was up 44.4 per cent and 29.9 per cent, respectively.        
	The RBI is likely to increase the interest rates by 50 basis points and the government will try to remove the stimulus measures given to deal with the global economic slowdown. The numbers indicate strong growth in domestic demand, professor N. R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy said.        
	High output numbers are largely because of a strong 16 per cent growth in manufacturing and a low base of minus 1.2 per cent a year ago, when the Indian economy was still reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis.        
	Although the low base effect has played a role in these strong numbers, the fact remains that there is an overall improvement in consumer and industrial demand which is reflected in the strong growth of capital goods and consumer durables. There is a need to maintain this momentum by ensuring that monetary and our exchange rate policies facilitate this growth, Amit Mitra, secretary-general of Ficci, said.

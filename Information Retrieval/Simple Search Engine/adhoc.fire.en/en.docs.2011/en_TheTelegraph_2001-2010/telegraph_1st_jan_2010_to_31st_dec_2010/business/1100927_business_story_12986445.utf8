	New Delhi, Sept. 26: Some leading multinationals have bid to partner the railways for three projects in eastern India, vindicating rail minister Mamata Banerjees decision to open up the bidding process to private players and bring the latest proprietary technology.        
	Alstom, General Electric (GE), Bombardier, Siemens, Hyundai, Hitachi and ABB are vying to pick up a stake in the three factories  an electric locomotive unit at Madhepura in Bihar, a diesel locomotive unit at Marhowrah (Bihar) and an electric multiple unit (EMU) at Kanchrapara in Bengal  involving an investment of over Rs 4,100 crore.         
	The railways are also finalising the bid documents for a fourth factory to make 400 engines a year at Sankrail in south Bengal.        
	Mamata has chosen two sites in Bihar, possibly to prove her credentials as an all-India leader and honour pledges made by her predecessor Lalu Prasad Yadav to set up factories there.         
	Expert panel        
	An expert committee, under Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra, has finalised the bid documents earlier this month for the Madhepura and Kanchrapara facilities. Top firms have started applying, and the documents will be opened later this year. The selection process for the partner at Marhowrah has already started.        
	The railways will pick up a 26 per cent stake in the joint ventures by offering land, while the private partner will take a 74 per cent stake and bring the money and technology.        
	Mamata has helped push through these projects at great speed and we have been able to meet the timelines set for them, said Mitra, who has been chosen by the minister to help out with the projects.         
	Applications for the Madhepura unit, which is expected to cost around Rs 1,293 crore and produce locomotives worth about $4.5 billion over 10 years, will close by October 11. Alstom, Bombardier Traction, GE and Siemens are in the fray. Lalu Prasad had won from Madhepura in 2004.         
	Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc (EMD) and GE are the only two to bid for the Marhowrah factory, which is expected to cost Rs 1,200-1,300-crore. The railways will pick the winner by year-end.         
	The Kanchrapara factory, which will make EMUs that operate on suburban rail networks, will cost about Rs 1,500 crore; eight global players, some in combination with Indian partners, have bid for it. The factory is expected to have an annual turnover of Rs 2,500 crore.        
	Multinationals in the fray include Frances Alstom, Germanys Siemens Canadas Bombardier, Frances CAF and Koreas Hyundai Rotem. Three joint ventures are also bidding: the Jindals in collaboration with Japans Hitachi, Kawasaki Heavy Industries (Japan) in collaboration with Birla-owned Texmaco and Switzerlands ABB in collaboration with Stadler and TWL .        
	Analysts see the Kanchrapara bidding, expected to be finalised by the third week of January to be a close one.         
	The Sankrail factory, expected to have an annual turnover of over Rs 700 crore, will be split into two phases. State-run Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd will set up the plant in the first phase, while bidding will take place for the second phase.

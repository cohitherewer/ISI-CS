          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A. Raja                                  
	New Delhi, May 26: Telecom minister A. Raja today met home minister P. Chidambaram to discuss security concerns over the import of Chinese telecom equipment.        
	Raja has sought the home ministrys assistance in drawing up a clear policy on buying equipment from foreign vendors without choking the sectors growth, sources said.        
	Later, Raja met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and briefed him on the issue of Chinese vendors, pointing out that the delay in getting equipment was hurting the sector.         
	Over the past few months, the DoT has not cleared the import of equipment from China firms such as Huawei, ZTE, Mobi Antenna, Sunsea Telecom and Leoch Battery because of security worries raised by the home ministry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt doubles natural gas price
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Govt doubles natural gas price
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          HIGHER CHARGES                                  
	New Delhi, May 19: The government today more than doubled the price of natural gas produced by ONGC and Oil India to $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) to bring it on a par with the rate at which Reliance Industries sells gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	The low price of gas has discouraged national oil companies, ONGC and Oil India, from making investments in these (nomination) blocks. Therefore, it became essential to increase the price in APM (administered price mechanism) gas, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni told reporters after a cabinet meeting.        
	Soni said the price of natural gas produced by the private operators was much higher than APM gas. The price of APM gas needs to be rationalised and aligned with the market prices.        
	The new price will be valid till March 31, 2014. Gas prices for state explorers were last changed in 2005. Around 64 million standard cubic metres of gas per day are now sold under APM at $1.82 per mBtu.        
	Consumers in Delhi and Mumbai will be affected as the price of CNG, the green fuel used in public transport, will rise 20 per cent, Aporva Chandra, joint secretary in the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, said. There will be no impact on PNG (piped natural gas) as its price is linked to LPG, Chandra said. The price of electricity produced by gas-fired power plants can also rise 2.5 per cent.        
	Ninety per cent of the gas produced by the state-owned explorers from government-nominated fields go to the power and fertiliser firms, while 10 per cent are marketed as CNG and PNG. For customers in the Northeast, the government will provide subsidy.        
	The impact of the hike on the power sector will be marginal, while the price of fertilisers is likely to be unaffected, Chandra said. Fertiliser companies get the gas at a subsidised rate. So, the hike will only increase the subsidy of the government by another Rs 3,500 crore. The government has allocated Rs 28,500 crore for decontrolled fertiliser units under the nutrient-based subsidy policy that came into effect from April 1.

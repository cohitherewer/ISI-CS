                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stocks fall prey to FII selling pressure
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 2: Heavy selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) yanked down the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange sensex by about 193 points on Tuesday when it closed at 16163.44.        
	The markets opened in the positive today after Wall Street fared well overnight but started slipping after an hour of trading with realty, PSU and banking stocks facing the brunt of the clobbering.        
	The FIIs sold large-cap stocks as global macro conditions led to heavy liquidation. Marketmen, however, said todays movements were not indicative of the start of a bearish trend in the bourses.         
	There was a significant amount of FII selling even though global markets were not weak. Daily movements do not really point to the start of a bearish phase, said Sharekhans head of research, Gaurav Dua.         
	Manish Sonthalia, fund manager at Motilal Oswal, said, There is no India-centric reason for the fall. The FIIs are selling because of global macro factors such as regulatory pressures from the US and the hardening of the dollar.        
	This top down withdrawal of funds may also have taken place as investors look to trim gains in large-cap stocks to invest in the large follow on issue by National Thermal Power Corporation, said a fund manager.        
	During the day, the market breadth was weak with 1,788 declines against 1,105 advances out of a total of 2,963 stocks on the BSE.         
	Top gainers who bucked the trend include Spice Communications, Dr Reddys Laboratories, Hindalco, HDFC and Religare Enterprises.         
	The National Stock Exchanges Nifty also fell nearly 70 points to close at 4830.10.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 25: Stock markets tumbled today as the government stoked fears of rising inflation after raising fuel prices across the board, triggering prospects of an interest rate hike to limit the damage.        
	The bellwether sensex slumped 156 points to close at 17574.53. However, the governments move sparked a surge in oil stocks amid expectations that oil refiners would be able to boost profitability.        
	The BSE oil amp; gas index led the list of percentage gainers, rising 2.88 per cent. There were huge gains in stocks such as BPCL which rose 12.84 per cent to Rs 621.35, HPCL 13.66 per cent to Rs 401.05 and IOC 10.39 per cent to Rs 377.30.         
	Upstream oil companies also surged as the price rise in petro products cut the burden of the subsidies they had to bear to bail out the state-owned oil refiners. ONGC rose 6.35 per cent to Rs 1,264 and shares of Oil India Ltd gained 4.62 per cent at Rs 1,360.20.        
	The same sentiment was not reflected in many of the other counters as fears grew that the governments decision would lead to higher inflation, compelling the RBI to raise interest rates. Hence, the interest rate sensitive sectors that include auto, banking and realty were the worst-hit.         
	The move will push inflation. It is now certain that the central bank could hike the repo rate by 25 basis points in the next few days to counter inflationary expectations, said an analyst with a domestic brokerage. This fear could put pressure on interest rate sensitive sectors in the immediate term, he added.                                
	Among the sectoral indices, the BSE bankex shed 2.19 per cent, BSE realty was down 1.08 per cent and the BSE auto index yielded 0.91 per cent. While ICICI Bank slumped 3.09 per cent, HDFC Bank was down 2.69 per cent, HDFC 2.63 per cent and SBI by 2.36 per cent. Auto counters like Tata Motors were lower by nearly 2 per cent at Rs 769.45.        
	While the benchmark sensex opened a tad lower at 17705.11 due to global factors, it stayed in the negative zone for the greater part of the day. The index did reverse some of its losses on news of the deregulation. However, this was short-lived as inflation concerns saw the index touching an intra-day low of 17546.73 before recovering a bit at the close.

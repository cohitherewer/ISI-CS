	Calcutta, March 27: Companies should upload information relevant to shareholders on an open platform such as a website, Salman Khursheed, Union minister of state for corporate affairs, said today.        
	It should be mandatory for each company. Documents such as balancesheets, annual reports and meeting agendas should be uploaded at the earliest. It would reduce shareholders complaints and increase transparency, Khursheed said at an event organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce.         
	Earlier in the day, Khursheed, who was in Chennai, said the Companies Bill 2009 would take a special approach to second- and third-generation family members joining family-run companies after their studies.        
	With more of the GenNext joining the services of such companies, we need to facilitate them by providing guidelines. We need to train them in following good corporate governance, he said.

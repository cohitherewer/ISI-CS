	New Delhi, July 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today pinned hopes on a normal monsoon to cool down food prices and in turn ease inflation to 6 per cent by December from over 10 per cent now.        
	Fiscal deficit and subsidies also need to be cut to ensure debt funding of five-year plans is reduced considerably, Singh said.        
	The present high rate of inflation is because of food price inflation. We expect to see the rate of inflation in wholesale prices come down to around 6 per cent by December. Good rains should lower the soaring food inflation in the second half of the year, Singh said at the National Development Council meeting, which later approved the mid-term appraisal of the Eleventh Plan.        
	On Friday, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council, said food prices had started softening and would decline to 7-8 per cent by December and 6.5 per cent by March.        
	Singh also regretted that states were not paying due attention to the farm sector, which was crucial to curbing inflation.         
	This must be corrected if we want to achieve a broad-based improvement in living standards in rural areas. Better agriculture performance is crucial for food security and would help in tackling the problem of inflation, he said.        
	Monsoon rains have been 12 per cent below the long-term average so far this year, but fairly widespread rainfall is expected in the next few days in the northern and central regions and major oilseed producing areas.        
	Singh emphasised the need for use of technology to improve productivity and to attract private sector investment in agricultural infrastructure.        
	He also sought chief ministers support for the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) regime, considered as the biggest tax reform that would combine central and state taxes.        
	I would urge chief ministers to give full support to the effort to implement GST from April 1, 2011, he said.        
	On the pace of economic growth, he said the countrys gross domestic product was expected to expand by 8.1 per cent during the 11th Five Year Plan (2007-12) against the targeted 9 per cent. This is lower than the target of 9 per cent, but still the highest achieved in any plan period, he said.        
	The NDC approved the Mid-Term Appraisal of the Eleventh Plan, which listed power and infrastructure as areas of concern for attaining a 9 to 10 per cent economic growth.        
	The National Development Council is the highest deliberative and decision-making forum on development issues which has as members the Prime Minister, chief ministers, lieutenant governors and members of the Planning Commission.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 2: UTI Mutual Fund is promoting financial inclusion for rural areas through a technology solution that will not only widen the reach of the fund house but also provide service to rural residents at a lower cost.        
	Jaideep Bhattacharya, chief marketing officer of UTI Mutual Fund, told The Telegraph that the solution was at a development stage and the target was to reach every panchayat once UTI put the plan into action. We are working on how to use the technology platform to penetrate in rural areas.        
	The rural solution is one among a series of tech initiatives by the mutual fund. In the first quarter of this fiscal, the fund house will introduce a facility that will let its investors buy, sell and switch funds using their mobile phones.        
	There has been an exponential growth in the mobile space and this can be leveraged effectively. The mobile phone is the most effective technological device to reach out to more investors at very low costs, Bhattacharya said.        
	UTI Mutual already has the unique mobile application facility that provides services to its investors such as information on branch location, net asset values and SIP calculations. An investor who has a complaint can send an SMS that goes directly to the registrar and transfer agent. The response time in this case is much quicker, Bhattacharya said.        
	Analysts said other mutual fund players were also embracing technology in a big way. Leveraging technology provides various advantages. Apart from higher penetration, fund houses also save on costs as they do not have to follow the brick-and-mortar approach. This apart, its convenient for the investor as well, an analyst said.        
	Recently, SBI Mutual Fund introduced an online payment option through SBI ATM-cum-debit cards. The payment facility is available for all SBI Mutual Fund equity and most debt schemes. The move is meant to entice SBI account holders to buy the banks mutual funds.        
	Earlier this week, HDFC Standard Life had launched its online buying channel starting with three products  YoungStar Super Suvidha, Pension Super and Endowment Super Suvidha, according to PTI.         
	Our online buying service aims to address the need of a niche segment of the population which understands insurance products. It will also help them experience a simple, convenient, transparent, and cost-effective way of buying a life insurance plan, HDFC Standard Lifes executive vice-president Sanjay Tripathy, had said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex gains on late buying
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sensex gains on late buying
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Sept. 30: Short-covering at the fag-end of trading helped the sensex to recoup the losses made earlier in the day and gain 113 points to close above the 20000-mark at 20069.12 with metal, banking and IT stocks in the limelight.         
	Experts said the Ayodhya court verdict, which came out after trading hours, did not have a major bearing on the days trade. The volatility seen today was on account of the expiry of the settlement in the derivatives segment.         
	Weak signals from the global markets saw the benchmark index opening lower at 19931.49 and going down to 19864.46. However, short-covering in the last hour helped the index to stage a strong comeback.         
	The Nifty, too, cut short two days of losses and rose 0.65 per cent to finish at 6029.95.         
	The sensex, which had dipped below the 20000-level in the last session, has recorded a net gain of 11.6 per cent in September, the best monthly gain so far in this year.         
	From here on, the market movement will be dependent on how the world markets fare and the behaviour of the foreign institutional investors, Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS, told The Telegraph.         
	Mahindra Satyam was a big loser as the scrip sank nearly 9 per cent, or Rs 8.80, to Rs 90.10 a day after the company declared the financial results for 2008-09 and 2009-10.         
	Sugar stocks were also in demand after the government brought down the levy quota on the commodity to 10 per cent from 20 per cent.         
	HDFC rose 3.2 per cent to emerge as the biggest gainer in the sensex pack. HDFC Bank rose 1.45 per cent, the SBI, 1.22 per cent and ICICI Bank, 0.80 per cent. In metal stocks, Hindalco rose 2.61 per cent and Jindal Steel 0.29 per cent.         
	Sterlite, which had dropped over 8 per cent in the previous day, ended 3.28 per cent higher. Among the frontline IT stocks, Infosys rose 0.39 per cent, TCS, 0.16 per cent and Wipro, 1.61 per cent. ITC rose 2.53 per cent and HUL, 0.75 per cent. RIL lost 1.28 per cent to close at Rs 986.35.

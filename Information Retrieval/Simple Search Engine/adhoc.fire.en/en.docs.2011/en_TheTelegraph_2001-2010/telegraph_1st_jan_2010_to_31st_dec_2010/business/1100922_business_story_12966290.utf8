	New Delhi, Sept. 21: Norways Telenor expects to clock over 100 per cent growth in revenues from its Indian operations in the third quarter of 2010, riding on an increase in minutes of use and improved average revenue per user (Arpu).        
	Telenor owns 67.25 per cent in domestic mobile operator Uninor, while the rest is with real estate major Unitech. Uninor, which started providing GSM mobile services from December 2009, is one of the new operators to get licences in January 2008.        
	The global service provider expects to garner Rs 160 crore as revenues from Uninor in the third quarter of 2010, a 109 per cent growth from Rs 76.6 crore in April-June. It expects to add around 7 million subscribers in India, up from 3.9 million added in the second quarter.        
	Addressing analysts and investors in Oslo today, Telenor CEO Jon Fredrik Baksaas said the firm intended to develop Uninor in India according to a plan and aimed to continue to deliver growth above peers.         
	Revenue growth is coming from an overall increase in minutes of use as well as improving Arpu, said Sigve Brekke, managing director of Uninor and Asia head of the Telenor group.         
	Uninors average Arpu in August is around Rs 100 per month compared with the industry average of Rs 150 per month. According to telecom regulator Trai, minutes of use per subscriber is around 410 per month.        
	Brekke said Uninor was getting more primary SIM use  which implies that a customers main SIM is Uninor in a phone with two or three SIM cards  specially from Calcutta, Bengal, Mumbai, Maharashtra and Gujarat.        
	Telenor said its Indian operations would break even at a core profit level (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) three years after its launch.         
	The companys target is to secure an 8 per cent market share in India by 2018.        
	Uninor said it was banking on its dynamic tariff plan, which gave discounts of over 60 per cent on calls depending on time and location.        
	Uninor is strengthening its distribution network through improved channel servicing, commissions aligned to business goals and value-based incentives for retailers.

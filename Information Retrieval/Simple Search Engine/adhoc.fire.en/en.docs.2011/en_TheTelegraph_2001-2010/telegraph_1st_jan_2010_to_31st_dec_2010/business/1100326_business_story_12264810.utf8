	New Delhi, March 25: Tata Motors plans to increase prices across models in April to meet higher costs on account of the new emission norms that will kick in next month.        
	In 13 cities, including Calcutta, cars will have to run on fuel that meets Bharat Stage-IV standards.         
	The exact amount of price increase will be ascertained closer to the April 1 deadline. The hike will also factor in increasing raw material prices, said Rajiv Dube, president (passenger cars) of Tata Motors.         
	He said the industry might witness a short-term slowdown in sales because of the hike, but the dust would settle down soon.         
	Sales may get impacted for short term but 75 per cent of sales are financed and as long as that does not get affected, sales should largely be on track, he said at the inauguration of the second Jaguar-Land Rover (JLR) dealership in the country here today.         
	Mahindra amp; Mahindra, too, had said it was considering another round of price hike, with the implementation of the new emission norms.         
	On JLR, Dube said the company hoped to sell about 250 units by the month-end.        
	Share sale        
	Foreign fund Citigroup Global Markets Maturities today sold shares of Tata Motors worth Rs 182.86 crore through open market transactions.        
	The fund house has sold 25.22 lakh shares at Rs 724.85 apiece, according to bulk deal data available on the National Stock Exchange.

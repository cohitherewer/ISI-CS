The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lack of consensus to delay GST bill
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Lack of consensus to delay GST bill

	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The government may have to wait till the winter session of Parliament to introduce the bill on goods and services tax as consensus continues to elude the Centre and states.        
	According to sources in the finance ministry, it serves no purpose to table the bill and have it referred to a standing committee when consensus is still to be built on the issue.        
	BJP-ruled states have sought a months time to study the draft constitutional amendment bill, which was reworked after states refused to give certain veto rights to the Centre.         
	The revised draft proposes that any decision on GST can be taken only if there is a complete consensus between the Centre and the states.         
	Earlier, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had allayed fears that the bill could curb the rights of states and stressed that a GST council comprising central and state ministers would take decisions by consensus.         
	No tax can be levied except by authority of law. The primacy of legislature in taxation is supreme and the proposed draft did not seek to disturb or alter this, the minister had said at a meeting of the state finance ministers. However, the BJP, which is co-operating with the Congress on the crucial Nuclear Liability Bill, is biding time, upsetting the governments plan to present the bill in the monsoon session.         
	If the bill was tabled in the monsoon session, it would have been referred to a standing committee that would have given a report by the winter or budget session.         
	In this way, the bill could have been passed before the end of the financial year, allowing the government to meet the April deadline for the new tax regime.        
	GST is a two-tier tax  a central rate and a uniform state rate  and will eliminate local indirect taxes such as central excise duty and state levies such as VAT, entertainment and luxury taxes.         
	The fate of octroi duty  levied by states on goods moving on roads  is still uncertain.        
	The earlier deadline for implementing GST from April 2010 was missed because of differences between the Centre and the states over the tax structure.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Food inflation fell to 9.53 per cent for the week ended July 24, prompting the government to claim credit for it.         
	In December, the index was 21.6 per cent. Now, it has come down to 9.53 per cent. It is because of certain steps that were taken (by the government), finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his reply to a debate on inflation in the Rajya Sabha.        
	He said the Reserve Bank of India was keeping a close watch on the demand factors that fuel inflation and would make adjustments.        
	The dip in food inflation can be attributed to the fall in the prices of vegetables, especially potatoes and onions. After lingering above the 16-per-cent mark for nearly eight weeks, food inflation eased to around 12 per cent before falling to single digit in the week ended July 17.        
	Mukherjee said the Centre had done everything possible to blunt inflation and it was the states responsibility to take action against hoarders and revamp the public distribution system.        
	We will have to be careful in the next few weeks, as food prices could rise again. The bigger decline will come only around October when the kharif crop is harvested and will boost agricultural output, Sonal Varma, economist at Nomura Securities, said.        
	Mukherjee said the RBIs monetary policy was in sync with the Centres fiscal policies.         
	The RBI does not want to frame policy, which is discordant with fiscal policy. That is why, it is making changes in doses, he said.        
	He said the rapid expansion of the economy was generating inflationary pressures and the RBIs appropriate monetary policy was helping to tame prices by mopping up excess liquidity.

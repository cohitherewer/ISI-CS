	Mumbai, July 22: The first iPad imitator is here.         
	Even as Steve Jobs and Apple continue to ignore the Indian market, an iPad clone has been launched at a price range of Rs 22,000-25,000  a fraction of what the real McCoy will cost when it eventually gets here.         
	Olive Telecom, a Gurgaon-based company that sells mobile devices, launched the OlivePad, the first 3.5G pad to be sold in the country, in New Delhi today.        
	With iPad sales touching 3.27 million in the quarter ended June 30, Apple is seeing phenomenal sales of its revolutionary tablet device that was launched in early April.         
	But even as it continues to ignore markets in Asia (the iPad is only available in Japan now), the rip-offs have started to ride on the gizmos reputation. Several manufacturers have already announced the launch of tablets based on the Android operating system.        
	OlivePad, which operates on the Android operating system, has several additional features compared with the iPad, including a smartphone, two cameras and supports the Adobe flash technology, a feature not available on Apples tablet.        
	The OlivePad is not a me-too device. It has the features of a smartphone whereas the iPad is essentially a computing device. We offer voice, video and cameras. Our product is a combination of 3.5G smartphone and a tablet. We see this as a big differentiator, said Olive Telecoms chairman Arun Khanna.        
	Olive Telecoms multi-functional device supports 3.5G HSUPA, Wi-fi, and Bluetooth. With an in-built three megapixel camera and a front camera, the OlivePad can be used as a touch notebook that offers browsing, multimedia, GPS for maps, gaming console, an e-book reader, television and a smart phone with voice and video calling.        
	Khanna expects to sell 75,000 to 1,00,000 units in the next six months and launch versions of this tablet with a display of 7 inches compared with 9.7 inches of the iPad. I believe this segment will explode in the next one year and we are seeing huge traction in markets such as CIS countries and Mexico, he added.

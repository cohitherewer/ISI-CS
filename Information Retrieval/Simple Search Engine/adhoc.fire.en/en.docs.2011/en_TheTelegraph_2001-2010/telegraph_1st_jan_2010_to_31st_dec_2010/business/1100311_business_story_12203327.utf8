          SOUNAK MITRA                                            
	Calcutta, March 10: The tea industry is set to see a shortage this year, which is expected to push up prices.        
	According to statistics available with the Indian Tea Association and the Tea Board of India, global shortage stood at over 53.6 million kg last year. This is the extent to which output in 2009 was lower than the previous years output.        
	Taking into account similar shortfalls of the previous years, the deficit would touch 130 million kg by April this year. While output in India in 2009 has remained at almost the same level as last year, consumption grew 30 million kg and the season started with a shortfall of 25 million kg.         
	During 2009, producers such as Africa, Kenya, India and Sri Lanka registered sharp fall in output because of drought. In India, however, production picked up during the latter half of the last quarter of the year because of improved weather conditions.         
	According to statistics, during January-December 2009, Kenyas deficit stood at 31.6 million kg and Sri Lanka reported a shortage of 28.9 million kg.        
	Though industry analysts and major tea producers in the country are hopeful that prices will be strong next year, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has projected that prices globally will ease in 2010.        
	Tea prices reached record levels this year but should ease in 2010 as weather patterns returned to normal in the main tea-producing regions of Asia and Africa, FAO said in its latest report.        
	The surplus pipeline stock started depleting from 2003. While the pipeline stock grew to 67 million kg in 2003 from 53 million kg in 2000, it came down to 26 million kg in 2006.         
	Pipeline stock is the difference between a years output and the previous years.         
	During January-December 2009, output fell to 978.9 million kg from 980.8 million kg in 2008 mainly because of a lower contribution from south India.

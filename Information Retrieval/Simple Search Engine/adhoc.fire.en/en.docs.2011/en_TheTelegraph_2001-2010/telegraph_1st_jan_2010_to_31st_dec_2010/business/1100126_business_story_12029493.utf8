          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh: Clearing the air                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: South Korean Poscos Rs 54,000-crore steel project in Orissa may get off the ground in the next four to five months within which the land acquisition and regulatory issues will be resolved, steel minister Virbhadra Singh said today.        
	We are in constant touch with the Orissa government. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has also intervened. We will see that things get expedited as the project is of great national importance, he said after meeting an eight-member Posco delegation headed by chairman and global head Joon Yang Chung.        
	Efforts are on to ensure that the entire matter is resolved in the next four to five months. This includes physical transfer of land and all regulatory clearances. The company will start production within two years once the issues are addressed, Singh said.         
	It was a very fruitful meeting, Chung said.        
	Poscos 12-million-tonne steel plant is facing delay because of land acquisition problems and red tape. The integrated steel plant will be set up at Kujanga near Paradip Port in Jagatsinghpur district.        
	Singh said mines had already been allotted to Posco but some claimants, including a PSU, had moved Orissa High Court against this.        
	He said the government would request the high court to dispose of the case expeditiously. The litigant PSU would also be persuaded to withdraw the case.         
	The minister said Posco was in talks with the Maharashtra and Karnataka governments for projects besides the one in Orissa.         
	The Posco plant is the countrys largest foreign direct investment project.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | October start for Salboni steel
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      October start for Salboni steel
          SAMBIT SAHA                      Biswadip Gupta, CEO and joint MD of JSW Bengal Steel                          
	Calcutta, April 4: The Jindals want to start erecting their steel plant at Salboni in west Midnapore by October.        
	JSW Bengal has set an October 1 deadline to begin work on the Rs 20,000-crore steel and power projects.        
	The deadline has been pushed back several times in the past three years. It is also not in line with what Sajjan Jindal had said earlier this year. After meeting Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Jindal had said he would start work over the next six months, which is by June-July.        
	Biswadip Gupta, CEO and joint MD of JSW Bengal Steel, said such delays were natural in large projects. We will start digging from October. But a lot of preparatory work is currently on before construction begins, he said.        
	JSW Bengal is a special purpose vehicle set up by the JSW group for the steel project. The Bengal government has a 5 per cent stake in the company.         
	JSW signed a memorandum of agreement with Bengal in January 2007. It laid the foundation stone on November 2, 2008, an event overshadowed by a Maoist landmine attack on the convoy carrying Bhattacharjee, the then Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Jindal. They were returning from the ceremony.        
	The company had been changing strategies for the project. Initially, it was a 3-million-tonne (mt) unit that was scaled up to 6mt and brought down to 3mt.        
	Gupta said JSW was now looking at a 4mt capacity to begin with. We will put up Indias largest blast furnace of 5,500 cubic meters.         
	The Jindals plan to bring in Japanese steel maker JFE which is likely to pick up a strategic stake in JSW Bengal. JFE operates such large furnaces, with one in Japan capable of producing 4.2mt hot metal. The team that is carrying out expansion work at JSWs Bellary plant in Karnataka is visiting Salboni.        
	China coal deal        
	The Jindals have inked a deal with China Coal Energy to develop the semi coking coal blocks of Kulti and Sitarampur and the thermal coal block of Ichhapur.        
	The Chinese company has already begun exploration work. China Coal will bring in technology, mine the coal and supply to the Jindals.         
	Coal appears at an average depth of 800-850 meters in these mines. China Coal has the required technology to mine at such depths, generally unusual in India.        
	Jindals Bengal project is one of the very few in India to have land in possession, environment clearance, SEZ status, coal mines and assured water supply. It is well connected to the national highway and a broad gauge rail line, as well.        
	Power plant shift        
	JSW Energy, which proposes to build an 800x2 megawatt plant in Bengal, has decided against putting up the unit at Burdwan in compliance with the new government norms for airports.        
	The plant was coming up within 20 km of the proposed airport city at Andal. Gupta said the unit would be at Salboni, as planned before. The steel plant is likely to be commissioned in 2013 and the power unit in 2014.

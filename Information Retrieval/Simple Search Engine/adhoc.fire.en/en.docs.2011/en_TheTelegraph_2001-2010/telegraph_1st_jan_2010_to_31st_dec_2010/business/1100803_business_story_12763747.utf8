The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi pulls up Anil, group firms
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sebi pulls up Anil, group firms
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ambani: Facing queries                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 2: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has issued show-cause notices to Anil Ambani and four senior executives asking them to appear before the market regulator for a personal hearing on September 3 over certain questionable stock market transactions.        
	The capital markets regulator has also issued notices to two Anil Ambani group companies  Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) and Reliance Infrastructure Ltd.         
	Although Sebi did not disclose the grounds for issuing these notices, it is learnt that the notices arise from the controversy relating to Anil Ambani group firms Reliance Energy (now known as Reliance Infrastructure) and RNRLs accounts in a London branch of UBS. There are accusations that funds were siphoned off from accounts in the London branch and later invested in the Indian stock markets.        
	The other key executives of the Anil Ambani group who have been asked to appear before the Sebi officials are Satish Seth, executive vice-chairman of Reliance Infrastructure, S.C. Gupta, director of Reliance Infrastructure, J.P. Chalsani, director, Reliance Infrastructure, and Lalit Jalan, whole-time director of Reliance Infrastructure.        
	The two companies had raised money through external commercial borrowings and foreign currency convertible bonds around four years ago. There have been allegations that these funds were used to buy shares in India.        
	Last November, UBS was fined 8 million in the UK by the Financial Services Authority after four of its senior employees were found misusing funds of customers, including the two Anil D. Ambani group companies.         
	One of the entities that came into focus was Pluri Emerging Companies, a foreign institutional investor. There are allegations that Pluri had used the funds siphoned out of the bank accounts to buy shares in India.        
	Sebi today said the eight noticees that included the two companies and others had been served the show-cause notices (SCNs) in this connection on June 9. Through these notices, they were offered opportunity of inspection of documents and they were advised to reply to the notices within 21 days.        
	I further note that though the two noticees were provided opportunities of inspection of documents and reply to the SCNs, they did not avail the same. They did not do so even after notice for personal hearing was issued, said M.S. Sahoo, Sebis whole-time member.        
	Responding to the development, the Anil D. Ambani group said in a statement that the matter is sub-judice. Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, RNRL and the concerned individual directors will comply with due process of Sebi, and are confident of suitable resolution of the matter, as legally advised.

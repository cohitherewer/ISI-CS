The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GST runs into fresh trouble
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      GST runs into fresh trouble
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Asim Dasgupta in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today played the price card and asked the Opposition to convince states ruled by them to agree to the goods amp; services tax (GST), even as his draft GST legislation was rejected by states over granting the Centre certain veto rights.         
	If taxes go down, commodities will become cheaper and it will provide great relief to consumers. It is precisely for this that my government has undertaken the single biggest reform in taxation in the form of GST, Mukherjee told the Lok Sabha in reply to a debate on inflation, trying to turn the tables on states that had been trying to delay his tax reform measure.        
	However, not only the Opposition but most states today rejected the GST draft constitutional amendment bill, which sought to provide a veto power to the Union finance minister in the proposed tax regime.        
	Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta, the chairman of empowered group of state finance ministers on GST, was one of the first to reject the draft.        
	States in general have reservations about the Union finance minister having any veto power on state GST ... the draft in its present form is not acceptable to us, said Dasgupta.        
	The rejection hampers the governments plan to introduce the bill in the ongoing session of Parliament which in turn, puts a question mark on the GST rollout next fiscal.         
	By shifting the focus from inflation to GST during the debate in the Lok Sabha, Mukherjee tried to take the battle to the Opposition camp after being cornered over rising prices. Over the last seven months, the annual food inflation in the country has swung between 13 per cent and 20 per cent. Opposition parties have blamed the government for helping to fuel the price rise with inaction and an attempt to cut oil subsidies.        
	GST proposes to replace a wide range of central and state levies  the central excise tax and state tax such as octroi and sales tax  with a single goods or service tax at the point of consumption. Analysts say the reform should lower prices.        
	Mukherjee had pushed GST among states through numerous parleys with the empowered group only to be rebuffed by the Opposition-ruled states.        
	States with BJP governments, led by Gujarat, had been the most vocal against GST.        
	The Opposition is arguing the new regime can lead to lower revenues for states and has called for a pilot project.        
	However, todays rebellion against the tax reform move was not expected. At the meeting of the empowered group with Mukherjee, states said they feared that giving the veto power to the Union finance minister on state GST would dilute their fiscal autonomy.        
	The states have sought at least a month for their response to the proposed legal changes. They have also proposed that the chairman of the GST council should be appointed on a rotational basis.        
	States feel that the GST disputes authority should not find a place in the constitutional amendment bill and may be incorporated in GST legislations, said Dasgupta.

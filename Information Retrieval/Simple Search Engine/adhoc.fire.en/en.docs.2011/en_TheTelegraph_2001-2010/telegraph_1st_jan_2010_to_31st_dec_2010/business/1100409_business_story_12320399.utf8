The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Descon divests 17.3% DPSC stake
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Descon divests 17.3% DPSC stake
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, April 8: Descon has sold 17.31 per cent stake in power generator DPSC Ltd to Orbis Power Venture Ltd.        
	The IT firm, which holds 32.31 per cent in DPSC, offloaded the shares in the open market on Monday.         
	The shares have been picked up by Orbis, a special purpose vehicle led by infrastructure finance company Srei, at Rs 709.98 a share.        
	Orbis had paid nearly the same price to Andrew Yule, the LIC and the GIC to take control of DPSC last year.        
	Descons sale comes at a time public sector Andrew Yule is disputing the ownership of the IT firms holding in DPSC.        
	An interim order in 2003 had barred Descon from selling its stake. However, a single bench of Calcutta High Court removed the restriction last month.        
	Yule contested the single bench order and moved a division bench seeking injunction. The division bench has refused to give a stay. The matter is coming up for hearing tomorrow. When contacted, S. Radhakrishnan, managing director of Descon, declined to comment.        
	It is also learnt that Descon has submitted the rest of its 15 per cent holding in the open offer made by Orbis. If it is accepted, it will pave the way for Descon to cash in on its stake and exit DPSC, formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Corporation.        
	However, the court proceeding tomorrow will have a bearing on whether Descon could offload the 15 per cent in the open offer. The company took advantage of the window of opportunity provided by the single bench order in March to sell off 17.31 per cent in DPSC. As of today, there is no bar on Descon to sell the shares.        
	Descon could rake in as much as Rs 97 crore by selling the DPSC stake. Orbis, led by Srei and supported by Indian Power Company Ltd, was keen to buy this stake to take complete control.        
	Descon had fought a hard bidding war with Srei-IPCL to buy the stakes of LIC, GIC and Andrew Yule from DPSC but eventually lost out.        
	The origin of the case between Descon and Yule over DPSC shares dates back to a dispute in 2001 when the IT firm declined to give 26 per cent stake to Yule through a preferential allotment. The matter went to court.        
	Descon was of the opinion that the 2003 order was meant to keep the power company within the Andrew Yule group.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | April exports jump, imports rise too
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      April exports jump, imports rise too
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Robust show                                  
	New Delhi, May 19: Exports surged 36.2 per cent to $16.9 billion in April, while imports shot up 43.3 per cent to $27.3 billion.         
	The import surge indicates increased consumption by domestic industries and a rise in output in the months ahead.        
	Dont get carried away by these (export) numbers because there is an increase in percentage terms because of the low base effect. We are still running below the export level of April 2008. The huge surge in imports is more interesting because I have never seen numbers this large... $8 billion jump in a month, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said.        
	He said imports rose because of industrial recovery, stronger domestic growth and rising oil prices. Imports stood at $19 billion in April 2009. Trade deficit was $10.4 billion against $6.7 billion in the year-ago period.        
	Factory output has been rising steadily, with a 13.5 per cent growth in March and a 10.4 per cent rise in 2009-10.        
	Khullar said the increase in the import of gems and jewellery, chemicals, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals and ore indicated growing domestic demand, potential export push and industrial recovery. He said the trade deficit at current levels was not worrying.        
	In April 2009, exports had shrunk nearly 30 per cent to $12.4 billion in line with a 9 per cent contraction in global trade as a result of the financial crisis.         
	Khullar said the Greece debt crisis had not impacted exports. The European Union is Indias largest trading partner and accounts for around 20-25 per cent of exports.        
	You do not know how Greece will pan out. I hope for the best, but I have to be ready for the worst, he said.        
	The government has set a an export target of $200 billion for 2010-11 and aims to double the amount by 2014.

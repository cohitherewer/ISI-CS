  - Rollback vies for attention with stimulus cut        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee and CII president Venu Srinivasan (right) in New Delhi on Wednesday. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	New Delhi, March 3: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the current economic recovery was not broad-based and was driven by the governments stimulus measures.        
	Mukherjee, however, expressed optimism that the economy would grow at 8-8.5 per cent in the next fiscal.        
	I hope this budget will help us consolidate the gains from the recovery process. However, there is no room for complacency regarding our economic growth. Recovery continues to be driven by the governments stimulus spending and is not completely broad-based, he said at an industry event.        
	The finance minister said a complete rollback of stimulus was not on the cards till growth had spread to all the sectors.         
	The budget raised excise duty by 2 per cent to 10 per cent in a partial withdrawal of stimulus. The government had cut excise duty by 6 per cent, besides reducing service tax by 2 per cent, to provide a boost to the economy hit by global recession.        
	Mukherjee said the double-digit food inflation was a major concern, and the Centre was taking steps along with the states to cool the surging prices in the next few months.        
	While rolling back stimulus the government has also offered sops in direct taxes.        
	The loss of Rs 26,000 crore resulting from direct tax proposals is in my view an extension of stimulus, he said.        
	Mukherjee expressed confidence that economic growth in the fourth quarter of this fiscal would pick up again and I am confident that GDP would grow between 8 per cent and 8.5 per cent in the next fiscal.        
	He said the fall in growth in the third quarter was primarily because of the poor performance of agriculture and expected growth to accelerate in the March quarter,        
	The third quarter growth rate of 6 per cent reflects the sharp decline in agricultural growth rate due to drought and negative rate of government spending. I do expect that in the fourth quarter the GDP will pick up again, he said. The economy grew at a slower-than-expected rate of 6 per cent in the third quarter.        
	The challenge is to quickly reach the high growth path of nine per cent and then find the means to cross the double digit growth barrier, Mukherjee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Food inflation in single digit
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Food inflation in single digit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, July 29: Food inflation fell to a single digit at 9.67 per cent in mid-July for the first time in more than a year because of a high base effect and the governments steps to augment food supplies.        
	Food inflation was at 12.47 per cent in the previous reporting week.        
	The inflation numbers will provide some relief to the government. It is a very welcome news. Inflation has moved pretty much on cues as I had expected. It feels good. However, it should not be over interpreted, chief economic adviser Kaushik Basu said.        
	Opposition parties led by the National Democratic Alliance had organised an all-India agitation against inflation on July 5, which saw the BJP and the Left parties coming together on an issue.        
	The issue of price rise rocked Parliament again today, leading to an adjournment of the proceedings in both the Houses for the third consecutive day. The Opposition parties want discussion on price rise under a rule that entails voting, which the government is not keen on.        
	The fall is basically due to the high base affect. Besides, a seasonal fall in food inflation is normal. And we can expect a further fall because of the monsoons progress and rise in farm productivity, said Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University.        
	Food inflation had remained above the 16 per cent level for most part of last year, before falling to below 13 per cent since mid-June. Data showed the decline was mainly because of a fall in the prices of vegetables, especially potatoes and onions. The fuel prices index rose to 14.29 per cent, reflecting the governments decision to raise the prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene and cooking gas in the last week of June.        
	Though the government can draw comfort from the lower food inflation, data released by the government show that prices of pulses, milk and fruits rose 21.23 per cent, 19.03 per cent and 12.14 per cent, respectively, in the last one year.        
	I am glad that it (food inflation) is beginning to come down. Well before December end you will see a definite deceleration in food inflation and I hope it would follow the single-digit number, although it is very difficult to predict exactly how much it will be, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said.

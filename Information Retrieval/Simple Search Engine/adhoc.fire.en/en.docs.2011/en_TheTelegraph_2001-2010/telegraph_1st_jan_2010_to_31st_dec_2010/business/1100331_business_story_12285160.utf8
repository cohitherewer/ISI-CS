                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bharti seals Zain deal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Africa calling                                  
	New Delhi, March 30: Bharti Airtel finally managed to prise open the African market by inking a $10.7-billion deal today with Kuwaits Zain to buy the latters African assets.        
	Under the agreement signed in Amsterdam, Bharti will acquire Zains mobile operations in 15 countries having a total customer base of over 42 million. The Bharti-Zain combine will have revenues of some $13 billion and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of around $5 billion.         
	Indias No. 1 cellular player had tried to enter Africa earlier only to beat a retreat following a double failure over a two-year period to stitch a deal with South Africas MTN.        
	The Zain deal, which does not cover the Kuwait firms operations in Morocco and Sudan, puts Bharti in direct competition with MTN.        
	This agreement is a landmark for the global telecom industry and a game changer for Bharti The extremely tight timelines and the enormity of the task posed a real challenge, said Sunil Mittal, chairman and managing director of Bharti Airtel.        
	Bharti has finalised $8.5 billion for the acquisition  a consortium of banks led by Standard Chartered and Barclays would lend it $7.5 billion and the State Bank of India would give a $1-billion rupee loan.         
	With this acquisition, Bhartis global telecom footprint will expand to 21 countries  Seychelles, Jersey, Guernsey, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zains operations in the 15 African countries.        
	Mittal, however, may face challenges in turning round Zains under-performing operations, particularly in Nigeria, its most important market.         
	Zain faces a legal suit from Econet Wireless, a South African telecom company, which is opposing the sale of its Nigerian operations to Airtel.         
	The company had been desperate to sell its Africa operations, which is a drain on its resources.

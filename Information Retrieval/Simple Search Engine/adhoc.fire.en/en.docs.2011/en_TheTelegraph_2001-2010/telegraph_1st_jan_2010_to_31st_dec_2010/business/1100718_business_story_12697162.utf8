	Calcutta, July 17: Hiring in information technology is estimated to be about 20,000-25,000 in Bengal during 2010.        
	A lot of new companies are setting up facilities in the state and the existing ones are on an expansion mode. We expect that about 20,000-25,000 jobs will be added this year, state IT minister Debesh Das said on the sidelines of a programme organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	In 2009, the state reported 15,000 fresh employment in IT and IT enabled services. At present, there are around 1 lakh IT professionals.        
	In December, Wipro had announced that it would set up a second facility spread over 50 acres in Bengal. According to Das, major IT firms such as PwC, Capgemini and Cognizant are also expanding presence in the state.        
	On land acquisition problems, Das said, It has slowed our speed, but cannot stop us. For us, 2009 was a golden year. Bengal has reported an 8 per cent growth in information technology in 2009, he added.

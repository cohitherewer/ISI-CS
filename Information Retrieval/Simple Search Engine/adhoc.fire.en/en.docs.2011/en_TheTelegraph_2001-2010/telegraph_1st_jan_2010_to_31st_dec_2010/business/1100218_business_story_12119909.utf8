          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: State-run Bharat Heavy Electricals (Bhel) plans to hire 8,000 employees over the next two years to help it to meet its production targets and requirement of personnel for its foray into nuclear power.        
	We are recruiting people at the rate of 4,000 per year. We have done that in the last two years. This year also, we are on track, chairman and managing director B.P. Rao said.        
	In the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12), Bhel had targeted to add 20,000 people, of which over half have already been enrolled. About 12,000 of the companys workforce will retire in the next two years.        
	The company has about 48,000 employees.         
	Bhel manufactures equipment that can generate 10,000 mega watt (mw) electricity and plans to ramp up capacity to 20,000mw by the end of the plan period. Rao said Bhel alone could not be blamed for the delay in supplying equipment to meet the countrys target to generate 78,000mw of power by 2012.         
	There are a number of factors that have to be taken into account  absence of casting and forging makers in the country. However, we have geared up to bring new technologies, form joint ventures and employ people to overcome delays.         
	Rao said the company would announce the third partner in its proposed joint venture with Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd.

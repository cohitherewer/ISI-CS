The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Goldman to shell out $550m to settle claims
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Goldman to shell out $550m to settle claims
          SEWELL CHAN LOUISE STORY                          Robert S. Khuzami, enforcement director of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in Washington on Thursday. (AP)                                  
	Washington, July 16: Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay $550 million to settle federal claims that it misled investors in a subprime mortgage product as the housing market began to collapse, officials said on Thursday.         
	If approved by a federal judge in Manhattan, the settlement would rank among the largest in the 76-year history of the US Securities and Exchange Commission but would represent only a small financial dent for Goldman, which reported $13.39 billion in profit last year.         
	News of the settlement sent Goldmans shares 5 per cent higher in after-hour trading, adding far more to the firms market value than the amount it would have to pay in the settlement.         
	Even so, the settlement is humbling for Goldman, whose elite reputation and lucrative banking business endured through the financial crisis, only to be battered by government investigations that shed light on potential conflicts of interest in its dealings.        
	This settlement is a stark lesson to Wall Street firms that no product is too complex, and no investor too sophisticated, to avoid a heavy price if a firm violates the fundamental principles of honest treatment and fair dealing, said Robert S. Khuzami, the commissions director of enforcement.         
	The civil suit brought by the SEC focused on a single mortgage security that Goldman created in 2007, just as cracks appeared in the housing market. That security, called Abacus 2007-AC1, enabled a prominent hedge fund manager, John A. Paulson, to place a bet against mortgage bonds.         
	The commission contended that Goldman misled investors, who were making a positive bet on housing, because Goldman did not disclose Paulsons involvement in creating the deal. Paulson has not been accused of wrongdoing.         
	Though Goldman did not formally admit to the SECs allegations, it agreed to a judicial order barring it from committing intentional fraud in the future under federal securities laws.         
	In addition, Goldman acknowledged that the marketing material for Abacus contained incomplete information and that it was a mistake not to have disclosed Paulsons role. As part of the agreement, the bank also said it regrets that the marketing material did not contain that disclosure.         
	Goldmans general counsel Gregory K. Palm signed the SEC settlement on Wednesday, though it was not announced until after markets closed on Thursday. Officials said the timing was not affected by the Senates approval of an overhaul of financial regulations.         
	Word that Goldman had settled the case began leaking about 30 minutes before the markets closed and appeared to please investors.         
	Some analysts had expected a settlement by this Monday, when Goldman, which had been under pressure from shareholders to reach a settlement, was expected to deliver a formal response to the commissions complaint.         
	We believe that this settlement is the right outcome for our firm, our shareholders and our clients, Goldman said in a written statement.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata Cap to beef up travel business

	Mumbai, Sept. 7: Tata Capital  the financial arm of the Tata group  is trying to develop its travel-related business on the lines of American Express, albeit on a smaller scale.        
	The wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Sons sees a huge upside in the travel-related segment that can be met by payment solutions such as credit cards and travellers cheques besides holiday packages and car rentals.        
	To put its payment solutions model in place, Tata Capital is on the verge of acquiring Chennai-based TTK groups foreign exchange business called TT Forex.         
	Though TTKs forex business is not very large, the company will offer Tata Capital a national presence as well as products, which include travellers cheques, money transfer and travel currency cards.        
	A Tata Capital spokesperson declined to comment on the companys plans in travel-related services or on the acquisition of TTKs forex unit.        
	Besides TT Forexs payment solutions, Tata Capital can offer customers the Tata branded credit card launched by its parent Tata Sons. The white-label card, which is issued and operated by the State Bank of India, has been taken over by Tata Capital, which markets and distributes this payment option.        
	Ticketing and holiday packages were brought within the Tata Capital portfolio as early as 2008 when the company took over the erstwhile Indian Hotels travel agency Inditravel Pvt ltd.        
	Once the entire chain of payment solutions and product offerings is in place, Tata Capital plans to focus on travel-related services through its subsidiary TC Travel and Services Ltd. Tata Capital was keen to brand the business as Tata Travels, a source said.         
	However, the parent has not pushed for it as the segment is still at a nascent stage.

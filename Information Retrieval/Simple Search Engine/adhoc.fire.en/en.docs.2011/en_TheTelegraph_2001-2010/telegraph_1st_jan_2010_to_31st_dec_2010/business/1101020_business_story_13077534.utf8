          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Good show                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 19: HDFC Bank has reported a 33 per cent rise in second-quarter net profit on the back of a robust loan growth.         
	Net profit rose to Rs 912.14 crore from Rs 687.46 crore in the same period last year. Analysts had expected a net profit of around Rs 910 crore.         
	Net interest income, which is interest earned minus interest paid, grew 29.2 per cent to Rs 2,526.3 crore, driven by an average asset growth of 30 per cent and a stable net interest margin of 4.2 per cent.         
	Net revenues, which is net interest income plus other income, rose 15.9 per cent to Rs 3,487 crore from Rs 3,009.3 crore last year.         
	Other income stood at Rs 960.7 crore. This includes a growth of 16 per cent in fees and commissions to Rs 857 crore from Rs 738.6 crore in the same quarter last year.         
	The bank also made lower provisions because of an improvement in asset quality. During the period, provisions and contingencies came down to Rs 454.5 crore from Rs 594.1 crore.         
	The ratio of gross non-performing assets to gross advances fell to 1.2 per cent as on September 30 from 1.8 per cent in the year-ago period.         
	Bajaj Auto         
	Bajaj Auto has posted a 69 per cent rise in profit for the second quarter ended September, driven by a strong demand for motorcycles and a jump in non-operating income.         
	Net profit rose to Rs 682 crore from Rs 403 crore during the same period last year. Analysts had expected it to post a profit of around Rs 650 crore.         
	Total income rose 50.37 per cent to Rs 4,341.82 crore from Rs 2,887.51 crore a year ago.        
	The quarter witnessed a new high in sales volume, which rose 46 per cent to 1,000,570 units. This was reflected in its turnover, which grew 52 per cent to Rs 4,426 crore from Rs 2,909 crore in the previous year.         
	According to the firm, a richer product mix  comprising more Pulsars and Discovers  and record volumes helped it to post better margin at 20.7 per cent, up from 20 per cent in the preceding period.

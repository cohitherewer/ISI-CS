The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Yule seeks Italian tech for hydel push
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Yule seeks Italian tech for hydel push
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Deal plan                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 17: Andrew Yule is looking at a technology alliance with Italys Fiore in hydraulic turbines.        
	The proposed venture will supply to mini hydel projects of up to 25 mega watt capacity.         
	Yule officials said representatives from the Turin-based company were likely to come to Calcutta next month to seal the deal.        
	The development comes close on the heels of two successive stake sales by Yule in Phoenix Yule and DPSC, which helped the PSU to clean up its balance sheet.        
	The company paid off an interest-free loan of Rs 73.56 crore to the Centre. Now, the management can better pursue opportunities in its existing businesses  engineering, electrical and tea.        
	The tie-up with the Italian company is a step in that direction.         
	We need to increase the product portfolio to grow existing businesses, said an official.        
	Yule plans to manufacture the turbines at its Kalyani facility in Bengal without much investment.        
	According to an estimate, mini hydel projects, which are plants of up to 25mw size, will add as much as 15000mw to the total power capacity in the next few years.         
	Yule hopes to make a dent in that huge market with the Italian company.        
	Going by the industry thumb rule, Rs 5 crore investment goes into producing a mega watt of hydel power. Of this, 40 per cent, or Rs 2 crore, is spent on equipment. The turbine is likely to cost Rs 1 crore in that pie.        
	Thus, Yule can potentially tap a market of Rs 15,000 crore through the joint venture.        
	The company makes transformers, electrical switchgears and high tension control panels at its electrical division.        
	Yule also manufactures industrial fans, air and water pollution control equipment at its mechanical division.         
	The Kalyani plant is doing well and is self-sufficient. However, the Chennai plant within the electrical division is yet to catch up.

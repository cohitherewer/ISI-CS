          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 11: The Reserve Bank of India today relaxed the rules for infrastructure finance companies (IFCs) raising funds through the external commercial borrowings (ECB) route.        
	IFCs from now on will not need the apex banks approval to raise overseas funds equivalent to or less than half of their own funds. Approval will be required if they raise more than 50 per cent of their net owned funds.         
	ECBs are loans from non-resident lenders, which can be accessed under two automatic and approval routes.        
	In a notification issued today, the central bank said it had been decided to modify the current ECB rules in respect of those non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) categorised as IFCs.         
	According to the current norms, IFCs are permitted to avail themselves of ECBs for lending to infrastructure firms under the approval route.        
	As a measure of liberalisation of the existing procedures, it has been decided to permit IFCs to avail themselves of ECBs, including outstanding amounts, up to 50 per cent of their net owned funds under the automatic route, subject to their compliance with the prudential guidelines already in place, the RBI notification said.        
	External commercial borrowings by IFCs above 50 per cent of their net owned funds would require the approval of the Reserve Bank and would, therefore, be considered under the approval route, it added.        
	All the other aspects of the ECB policy such as the $500-million limit per company per financial year under the automatic route, eligible borrower, recognised lender, end-use, average maturity period among other conditions will remain unchanged.        
	The RBI relaxation is expected to benefit players such as IDFC, Srei Infrastructure Finance, Power Finance Corporation, among others.        
	At present, infrastructure includes power, telecom, railways, roads, including bridges, sea port and airport, industrial parks and urban infrastructure. Recently, cold storages for the preservation of agricultural, marine produce and meat have also been included under the infrastructure category.

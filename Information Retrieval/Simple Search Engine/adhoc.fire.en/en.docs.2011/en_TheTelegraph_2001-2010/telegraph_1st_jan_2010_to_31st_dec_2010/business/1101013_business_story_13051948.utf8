The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Factory growth tumbles in August
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Factory growth tumbles in August
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT PTI                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: Industry growth for August dropped to just 5.6 per cent from 15.2 per cent in July, raising concerns about the economys ability to move to a higher growth trajectory if fresh investments decline in absolute size.        
	The dip mainly reflected a fall in capital goods output that shrank 2.6 per cent year-on-year in August.        
	The trend is a little disappointing. Let us see how it fares in annualised terms, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said. Policy-makers are expecting more than 8.5 per cent growth in this fiscal at a time the global economy is struggling to fully yank itself out of recession.         
	The index of industrial production (IIP) had surged to 335 in July only to come down to 309.1 in August, and several analysts said the strong July performance could have been an aberration. They pointed to a traditional slowdown during the monsoon season, which stretched for a longer period.         
	The weak IIP show sparked a debate on any further increase in key policy rates by the Reserve Bank and triggered a huge sale on the bourses, with the sensex plunging 225 points in intra-day trade. The losses were pruned to 137 points at close.        
	The RBI should not raise policy rates any further as it could have a negative impact on consumer demand as well as corporate investment and thereby slow down economic growth, the CII said in a statement.         
	Ficci, too, said any further hike in interest rates could impact consumer durables and the automobile sectors.        
	Manufacturing, which constitutes 80 per cent of the industrial output, grew 5.9 per cent against 10.6 in August 2009.        
	Mining growth decelerated to 7 per cent from 11 per cent, electricity generation to 1 per cent from 10.6 per cent.         
	Only consumer durables showed a positive trend in August  its growth rose to 26.5 per cent from 24.7 per cent a year ago.        
	Moodys Analytics, in a research note, said the August data might give the Reserve Bank of India reason to pause its monetary tightening.        
	While volatility (in industrial output data) will likely persist, the decelerating trend evident over the past three or four months suggests below-trend results can be expected for the remaining months of 2010, Moodys said.        
	From the second half of 2010, we are seeing some signs of moderation in industrial activity and signs of weaker global demand and supply-side pressures, said Nomura economist Sonal Varma.        
	Shares fall        
	The sensex shed almost 137 points today as investors reacted to the poor August IIP data.         
	Reliance Industries and L amp;T were the worst-hit scrips in the 30-share pack.         
	Amid weak global cues, the 30-share barometer of the Bombay Stock Exchange lost 136.55 points, or 0.67 per cent, to close at 20203.34.         
	In a similar fashion, the wide-based 50-share Nifty index of the National Stock Exchange finished 0.73 per cent lower at 6090.90.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | S Tel bid to clear the air
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      S Tel bid to clear the air
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 8: S Tel officials today met telecom minister A. Raja to resolve issues regarding the governments security concerns.         
	S Tel is jointly owned by C. Sivasankarans Siva Group and Bahrain Telecom Company (Batelco).        
	Last week, the department of telecom (DoT) had asked S Tel to stop mobile services in Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa circles, citing security concerns. DoT officials said S Tel needed security clearance from the Intelligence Bureau to start services. The matter is likely to be resolved soon as there is no other concern except pending security clearance, they said.        
	Top executives of the firm said it was still offering telecom services to its customers and hoped that the matter would be resolved soon.         
	S Tel, which holds licences for six circles and started services in three in December 2009, has over 6 lakh subscribers. The company applied for another 16 licences on September 28, 2007.         
	Industry insiders said telecom being a strategic sector, no company could be allowed to start services at this scale without having all the requisite permissions in place. They said this could be an arm-twisting tactic by the government.         
	A case filed by S Tel that accused the communication ministry of bias while allotting 2G licences in early 2008 is coming up for hearing in the Supreme Court.         
	On September 25, 2007, Raja had said the cutoff date for licence applications would be October 1, which was later changed to September 25.                                
	Later, he said September 25 itself would be the actual cutoff date.         
	The Delhi High Court has already ruled in S Tels favour, holding Rajas decision to be blatantly arbitrary and illegal. Following which the telecom ministry has now approached the Supreme Court for relief.         
	If the Supreme Court upholds the Delhi High Court verdict, Raja could face serious embarrassment, forcing DoT to award licences and spectrum to not just S Tel but over 200 other applicants, were denied licences on the basis of this cut-off date.         
	Several of these companies have alleged the DoT changed the cut-off date to September 25 so that only a few select Indian companies such as Swan, Unitech, Loop, Datacom and Shyam get licences. So far, DoT has provided no explanation for changing the cut-off date.

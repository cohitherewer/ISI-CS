          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 10: Powered by good tidings from afar, equities at home today staged a stunning recovery with the sensex surging over 561 points to end at 17330.55. This is the biggest one day gain in around 10 months.         
	Though India was not affected by the crisis in Greece, developments in Europe had resulted in share prices remaining under pressure over the last few sessions as foreign institutional investors sold stocks here to make up for the losses overseas.         
	The sensex opened higher today at 16799.49 and thereafter consolidated its position. However, the real boost came post noon, when the index hit an intra-day high of 17356.54 and thereafter closed at 17330.55, marking a gain of 561.44 points, or 3.35 per cent.         
	Brokers said hectic buying by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and a sharp rally in realty and metal stocks were the key highlights of the day. As commodity prices rallied in response to the EU bailout package, the BSE metal index gained 6 per cent, while the BSE realty index led the list of gainers with a rise of 6.17 per cent.         
	Market experts say the indices are likely to head northwards from here on, though one should not expect a sharp rally as seen today.         
	The rally should sustain in the near-term, Apurva Shah, vice-president and head of research, Prabhudas Lilladher, told The Telegraph.         
	Automobiles, engineering, power and oil amp; gas are some of the sectors that are likely to score gains over the next few days, Shah added.        
	The rupee today surged by 64 paise against the dollar, the biggest one-day gain in nearly 12 months, on heavy selling of the dollar amid its loss against the euro.        
	Banks and exporters sold dollars following a weakness in the US currency overseas and expectations of more fall in the near term, dealers said. At the Interbank Foreign Exchange market, the rupee closed at 44.85 a dollar, a gain of 1.41 per cent, or 64 paise.        
	Meanwhile, finance secretary Ashok Chawla today allayed fears of Greeces debt crisis impacting the Indian economy.        
	I think we are immune. We were immune when there was a much larger international financial crisis, Chawla said on the sidelines of an Assocham function.        
	As far as India is concerned, the impact will be minimal. In the short run, it might help India in terms of being regarded as a relatively more safe haven, Chawla said.

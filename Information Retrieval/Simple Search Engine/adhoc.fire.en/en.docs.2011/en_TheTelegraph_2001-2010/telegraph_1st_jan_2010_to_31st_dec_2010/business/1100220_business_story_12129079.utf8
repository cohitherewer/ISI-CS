The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Weak Asian cues pull sensex down
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Weak Asian cues pull sensex down
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 19: The sensex fell 136 points to 16191.63 as both the Indian and other Asian markets reacted negatively to the US Federal Reserves decision to raise the rate on short-term funds lent to banks.        
	Metals and realty stocks took a hit today. Metals suffered as global prices took a beating with the dollar gaining against other currencies. Realty stocks were hit by interest rate concerns.         
	Heavyweights such as RIL, which ended over a per cent lower on worries that it might have to shell out more for the acquisition of LyondellBasell, also contributed to the weak close.         
	Brokers say the stock markets are likely to be under pressure and they can hover in a narrow range in the near term till the presentation of the budget on February 26.         
	There is an apprehension that a part of the stimulus package may be withdrawn in this budget, an analyst said.         
	The sensex began weak today at 16256.53. Selling by both funds and retail investors saw the index hitting an intra-day low of 16074.58. However, it staged a recovery after the Prime Ministers economic advisory panels report said the economy would grow at least 9 per cent in 2011-12.         
	The main NSE index, Nifty 50, lost 42.85 points to end at 4844.90.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas to tie up with Nippon
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tatas to tie up with Nippon
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deal Time                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 29: After years of deliberations, Tata Steel will finally sign an agreement with Nippon Steel of Japan to build a plant in Jamshedpur to make automotive grade steel.        
	The Indian company will retain a majority 51 per cent stake of the Rs 2,400-crore venture, while the Japanese firm will hold the rest. The capacity of the plant  to come up within the premises of Tata Steels existing unit in Jamshedpur  will be 0.6 million tonnes. The new unit is expected to be operational in two years.        
	The Tatas and Nippon have been looking at the possibility of this project for more than three years. The development comes close on the heels of Japans JFE Steel Holdings picking up a 14.9 per cent stake in Indias largest private steel company, JSW Steel.        
	Sumitomo of Japan has also inked an agreement with Bhushan Steel for sourcing hot-rolled coils from the latters new plant in Orissa. This will be processed into auto grade steel and sold under the Sumitomo brand.         
	Tata Steel says it has a 45 per cent share of the auto grade steel market, estimated at three million tonnes a year. Apart from the steel used for the interiors, the Tatas also manufacture the skin panel  the outer sheet of the car  for some major companies. Toyota uses Tata products for its sedan Etios.        
	Tata Steel Europe, formerly Corus, has advanced technology for auto grade steel for outer skin panels but that is more suited for snow and corrosion. In India, there is no use of the technology.         
	Given the dominance of the Chinese and the Japanese in the Indian auto market, Nippons technology will cut more ice with customers.        
	Nippon Steel and Tata Steel have been working together for quite some time.        
	In 2005, the two companies had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) whereby the Japanese major would provide technical assistance to select a facility layout for Tata Steels Orissa project. In 2002, the two companies had signed a technical agreement to take Tata Steels cold-rolled auto steel to the market.        
	Tata Steels association with Nippon is unlikely to stop with the cold-rolled steel plant in Jamshedpur. There is a possibility that the two may also collaborate to build an integrated primary steel plant of three million tonnes.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 13: Prices of coking coal  a key raw material in steel  are likely to go up, a well-known trade expert said.        
	Gerard McCloskey, chairman of UK-based Merlin Trade amp; Consultancy, said prices could touch $250 a tonne between April and June compared with the prevailing rate of $209 a tonne (free on board).         
	The contract for the first quarter of 2011 has been settled at $225 between manufacturers such as BHP Billiton and Japanese steel mills.        
	I think the demand will be strong and prices will be firm. Coking coal prices will be good for the entire decade, McCloskey said at the sidelines of a seminar on steel raw material outlook in Calcutta organised by IPF Online.        
	His prediction, however, remains modest compared with the forecast of Standard Chartered, which sees prices hitting $350-a-tonne level. Its bold according to me, McCloskey said.        
	Coking coal rates have a direct impact on the price of steel  used in construction, consumer durables and automobiles.         
	India has only a small quantity of coking coal reserves. Last year, the country imported 23.5 million tonnes (mt), mostly from Australia, while domestic production stood at 7mt.        
	The last time coking coal had hit $300 a tonne in 2008, steel rates were ruling at $1,000 a tonne. At present, steel prices are nowhere near that level, and given the weaknesses in the European Union and the US economies, there is a remote possibility that it may touch that level.        
	McCloskey said high coal prices would push up valuation of mines, but many companies, including the Tatas, might seek to buy them.        
	China will remain a key determinant in the global market. There has been spate of mine closures in China.         
	Chinese imports are expected to be around 40mt against 34mt last year.

	Calcutta, June 13: Norways Orkla, which had bought Bangalore-based MTR Foods in 2007, is eyeing more Indian food and beverage firms to expand.         
	The company is likely to shell out Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,000 crore for buyouts in India. We are looking for both national and regional brands with local flavour, MTR chief executive officer Sanjay Sharma said.        
	MTR Foods  the manufacturer of spices, instant mixes and ready-to-eat food  is also gearing up to become a national brand.         
	The 86-year-old heritage brand is a household name in south India, which accounts for 70 per cent of the companys business.        
	The company has its own team, which is looking for merger and acquisition opportunities. We do not have any merchant banker as such, he said.        
	MTR Foods was acquired by Orkla for over Rs 250 crore in early 2007. In a two-pronged strategy, MTR Foods aims to strengthen its distribution both in the north and west. The company also intends to double its total marketing spend to build its brand equity in these regions. It spends about 14 per cent of its turnover, which is between Rs 250 crore and Rs 300 crore, on marketing.        
	Though MTR Foods is the market leader in spices in the south, other brands such MDH and Everest sell more in the north. Therefore, plan is to focus on instant mixes in the north and west. Under instant mixes, MTR aims to promote the breakfast range by leveraging its popular south Indian foods.        
	By 2015, the north and west should account for 40 per cent of our targeted turnover. We aim to double our turnover and become a Rs 500-crore brand by 2012 and treble our profits as well, Sharma said.         
	The companys EBITDA margin is around 11 per cent and it has a debt of about Rs 30 crore. It aims to become debt-free by 2012.        
	According to Sharma, the company will cut debt by trimming its distribution network. First, we need to build our business in larger towns, therefore we have decided to pull back our distribution from several smaller towns. MTRs presence will, therefore, come down to 150 smaller towns from over 500.         
	The company is also looking at sourcing opportunities from the the north and west. For the first time, it has outsourced the production of vermicelli to a third-party manufacturer in Mathura.         
	More food categories will be evaluated to cut freight costs on transporting raw materials such as wheat from the north to south.

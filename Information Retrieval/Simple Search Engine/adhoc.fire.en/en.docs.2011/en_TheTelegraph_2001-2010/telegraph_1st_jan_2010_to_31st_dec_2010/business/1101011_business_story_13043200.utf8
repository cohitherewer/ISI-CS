          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 10: The government is gearing up to infuse Rs 7,600 crore in six public sector banks  the Bank of Baroda (BoB), the Oriental Bank of Commerce, Andhra Bank, Dena Bank, IDBI Bank and Vijaya Bank  to increase its shareholding.         
	The move will provide the banks with scope to raise funds, without the government holding falling below the mandatory 51 per cent. The Centre holds less than 55 per cent in these banks.        
	Around Rs 7,600 crore will be infused in the six banks, in the form of preferential allotment, to increase the governments shareholding, finance ministry officials said.        
	Vijaya Bank is expected to get a capital infusion of Rs 1,500 crore, BoB, Rs 2,500 crore and Dena Bank, Rs 600 crore. Providing headroom for banks to tap the market will also allow them to raise capital in tier-II structure (for example, debts), which will have a multiplier effect on their credit lending and ratings, officials said.         
	Earlier, financial services secretary R. Gopalan had said the government was looking at increasing its holding in those banks where it has just over 50 per cent stake.        
	We will hike the stake to give them adequate cushion to raise money from markets at a later stage without diluting the majority stake of the government, Gopalan said.         
	The Centres holding in BoB stands at 53.8 per cent, the Oriental Bank of Commerce, 51.1 per cent and Andhra Bank, 51.6 per cent. In IDBI Bank, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank, the governments holding is 52.7 per cent, 51.2 per cent and 53.9 per cent, respectively.        
	Officials estimate that PSU banks will need about Rs 35,000 crore by 2012 to keep pace with their expansion and the new capital adequacy norms.         
	In Budget 2010, the government had committed an additional Rs 16,500 crore to help banks to maintain a tier-I capital adequacy ratio of above 8 per cent.         
	In the near term, capital infusion in PSU banks will continue as part of the Rs 16,500-crore package committed by the government, finance ministry officials said.        
	As part of this programme, the government had injected Rs 1,500 crore in four banks in May.        
	In June, the finance ministry approved the injection of Rs 6,211 crore into the Union Bank of India, the Bank of Maharashtra, IDBI Bank, Uco Bank and the Central Bank India.         
	These infusions are in the form of direct equity and hybrid tier-I capital, including perpetual non-cumulative preference shares.         
	In 2008-09, the government had pumped Rs 190 crore into four banks, while infusing Rs 120 crore in another three in 2009-10.        
	Analysts said the amount of recapitalisation would be key to the growth of the 27 state-run banks, which accounted for more than three-fourth of lending.

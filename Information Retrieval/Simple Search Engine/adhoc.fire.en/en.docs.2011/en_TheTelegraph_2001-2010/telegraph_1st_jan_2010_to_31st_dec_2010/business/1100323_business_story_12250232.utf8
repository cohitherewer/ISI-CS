The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wider gas grid in the pipeline
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Wider gas grid in the pipeline
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 22: Over 7,000km of gas pipeline network will be added in the country in the next two to three years to meet the growing demand for the clean fuel in eastern and southern India.        
	The challenge for an emerging market such as India is to develop pipeline infrastructure in all parts of the country, including in the remote areas, in tandem with increasing supplies. Only then we will be able to secure inclusive growth, petroleum minister Murli Deora said at the Sixth Asia Gas Partnership Summit here today.        
	Most of the pipeline infrastructure is concentrated in the west and north, while the south and east have hardly any.        
	The present natural gas transportation infrastructure in the country is around 10,800km with capacity to carry 270 million standard cubic metres of gas per day (mmscmd).        
	Major pipeline projects are underway in the country, which will add another 7,450km and 248mmscmd to our gas transport infrastructure, he said.        
	Natural gas, he said, is the fuel of choice today. It enhances energy security, it is an efficient fuel for power generation, a cheaper feedstock for industries, a cleaner alternative for vehicles, it reduces air pollution and, in general, it leads to an improved quality of life.        
	Calcutta, Haldia, Burdwan and Durgapur are some of the cities in Bengal which will have city gas facilities.         
	Discoveries by Reliance Industries Limited in the Krishna Godavari basin have almost doubled the availability of gas from domestic sources.         
	Today, about 40 cities and towns are covered by CNG (city gas network). We intend to provide city gas to more than 200 more cities. Piped natural gas in more big cities and metros will help us to divert LPG supplies to our rural areas, Deora said.         
	The governments target is to roll out gas networks in 200 cities over the next three years. This will involve an investment of Rs 60,000 crore. The average cost of setting up a city gas network is around Rs 300-400 crore.         
	A McKinsey report says Indias natural gas demand is expected to nearly double to 320mmscmd by 2015. The current demand of 166mmscmd  made up of nearly 132mmscmd supplies from domestic fields and the rest from imported LNG  is likely to rise to at least a minimum of 230mmscmd and a maximum of 320mmscmd by 2015.        
	Meanwhile, oil secretary S. Sunderashan said the government might soon raise the prices of natural gas produced by ONGC and Oil India by as much as 30 per cent.

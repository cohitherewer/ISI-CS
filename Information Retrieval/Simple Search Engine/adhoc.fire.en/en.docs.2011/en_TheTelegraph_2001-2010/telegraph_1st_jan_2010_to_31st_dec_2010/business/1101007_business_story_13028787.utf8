The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Centre weighs easier oil hunt rules

          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Relief in sight                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: The government plans to relax the rules for the next round of bidding for oil and gas blocks, which will commence from October 15 with roadshows.         
	On the table are proposals to do away with technical capability criteria for small onland blocks, extend the initial exploration phase by one year to five years and allow companies that have surrendered blocks to bid again.        
	The oil ministry is working on the revised norms, which will have to be approved by an inter-ministerial committee of secretaries, officials said.        
	The government plans to offer 34 oil and gas blocks in the forthcoming round  the ninth in the series under the new exploration and licensing policy  compared with 70 blocks in the previous round.        
	For small onland blocks, bidders technical skills will not be evaluated during initial screening. The blocks, which span an area of less than 200 square kilometres, provide an opportunity for firms to gain experience in exploration.        
	With more companies becoming eligible to bid for these blocks, the bids will be evaluated only on the basis of the committed work programme and fiscal package.         
	Officials said the initial exploration period for deepwater blocks and blocks in the northeastern region should be increased to five years, instead of four years in the previous round of bidding.        
	Blocks in deep water and those in the Northeast are difficult to operate. Accurate estimation of hydrocarbon potential of these blocks requires more time. The extension in the exploration period, the ministry hopes, will encourage more companies to place bids. In the previous round  the eighth in the series  the initial exploration period was four years and the second stage was three years; this should change now.        
	However, operators would now be allowed to drill the committed number of wells at any time during the second period without any stipulation of drilling one additional exploratory well every year.        
	The ministry has also proposed to allow bidding by companies that had surrendered blocks. Earlier, companies which chose to exit a block without fulfilling their obligations were not allowed to bid for the same block as an operator. They could, however, choose to be a member of a consortium bidding for the block, provided another company was the operator.        
	Companies who have relinquished blocks earlier may have acquired new ideas or methods which they may choose to implement in these blocks.The operators who had quit a block without fulfilling their commitments had to pay damages. Barring them from bidding again would amount to penalising them twice for the same offence.        
	Another proposal relates to forfeiting the bond money if a production sharing contract is not signed within 90 days of the government awarding a block. This should encourage the participation of only serious players.        
	As many as 239 blocks have gone to bidders since the launch of the new exploration and licensing policy in 1997.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          .P. Bhatt in New Delhi on Thursday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: The State Bank of Indias (SBI) first-quarter net profit rose 25 per cent on higher demand for loans and earnings from retail banking.        
	Net profit for the April-June period rose to Rs 2,914 crore from Rs 2,330 crore a year earlier, said chairman .P. Bhatt.        
	The PSU lender will soon take a call on raising deposit and lending rates for existing borrowers by at least 25 basis points.        
	There is an upward bias on interest rates ... on both deposit and lending rates. We will review deposit rates and benchmark prime lending rate, Bhatt told reporters.        
	Most of the public sector lenders, including Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank, have raised lending rates after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased its short-term lending (repo) and borrowing (reverse-repo) rates by up to 50 basis points in July.        
	Indias No. 1 bank benefited from the 3G and wireless broadband auctions, which led to huge borrowings by telecom companies to make licence payments.        
	Loans climbed 21 per cent from a year earlier to Rs 6.64 lakh crore at the end of the quarter. The State Banks market share on loans widened to 16.55 per cent from 16.43 per cent a year earlier.        
	Bhatt sees the banks credit growth at 21-22 per cent for the current fiscal.        
	Interest income grew 6 per cent to Rs 18,452 crore from Rs 17,473 crore, while interest expenses fell 10 per cent to Rs 11,148 crore from Rs 12,448 crore. As a result, the net interest income, or revenue from borrowers after deducting interest paid to depositors, jumped 45 per cent to Rs 7,304 crore from Rs 5,025 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Other income, including fees, commissions, treasury and foreign exchange transactions, grew to Rs 3,690 crore from Rs 3,569 crore in the year-ago period.        
	The pressure on the banks asset quality continued with the percentage of gross bad loans to total advances rising to 3.14 per cent from 2.79 per cent a year earlier. Provision for bad loans increased 29 per cent to Rs 1,733 crore from Rs 1,344 crore.        
	Capital adequacy ratio was 13.54 per cent, lower than 14.12 per cent a year earlier but higher than the mandated 9 per cent. Shares of the bank today shot up nearly 7 per cent on the BSE, driven by the strong first-quarter results.        
	Meanwhile, Parliament today passed a bill allowing the government to reduce its stake in the SBI to the bare minimum of 51 per cent.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tea wage review on the cards
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 6: The Bengal government has decided to conduct a tripartite meeting on May 19 to review an interim wage revision proposal of tea garden workers.         
	The present wage structure will lapse on March 30, 2011.         
	Considering the price rise in commodities across verticals, we have placed our demand for an interim renewal of the cash components of the salary of the workmen at the tea gardens, union representatives said.         
	The state labour department has requested garden owners to resolve the issue at the meeting. However, the labour unions have not specified the amount of wage hike. Wages of labourers comprise cash and infrastructure facilities.         
	A tripartite meeting was held at the Writers Buildings today to discuss the infrastructure facilities offered to the workers, following the state labour departments inspection of the 142 gardens in north Bengal.         
	The labour department had constituted a medical advisory board, housing advisory board and an electrification monitoring committee to oversee the welfare amenities for the workers.         
	The meeting was fruitful and we have given a mandate to the garden owners to develop the physical infrastructure within the stipulated dateline, state labour commissioner Satyabrata Chakraborty told The Telegraph.         
	Tata Tea makeover        
	The Tatas have decided to change the name of Tata Tea Ltd to Tata Global Beverages Ltd.        
	The board of directors has today approved the new name as part of the groups strategy to establish itself as a complete beverages brand globally, the company informed the bourses.        
	However, the name change is subject to the approval of shareholders and the Indian government.        
	The Tata group entity, which has made big-ticket acquisitions to foray into coffee, energy drinks and mineral water, intends to keep its existing brands such as Tata Tea, Tetley and Eight Clock Coffee under Tata Global Beverages.

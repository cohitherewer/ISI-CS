          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, June 30: ITC has sold off its shares in Thapar family-controlled Ballarpur Industries and reduced its strategic stakes in two entities  Agro Tech Foods and VST Industries.         
	The company, in a regulatory filing with its shareholders, said it sold around 23 lakh shares, or 0.38 per cent, in paper maker Ballarpur during the last financial year.        
	The city-based tobacco-to- hotels major had bought into Ballarpur in 2007-08.         
	It was ITCs third high-profile trade investment in rival firms after tobacco maker VST and hospitality major EIH.        
	During the annual general meeting of ITC in 2008, chairman Yogi C. Deveshwar had explained the companys strategy of buying into firms having similar businesses. If there is value, we will invest, Deveshwar had said.        
	ITC became the leader in paperboards after it merged its own subsidiary ITC Bhadrachalam with itself earlier this decade. Ballarpur is the leader in the paper industry.        
	ITC did not build upon its initial stake in Ballarpur. Usually, it preferred to consolidate its holdings in companies where it bought stakes, much to the discomfort of the promoters of the target firms.        
	Such a strategy was pursued in EIH, VST and Hotel Leelaventures. In contrast, the Ballarpur stake remained the same over the last two years.        
	More share sale        
	During the last fiscal, ITC pared its stake in edible oil maker Agro Tech Foods and VST Industries.        
	The company sold off around 6.92 lakh shares in Agro Tech, reducing its stake to 13.92 per cent from 16.77 per cent in 2009-10.        
	In VST, the company sold around 27,000 shares, bringing down its holding to 14.09 per cent from 14.26 per cent.        
	Incidentally, ITC had been holding on to these investments for years.         
	For instance, the company had promoted ITC Agro in 1986 and sold off the majority stake to ConAgra of the US in 1997, when the name changed to Agro Tech.        
	It continued to hold on to the minority stake in Agro Tech for 12 years before selling part of the holding in the last fiscal.        
	In VST, ITC entered the company in 2001-02 with a small stake but then steadily ramped it up to nearly 15 per cent.         
	The company raised its stake in Hotel Leela to 8.48 per cent from 3.72 per cent.         
	The holding has now crossed 10 per cent; moreover, it did not offload any shares in EIH either.        
	The company could not be reached for comment.        
	The stakes in rival firms were bought by ITCs wholly owned investment arm Russell Credit.         
	ITC decided to take Russells stakes in EIH, VST, Agro Tech and Hotel Leela on its own balance sheet a day before the last fiscal closed on March 31, 2010.        
	All the investments were transferred at their historical buyout costs, which amounted to Rs 387.31 crore.

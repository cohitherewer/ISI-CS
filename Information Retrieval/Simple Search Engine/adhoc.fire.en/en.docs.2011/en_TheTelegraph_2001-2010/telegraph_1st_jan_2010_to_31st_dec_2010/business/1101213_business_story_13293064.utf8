                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      PPF poser
                                I have a PPF account in my name. Can my HUF also contribute to the same PPF account, if total contribution in a particular year is within the maximum limit of Rs 70,000?          Harish Pandey, Howrah
                    HUF wants to avail itself of the exemption under section 80C of the income tax act for contribution to the PPF, the HUF account should be separate. However, following a government directive on May 13, 2005, no bank opens an HUF account for PPF. The government amended the Public Provident Fund Scheme, 1968 wherein a PPF account can only be opened in the name of the self or minor.                                    Gifting shares      After holding some shares for more than a year my wife has transferred them from her demat account to my demat account. If I sell those shares now, what will be the tax implication on the profit?         Pratim Pal, Serampore
                    ce the total holding period of those shares is more than one year, the capital gains arising from the sale will be considered as long-term. The transfer of such shares to you by your wife can be considered as an act of gift. The long-term capital gains arising from the sale of shares through a stock exchange are exempt from income tax.                                     Provident fund       After working for 10 years, I had quit my employer few months ago. I havent withdrawn the provident fund till now. Shall I continue to get interest on the PF account?        Shyamal Ghose, Calcutta
                    After a certain waiting period of three years the unclaimed fund is transferred to the unclaimed deposit account. Interest on unclaimed deposit is not credited every year but it is calculated and credited to the members accounts at the time of settlement of the claims. So, your PF account will continue to earn interest. But you should either shift the account to your new employer or withdraw the money at the earliest.

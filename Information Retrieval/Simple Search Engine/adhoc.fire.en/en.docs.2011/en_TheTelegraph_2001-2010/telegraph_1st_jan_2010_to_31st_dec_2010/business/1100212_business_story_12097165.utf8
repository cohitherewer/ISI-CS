          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and petroleum minister Murli Deora will meet on Sunday to juggle with the options on fuel pricing as the Congress treads the tightrope between the need to balance the books of the PSU oil companies and the shrill cries of allies Trinamul Congress and the DMK to keep a lid on the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG.        
	The allies fear a hike in the prices at a time of high food inflation will hit the masses.        
	Food inflation rose for the third straight week to touch 17.94 per cent at the end of January, fuelled by costlier potatoes and pulses, but the government was confident that the prices of essential items would cool down once the winter crop came to the market.        
	We will discuss (on Sunday) fuel pricing and if there is a need to raise prices, it will be to what extent, how much and for which products, a senior petroleum ministry official said.        
	The government is concerned about the mounting oil subsidy bill but cant afford to stoke inflation. RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn said food inflation was expected to moderate towards the end of 2010 in the event of normal monsoon.        
	Officials said Deora did not take fuel pricing up before the cabinet today as the core group of the Congress had decided last night that the government should take a call only after taking the allies on board.        
	No, it (auto fuel hike) was not discussed today, home minister P. Chidambaram said after the cabinet meeting.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee and telecom minister A. Raja had opposed the move when the oil minister held talks with them yesterday.         
	Trinamul and the DMK face assembly polls in the next 15 months and would not like to take a step that could affect their prospects.        
	Sources said both Mukherjee and Deora were in favour of a Rs 2-3 a litre hike in petrol and diesel prices and an increase of Rs 25 on a LPG cylinder.        
	At present, petrol is being sold at a loss of Rs 4.72 a litre, diesel at Rs 2.33 per litre, kerosene at Rs 18.06 per litre and domestic LPG at a discount of Rs 287.59 per cylinder.        
	Deora met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after the cabinet meeting and had asked the government to cover the losses suffered by the state-owned refiners from selling fuel below cost.         
	I submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister and (Pranab) Mukherjee seeking compensation for the shortfall (in revenues), Deora said.

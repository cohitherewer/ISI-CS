          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee with outgoing IBA chairman M.V. Nair (right) in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, June 8: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today warned that India could see capital inflows into the country shrink in the medium term if the sovereign debt crisis in Europe continued to snowball.        
	Mukherjee said India could no longer remain aloof to overseas developments and had to keep a close watch on the European crisis triggered by the problems in Greece        
	If the crisis in Greece turns into a larger European sovereign debt crisis and possible fragmentation of the European region, then there are chances of adverse capital flows. This could turn out to be a major area of concern for us in the medium term, Mukherjee told a roomful of senior bankers at the annual general meeting of the Indian Banks Association.        
	At a function earlier in the day, Mukherjee had said the uncertainties in the global markets could exacerbate volatility on Indian bourses but he didnt think that this would be a major cause for worry. Given the uncertainties in the global market, especially in Europe, there may be some adverse impact on the market...(however) there is no need to press the panic button, he said.        
	The finance minister advised bankers to be ready to face several challenges in the days ahead. They would have to constantly augment their capital base to meet the needs of one of the fastest growing economies.         
	The challenges for banks during the current year include an uncertain pace of global recovery, exit policy, containment of non-performing asset levels, higher provisioning norms, he said.         
	The finance minister said banks might no longer enjoy windfall treasury gains that the secular decline in interest rates had earlier provided. He said bad loans at some banks had risen notably recently. This would have negative consequences in the form of lower net profits for banks and put pressure on the lending rates.        
	Standoff on Ulips        
	Mukherjee said the government would soon resolve the standoff between the Sebi and the insurance regulator over the regulation of Ulips.        
	I am aware of some recent issues arising in the life insurance industry, especially concerning Ulips. We will resolve this soon, the finance minister said earlier in the day, while inaugurating the new building of the Insurance Institute of India.

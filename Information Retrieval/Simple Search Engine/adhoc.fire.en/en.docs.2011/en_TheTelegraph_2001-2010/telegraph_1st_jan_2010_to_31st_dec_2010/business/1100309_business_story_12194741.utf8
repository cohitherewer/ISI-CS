          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 8: Exide Industries Ltd, the countrys largest storage battery maker, has launched a qualified institutional placement (QIP) issue to raise around Rs 450-500 crore.        
	The company, with headquarters in Calcutta, will offer up to 5 crore shares at around Rs 107.9 apiece.        
	The Exide scrip closed at Rs 110.15 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, gaining 0.95 points, or 0.87 per cent.        
	The Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Enam Securities Pvt Ltd, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG are managing the share sale.        
	S.B. Ganguly, chairman emeritus of Exide, said the funds would be deployed to increase capacity and upgrade technology. Demand is very strong. We need to add capacity, he said.        
	The company has six plants in India. It has also picked up a stake in a lead smelter.         
	Exide is the market leader in lead-acid battery in both the auto and industrial segments.        
	Exide also owns a 50 per cent stake in ING Vysya Life Insurance Company Ltd.        
	Industry observers said a part of the QIP money could be used to support the loss-making insurance venture.        
	As of March 31, 2009, Exide had invested Rs 531.9 crore in ING Vysya Life Insurance.         
	The company could also look out for more buyouts, especially in the lead smelting segment.                          
	However, a bigger acquisition in related lead-acid battery sector can not be ruled out either.

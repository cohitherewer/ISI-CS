          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 21: Coal India has created history in the countrys primary market with its maiden public offer receiving bids worth Rs 2.35 lakh crore from investors. This is the highest ever that any primary issue has garnered in India.        
	The mega issue, which closed today, was subscribed over 15 times. With this, state-run Coal India has nudged past the the Reliance Power IPO that had attracted bids valued over Rs 2.05 lakh crore when it was launched in January 2008.        
	The response to Coal Indias IPO from all classes of investors has surpassed even the most optimistic predictions. It has caught even the biggest optimists by surprise, SMC Global Securities strategist Jagannadham Thunuguntla said.        
	Interestingly, Coal India has also surpassed the record of RPowers Rs 11,700-crore IPO to become the countrys largest public issue. The government is looking to garner up to Rs 15,400 crore by offloading a 10 per cent stake in the coal producer.        
	Market circles said the number could soar as applications from retail investors were still being counted. Bidding for the IPO closed yesterday for qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). Retail and non-institutional investors had time till today.        
	According to data available with the NSE, the IPO received bids for over 965.50 crore shares against the total issue size of over 63.16 crore shares. Most of the bids came at the upper end of the price band of Rs 225-245 apiece.         
	At the higher price band and excluding the 5 per cent discount for retail investors and employees, the demand is valued at over Rs 2.35 lakh crore, which is more than the amount invested by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in equities this calendar year.         
	Analysts estimate that if the retail discount of 5 per cent is taken into account, the value of the bids will be over Rs 1.8 lakh crore.         
	The best response came from the QIBs whose portion was subscribed by a massive 24.70 times. Bids were received for more than 701 crore shares against over 28.42 crore shares reserved for the category.         
	Market observers said the response was remarkable as FIIs had to pay the entire subscription amount upfront.        
	Bids received from retail investors were more than two times the 19.89 crore shares on offer in this category.        
	Analysts feel the strong financials of Coal India along with the attractive pricing of the IPO had fuelled the blockbuster response.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the huge demand for the CIL offer showed investor confidence in premier Indian companies. This (Coal India) is a premier organisation. It speaks how much confidence they enjoy  public sector undertakings and private sector firms, Mukherjee told reporters.        
	Huge participation from FIIs as well as retail buyers shows high confidence in the worlds largest coal producer (CIL), said coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal.        
	A panel of ministers, headed by the finance minister, is expected to meet on Sunday to decide the issue price of the public offering.        
	Many feel the issue price is likely to be fixed at the upper end of the price band, which will enable the government to raise over Rs 15,100 crore.         
	The huge response to the CIL issue will boost the governments plan to mop up Rs 40,000 crore from divestment this fiscal.

	Calcutta, April 20: The Bengal government plans to set up a biotech incubation centre on 1.5 lakh square feet of space at Salt Lakes Sector V.        
	We have 3.5 lakh sq ft available in Sector V, of which we have set aside significant space to incubate biotech companies, state IT and biotechnology minister Debesh Das said.        
	The state government has placed orders worth Rs 2 crore to buy machines to develop infrastructure for firms that will occupy space at the centre. We have issued an expression of interest and tenders are expected to open in a weeks time, Das said. The government has also applied for a loan to fund the project.        
	The centre shall take two years to be operational. Meanwhile, machines worth Rs 4 crore have arrived in the city, to be housed in an adjacent building, for DNA sequencing study, he said.        
	Export of Indian biopharmaceutical products has grown 47 per cent annually, while domestic sales have risen only 4-5 per cent during 2006-07.                     
	Indian vaccine sales account for about 43 per cent of the countrys total biopharma sales compared with 16 per cent for diagnostics and 13 per cent for therapeutics. According to a recent KPMG report, Indian pharma industry has grown 1.5-1.6 per cent in the past couple of years.                           
	 Outsourcing opportunities estimated to reach $31 billion by 2010 from the present $ 20 billion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt raises ethanol price to Rs 27 a litre
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Govt raises ethanol price to Rs 27 a litre
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          HOWL OVER HIKE                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: The government today hiked the price of ethanol for blending with petrol to Rs 27 a litre from Rs 21.50, which has peeved not only the oil firms but also the liquor makers and chemical producers.         
	Potable alcohol makers and the chemical producers  the main users of ethanol  fear a shortage from the diversion of the product for blending.         
	The cost of producing ethanol ranges between Rs 6 and Rs 19 over a normal four-year supply cycle. Even at (the current price of) Rs 21.50 a litre, alcohol suppliers make a reasonable profit of at least 13 per cent even at the highest input prices. The price of Rs 27 a litre is, therefore, unrealistic and will only lead to windfall profits for the sugar industry, the Indian Chemical Council and the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverages Companies said.        
	According to a release of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA), the government plans to initially implement the programme with the interim price of Rs 27 a litre. Thereafter, the pricing will be based on the recommendations of an expert committee.         
	The oil industry, too, is not happy with the move. Sources in the industry said the interim price was far higher than the current price (shorn off taxes) of petroleum at Rs 20 per litre and imported price of about Rs 21.50.         
	The move will only benefit the sugar industry. This will result in an additional outgo of nearly Rs 600 crore to procure around 80 crore litres of ethanol for mixing it with petrol under the governments 5 per cent ethanol blending programme. Moreover, with the deregulation of petrol prices, it is unjustified for the government to fix the price of ethanol, the sources added.        
	Mining panel        
	The CCEA today also cleared the proposal of setting up a commission to check illegal mining in mineral-rich central and south Indian states. The commission will probe the extent of illegal mining and suggest penalties.         
	We will take stringent actions on illegal mining. The National Mining Regulatory Authority is coming up with powers to detect, investigate and prosecute such cases, mines minister B.K. Handique said in Parliament today.

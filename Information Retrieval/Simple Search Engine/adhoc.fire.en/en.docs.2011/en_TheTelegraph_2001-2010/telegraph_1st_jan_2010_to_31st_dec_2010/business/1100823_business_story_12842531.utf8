	New Delhi, Aug. 22 (PTI): The oil ministry has asked the finance ministry to let the courts decide if the seven-year tax holiday should apply only to oil and not gas produced from the same well.        
	Oil secretary S. Sundareshan had asked revenue secretary Sunil Mitra to allow profit-linked incentives to continue for existing contracts signed under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp) since 1999 in the proposed direct tax code.        
	The government had promised tax exemption on profit made from production of crude oil and natural gas for seven years from areas awarded under Nelp. In 2008, the then finance minister P. Chidambaram amended the act to apply only for oil.        
	Some firms such as Niko Resources of Canada and Cairn India have challenged the amendment in courts.        
	For contracts already awarded, it may be left to the judiciary to decide whether there exists a notional bifurcation of mineral oil from natural gas, Sundareshan wrote to Mitra on August 9.        
	On June 30, Mitra had written to him saying the tax breaks couldnt be extended for the ninth Nelp round.        
	As the government has agreed to provide the seven-year tax holiday, it may not be appropriate to deprive the benefit for companies under contracts which already exist, Sundareshan wrote.

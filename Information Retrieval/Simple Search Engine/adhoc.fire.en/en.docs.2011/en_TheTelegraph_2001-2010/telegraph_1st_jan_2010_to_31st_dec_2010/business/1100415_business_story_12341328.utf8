	Calcutta, April 14: Indian investors are the most optimistic among 12 Asian countries, excluding Japan, a survey conducted by the Nielsen Company on behalf of Dutch financial conglomerate ING said.        
	The ING Investor Dashboard is a quarterly survey that tracks the sentiments of affluent investors having disposable assets or investments worth $100,000 and more.        
	India alone stands among the 12 Asia-Pacific countries (excluding Japan) in the very optimistic zone with the sentiment index increasing to 174 at the end of the first three months of the current calendar year, up from 169 at the end of the last quarter in 2009.        
	The sentiment of Indian investors improved while the Pan-Asia index dipped marginally to 145 in the first quarter of 2010 from 147 in the last quarter of 2009.         
	The survey noted that optimism about economic growth, strong domestic demand and confidence in local stock markets helped the investors sentiment index for India to move up.        
	The survey interviewed 3,729 investors across 12 countries.         
	Around 91 per cent of investors in India expected the economic situation to improve over the next quarter and 60 per cent of Indian investors surveyed indicated they would increase their investments in local stocks and mutual funds in the next quarter.        
	In the first quarter of 2010, 69 per cent of Indian investors  the highest percentage in Asia  see high risk investments possible. The percentage of investors preferring high risk investment was 56 per cent in the last quarter of 2009, the survey said.        
	A majority of Indian investors surveyed (83 per cent, up from 78 per cent a quarter ago) said they were bullish on equity and realty prices in the next quarter.         
	However, 71 per cent said they would adopt a balanced investment strategy because inflation and interest rate rise were perceived as continued risks in the next couple of quarters.

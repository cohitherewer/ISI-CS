	Calcutta, July 23: Power generator CESC Ltd plans to add 2,000mw fresh capacity in Bengal.        
	Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of CESC, said the company was ready to look at new locations in the state apart from Haldia and Balagarh, where new plants are coming up.        
	We have to build ahead of time. If we start planning now, it will get executed over the next five years. The way demand is growing, we must be prepared, he told reporters after the annual general meeting of the company.        
	He said the financial closure for the first phase of the 600mw unit at Haldia, involving an investment of Rs 3,000 crore, was completed yesterday. The plant will come up in 36 months.        
	The Balagarh project, revived after almost a decade in April, will kick off with a capacity of 660 mega watt. However, it is yet to get coal linkage and environment clearance.         
	Apart from Haldia and Balagarh, we are willing to look at a third location in Bengal, he said.         
	He also announced the companys foray into the renewable energy sector. CESC has acquired 200 acres near Bikaner in Rajasthan where a 200mw solar plant will come up. He said the plan was to produce 1,000 mega watt from solar energy.        
	CESCs retail subsidiary Spencers had started making profits at the store level from June.        
	It has reported a net profit of Rs 110 crore in the first quarter of 2010-11, a rise of 4.76 per cent over the corresponding period last year. Net sales were up 33 per cent to Rs 1,082 crore during the quarter compared with Rs 809 crore sales registered in the corresponding quarter of 2009-10.

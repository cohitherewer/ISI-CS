The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Foreign allies quit ONGC gas block
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Foreign allies quit ONGC gas block
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 2: Norways Statoil and Brazils Petrobras have quit an ONGC gas block in the Krishna-Godavari basin over government delays in giving them approvals to pick up stakes in the block, sparking a war of words between ONGC and the oil ministry about the foreign firms motives.        
	ONGC has blamed the government for dithering on the issue of tax holiday and inordinate delay in granting permissions.        
	However, a senior oil ministry official said international firms had used red tape and uncertainty in policy matters as a pretext to relinquish participating interest. Such decisions are made purely on economic considerations and these firms have quit the KG basin blocks as they have found greener pastures elsewhere, the official added.         
	Statoil and Petrobras had signed preliminary agreements with ONGC for 10 per cent and 15 per cent stakes, respectively, in gas block KG-DWN-98/2, but a joint operating agreement could not be signed because of delays in various approvals. The block sits next to Reliance Industries prolific KG-D6 fields.        
	In a letter to petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan, ONGC chairman R. S. Sharma stated that red tape and policy uncertainties in tax holidays were making international oil majors apprehensive over sharing exploration risks in acreages where they picked up a stake.        
	Although the farm-out agreements with Petrobras and Statoil were signed in August-September 2007, joint operating agreement could not be signed with both these companies, initially, due to the time (nine months) taken in obtaining approval on assignment of participating interest, and then another year in signing amendment to the production sharing contract with the various parties, including the government, he said.        
	Sharma also cited delays in other blocks. In case of deep water block CY-DWN-20011 in the Cauvery basin, amendment to the production sharing contract signed by ONGC, Oil India and Petrobras was submitted for signing by the government in January 2009. The same is yet to be signed by the government.         
	International oil companies have been expressing anxieties and apprehensions for such delays. Since the majors participate in bidding all over the world, they are quite critical about such delays over procedural matters. The withdrawal by the majors without participating in any activity in the block is bound to send ripples in the industry and jeopardise the initial gains of India in the Nelp (new exploration and licensing policy) era as an exploration destination, the letter stated.        
	ONGC will now have to go it alone and shoulder added risks in developing the acreage KG-DWN-98/2, which is estimated to have in-place gas reserves of 14 trillion cubic feet. Cairn holds 10 per cent equity in the block.         
	KG-DWN-98/2 has 10 discoveries, which cannot be developed without drilling the appraisal wells.         
	Sources said ONGC did not have the production technology to produce gas from the Krishna Godavari deep waters.        
	Statoil and Petrobras were invited by ONGC as part of its strategy to capitalise on the technological experience of international companies of repute in the development of deepwater discoveries, the letter stated.

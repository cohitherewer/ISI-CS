	Calcutta, May 26: City-based Rossell Tea expects its non-tea business to contribute over 50 per cent to its total revenue in the next two years from a little over 15 per cent now.         
	During 2009-10, Rossell Tea reported a consolidated turnover of Rs 79.94 crore compared with Rs 59.56 crore in 2008-09. Net profit stood at Rs 18.87 crore against Rs 6.37 crore in the previous fiscal.         
	Tea is our core business and we will always continue with that. But other segments need to grow as well, Rossell Tea executive chairman Harsh M. Gupta said.         
	The company expects its aviation business to grow faster in the coming years.         
	Our average realisation from tea in 2009-10 was Rs 159.68 per kg, up Rs 31.22 per kg from Rs 128.46 per kg a year ago, Gupta said. The company has five gardens in Assam.         
	On a standalone basis, the company suffered a loss of Rs 5.94 crore for the quarter-ended March 31 compared with Rs 10.46 crore a year ago.

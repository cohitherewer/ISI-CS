The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ONGC looks to seal Kazakh block deal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ONGC looks to seal Kazakh block deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Foreign dreams                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: ONGC Ltd is likely to get a 25 per cent stake in Kazakhstans Satpayev block that is potentially rich in oil.        
	According to officials, the deal is likely to be finalised at a meeting next week, which will be attended by oil minister Murli Deora and Kazakhstans minister of oil and gas.        
	We are expecting to sign the deal during the Kazakh oil ministers visit here, though some tax issues still remain. I am hopeful that we will reach an agreement and sign the deal soon, a senior oil ministry official said.        
	Kazakhstan had offered up to 50 per cent stake in the Satpayev oil block in the Caspian Sea to ONGC Mittal Energy (OMEL), a joint venture between ONGC and ArcelorMittal.        
	However, on the eve of the signing of the agreement for the block in November 2009, Mittal decided to pull out. ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) had recently written to the Kazakhstan government that the 25 per cent stake in Satpayev would be acquired by it and not by OMEL.        
	Sources said the Kazakh government had responded positively to the state-owned firms interest.        
	Kazakh national oil firm KazMunaiGas will be the operator of the field and hold the remaining 75 per cent. An exploration and production contract will be signed soon for Satpayev, which covers an area of 1,582 sq km.         
	OVL will pay $26 million as signing amount to the Kazakhstan government. Besides, it will pay $80 million as one-time assignment fees.         
	In addition, the Indian PSU has committed a minimum exploration investment of $165 million and an additional optional exploration expenditure of $235 million.        
	Satpayev is situated in the highly prospective region of the North Caspian Sea. A peak output of 287,000 barrels of oil per day is envisaged from the 256 million tonnes of reserves in the field.        
	Kazakhstan is seeking up to $100 billion in investment in its oil and gas exploration and production sector over the next decade as the nation wants to more than double crude exports.        
	The government has asked Oil India Ltd and ONGC to make at least one acquisition each this financial year. ONGC has in the past lost out on several overseas oil and gas asset acquisitions, especially to cash-rich Chinese companies in Africa.

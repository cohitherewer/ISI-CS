                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Not a senior yet
                                My date of birth is October 23, 1949. Shall I get the tax benefit for senior citizens in assessment year 2010-11?          S. Sensharma, Calcutta
                    According to the income tax act, you must be 65 years of age before April 1, 2010, to be eligible for tax benefits for senior citizens. You shall be 65-years-old in 2014. Thus, you cannot claim tax benefits for senior citizens in assessment year 2010-11.                                  Stay invested      I have invested in a large-cap diversified equity mutual fund. Equity MFs are expected to give good returns over a long period of time. What does this mean? Is the fund expected to give more returns after 10 years than after 5 years?        P.K. Das, Calcutta
                    it is said that equity mutual funds are expected to give good returns over a long period of time, it means that you should stay invested for a longer time to get a return which is much higher than in other asset class. For example, most diversified equity mutual funds gave an annual compounded return of 17-30 per cent over the last 10 years. It means had you invested Rs 100 in a diversified fund that gave a 25 per cent return, your investment would now have become Rs 931.32. Similarly, your investment of Rs 100 in a fund giving an annual return of 25 per cent in the last five years would have become Rs 305.18. The longer you stay invested, the higher is the return.                                    Rent allowance      I am a central government employee. My wife is a school teacher. We have to maintain two separate establishments and pay house rents separately. Should my wife sacrifice her HRA so that our total HRA drawn is Rs 6,000 per month?        S. Dutta, Calcutta
                    It is not clear what do you mean by sacrificing HRA and total HRA drawn. Since you are a working couple, I assume both of you must be paying income tax separately. In that case, each of you can claim deduction on HRA by submitting the receipts of the house rent actually paid.

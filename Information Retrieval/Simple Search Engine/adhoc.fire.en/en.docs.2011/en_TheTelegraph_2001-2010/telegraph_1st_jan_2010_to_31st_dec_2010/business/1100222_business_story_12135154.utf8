The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Firms fret over stimulus exit
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Firms fret over stimulus exit
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                Wobbly Confidence        
	New Delhi, Feb. 21: The fear of stimulus rollback has affected the confidence of industry, according to a survey by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).        
	Industry fears that any change in the overall policy parameters will impinge on demand and result in a dip in consumption and investment levels, says the third quarter business confidence survey.         
	Sixty three per cent of the participating firms said current demand was very strong and opposed the immediate scrapping of measures such as excise duty cuts announced last year to support economic activity. The survey drew response from 372 companies, with a turnover ranging from Rs 1 crore to Rs 1,25,000 crore.        
	The survey covered companies from sectors such as textiles, steel, chemicals and fertilisers, oil and gas, auto and auto components, food processing, electrical equipment and machinery, rubber and rubber products, cement, FMCG, jute, pharmaceuticals, paper, metal and metal products, logistics, financial services and consulting.        
	Another survey by industry body Assocham said the stimulus package offered last year significantly turned around the job market in India by fuelling a growth of 19 per cent in employment generation during the OctoberJanuary period.        
	The Ficci survey said with speculation rife on the withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus, the companies were apprehensive about the near-term performance at the firm, industry and economy level.        
	The expectations index, which took a value of 73.1 in the last survey, has come down to 70 in the present survey.         
	The overall business confidence index has moderated slightly from 72.4 in the last survey to 70 in the current survey.         
	Rise in raw material costs and manpower costs have emerged as key constraints with 77 per cent and 66 per cent of the surveyed firms complaining about the same. In the last survey, 52 per cent and 42 per cent of the companies had responded likewise.         
	Despite pressure on the margins, companies are refraining from a price hike with 62 per cent reporting they will maintain the price line in the next six months.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata Motors to raise $1bn to cut debt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Money matters                                  
	Mumbai, June 28: Tata Motors, the countrys largest automobile company, has decided to raise Rs 4,700 crore (roughly $1 billion) to pare debt of Rs 18,800 crore on its balance sheet and fund its growth plans.        
	At a board meeting held today, it decided to seek shareholders approval to raise these funds through a mix of ordinary shares, A ordinary shares, convertible bonds, debentures or warrants.         
	The company may tap the domestic or global markets in one or more tranches for this fund raising exercise, said a communication by the company.        
	Besides the issue of equity-linked instruments, Tata Motors will approach shareholders to raise the limit for borrowing and for creation of security on the companys properties from Rs 20,000 crore to Rs 30,000 crore.         
	Last week, the company said in a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange that it was considering various options to raise long-term funds.         
	After a difficult two years, Tata Motors made a turnaround in the year ended March 31, 2010, by posting a profit of Rs 2,571 crore as sales improved and the company raised funds from divesting a 20 per cent stake in Telco Construction Equipment Company in March.        
	Even Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the British marquee brands that the company bought in 2008, fared well during the year and posted a pre-tax profit of 32 million.        
	Last year, the company raised $750 million through sale of GDRS and convertible notes to repay debt that it had taken to finance the acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover.        
	Tata Motors had got a $3-billion bridge loan to finance the acquisition and meet its working capital needs.         
	Early this year, JLR had also secured a 340-million loan from the European Investment Bank for Research and Development.         
	The company is looking to develop new car models and expand production of the Rs 1-lakh Nano even as it harbours several global ambitions.

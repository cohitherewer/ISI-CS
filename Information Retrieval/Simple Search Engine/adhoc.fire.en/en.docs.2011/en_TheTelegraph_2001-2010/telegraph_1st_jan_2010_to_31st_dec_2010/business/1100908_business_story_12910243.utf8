                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Move to sort out visa row
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharma: Seeking solution                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: India hopes to settle the disagreements with US over visa fees during commerce minister Anand Sharmas visit to Washington later this month.        
	Officials said Americas decision to hike the visa fees for IT professionals was high on the agenda of Sharma and commerce secretary Rahul Khullar.         
	Outsourcing firms such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Technologies, Wipro and Mahindra Satyam fear their costs will go up by about $200 million annually.         
	Indian IT firms account for about 12 per cent of the visas issued by the US.        
	Sources said officials of both the countries are working hard to reach a reasonable and amicable solution as they do not want the issue to cloud the visit of US President Barack Obama in November.        
	Several Americans, including deputy US trade representative Michael Punke and Florida senator George Lemieux, have discussed the issue with senior Indian officials.        
	Officials said Sharmas argument would likely be grounded in economics. The commerce minister  who will be in the US in the third week of this month  would point out that the hike was a protectionist measure and would delay the global recovery process.

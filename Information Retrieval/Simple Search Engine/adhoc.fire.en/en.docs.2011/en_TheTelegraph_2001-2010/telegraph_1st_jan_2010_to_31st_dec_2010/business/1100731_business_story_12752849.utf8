	Mumbai, July 30: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today imposed a penalty of Rs 5 lakh on ICICI Bank for violating guidelines on know-your-customer (KYC) norms and a similar sum on Standard Chartered Bank for not furnishing information on a foreign currency loan facility.        
	The RBI has imposed a penalty of Rs 5 lakh on ICICI Bank ... for violation of the guidelines on KYC/anti money laundering standards, the central bank said in a statement.        
	An ICICI Bank spokesperson said the violation related to a single customer account. The violations referred to by the RBI were in respect of a single customer account, for opening of which the bank has obtained a government issued identity card (driving licence) and an introduction from an existing customer, the spokesperson said.        
	The RBI concluded that the substitution of introduction (by an existing customer) for address proof was not in accordance with the RBI guidelines, the spokesperson added.        
	On Standard Chartered, the RBI said the lender did not furnish, within the stipulated time, information to the central bank about a foreign currency loan facility it arranged for an offshore special purpose vehicle.        
	When contacted, StanChart said, We have received the RBIs notification. StanChart follows the highest standard of compliance in all its markets and will continue to do so.        
	Earlier, RBI had issued show cause notices to both the banks in response to which they had submitted written replies. The RBI said on examination of the banks replies and the oral submissions made by them, it was found that the violations were conclusively established and the penalties accordingly imposed.

        The direct tax code paves way for return of annuities, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Looking for an assured income after retirement? Invest Rs 14,00,000 and earn a tax-free, guaranteed income of Rs 1,20,000 every year post-retirement. After your death, your spouse continues to get the same income. Any takers?        
	This is not a new investment plan, though. Immediate annuities are around for quite a while now and are being sold by life insurance companies.         
	But immediate annuities never caught the investors fancy in the absence of any tax benefit.        
	When you buy an immediate annuity, you pay the life insurance company a lumpsum amount upfront and the insurer gives a guarantee of paying you a fixed amount at regular intervals (depending on the payment option you choose) as long as you live.        
	There are many payment options available, such as return of capital after the death of the annuitant, payment of annuity to the spouse after the death of the annuitant and so on, besides the annuity for life without any return of capital.        
	Before 2000-01, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was the sole insurer selling both deferred and immediate annuity plans. But immediate annuity became popular only between 1987 and 1992.         
	In a study of the annuity market in India, former World Bank economist Estelle James and Renuka Sane of The OASIS Foundation noted that between 1987 and 1992, tax relief was provided for Jeevan Dhara and Jeevan Akshay (the deferred and immediate annuity plans, respectively, of LIC) and growth in demand was phenomenal.        
	When the tax relief was withdrawn in 1992, the individual pension business stopped growing and many Jeevan Dhara policies were surrendered. In 2000-01, LIC sold a total of 3.44 lakh annuity products, of which immediate annuities were a mere 37,000, the study noted.        
	It also explained that the deferred annuity plans, basically accumulation instruments, were much more popular than immediate annuity because of tax benefits available in them.        
	Code fillip        
	The revised draft of the new direct tax code proposes to bring back tax exemption on annuity income. This means that from April 2011, annuity income will be tax-exempt. This will pave way for the return of of immediate annuities.        
	Lets see how immediate annuities can help you get a higher income post-retirement compared with other fixed income avenues.         
	Fixed income avenues other than immediate annuities offering a regular, guaranteed income available to a retiree now are bank fixed deposits, post office monthly savings scheme and Senior Citizen Savings Scheme.         
	The interest rate of these instruments varies between 7.5 per cent and 9 per cent and is taxable.        
	None of these instruments are going to get a preferential tax treatment when the new regime kicks in from April 2011.        
	LICs Jeevan Akshay-VI, an immediate annuity plan, offers an annual payout at the rate of 7.11 per cent to a 60-year-old person with the option of return of capital after the demise of the annuitant. This is going to be tax-free from next year. Moreover, if the initial investment is Rs 5 lakh or more, the rate will be 7.51 per cent and you will get this return unchanged till you survive.         
	If you buy an immediate annuity plan now, you will get the first payout next year (in case of the annual payout option).         
	Thus, if you invest Rs 10 lakh, your annual payout will be Rs 75,100. If you survive till the age of 80, your total receipt will be Rs 15,02,000 (= Rs 75,100 x 20) as the annuity payout plus return of the initial investment of Rs 10,00,000.         
	To understand whether it is your moneys worth, let us compare the present value of the future payouts with your initial investment. The present value of future annuity payouts discounted by the current interest rate on one-year bank fixed deposits (assumed at 7.5 per cent) works out at Rs 7,65,606.30.         
	The present value of your initial investment that your family will receive after your death is Rs 2,35,413.15. So the discounted value (at the current rate of interest) of all your future receipts is Rs 10,01,019.45, which is 100.12 per cent of what you are investing now.         
	In other words, you are getting back more than your moneys worth in real terms.         
	The minimum age of the investor should be 40 years to buy an immediate annuity plan. Let us now see how can such an investor use this instrument to his/her advantage.        
	Maximum gain        
	The Jeevan Akshay-VI plan offers an annual payout of Rs 73,300 to a 40-year-old investor investing Rs 10 lakh. The rate is for the option of return of capital on death of the annuitant.        
	So, if you buy the annuity plan for Rs 10 lakh now, you will be getting Rs 73,300 every year till the time you survive. Invest the annuity payouts systematically every month in an equity mutual fund. Assuming a conservative annual return of 10 per cent, your mutual fund investment will amount to Rs 41,98,257.46 by the time you attain the retirement age of 60. This money you can use for any purpose that you may like.        
	In addition, the annuity investment will ensure an annual payout of Rs 73,300 post-retirement till the time you live.        
	The initial investment of Rs 10 lakh will act as the life insurance cover that your nominee will get back after your demise.        
	However, you should have one thing in mind before signing the dotted lines of an immediate annuity contract. The annuity rates depend on the market rate of interest among others. Hence, the rate differs from insurer to insurer for a particular age and payout option. A wise thing will be to cross check the rates being offered by different insurers and then settle with one that gives the highest rate.        
	Immediate annuity plans dont require any medical check-ups. So, go an get one for you. Particularly, now that it is tax-free.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Devil in disguise
        Verify the eligibility of a company before putting in your hard-earned money, cautions Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Debi Prasad Basu, now 70 years old, was one of those lucky investors who could retrieve their deposits from Sanchaita Investments, a ponzi scheme that lured hordes of people with high interest rates during the early 1980s but soon went bust. Since then Basu always kept his money in bank deposits.         
	Basu is no exception. Many educated people get cheated when they fall prey to high interest/return offers on deposits by unscrupulous entities, said a Reserve Bank of India official.         
	The greed to make more money often blinds people to see whether the entity raising the public deposits is legally eligible to do so? The investors dont make an attempt to know whether their deposits are safe with the entity or how the entity promises to give such high returns when commercial banks cant. Are their deposits insured so that they can get back at least part of their deposits when the entity goes bust or simply, ceases to exist? What recourses do they have to claim their money back?        
	Once you know these, chances of being cheated are less. You shall be able to distinguish a fraud company from a genuine one.        
	Legally yours        
	Before you decide to park your hard-earned money with any entity, the first thing that you need to know is: Who can accept public deposits under the laws of the land?        
	Only a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956 can accept public deposits. No other entities, such as partnership firms, societies or organisations can legally accept public deposits.        
	This is the first step of your screening. Dont deposit your money in an entity that is not set up under the Companies Act and registered with the Registrar of Companies as a corporate body.         
	The Companies Act sets down the rules and regulations for the establishment of both public and private companies in India. A private company should have Private Ltd in its name, while a public firm should be qualified as a Limited entity.        
	However, a company incorporated under the Companies Act can be a non-banking finance company or a non-banking non-finance company. If it is a non-banking finance company (NBFC), it has to be registered with the Reserve Bank of India also. A non-banking finance company is a firm that has more than 50 per cent of its assets comprising financial assets and earns at least 50 per cent of its income from financial assets.         
	Now, whether an NBFC can raise public deposits or not will depend on whether it has got the RBIs permission to do so. NBFCs planning to raise public deposits need special approval from the RBI. Thus, all NBFCs cannot raise public deposits.         
	NBFCs raising public deposits need to compulsorily display the RBI certificate at their corporate and branch offices. Besides, NBFCs cannot raise public deposits with a maturity of less than a year. Neither can they raise deposits maturing beyond five years.         
	Web watch        
	Also, NBFCs taking public deposits cannot give an interest rate of more than 11 per cent per annum. The RBI publishes the names of NBFCs taking public deposits on its website (www.rbi.org.in). So, before depositing your money with any such company, cross-check its legal eligibility on the RBI website.        
	In Bengal, we have more than 6,000 NBFCs registered with the RBI, but only three of them, including Peerless General Finance, can accept public deposits, said C.V. George, general manager, department of non-banking supervision, RBI. Given these facts, you can easily identify a company that is fraudulently raising public deposit.        
	It should be mentioned here that chit funds, unless they have multi-state operations, are not regulated by the RBI. Chit funds are regulated by individual states where they are located.        
	Non-banking non-finance companies, such as a manufacturing company, can also raise public deposits. But these companies are not regulated by the RBI; they are regulated by the Registrar of Companies. Any dispute on company deposits comes under the purview of the Company Law Board.        
	It should be clear by now that beyond the banking sector, dont entrust an entity with your deposits unless the entity has either Limited or Private Limited in its name.        
	Now that you know which are the entities with whom you can entrust your money, you must know one more thing and that is about the guarantee of getting back the deposit.        
	Guaranteed return        
	As of now, only bank deposits up to Rs 1 lakh per depositor is insured under the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Scheme. This means that in case a bank becomes insolvent, depositors of that bank can get back a maximum of Rs 1 lakh under the said scheme.        
	Deposits with NBFCs or non-banking non-finance companies are not guaranteed either by the company concerned or by the RBI.        
	However, to protect the interest of investors, the new Companies Bill envisages restrictions on the ability of companies to raise deposits from the public, except under special laws.         
	The JJ Irani committee had proposed that the norms for accepting public deposits by non-banking non-finance companies should be made stricter.         
	If you want the assurance of a safe return of your deposits, go to banks till the new companies law becomes effective. The Reserve Bank has also barred residuary non-banking finance companies such as Sahara to accept public deposits from 2008, while Peerless cannot accept public deposits from April 2011.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Nicolas Sarkozy in Mumbai on Tuesday. (Reuters)                          
	Mumbai, Dec. 7: Reiterating his call to India to open up some of its sectors to foreign investment, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who wound up his four-day visit to the country today, said France could serve as a good market in sectors such as petroleum, farm products and textiles for Indian companies.         
	Addressing business heads at a meeting organised by the Confederation of India Industry and Ficci here today, Sarkozy said his visit to India was not about finding new clients or acting as vendors to Indian buyers, but to forge a true partnership.         
	Perhaps we believe in your future more than you do. Perhaps when we see India from the outside, we are more impressed than when you look at it from inside. India can count unreservedly on Frances support. We want to support you and develop your country, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Oil slick                                  
	New Delhi, May 22: A $15 decline in global crude oil prices pulled down ONGC Videshs profit by 25 per cent to Rs 2,090 crore in 2009-10 even as production increased.         
	The decline was mainly because of a fall in international oil prices in the later half of the financial year, OVL said in a statement.        
	Revenue dipped 16 per cent to Rs 15,181 crore from Rs 18,144 crore in the previous year. The average crude oil price during 2009-10 was $69.58 per barrel, against $84.45 per barrel in 2008-09.        
	The company produced 130,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 41,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent gas during the year from nine fields in Sudan, Russia, Vietnam, Syria, Brazil and Colombia.        
	Oil and gas production rose 1.2 per cent to 8.87 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2009-10 compared with 8.77 million tonnes in the previous year.        
	Project BC-10 in Brazil is OVLs latest oil asset, from which production commenced during 2009-10.        
	OVL has stakes in 40 oil and gas projects, spread across 16 countries. Of these nine are operational. Oil and gas production will increase once oil and gas starts flowing from other projects, it said.        
	The company has a presence in Sudan, Nigeria, Russia, Vietnam, Libya, Iran, Cuba, Brazil, Syria, Myanmar, Iraq, Egypt, Columbia, Syria and Venezuela. At the close of 2009-10, the proven reserves of OVL stood at 185.99 million tonnes of oil and gas.

	Bharat Forges fourth-quarter profit rose to Rs 61.26 crore from Rs 61.13 crore in the corresponding previous period.

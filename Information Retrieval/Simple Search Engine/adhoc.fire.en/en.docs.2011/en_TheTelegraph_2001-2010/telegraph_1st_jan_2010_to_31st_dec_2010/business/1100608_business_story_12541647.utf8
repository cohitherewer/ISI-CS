The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex, rupee take a beating
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sensex, rupee take a beating
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           WEAK SHOW                                  
	Mumbai, June 7: The forex and stock markets slipped today because of weak US jobs data and worries over more economies facing a Greece-like crisis.         
	The rupee dipped below the 47-level to close at 47.09 against the dollar, and the benchmark sensex crashed nearly 337 points to end at 16781.07.         
	At the forex markets, the Indian currency fell to a low of 47.47 on disappointing global news. While the euro hurtled to a four-year low, concerns about Hungarys debt raised fears of more countries continuing to face public finance problems. Stocks also got battered by the developments in the US and the deepening crisis in Europe. Last Friday, the US labour department had reported that around 431,000 jobs were created in May, which fell short of analysts expectations.         
	The rupee, however, staged a recovery from its lows as the euro stabilised and exporters sold dollars. It finished at 47.09, lower by nearly 25 paise over its previous close of 46.86.         
	According to Urvi Sheth, senior analyst at Mecklai Financial Services, the fall in the rupee was expected because of concerns regarding public finances in Hungary that led to global equity markets taking a knock and the euro coming under intense pressure. Sheth said there was a worry that more countries could face a similar crisis. The rupee is likely to remain under pressure but a normal monsoon can bring some respite.         
	The sensex today fell 336.62 points, or 1.97 per cent. It opened lower at 17069.77 and dropped to a low of 16686.73, down nearly 431 points. Market circles said the governments decision to make 25 per cent public holding in listed firms mandatory contributed to the fall.         
	Stocks on Wall Street swung between gains and losses on Monday. In late-morning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was about 26.30 points higher, and the broader Standard amp; Poors 500-stock index was flat. The Nasdaq composite index was down 0.33 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Push for Doha talks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Push for Doha talks
                            
	Seoul, Nov. 12 (PTI): The G20 leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, today threw their weight behind the Doha talks for a global trade deal by asking negotiators to intensify efforts to reach the multilateral pact by 2011.        
	Our strong commitment is to direct our negotiators to engage in across-the-board negotiations to promptly bring the Doha development round to a successful, ambitious, comprehensive and balanced conclusion, the G20 leaders said.         
	We recognise that 2011 is a critical window of opportunity, albeit narrow, and that engagement among our representatives must intensify and expand, they said. The Doha round of talks under the aegis of the World Trade Organisation had started in the Qatari capital in 2001 to achieve a global trade deal.

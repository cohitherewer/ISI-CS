          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 9: Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar today laid out a strong case for scrapping government controls on sugar, igniting a sharp rally in sugar stocks.        
	I honestly feel this is the time where the government and industry associations should sit together and take some major policy decisions.... this is the only industry in the country which has far too many government controls, Pawar told an industry conference in Delhi. We have to withdraw the government controls on the sugar industry and give full freedom to those who are managing the industry, Pawar added.        
	Sugar stocks  which provided one of the best returns to investors in 2009  flared up almost 12 per cent on Pawars announcement since it raised the prospect of freeing the industry from shackles that were first imposed in 1965.        
	Oudh Sugar Mills gained 10.38 per cent to close a frenetic day of trading at Rs 40.40. Dwarikesh Sugar Industries rose nearly 12 per cent to Rs 75.60, while Simbhaoli Sugars Ltd nudged up 5.17 per cent at Rs 42.70. Others such as Bajaj Hindusthan gained 4.84 per cent to Rs 121.25, Balrampur Chini by 3.87 per cent to Rs 87.15 and Shree Renuka Sugars by 3.12 per cent to Rs 71.15.        
	At present, sugar mills have to supply 20 per cent of their production to the public distribution system at a price that the government fixes. This is known as levy sugar; the government also sets free sale quotas for the industry. There is a zoning restriction also which ensure that mills cannot be located within 15 km of each other.        
	Later, Pawar said a decision on removing the controls on the sugar industry  an issue that has been debated several times over the years since price controls were first relaxed in 1979  could be taken in October when the new sugar year begins. The decision will depend on production.         
	Industry is expecting a bumper production next year, and this is likely to put a lid on prices. Retail sugar prices surged to almost Rs 50 a kg in January following shortages arising from poor sugar cane output last year. Prices have cooled since then and are hovering around Rs 32 per kg.                                      
	Last month, the Centre lifted all price controls on petrol and promised to do the same in diesel. The sugar industry has been lobbying hard for a similar freedom from price controls. The government fixes the minimum price that the mills must pay sugarcane farmers and also dictates the levy sugar price.        
	A senior industry official welcomed Pawars comment but wondered how the government would bring about the change. It is likely to be carried out in phases. However, it should be full decontrol right across the chain, he added.        
	He said decontrol would not only improve the cash flows of the sugar industry but also ensure remunerative payment to the farmers.

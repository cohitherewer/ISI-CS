                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Nominee details
                                I invested in Senior Citizen Savings Scheme with my daughter as nominee. The passbook mentions my daughters name, but no nomination registration number is given in the requisite column. The post office says the insertion of my daughters name is sufficient. Is it right?          Benoy Guha, Mahestala
                    The rules of Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, 2004 as published in the Gazette of India says, Every nomination and every cancellation or variation shall be registered in the deposit office and shall be valid from the date of such registration, the particulars of which shall be entered in the passbook. So, dont go by the assurances of the post office. Tell them about the rules and get your nomination registration mentioned in the passbook.                                   Tax token      I am 60 years old and have a gross income of Rs 3,38,285 under Chapter VI A of the Income Tax Act. What will be my tax liability for the assessment year 2010-11.        Beeneet K. Nair, Parnasree Palli
                    Your tax liability for 2010-11 will be Rs 22306.71.                                    Return rule      Is it mandatory to file income tax return for a PAN card holder even if the holders annual income is not taxable?        P.C. Daschaudhuri, Calcutta
                    No. Filing of return is mandatory for those who want a tax refund or who have annual income (before any deduction) higher than the threshold limit prescribed for I-T purposes.                                   Play safe       I am a retired person. I wish to invest in a mutual fund for regular return. Which one would be better  a monthly income plan or a diversified equity plan with dividend option?        P.K. Saha, Khidderpore
                    You are too old for an equity fund. A better option will be the monthly income plan. However, the income is not guaranteed under the monthly income plan of mutual funds. You can also explore the immediate annuity plans being sold by life insurance companies. Besides, Senior Citizen Savings Scheme also offers a good 9 per cent interest.

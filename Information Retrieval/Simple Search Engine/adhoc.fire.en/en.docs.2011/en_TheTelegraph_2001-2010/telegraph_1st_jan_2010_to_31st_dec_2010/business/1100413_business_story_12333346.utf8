          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cash chase                                  
	Mumbai, April 12: Essar Steel Holdings Ltd (ESHL) plans to raise at least $500 million through a bond issue denominated in dollars.        
	The Ruia-group company incorporated in Mauritius is the parent of Essar Steel. A statement by the company said, ESHL announced today that it is proposing a benchmark offering of dollar denominated senior unsecured notes due 2017.        
	Sources said the benchmark offering seven-year global bond was not callable for four years and the companys management would shortly meet with investors in Asia, London and the US.        
	The company statement clarified that funds raised from the bond issue would be used to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and potential acquisitions. It is likely that the offering can be upwards of $750 million. However, no confirmation was available on this number from the company.        
	Sources said Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered Plc were among the banks that had been given the mandate for this sale.        
	The Essar group is also in the midst of raising funds for its other businesses as it expands capacities and looks for global acquisitions.         
	Essar Energy had recently announced that it would divest between 20 and 25 per cent to raise $2.5 billion on the London Stock Exchange.         
	Proceeds from this issue  that will be the biggest listing on the LSE in four years  will be used to expand the groups power generation capacities and a refinery.        
	SAIL offer         
	The government may offer a special discount of five per cent to retail buyers and employees of state-owned Sail Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) on the issue price of the PSUs follow-on public offer, steel secretary Atul Chaturvedi said.        
	He was confident that SAILs share sale would elicit more response from investors than the follow-on offers of NMDC, NTPC and REC.

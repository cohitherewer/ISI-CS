          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          C.B. Bhave (right) with Nagendra Bhatnagar, MD of IDBI Capital Market Services, in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 24: Merchant bankers to public issues  in the face of intense competition amongst themselves  are not only charging abysmally low fees for their services but also pushing for higher pricing that is hurting retail investors, according to the market regulator.        
	There is intense competition, not only in terms of the fee but also what price the issuer is getting in the market. If you try to maximise the price for promoters, you are going in the direction of not leaving much on the table for investors, Securities and Exchange Board of India chairman C.B. Bhave said at a conclave of merchant bankers.         
	 Around 11 companies have floated IPOs from the week beginning September 20 to raise nearly Rs 3,500 crore.        
	Later, on the sidelines of the meet, Bhave said some issuers tended to provide insufficient information or spike the issue price when a large number of flotations were in the pipeline and the markets were in a fine fettle.         
	That is why, I was raising the question with them (investment bankers) that there should not be competition for raising the price of the issue. There should also be the consideration of investors.        
	Tough competition has prompted investment banks to charge almost zero fee from issuers, particularly from state-owned companies. Bhave asked the investment bankers whether this practise was an healthy one. They need to decide as to whether they can go on charging zero fees for doing work. What mechanism they evolve is for them to decide, he told newspersons.        
	On Sebi rejecting the application of MCX Stock Exchange Limited for trading in equities, Bhave said, Everybody has to stick to the guidelines.

	New Delhi, Feb. 11: The foreign investment promotion board will now clear proposals worth up to Rs 1,200 crore from overseas entities against the existing limit of Rs 600 crore  a move that will speed up the flow of foreign investment.        
	The decision was taken at a meeting of the cabinet committee of economic affairs (CCEA), which was chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	The recommendation of the foreign investment promotion board on proposals involving foreign equity inflow of and below Rs 1,200 crore will be considered by the finance minister for approval, said home minister P. Chidambaram.         
	Foreign investment proposals of over Rs 1,200 crore will have to be put up before the CCEA for approval. Earlier, the CCEA approved proposals of over Rs 600 crore.        
	Under the new dispensation, only the foreign investment amount will be considered while deciding whether the project will be put up before the CCEA against the earlier practice of taking into account the total project cost.        
	Chidambaram said the proposal, which was mooted by the commerce ministry and approved by the CCEA, is expected to save time and efforts for the FIPB/ CCEA and also expedite foreign investment inflow.         
	Chidambaram said foreign investors need not seek fresh approvals from the government or FIPB in sectors which had been transferred to the automatic route or where foreign direct investment caps had been removed.        
	FDI grew 13.2 per cent in December to $1.54 billion against $1.36 billion in December 2008.        
	Cabinet decisions        
	The government will table the 13th Finance Commissions report on sharing the Centres tax receipts with states in Parliament before the budget, which will be unveiled on February 26.        
	Meanwhile, India and Nepal are expected to soon sign a revised air services agreement that will lead to an open skies arrangement in the cargo sector and liberalise passenger flight operations.        
	The approval for signing the air services agreement between the two countries was given today by the Union cabinet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | High alert on crude
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      High alert on crude
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ambani: Sounding alarm                                  
	Mumbai, May 14: Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Asias richest man, predicts that the price of crude oil per barrel will touch $100 a barrel in the foreseeable future as consumption in Asia grows.         
	Addressing a conference in the city on Friday, Ambani said, By most analyst accounts, crude oil prices are well above the $70-mark. In the foreseeable future, we have to prepare to again see a three-digit oil price. Experts talk of resilient oil growth, sluggish refining growth and higher marginal costs for new discoveries and production.        
	All these factors are no doubt true but I believe that the petrochemicals industry will have to keep reinventing itself in response and prepare itself for a higher energy price than what it has been used to in the last two decades. A price of $80 to $100 is a norm in this ever-changing global dynamic, added Ambani.        
	He urged the petrochemicals industry to reset its thinking and not hanker for lower energy and feedstock prices. The solution, according to Ambani, was to find creative responses and adopt innovation as a way of life.        
	Ambanis take on oil prices came on a day when crude oil prices in Asia fell to below $74 a barrel as a slower economic recovery in Europe was expected to impact demand.        
	The RIL chairman was bullish on the prospect of Asian economies, especially China and India.        
	It is said this century belongs to Asia. I completely endorse this view. It has decisive demographic advantages over Europe and the US. New markets are being created in Asia. It has made new crude oil and gas discoveries and is at the forefront of finding sustainable renewable energy solutions, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GSPC strikes gas
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      GSPC strikes gas
                            
	Ahmedabad, Dec. 24 (PTI): Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) has discovered a huge reservoir of gas in an onland exploration block at Ankleshwar, Gujarat.        
	The discovery of a huge reservoir of gas at the Ankleshwar 41-S well could potentially open a new zone for exploration for us there, a top GSPC official today said.        
	Production testing of the Ankleshwar 41-S well in the Cambay Basin onland block CB-ONN-2003/2 indicates the potential for production of several million cubic feet of natural gas per day. A negligible quantity of oil also flowed to the surface during production testing.        
	The discovery has been brought to the notice of the directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH). GSPC declined to give a preliminary estimate of the reserves until the upstream regulator certified it as a discovery.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Private refiners get a boost
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Private refiners get a boost
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 25: The move to free fuel pricing has set the stage for the re-entry of private oil retailers such as Reliance, Essar and Shell, which will result in greater competition.        
	We expect the private refiners to start operating again following the governments decision. We expect healthy competition in the oil retailing segment, petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said.        
	Private retailers, who had once captured a 15 per cent market share in diesel retailing, had virtually closed shop in 2008 following a spike in global crude prices and the advantage state-owned firms IOC, BPCL and HPCL enjoyed in the form of government subsidy.        
	Sources said private retailers were chalking out plans to re-open their fuel stations at the earliest.        
	As the largest active private sector fuel retailer in India, we are well placed to capture additional sales for fuel and non-fuel items and expect to see significant volume growth in both areas, Naresh Nayyar, managing director and chief executive officer of Essar Oil, said.        
	Petrol prices will be revised every 15-30 days, the individual marketing companies will decide on the price and time for hikes, Ashok Sinha, chairman of Bharat Petroleum, said. We are moving towards a more competitive pricing.        
	Sundareshan said the government would give marketing freedom to state owned oil firms, which would encourage them to compete among themselves. Such healthy competition could result in fuel prices actually coming down with better efficiency, he said.        
	B.M. Bansal, chairman of Indian Oil, said the move would reduce borrowing costs and improve cash flows.        
	Planning Commission former member Kirit Parikh, who headed the panel on fuel pricing, said the decision was an excellent signal  I am delighted by the decision to decontrol petrol prices and raise diesel rates. The government has taken a tough and difficult decision.        
	The governments decision may also benefit ONGC and OIL, which partly compensate state refiners by selling crude to them at a discount.         
	Its a relief for the upstream as well as downstream industry. However, there is not much clarity on under recoveries and the subsidy sharing mechanism, ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said.        
	The government panels decision will result in reducing the revenue loss of state-owned oil firms to Rs 53,000 crore during 2010-11 from the earlier estimated Rs 83,000 crore. Oil ministry estimates marketing companies under-recoveries at over Rs 3,45,000 crore between 2003-04 and 2009-10.                                       
	Sundareshan said this (Rs 53,000 crore) under recovery will be borne by the government and upstream oil companies like ONGC, OIL. He said the formula of subsidy sharing would be worked out in due course to time.        
	Fuel subsidies given by the government to state refiners fell to Rs 26000 crore in the year 2009-10, as oil declined from a record in July 2008. The refiners received Rs 71300 crore in bonds as compensation a year earlier, according to the government.        
	Oil ministry estimates oil marketing companies under-recoveries on sale of retail fuel at government-set prices at over Rs 3,45,000 crore between 2003-04 and 2009-10.         
	A lower fuel subsidy bill may help the government reduce the fiscal deficit substantially, from the projected 5.5 percent of 2010-11 GDP        
	Finance Secretary Ashok Chawla has said that the fiscal deficit could shrink to 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2011 if fuel prices were deregulated and on the back of other revenues including the 3G spectrum auction.        
	ends              
	Sundareshan, said the government had to take this painful decision in the larger interests of the economy and the larger interests of the nation. However, he added that the government could still step in to ease the burden on consumers if global oil prices surge sharply, although he said no precise level had been identified.              
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla has said that the fiscal deficit could shrink to 4.5 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2011 if fuel prices were deregulated and 3G spectrum revenue was counted.

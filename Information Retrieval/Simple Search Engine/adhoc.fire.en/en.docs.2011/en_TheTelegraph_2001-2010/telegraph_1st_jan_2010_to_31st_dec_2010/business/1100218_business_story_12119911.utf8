The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telenor faces Calcutta delay
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Telenor faces Calcutta delay
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	Barcelona, Feb. 17: The Centres policy of scrutinising telecom equipment could delay mobile firm Telenors Calcutta launch.        
	The Norwegian firm, whose Indian partner is realty market leader Unitech, is awaiting equipment approvals from the government.        
	There is some delay in getting approval for technical equipment, which will defer our launch to the second quarter of this year, Jon Fredrik Baksaas, CEO and president of Telenor Group, told The Telegraph at the Mobile World Congress here.        
	Telecom ministry rules, amended in December, make it mandatory for operators to provide details to the government about equipment  their suppliers and original equipment manufacturers, among other information  before placing the final purchase orders.        
	Similar procedures need to be followed while placing orders for upgradation purposes.        
	Telenor  which made its India debut in December under the Uninor brand  is planning an all-India rollout by the end of this year.         
	It had planned to commence operations in Mumbai and Calcutta in this quarter.        
	Uninor has 1.2 million subscribers across eight circles  Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, east and west Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	The government should streamline the process of granting security clearances so that undue delays are prevented. Delay in the competitive telecom market could have severe revenue implications on companies as they might not only lose market share but also face penalty from regulators, said KPMGs telecom head Romal Shetty.        
	Baksaas said Telenor was focussing on brand-building and establishing a distribution channel.

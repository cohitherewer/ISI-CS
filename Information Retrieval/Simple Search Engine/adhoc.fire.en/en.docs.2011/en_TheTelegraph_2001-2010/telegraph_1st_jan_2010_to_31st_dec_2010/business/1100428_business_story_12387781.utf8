          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             Subbarao: Strict vigil      
	Calcutta, April 27: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will revisit the road map to capital account convertibility  that promises to give full freedom to invest in foreign assets (and foreigners to invest here) at market determined exchange rates  in the light of the lessons learnt from the financial crisis.         
	In his address at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington on Monday, RBI governor D. Subbarao said, Volatile capital flows have been a central issue during the crisis and continue to be so as the crisis is ebbing.        
	Emerging market economies saw a sudden stop and reversal of capital flows during the crisis. Now the trend has reversed and the question of how we can maximise the benefits and minimise the costs of volatile capital flows has returned to haunt the policy agenda.        
	Subbarao said India had followed a consistent policy on capital account convertibility in general and on capital account management in particular.         
	Our position is that capital account convertibility is not a standalone objective but a means for higher and stable growth, he added.        
	Full convertibility in capital account implies free exchange of currency and an unrestricted mobility of capital. India currently has full convertibility in current account, meaning foreign exchange is easily available for import and export of goods and services. On capital account, the country has partial convertibility  an Indian citizen can invest up to $200,000 in foreign assets in a financial year.         
	The RBI governor said, The surge in capital flows into emerging markets has seen the return of the familiar question  the advisability of imposing a Tobin-type tax on capital flows.        
	There are example of countries such as Chile, Colombia, Brazil and Malaysia that have experimented with the Tobin tax or its variantWe have not so far imposed a Tobin-type tax nor are we contemplating one. However, no policy instrument is clearly off the table and our choice of instruments will be determined by the context, he added.

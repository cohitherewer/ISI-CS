          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 28: The government expects stake sales in Indian Oil Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Coal India to help it to meet this fiscals divestment target of Rs 40,000 crore, even though it has raised a fraction of the sum in the first half.        
	Big-ticket issues will come now, divestment secretary Sumit Bose said after meeting finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to discuss budget plans for the next fiscal.        
	The government has managed to raise Rs 2,022 crore so far, around 5 per cent of the target, by divesting in Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam and Engineers India Ltd, but a buoyant stock market has sparked hopes of successful mop-ups from larger issues.        
	Moves are now afoot to sell stakes in Coal India, IOC, ONCG, Steel Authority of India Ltd and Power Grid.        
	The government needs the cash to stick to its budget deficit guidance of 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product for this fiscal, despite a one-time windfall of Rs 1.06 lakh crore from selling spectrum, which will mostly be spent on social development projects.        
	The Coal India IPO pricing will be finalised in the second week of October, Bose said.         
	The float, possibly the countrys largest primary offering, could fetch the government around Rs 16,000 crore. The share sale is scheduled to open for subscriptions on October 18 and close on October 21.        
	IOC  the countrys largest listed company by sales  plans to launch its follow-on public offering by January. It aims to sell 242.8 million fresh shares to raise about Rs 10,000 crore.        
	Simultaneously, the government, which owns 78.92 per cent in IOC, will sell 10 per cent to raise funds for infrastructure and welfare projects.        
	The Centre also plans to sell 5 per cent in ONGC in January-March. It owns 74.14 per cent in the PSU, which is valued at about Rs 3.1 lakh crore on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Divestments in ONGC and IOC will fetch around Rs 21,000 crore this fiscal, oil secretary S. Sundareshan had earlier said.

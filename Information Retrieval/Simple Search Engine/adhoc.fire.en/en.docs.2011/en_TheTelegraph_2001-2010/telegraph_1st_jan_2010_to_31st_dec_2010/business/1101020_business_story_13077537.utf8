The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Profit numbers fail to cheer Sesa scrip
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Profit numbers fail to cheer Sesa scrip
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 19: Shares of iron ore miner Sesa Goa today tumbled on the bourses as the companys second-quarter numbers failed to meet Street expectations. Apprehensions that the firms sales volume may be hit because of government policies and reduction of Chinese imports of iron ore also contributed to the fall.         
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the Sesa Goa scrip ended at Rs 358.80, down 3.60 per cent or Rs 13.40 from its previous close of Rs 372.20, despite the company posting a net profit of Rs 388 crore compared with Rs 166 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Profit rose on the back of rising prices of the raw material used in manufacturing steel. Net sales stood at Rs 918 crore against Rs 539 crore last year. However, the results were not in line with analysts estimates.         
	Sesa Goas second-quarter results were lower than our estimates. The top line was lower by 10.3 per cent on account of a 14 per cent lower-than-expected iron ore realisation at $73 per tonne. The bottom line was lower by 21.3 per cent compared with our estimates, Angel Broking said in a report.        
	Observers said it was not the profit numbers alone that dragged the stock down. While the management lowered the sales volume guidance for the fiscal to 10 per cent from 2025 per cent earlier, the brokerage said because of the export ban from Karnataka, the company witnessed a sales loss of 1 million tonnes during the quarter. Further, downward revision in sales volume can be expected in case the ban on export of iron ore from Karnataka is not revoked, it said.         
	The fall came a day after the firms shareholders passed a resolution to increase its investment limit to Rs 16,000 crore and the borrowing limit to Rs 15,000 crore.

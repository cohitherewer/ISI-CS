	Calcutta, Oct. 25: The United Bank of India (UBI) has posted a 63.7 per cent rise in operating profit at Rs 354.55 crore for the quarter ended September, helped by an improvement in corporate banking and treasury operations.         
	Profit from corporate banking nearly doubled to Rs 298.09 crore from Rs 148.20 crore during the same quarter last year, the UBI informed the bourses. We have been adjudged the second best in providing loans to medium, small and micro companies, chairman and managing director Bhaskar Sen said.         
	We have been exiting low-yielding assets and focusing on high-yielding ones. After the implementation of the base rate system, the scope of lending at low rates to highly rated firms is gone. So, we have started focusing on the MSME (medium and small enterprise) sector that helped us increase the yield on advances.         
	The bank has stopped accepting high cost deposits, bringing down the cost to 5.57 per cent from 6 per cent at the end of September 2009. The yield on advances went up to 9.90 per cent from 9.46 per cent.        
	However, operating profit from retail operations fell to Rs 71.12 crore from Rs 76.88 crore a year ago, despite a 35.7 per cent growth in advances at Rs 6,533 crore.        
	The bank had made a higher provisioning of Rs 217.81 crore for bad loans and other contingencies against Rs 79.81 crore a year ago, leading to a lower tax liability of Rs 27 crore against Rs 53 crore a year earlier. Lower taxes helped the bank to report a 30.9 per cent jump in net profit to Rs 109.74 crore (Rs 83.83 crore) in the second quarter.

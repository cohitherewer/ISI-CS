                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Insurance IPO norms on way
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 1 (PTI): The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) today said it would come out with initial public offer guidelines within a fortnight.        
	IPO guidelines would be issued in the next 15 days, IRDA member R. Kannan said. The IRDA, which has been working on the guidelines along with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, is likely to come out, initially, with a draft for public comments.        
	Several private sector insurance companies, including Reliance Life, have shown interest in tapping the capital market to augment its resource base.        
	The government had proposed to ease the norms to allow companies to list after five years of operations, instead of the current 10-year rule.        
	However, Kannan said, No decision has been taken on reducing the number of years before permitting insurance companies to go public.        
	According to the insurance act, promoters having a 26 per cent stake can offload equity after the company completes 10 years of operations. The legislation also empowers the government to reduce the mandatory waiting period.        
	The IRDA had already notified the disclosure norms, which require the companies to provide details about their operations and balance sheets on a quarterly as well as on a yearly basis.         
	The IPO guidelines will deal with minimum norms that a company must fulfill before hitting the market.        
	The three essential steps are correct valuation; disclosure of operating results and profit and loss account; and filing of the draft red herring prospectus.        
	Besides the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation, 22 private companies are selling life policies. General insurance has 21 players, including four state-owned firms.        
	Anil Ambani Groups life insurance venture Reliance Life expects to tap the capital market with an initial public offer in the first quarter of the next fiscal.         
	Reliance Capital, the holding company of Reliance Life Insurance, is waiting for the guidelines on public float and a subsequent clearance from the finance ministry, CEO Sam Ghosh had said.         
	Reliance Life could be the first life insurance company in the country to come out with an IPO once the guidelines were framed.

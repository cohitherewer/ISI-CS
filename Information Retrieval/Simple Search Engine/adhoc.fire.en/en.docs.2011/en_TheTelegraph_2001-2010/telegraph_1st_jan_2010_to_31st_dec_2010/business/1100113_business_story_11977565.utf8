                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Factories flourish in November
  - Green shoots put down roots: Industry puts up a stellar show as govt pledges fresh support        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: Industrial production has surged 11.7 per cent in November  the fastest growth since November 2007, sparking speculation that India will tighten its monetary policy just as China did today.         
	The sharp surge in the index of industrial production (IIP) was underpinned by a 37.3 per cent leap in the consumer durables segment, indicating a robust demand for refrigerators, washing machines and television sets that comes atop the strong sales in the automobile sector this year.        
	Deepali Bhargava, an economist with ING Vysya Bank, said, While the November numbers were exaggerated by comparisons with a muted reading last year, it still signalled a gradual uptrend in the economy. It is an across-the-board rise with good numbers from both manufacturing and basic industries.        
	Analysts said the government could now review its stimulus measures as well. The government may start withdrawing stimulus, especially from sectors that are recovering such as automobiles and consumer durables, D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil, said.        
	The December inflation data, due on Thursday, will be the last important indicator of the price pressures on the economy prior to the RBIs policy review on January 29.         
	Goldman Sachs predicted that the RBI could winch up benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points later this month.         
	Sonal Varma, economist with Nomura, said, Overall domestic demand is rising as are inflationary pressures. We expect the rate tightening cycle to begin with an increase in both the cash reserve ratio and key interest rates.         
	China, meanwhile, has started reining in its economy, which is on the brink of overheating. It raised today the proportion of deposits that banks must hold on reserves. The 0.5 percentage point increase in the reserve requirement ratio will take effect on January 18.

	Calcutta, July 2: Coal production in 2010-11 may fall short of domestic demand by 104 million tonnes (mt), according to coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal.         
	In 2009-10, the country produced 531mt of coal, about 70mt short of demand. It was earlier estimated that imports would rise beyond 100mt by 2012.         
	At a function of the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today, Jaiswal said, The gap between the demand for coal and its domestic availability has been projected at 104mt for 2010-11. For this fiscal, the requirement of power utilities is estimated at 440mt while its availability from Coal India Ltd (CIL) and other sources (primarily captive mines) is expected to touch 388mt.        
	The situation may worsen if the forest and environment ministry does not relax its criteria for go and no-go areas. In go areas, mining can be undertaken with prior clearance from the environment ministry unlike no-go areas where mining activity is prohibited.         
	In May, the environment ministry had identified 48 per cent of 1,00,000 hectares of coal-bearing forest area involving nine coal fields as no-go areas. They are Hasdeo-Arand in Chhattisgarh, Singrauli, Wardha, IB Valley and Talcher in Orissa, north Karanpura and west Bokaro in Jharkhand, Sohagpur and Mandraigarh coal fields.         
	The ministry is mapping other such fields having large forest cover. Out of the 219 captive coal blocks allocated in March this year, 40 cannot take off following the identification of the no-go areas.

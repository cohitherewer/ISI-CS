The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Banks in credit card slip-up
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Banks in credit card slip-up
          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                          Status quo rules                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: A month after the new base rates for lending became effective, banks are still charging interest on credit card dues under the previous rates.        
	In a July 1 circular, the Reserve Bank had directed all commercial banks to link the interest on credit card dues to their respective base rates and prescribe a ceiling rate of interest. In a follow-up circular on July 9, the RBI had asked the banks to strictly adhere to its guidelines on credit cards. But no bank has changed the interest on credit cards according to the new base rates.         
	I have not seen the circular. If the RBI has issued such a circular, well follow it, said Shikha Sharma, managing director and chief executive officer of Axis Bank.        
	Parag Rao, head of HDFC Banks credit card business, said, I am not aware of any such circular. Ill look for it and if anything is there, Ill get back to you.         
	ICICI Bank didnt respond to an email query.        
	Whenever the RBI issues a circular, we send it to the chairmans office of every bank. Besides, the circulars are also available on the RBIs website. So, the ignorance about the circular cannot be justified, said RBI spokesperson Alpana Kilawala.        
	However, we will consider it a deviation on the part of the banks if they do not shift to the base rates after the time period given to them for the transition and the question of penalty or a penal action will be considered then.        
	Banks have been given time till December 31 to make changes in the methodology of calculating the base rate. So, from January next year, banks will have to charge base rate-linked interest on credit card dues.        
	Credit card dues fall under lending in the non-priority sector. Till June, banks were free to determine the rate of interest on credit card buys without referring to their benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR).         
	From July 1, the base rate  the rate below which banks cannot lend  replaced the BPLR system. According to the RBI circular, all categories of loans, including credit card dues, must be linked to the base rate. The RBI has allowed banks to review their base rates once in three months. So, the interest rate on credit cards will change with every revision of the base rates.

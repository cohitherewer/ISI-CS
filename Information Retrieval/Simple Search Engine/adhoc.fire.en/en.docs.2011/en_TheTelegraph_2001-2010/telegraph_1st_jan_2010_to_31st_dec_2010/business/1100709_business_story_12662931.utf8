	New Delhi, July 8 (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that taxpayers can legally reduce their liability through dividend-stripping, a term used for selling mutual fund units at a discount post-dividend.        
	An apex court bench headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia has said there is nothing wrong in dividend-stripping after getting the tax benefits and it cannot be termed as abuse of law. Even assuming that the transaction was pre-planned there is nothing to impeach its genuineness, said the bench agreeing with an earlier Bombay High Court order.        
	Dividend-stripping is the purchase of shares just before a dividend is paid, and sale of the same after that payment, when they go ex-dividend. This is often done by investors and companies as an investment strategy to avoid/reduce income tax liability.        
	The court said the income tax department could not term the loss occurred after such a transaction as not valid as it had been a pre-planned one. It said the interest/dividend received on such investments were regarded as return on investment and not return of investment.        
	Only in certain cases where the purchase price includes the right to receive crystallised and accrued dividend, that have already accrued and become due for payment before the date of purchase of the units, that the same has got be reduced from the purchase of the investment. But receipt of dividend subsequent to purchase of units merely on the basis of a person holding units at the time of the declaration of the dividend on the record date cannot go to offset the cost of acquisition of the units, the court said.        
	The ruling follows a petition filed by the I-T department challenging the order of Bombay High Court.         
	The case dates back to 2000, when brokerage house Walfort Share amp; Stock had bought tax-free dividends from Chola Freedom Technology Mutual Fund at a price of Rs 17.23 per unit. The brokerage house got 40 per cent tax concession from the deal.         
	After three days, they sold it at Rs 13.23 a unit, thus suffering losses. When it filed its annual returns it got the benefits under Section 10 (33) of the income tax act, but the department declined to adjust the loss suffered in dividend-stripping, contending that it was a pre-designed artificial loss.

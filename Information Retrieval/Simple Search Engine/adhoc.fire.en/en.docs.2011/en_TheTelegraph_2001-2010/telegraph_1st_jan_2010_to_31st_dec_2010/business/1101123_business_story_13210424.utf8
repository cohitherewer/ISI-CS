The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Incentives to make electric car cheaper
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Incentives to make electric car cheaper
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Big push                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 22: Electric small cars will be cheaper by about Rs 1 lakh following the governments Rs 95-crore incentive scheme for the industry.        
	The scheme for electric vehicles provides incentives of Rs 4,000-5,000 to two-wheelers and Rs 1 lakh to a car. While electric two-wheelers are priced between Rs 26,000 and Rs 40,000, an electric car is available in the range of Rs 4-5 lakh.        
	Manufacturers will definitely pass on the benefits to the customers as it is a win-win situation for both. Higher volumes (from a price cut) will mean higher revenues for companies, while for customers it will mean access to a greener mode of transport, Sohinder Singh Gill, chief executive officer of Hero Electric, told The Telegraph.        
	The scheme, which took effect on November 11, has been approved by the ministry of new and renewable energy.         
	Gill, who also heads the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SEMV), said the real impact would be reflected next year.        
	The incentives will encourage manufacturers to expand in the domestic market instead of exploring foreign markets, analysts said.         
	Mahindra and Mahindra, which owns 55 per cent in Chetan Maini-promoted Reva Electric Car Company, has been planning to enter the US with electric vehicles from Revas portfolio.         
	Analysts expect electric cars to constitute 5 per cent of the domestic market in the next five years at 1,75,000 units.        
	Most global car brands have not been launched in India because of the high duty structure, the lack of component makers and insufficient outlets for charging such vehicles, experts said, adding the incentives could change the situation.         
	The incentive scheme will provide the much-needed impetus to the industry, V.U. Giri, secretary-general of the SMEV, said.         
	Car makers, including Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Hero Electric are developing concept electric cars. Hero Electric, which is the market leader in electric two-wheelers, expects a demand surge over the next few quarters. The Indian electric two-wheeler market stands at around 85,000 units annually.

	Calcutta, Nov. 28: BMW India is set to introduce the sports activity vehicle X1  its entry-level model at less than Rs 25 lakh  next month.         
	Andreas Schaaf, president of BMW India, said, We will now have a new entry-level vehicle below the 3 Series corporate edition that was available for Rs 25 lakh.         
	The car maker aims to attract new customers with a lifestyle product that is flexible, unique, and modern besides being strategically priced.         
	With the Indian market growing phenomenally, it was only a matter of time when we would expand from servicing just 0.5 per cent of the population to a much larger segment. In India, the luxury market is no longer confined to a group of influential people of the established class. Its growing to include younger people with excellent jobs, high incomes and access to financial tools. It is this segment we want to address with our new X1, Schaaf said.        
	Of the three German lpremium car makers, both BMW and Audi have started CKD (completely knocked down) assembly of its SUVs.         
	With Audi assembling the Q5 at its Aurangabad facility since June and BMW putting together the X1 at its Chennai plant, the competition in this segment is going to be intense.         
	Responding to environment minister Jairam Rameshs concern over high-end SUVs contributing to increasing carbon footprint, BMW and Audi representatives said, Our vehicles have a much cleaner technology conforming to Euro V emission norms.

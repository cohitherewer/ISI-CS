The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | China faces charge of the young India brigade

          PIYA SINGH                                            
	Mumbai, July 5: The population of India will be much younger than Chinas in 2050. With more young people being part of its workforce, India is expected to enjoy a huge economic advantage over rivals such as China.        
	According to a report titled Global Ageing Demographics and Economic Growth by brokerage house CLSA, Asia is ageing at an unprecedented rate, with birth rates plummeting in a short span of time. The trend in India, however, does not reveal any such drastic decline.        
	The research by Amar Gill is demonstrated through population pyramids that show a countrys age and sex profile at a particular point of time. While India retains the traditional shape of the pyramid till 2050, Chinas population pyramid takes on an inverted structure. This suggests that India will have moderate rather than abrupt changes in the most basic driver of population  birth rate.        
	China reveals sharp and abrupt changes in birth and death, a declining birth rate and an increase in population over the age of 60 by 2050. The number of people in the working age group (15-64 years) in China by 2050 is projected to shrink to less than 760 million compared with 1.08 billion in India.        
	Labour-force expansion has been a key component of economic growth globally but this is now reversing. Particularly exposed are Portugal, Italy and Greece, where a shrinking workforce impacts medium-term economic growth. Despite global ageing, the labour force in all Asian countries other than Japan, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan will continue to rise through to 2020, says Gill.        
	Workforce quality        
	India scores well not only in the number of young people expected to join the workforce but also in the improved quality of this workforce. The study shows that the proportion of the population in the working age group with at least secondary school education is set to rise 50 per cent for China and will double for India between 2000 and 2050.                       
	Better educated workers along with the benefits of urbanisation will come to the rescue of an ageing Asia.        
	Another interesting statistic that could work in Indias favour was that its life expectancy was much lower at around 63.7 years in 2008 against 86.2 years in Japan. For countries such as China, which have a higher life expectancy, the population of potential workers is higher initially.        
	However, with time todays larger population of potential workers becomes tomorrows retirement burden, the report said.        
	India also has one of the lowest participation by women in the workforce in the Asian region. This is typical of relatively younger countries such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.         
	Urbanisation is another phenomenon where India is lower on the charts than its Asian peers. There is substantial variation in the extent of urbanisation in Asia, ranging from total urbanisation of 100 per cent in both Hong Kong and Singapore and nearly 90 per cent in Australia to lows of 28.3 per cent in Vietnam, 29.8 per cent in India, 33.6 per cent in Thailand, and 44.4 per cent in China as of 2009, the study said.         
	In India, urbanisation has risen slightly in the last 40 years, while agricultural density has risen steadily and is now nearly more than double than in 1961. Higher agricultural density means cultivable land available per farmer will decline even further. This may act as a dampener as it will reduce labour productivity and income, increase rural poverty and widen the economic inequality between rural and urban residents.

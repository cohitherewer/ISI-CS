The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Twin HM steps to trim loss
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Twin HM steps to trim loss
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jha: New game plan                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 8: Hindustan Motors, the Chandra Kant Birla group flagship, has proposed to write down its equity capital by half and write off its securities premium account and adjust the amount against its losses.        
	The company had accumulated a loss of Rs 152 crore by June 30, 2010 compared with its net worth of Rs 164 crore. If the restructuring exercise is approved by the shareholders, creditors and Calcutta High Court, the losses could be cut by as much as Rs 84 crore.        
	When contacted, Manoj Jha, managing director of Hind Motors, said the exercise was intended to make the company leaner and fitter.        
	We want to leave behind the baggage of the past. The restructuring, along with fresh capital infusion of Rs 40 crore, will help us move forward, Jha told The Telegraph.         
	HMs board in its meeting today decided to trim the equity capital from Rs 161.17 crore to Rs 80.58 crore by reducing the face value of the paid-up share from Rs 10 to Rs 5. It has also offered to write off Rs 3.17 crore in the securities premium account against its losses.        
	The twin exercises mean promoters (CK Birla Group), institutional shareholders and ordinary retail shareholders are being asked to take a cut on their investment in the auto maker. Hind Motors manufactures the Ambassador car and light commercial vehicle Winner, apart from Mitsubishi cars under a licensing agreement with the Japanese major.        
	In the last quarter, Hind Motor had raised Rs 20 crore by selling property in Chennai and an equal amount by cutting stake in Avtec, an associate company of Hind Motors engaged in the auto component business.        
	The company plans to sell more shares in Avtec to CK Birla group firms. This will raise more cash for HM and potentially wipe off the entire accumulated loss, or get very close to doing it.        
	The write-down of the equity and capital infusion through asset sale are expected to bring down its losses to around Rs 30 crore by the end of the June quarter. However, the company is likely to post losses in the second and third quarter as well.        
	But the latest HM exercise means the fear of being referred to the BIFR will recede for some time to come.         
	According to the provisions of the Sick Industrial Companies (special provisions) Act of 1985, a firm must be referred to the BIFR if its net worth is fully eroded. As of June 30, 92.5 per cent of HMs net worth had been eroded.        
	In an interaction earlier this month, Jha promised to touch the break-even point operationally by the fourth quarter on the back of a slew of launches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Token hike in wheat support price

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The government today raised the support price of wheat marginally by Rs 20 a quintal to Rs 1,120 as it had adequate stock of the foodgrain.        
	There is also not much political pressure to raise the support price of wheat; procurement from Bihar  which is going to the polls tomorrow  is negligible.        
	However, the prices of lentils  masoor and gram  have been raised substantially, by up to Rs 380 a quintal, to encourage farmers to grow more to help bridge the demand-supply gap.        
	The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) today approved the minimum support price (MSP) of rabi crops for 2010-11, home minister P. Chidambaram said after the cabinet meeting.        
	The MSP of wheat, a major rabi crop, was Rs 1,100 per quintal in the last season.        
	This year, with silos overflowing with wheat, the government wanted to reduce the incentive for growing the crop.         
	Against the buffer norm of 14 million tonnes (mt), the Food Corporation of India held 10.28mt wheat, while the stock in the central pool, including state agencies, was 27.77mt as on October 1.        
	The support price is the price the government pays to farmers while procuring their crop. The hike in the MSP is based on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. The Centre procures wheat and rice from farmers for the public distribution system.        
	Electoral politics had prompted the wheat growing states of UP, Punjab, Haryana and MP to lobby for a higher support price for the crop. This discouraged farmers from shifting to other crops as they were assured of a good price. But the stress on wheat has impacted soil fertility and lowered productivity because of overuse.         
	Much of the huge stock that the government claims to have, however, may be rotting in makeshift godowns.         
	A recent Supreme Court order asking the government to distribute foodgrains free-of-cost to the poor has not yet been implemented on grounds that the move involves huge costs.        
	For cereals, the Food Corporation and other state agencies will continue to provide price support to the farmers.        
	According to the revised price, the MSP of masoor dal has been raised by Rs 380 per quintal to Rs 2,250, while that of gram has been increased by Rs 340 per quintal to Rs 2,100 a quintal.        
	The CCEA also approved an increase in mustard MSP by Rs 20 to Rs 1,850 per quintal. The support price of safflower has gone up to Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,680 a quintal. Barley MSP has been increased to Rs 780 from Rs 750 per quintal.         
	A higher support price for pulses is aimed at reducing dependence on imports.         
	The agriculture ministry has set a target of increasing the production of pulses to 16.5mt in 2010-11 from about 14.5mt in the previous year.         
	India imports 3.5-4mt to meet the domestic demand of 18-19mt.

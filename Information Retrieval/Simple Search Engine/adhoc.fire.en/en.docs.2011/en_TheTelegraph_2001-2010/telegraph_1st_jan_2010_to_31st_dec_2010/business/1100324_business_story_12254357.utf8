          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 23: The construction of 12 greenfield airports, including the aerotropolis in Durgapur, will start soon, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.        
	The real test for the Indian aviation sector is to create more (infrastructure) facilities. Approvals have been granted to 12 greenfield airports in different parts of the country, Patel said at an infrastructure conference here today.         
	These include two aerotropolises, or airport city projects, in Durgapur, Bengal and Ludhiana, Punjab.        
	Unlike conventional airports, an aerotropolis leads to parallel growth of real estate, hospitality and manufacturing. In an aerotropolis, a major share of the revenue comes from non-aeronautical components, which yield faster returns than aeronautical components.         
	Patel said the governments policy to allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the construction of greenfield airports was attracting huge investments.        
	Several leading airport operators and related firms have invested or formed joint ventures with Indian partners for airport and aviation infrastructure projects. The domestic firms have also started participating in global bidding for such projects.         
	I am sure that the Airports Authority of India will also bid for many international projects in the future, he said.        
	Noting that land acquisition was an area of concern, Patel said, We will have to closely work with the states because airports cannot be made 100-200km away from the cities. They have to be in close proximity of the cities.

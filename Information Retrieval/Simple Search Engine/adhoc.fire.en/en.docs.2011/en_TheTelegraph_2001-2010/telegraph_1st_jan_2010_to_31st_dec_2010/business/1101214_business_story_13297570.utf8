The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Charges greet new Birla Corp office
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Charges greet new Birla Corp office
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 13: The Birla family and the Lodhas today traded charges over the purported shifting of Birla Corporation headquarters from Birla Building on R.N. Mukherjee Road to a new Shakespeare Sarani address, while they continue to bicker over the ownership of the Rs 5,000-crore MP Birla empire.        
	The Birla camp alleged that Birla Corporation, under the control of Harsh Vardhan Lodha, inaugurated the headquarters today after a customary puja in contravention of a November 12 Company Law Board (CLB) order.        
	The Lodhas denied the charge saying the CLB never stopped the company from adding office space or shifting staff from Birla Building  the headquarters of many Birla companies in Calcutta near Dalhouise  as long as the registered office remained there.        
	Debanjan Mandal, partner of Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm of Lodha, said: This is the third attempt to stop Birla Corp from having additional offices, obviously with malafide intent. The company is advised that there is no impediment to opening offices and using available space for its offices and attempts are being made to interfere with its functioning.        
	The Birla Corp board on July 31, 2007 had approved buying additional space. Subsequently, 20,000 square feet was bought on 1, Shakespeare Sarani, popularly known as AC Market, on March 1, 2008.         
	In September, responding to a Birla application, the CLB advised the Lodhas not to do anything that might render their (Birla) prayer infructuous.         
	Birla Corp had submitted an affidavit thereafter that it would not shift the registered office but added that it needed more space.        
	The Birla plea is part of a case slapped by the family on Harsh Lodha alleging mismanagement at Birla Corporation. A hearing will take place on December 22.        
	Sensing that Birla Corporation was going ahead with their plans to inaugurate a new office, the Birla Education Trust, through their solicitor firm Amarchand Mangaldas, posted notices in various newspapers last week referring to the CLB order and warned Birla Corp employees of committing contempt of court if they moved to the new office.        
	It also informed the Hare Street and Shakespeare Sarani police stations on Saturday about the CLB interim order and sought intervention to stop the unauthorised and illegal action. But the police did not take any steps today.

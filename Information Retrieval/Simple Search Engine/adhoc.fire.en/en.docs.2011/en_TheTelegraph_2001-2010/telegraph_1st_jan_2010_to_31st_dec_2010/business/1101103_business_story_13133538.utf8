          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 2: The countrys second largest low cost carrier SpiceJet has posted an unexpected profit as Indians travelled more during the second quarter of this fiscal.        
	The airline posted a profit of Rs 10 crore in the three months ended September 30 against a loss of Rs 101 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Net sales rose 37 per cent to Rs 603 crore from Rs 440 crore.         
	Analysts expected the airline to post a net loss considering that the second quarter is traditionally one of weak performance for the aviation industry.        
	On Tuesday, the airline said the board of directors had approved an order of up to 30 turboprop aircraft from Canadas Bombardier Inc. SpiceJet hopes to improve regional connectivity with these by focusing on tier II and tier III cities.         
	The airline is expected to spend roughly $450 million to buy the first 15 aircraft.

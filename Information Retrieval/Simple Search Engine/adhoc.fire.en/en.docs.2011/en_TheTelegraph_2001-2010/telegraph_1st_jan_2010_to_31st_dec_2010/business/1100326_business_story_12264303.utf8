The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dubai World gets lifeline
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Dubai World gets lifeline
                            
	Dubai, March 25 (Reuters): Dubai will recapitalise its Dubai World conglomerate and repay property unit Nakheels bonds in full, with $9.5 billion of aid for a debt deal promising creditors all their money back in up to eight years.        
	The price of bonds issued by Nakheel, which built a map of the world archipelago, soared and the cost of insuring Dubai debt against default plummeted, while the Dubai main stock index rose 4.73 percent to an 11-week high.        
	The long-awaited plan unveiled today is Dubais attempt to restructure some $26 billion in debt held by Dubai World, owner of the QE2 liner and Cirque du Soleil assets, which fell on hard times when Dubais property boom went bust.        
	The Dubai government said $5.7 billion in funds from a previous loan made by neighbouring emirate Abu Dhabi would provide the lions share of the overall $9.5 billion, and that it would add around $4 billion of its own resources. Analysts had expected oil-rich Abu Dhabi to step in with more cash, but that was not part of the package.

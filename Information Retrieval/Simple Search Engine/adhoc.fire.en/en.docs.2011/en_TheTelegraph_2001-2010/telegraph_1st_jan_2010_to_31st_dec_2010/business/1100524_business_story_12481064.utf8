	Mumbai, May 23: Godrej Consumer Products will acquire a 100 per cent stake in the Latin American entity, Issue Group, a market leader in hair colour in Argentina, Peru, Uruguay and Paraguay.        
	The FMCG major had recently acquired Nigerias Tura soap brand and Indonesias household care company, the Megasari group. It has also picked up Sara Lees 51 per cent stake in its joint venture Godrej Sara Lee.        
	The Issue Group buyout provides us the perfect platform to establish a strong presence in the fast-growing hair colour markets of Latin America, GCPL chairman Adi Godrej said.        
	On plans for more acquisitions, he said, Yes, there could be one or two more acquisitions soon. We are looking at companies in the home care, personal wash and haircare segments.        
	He, however, did not disclose the acquisition cost. The companys annual turnover is $33 million ... the price we are paying is eight times the EBIDTA of the company.        
	The transaction is expected to be completed by early June.

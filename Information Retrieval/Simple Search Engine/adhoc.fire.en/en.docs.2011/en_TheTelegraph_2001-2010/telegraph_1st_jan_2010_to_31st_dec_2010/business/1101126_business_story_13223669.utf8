The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Realty, bank stocks take a beating
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Realty, bank stocks take a beating
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 25: Realty and bank stocks tumbled in a skittish market spooked by the arrests of senior officials at lending institutions over a housing loan scam.        
	The sensex plunged to a 10-week low at 19318.16, shedding nearly 142 points over Wednesdays close.        
	Investors refused to make any purchases  prompted in part by the futures and options expiry  even as a wave of selling rocked the realty and bank counters. Market circles fear that more companies will be sucked into the loan scam, weakening sentiment on the bourses.        
	The BSE realty index emerged as the largest percentage loser as it dropped 5.40 per cent. Shares of DLF slumped 4.13 per cent to Rs 292.75, Unitech by 6.04 per cent to Rs 63, DB Realty by nearly 10 per cent to Rs 235.25 and Oberoi Realty by 3.61 per cent to Rs 254.         
	Stocks of banks that were named in the scam continued to flounder. Bank of India fell nearly 6 per cent to Rs 420.30 and Punjab National Bank by 6.38 per cent to Rs 1,183.75. However, shares of the Central Bank of India rebounded nearly 5.80 per cent.         
	Financial services provider Money Matters Financial Services, which has allegedly bribed senior officials of public sector financial institutions to procure loans for corporate houses, nosedived 20 per cent for the second consecutive session, hitting a lower circuit on the BSE.        
	With the benchmark index ending in the negative territory today, it has shed 639 points, or 3.2 per cent, in the last three trading sessions. The index had, however, begun the day with a gain of over 100 points.         
	There are no triggers for a buying opportunity coming from either the domestic markets or at the global level. The indices are likely to remain under pressure though there will be volatility, an analyst said.        
	Of the 30 sensex components, 23 ended the day in the red, while the rest settled in the green. IT bellwether Infosys surged 2.09 per cent to Rs 3,063.70. TCS ended with a gain of 1.32 per cent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Revival mode                                  
	New Delhi, June 8: The government today granted permission to realty major DLF to revive its IT special economic zone in Calcutta.         
	DLF had surrendered the project last year.        
	The government has also approved six SEZ applications, including the proposals of Larsen amp; Toubro and Hindalco. The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Haryana SEZ has been given an extension.        
	The board of approval (BoA) for special economic zones has allowed re-notification of DLFs SEZ in Calcutta, D.K. Mittal, additional secretary in the commerce ministry, said.        
	Improved sentiment in real estate had encouraged DLF to approach the ministry to revive the IT/ITeS tax-free zone. In its application, the company said demand for IT/ITeS leasing space was showing signs of improvement.        
	The project at Rajarhat, Calcutta, to be developed over 10.48 hectares, was notified on June 23, 2008.        
	In 2009, DLF had applied for denotification citing falling demand for commercial space.         
	The proposal was taken up by the BoA on June 2, 2009, and the SEZ denotified on February 23.        
	DLFs three other projects in Gujarat, Haryana and Orissa remain denotified.         
	In all, around 12 developers had pulled out because of a slowdown in the commercial space segment last year.        
	The BoA today allowed four developers to withdraw their proposals.         
	The applicants, including Bata India, had cited a slowdown in the IT industry as the reason for pulling out.        
	The government has given formal approval to set up 574 SEZs, of which 353 have been notified.        
	Exports from SEZs were valued at Rs 2.20 lakh crore in 2009-10, up 121.29 per cent from the previous fiscal.

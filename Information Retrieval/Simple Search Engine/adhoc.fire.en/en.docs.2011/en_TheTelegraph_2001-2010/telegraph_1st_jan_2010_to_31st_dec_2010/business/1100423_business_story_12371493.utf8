                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tatas plan third retail venture
          PIYA SINGH                          Best foot forward                                  
	Mumbai, April 22: The $70.8-billion Tata group is launching its third retail venture in India after selling consumer electronics under the Croma brand of stores and building Trent Ltds portfolio of Westside, Star Bazaar hypermarkets and Landmark outlets.        
	Tata International Ltd  the global trading arm of the group and one of the countrys biggest export houses  plans to set up a retail chain for footwear. The first store is likely to open in Delhi shortly.        
	That Tata International will sell footwear in India is not surprising considering the company focuses on two key businesses at present  leather and leather products, and engineering.        
	Besides expertise in the leather business, the company has identified a segment where there is little competition with few organised players engaged in retailing footwear such as Bata that has a national presence.         
	A Tata International spokesperson said, At the moment, we are not in a position to comment on this development. We continue to examine forays into new businesses.        
	The company has an extensive network of international retailers to whom it already supplies shoes and leather garments, including high street brands such as Marks amp; Spencer, Zara, Betty Barclay, Mango, Hush Puppies and even luxury retailers such as Escada.         
	In India, it has done business with Westside, Shoppers Stop and Raymond.        
	With design studios in Italy, Spain and India, the company has collaborated with several global retailers in ascertaining trends and developments in footwear fashion and is likely to get a leg up through these associations, sources said.         
	Tata International boasts of one of the largest tanneries in the world in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, and runs a manufacturing unit in Chennai.        
	The Tata groups intent to consolidate its position in the competitive retail business is clear. It has been pushing Croma that has been launched under the Infiniti Retail banner, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Tata Sons, across several Indian cities such as Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi Bangalore and Surat. It hopes to grow the brand into a 100-store property by 2011.        
	Star Bazaar  a hypermarket format that gets technical expertise from Tesco of the UK  is pursuing growth in the domestic market and plans to scale up to 18 stores by 2011.         
	Westside, a department store retailer that has also established itself in several big Indian cities, is trying to bring foreign brands into the country. It has signed up with Spanish retailer Inditex for a joint venture that will develop and promote stores that will exclusively sell the Zara brand in India.                          
	The three retail ventures from the Tata group are headed by separate management teams. Trent Ltd  the listed retail arm of the group  is headed by Noel Tata while the Croma business is spearheaded by Tata Sons director R.K. Krishna Kumar.         
	Tata Internationals top management includes chairman B. Muthuraman  who is also vice-chairman of Tata Steel  and .K. Kaul, executive director of Tata International Ltd.

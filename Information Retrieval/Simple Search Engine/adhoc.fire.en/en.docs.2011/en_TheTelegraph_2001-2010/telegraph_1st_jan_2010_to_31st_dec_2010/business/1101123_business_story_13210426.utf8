The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | MNP to debut on Thursday
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      MNP to debut on Thursday
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          New era                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 22: Number portability, which allows customers to switch service providers without changing their cell numbers, will take off from Thursday in Haryana.        
	The implementation in the rest of the country will be completed by December or January 2011, said officials of the department of telecom (DoT).        
	Some operators are excited, while others are apprehensive about the new facility.         
	Officials of new operators said portability would enable them to rake in subscribers from other networks and they are likely to approach corporate houses to acquire a large chunk of customers at one go by forgoing porting charges and offering other attractive deals.        
	However, some players said operational costs could increase as they would be forced to provide additional incentives to retain customers.        
	The Aditya Birla group-promoted Idea Cellular has started the switch to Idea commercial, which urges users to switch to a new operator that provides better coverage, flexible tariff plans and better customer service without changing their numbers.        
	There are eight operators in Haryana  Airtel, Idea, BSNL, Aircel, Loop, Vodafone, Etisalat DB, and Videocon.        
	Mobile subscribers will be charged a maximum Rs 19 for the service and the process will take four days, according to the telecom regulators norms.        
	While there is no restriction on the number of times a subscriber can switch to new operators, the change can be made only after a gap of three months from the date of activation of a number or the date of the previous switch.        
	Number portability, which missed many deadlines because of the inability of operators to set up infrastructure, has finally taken off on DoT pressure.         
	In August, the telecom ministry had directed that only those operators who were ready with portability would be allowed to introduce new services, including the high-earning 3G services.        
	Since number portability creates genuine competitive pressures, its biggest upside is a marked improvement in the quality of service, said DoT officials.

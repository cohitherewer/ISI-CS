The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Emission rules hit fuel hurdle
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Emission rules hit fuel hurdle
                              Up in smoke                            
	Mumbai, March 21 (PTI): Auto manufacturers are not sure about the availability of the required fuel for their cars, which will have to comply with new emission standards from next month. Analysts said the government might have to postpone the April 1 date to shift to the new standards.        
	The automobile industry is ready to follow the new emission norms from April 1, but the fuel is not available. We have requested the government to defer the date till the fuel becomes available, Pawan Goenka, president of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers and Mahindra amp; Mahindra (automotive division), said.        
	From April 1, stricter emission norms will be in place under which 13 major cities will upgrade to Bharat Stage IV from III and the rest of the country will move up to Bharat Stage III from II.        
	The new emission norms have forced auto makers to replace some old technology in their vehicles. We have been preparing for a long time to meet the challenge, Goenka said.        
	Many of the older cars in use will need major changes in their engines and exhaust systems. New models will be relatively easy to upgrade, Ernst amp; Youngs national head (automotive sector), Rakesha Batra, said.        
	 The government may postpone the April 1 date by at least six months as the required oil is not available. The good thing is that the auto industry is ready, Batra said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Essar sets London IPO price
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Essar sets London IPO price
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cash course                                  
	Mumbai, April 22: The Essar group today launched the initial public offering (IPO) of Essar Energy Plc, which houses its energy, and oil and gas businesses. A price band of 450 to 550 pence per share was fixed for the offering that could translate into market capitalisation of $9.5-11 billion post listing.        
	The company plans to raise up to $2.5 billion. Shares of the company will be listed on the London Stock Exchange in the first week of May.        
	The group is selling 20 to 25 per cent in the company. Sources said the offering drew a good response from investors after the book-building issue opened today.        
	They added that the IPO, which is the largest from an Indian company, will also make it to the top 50 of the FTSE 100 index upon listing. JP Morgan Cazenove and Deutsche Bank AG are the joint global coordinators of the issue.         
	Essar will use the proceeds from the issue to fund its expansion in the oil and gas and power verticals. Earlier this month, the company had formally announced its intention to list on the London Stock Exchange.         
	Sources said Essar Energy had in place plans to increase its power generation from 1,220MW to 11,470MW.        
	It also aims to increase the Nelson Complexity of its oil refinery from 6.1 to 11.8, which will help the refinery process complex crudes. The Nelson complexity index indicates not only the investment intensity or cost index of the refinery but also its potential value addition. Thus, the higher the index number, the greater the cost of the refinery and the higher the value of its products.        
	Essar Energy has interests around the world in 14 prospective oil, gas and coal seam gas exploration blocks.        
	It has plans to raise its refining capacity at Vadinar in Gujarat to 375,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2011 from a current capacity of 300,000 bpd.         
	The group has also indicated that if market conditions permit, the refinery capacity will be increased to 750,000 bpd by 2013, making it Indias largest single location refinery.        
	The funds will also be used to carry out exploration and production across its global portfolio of oil and gas blocks in Asia, Africa and Australia.

	New Delhi, May 25: The agitation for Gorkhaland is likely to delay the commissioning of NHPCs Teesta Low Dam projects in Bengal, resulting in a 30 per cent cost overrun of Rs 745 crore.        
	We have asked the Bengal government and the Centre to help us out so that the projects can be completed and commissioned at the earliest. The Gorkha agitation is delaying the project further, S.K. Garg, chairman and managing director of NHPC, told The Telegraph.        
	Garg said he had taken up the issue both with the Bengal government and the Union power ministry. The hydel power plant will be beneficial to the state as the power generated from Teesta Low Dam III and IV will be used in the state itself.         
	The NHPC head said he had been assured at the highest levels that steps would be taken for the early commissioning of the project in Darjeeling district.        
	While Teesta III is expected to generate 132mw of power, Teesta IV is expected to generate 160mw. We expect Teesta III to be completed by next March and Teesta IV by August 2011, if the state and Centre intervene and the agitators allow the project work to go on, he said.        
	A.B.L. Srivastava, director finance, said, The project cost for these two projects have now shot up Rs 745 crore to Rs 2,574 crore. The cost overrun would ultimately affect the state as the cost of power would go up.        
	NHPC had announced plans of setting up Teesta III in 2002 and Teesta IV in 2005. Since then the project has been delayed because of lack of forest clearance, protests from environmentalists, floods and political agitations.        
	The state-run firm today reported a 94.43 per cent higher profit after tax of Rs 2,090.50 crore in 2009-10 compared with Rs 1,075.22 crore in the previous fiscal. Total revenue of the power company, including other income, rose to Rs 4,892.09 crore from Rs 3,261.49 crore in the same period last year.        
	On a consolidated basis, the companys net profit in 2009-10 rose 83.6 per cent to Rs 2,175.56 crore from Rs 1,184.89 crore in 2008-09.

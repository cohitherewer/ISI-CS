                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stocks go into a tailspin
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, May 25: The Indian markets saw a sharp fall on Tuesday and touched three-month lows as fears about Europes debt crisis continued to persist and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) dumped local stocks.        
	The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange sensex dipped below the psychologically important support level of 16000 points and the broader 50-share Nifty fell below the 4800-point mark.         
	The sensex closed 2.71 per cent lower, or 447.07 points, to 16022.48 points, its lowest since February 10. The Nifty was down 2.78 per cent, or 137.20 points, on Tuesday and closed the day at 4806.75 points.        
	Weak global cues, uncertainty about markets overseas and the fact that we are succumbing to these pressures pulled down the sensex. The fact is that while foreigners are selling and local institutional buyers are buying shares of at least 60 to 70 per cent of what is sold, the market is still going down, said Arun Kejriwal, strategist at Kris Research in Mumbai.        
	Brokerage houses are still bullish on the strong consumption-led domestic environment, and some believe that the worst may be over. Angel Brokings vice-president research Sarabjit Kaur Nangra said, We believe that the selloff will not sustain for long. India is still an attractive bet and valuations at this point are in a comfortable zone.        
	Asian markets are reacting badly to the European crisis and were in the red today. European markets also opened weak and remained so in the afternoon with the escalating tension between North and South Korea exacerbating the bearish sentiment.        
	Wall Street plunged in early trade today and the key Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below the sensitive 10000-mark. The euro sank close to a four-year low against the dollar today before recovering.        
	Cyclical commodities, including copper, slid today in the world markets, cowed by risk aversion, while gold shone as a safe haven option. Among commodities, oil slipped towards $68 a barrel, while copper has fallen 3 per cent. Spot gold was at $1,200.05 an ounce, up around 1 per cent so far this week.        
	Picking up on global cues, gold once again sparkled to hit a new peak on the Mumbai bullion market following hectic buying by stockists and retail investors.         
	A good local demand because of the ongoing marriage season supported the (rise in the price of the) precious metal, traders said.        
	Reliance loss        
	Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, which has the highest weightage in the sensex, fell 3.4 per cent to Rs 986.85, losing the gains it made yesterday after the announcement on cancellation of the non-compete agreement between the two Ambani brothers.        
	All the sectoral indices on the BSE ended in the red on Tuesday with the metals, consumer goods and banking indices being the worst hit.         
	The rupee today plunged to a nearly 8-month low of 47.71 against the dollar on strong demand for the US currency.

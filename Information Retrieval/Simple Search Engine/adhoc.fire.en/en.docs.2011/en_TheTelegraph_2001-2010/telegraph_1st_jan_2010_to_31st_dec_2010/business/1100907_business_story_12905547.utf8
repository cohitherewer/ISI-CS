                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Aurobindo in supply pact with AstraZeneca
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 6: Hyderabad-based Aurobindo Pharma today signed a deal with AstraZeneca under which it would supply generic drugs to be marketed by the latter in emerging markets.        
	AstraZeneca will brand and market Aurobindos anti-infectives, cardiovascular system (CVS) and central nervous system (CNS) drugs in various emerging markets. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.        
	Such an arrangement is not unusual as large pharmaceutical companies have been increasingly looking at markets such as India to source generic drugs. According to analysts, it results in a win-win deal as the multinationals have been facing increased competition for their products even as their pipeline of new drugs hasnt been growing.         
	For companies such as Aurobindo Pharma, such a deal not only boosts revenues but also their global presence.         
	Aurobindo Pharma said it would supply several solid dosage and sterile products. Aurobindos proven track record in building strong, collaborative working relationships is a key driver for these strategic agreements with AstraZeneca which will accelerate our growth and support our earnings, chairman P.V. Ramprasad Reddy said.        
	This is not the first time that Aurobindo Pharma is entering into such a deal with a global firm. Earlier, it had forged a partnership with Pfizer for several solid dosage and sterile products. The agreement gave Pfizers established product business unit the opportunity to exploit the sales potential of these generic drugs. The agreement was targeted at markets in the US and Europe.         
	The partnership was later expanded to cover 55 solid oral dose products and five sterile injectible products for countries across Asia, Latin America and Africa. The products also covered anti-infectives, CVS and CNS segments.         
	Aurobindo Pharma shares rose 1.82 per cent to close at Rs 1,063.75 on the BSE today.

          PIYA SINGH                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 15: Subrata Roy of the Sahara group is checking into Grosvenor House  the 80-year-old five-star hotel that overlooks Londons Hyde Park  after wrapping up a 500-million deal that the Lucknow-based group refuses to confirm.        
	A source close to the development said the Sahara group and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) were hammering out an agreement under which the state-owned British bank would convert 60 per cent of the purchase price into a loan on its books. The Sahara group will pay the remaining amount on a deferred payment basis.        
	The payout for Grosvenor House is slightly higher than the 470-million estimate made by the Sunday Times.        
	It is slightly more than that, close to 500 million actually, said a source privy to the impending transaction. He added that the Sahara group was likely to be allowed to pay the remaining 40 per cent of the purchase price over a period of two to three years.        
	The Sahara group continues to vehemently deny any knowledge of the deal. I am not aware of this  This is pure speculation, said Sahara spokesperson Abhijit Sarkar responding to a query on the groups purchase of Grosvenor House.        
	However, the source confirmed that the Roys had started a process of due diligence before closing the transaction. This will involve a scrutiny of the title of the property, verification of the physical area of the hotel and other regulatory issues.        
	It is also learnt that Sahara and RBS are in the middle of finalising the loan agreement after which Grosvenor House will change from a physical asset that the bank earns to a loan asset on its books.         
	According to the source, there were three bidders in the auction for Grosvenor House. One of them was from West Asia. Sahara bid the highest in this auction, he added.         
	RBS  which received bailout funds from the British government when the global financial crisis rocked Europe  has been looking to sell the hotel along with other assets to shore up its recession-ravaged balance sheet.        
	The historic Grosvenor House is run by international hotelier JW Marriott and has been frequented by royalty, celebrities and business leaders since its opening in 1929.        
	RBS tried to place the property under the hammer on two earlier occasions but failed to get its asking price of roughly 700 million, said sources.         
	Once it signs on the dotted line, the London property will be a trophy asset in the Sahara groups property and hospitality portfolio. The group already runs the Sahara Star hotel near Mumbai airport and has another hotel in Lucknow, its headquarters.         
	The Sahara group plans to put up hotels in the 15 townships that are under construction, said a source who is involved with its property development plan. The group is very serious about developing townships and has not changed its original plan of putting up 200 townships across the country, he said.         
	Grosvenor House will be a stable asset that will offer the group steady cash flows, this source added.         
	That may be true. But, Grosvenor House will give the Roys of Sahara India Pariwar more than just a trophy asset  it will give them ownership of a slice of a history.

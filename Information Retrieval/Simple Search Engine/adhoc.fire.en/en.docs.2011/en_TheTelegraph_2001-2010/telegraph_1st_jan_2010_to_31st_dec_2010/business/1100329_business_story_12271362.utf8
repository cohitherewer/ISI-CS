	 The State Bank of India has launched a chip-based platinum debit card, the first of its kind in the industry, that offers higher daily withdrawal limit of Rs 1 lakh from ATMs and improved security to customers. The new card allows a daily withdrawal of up to Rs 1 lakh from ATMs against the earlier limit of Rs 50,000 and a spending limit of Rs 2 lakh through point of sales (PoS) terminals. The new card will provide improved security to card holders as the data on the chip is extremely difficult to copy or change.

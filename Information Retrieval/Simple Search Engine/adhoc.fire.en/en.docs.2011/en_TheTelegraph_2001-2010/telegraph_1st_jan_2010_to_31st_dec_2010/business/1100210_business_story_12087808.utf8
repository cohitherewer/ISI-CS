                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      FIR quash plea in Mafatlal dispute
                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 9 (PTI): The Mafatlal family feud has taken a new turn with Ajay Mafatlal moving Bombay High Court to quash an FIR against him and cousin Shailaja Parekh for threatening brother Atulya and sister-in-law Sheetal.        
	Ajay and Atulya are locked in a property dispute since the death of their father, Mafatlal Industries owner Yogendra Mafatlal, in January 2005.        
	At the hearing yesterday, Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari questioned how an FIR could be lodged in a case in which offences were non-cognisable. The court has asked government pleader Shahji Shinde to ensure the investigating officer was present during tomorrows hearing.        
	Atulya and wife Sheetal had lodged a complaint on December 26, 2007 with Gamdevi police alleging threats from Ajay and Shailaja. Based on the complaint, the police filed an FIR under Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 II (criminal intimidation) of IPC.         
	Fearing arrest initially, Ajay had secured anticipatory bail, but later withdrew it as the offences were bailable. The police did not arrest him but filed a chargesheet before a magistrate who took cognisance of the offences. Later, Ajay was arrested and granted bail  the procedure followed in offences which are bailable.        
	Ajays counsel Sayaji Nangre has challenged the polices authority to file an FIR since the offences are non-cognisable and urged the high court to quash it. Besides, he said, there is no evidence mentioned against Ajay in the chargesheet.        
	Nangre argued that the police could not investigate a non-cognisable offence till they had sought permission from a magistrate. This, he said, had not been done when the FIR was filed.         
	The court may pass an order tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Economy health signals stimulus exit

  - Govt forecasts 7.2% growth        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: The government expects the Indian economy to grow at 7.2 per cent this year  fuelling talk that it can provide the launch pad for the unwinding of the stimulus package that the government prepared in late 2008 to jumpstart a faltering economy.        
	The growth forecast  which was made by the Central Statistical Organisation in its advance estimates for 2009-10  is, however, more sedate than the earlier estimates that were independently put out by the finance ministry and the RBI.        
	The big drag on growth will be the negative 0.2 per cent growth in agriculture this year because of a poor monsoon in 2009 that wrecked kharif crop production.        
	The finance ministry had estimated GDP (gross domestic product) growth this year at a robust 7.75 per cent, while the RBI had indicated in its third quarter review of the monetary policy last month that the economy would grow at 7.5 per cent with an upward bias.        
	This is an advance estimate. What normally we see when the final numbers come out for the third and fourth quarters is that there will be an upward bias and we are sure that this time also the same is going to happen, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said.        
	On the implication of the growth estimate on the fiscal stimulus measures, Chawla said, In terms of what the future policy framework is going to be, I think you will have to wait for the budget.        
	We should say the stimulus has succeeded and we should begin to phase it down. Fiscal deficit next year would be lower than that of this year, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, said.        
	The forecast growth is slower than the average 9 per cent expansion India logged before recession but marks acceleration from the 6.7 per cent growth in the previous financial year.         
	Manufacturing growth is seen at 8.9 per cent against 3.2 per cent a year ago, while agriculture and allied activities are projected to shrink by 0.2 per cent against 1.6 per cent growth a year ago, primarily because of drought.        
	Manufacturing had got various stimulus doses from the government in the wake of the global financial crisis.        
	The stimulus, which included tax cuts and raising public expenditure, is expected to push up the fiscal deficit to over Rs 4 lakh crore, or 6.8 per cent of GDP, in 2009-10.        
	Industry looks at that part of the stimulus which affects them. The real issue is the growing fiscal deficit which needs to be curtailed, Ahluwalia said.

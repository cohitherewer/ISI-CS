                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Centre asks DVC chairman to step down
          OUR BUREAU                      Biswas: Facing the flak                          
	July 21: The power ministry has removed Damodar Valley Corporation chairman Subrato Biswas from office.        
	An IAS officer of the 1985 batch, Biswas has been sent back to his parent Kerala cadre. He will now report to the Kerala chief secretary.         
	A new chairman for the DVC is yet to be decided as Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde is not in Delhi.        
	Biswas became the DVC chairman on October 13, 2009. He was to continue in office till May 21, 2011, when his five-year central deputation tenure was scheduled to expire.         
	On October 20, 2009, the Central Vigilance Commission had objected to Biswas appointment as the mandatory clearance from the commission was not sought.         
	Biswas had been accused of mismanagement and alleged acts of corruption. He had ordered the shifting of the Koderma units to Ranghunathpur and was allegedly indifferent to the problems at the Chandrapura thermal power station.         
	The DVC is also unlikely to supply 2,500MW power to the Commonwealth Games. Only the 500MW Mejia unit is scheduled to come up in August. All the other projects will be commissioned after October 2010, said Padamjit Singh, chairman of the All India Power Engineers Federation.        
	A couple of months back, Biswas was summoned by the speaker of the Jharkhand assembly and asked to submit a report on the DVCs development work in the state.         
	Representatives of various parties had criticised the arrogance of the DVC management. According to sources in the power ministry, they had forwarded a draft chargesheet against Biswas to the department of personnel and training in May, recommending his repatriation to Kerala.         
	Earlier, the Central Vigilance Commission had imposed a minor penalty on Biswas in connection with the ash evacuation work of the Mejia thermal power station.        
	This is the second time the power ministry had recommended the repatriation of Biswas. The first transfer proposal was made in November 2009, which reached the PMO in December.

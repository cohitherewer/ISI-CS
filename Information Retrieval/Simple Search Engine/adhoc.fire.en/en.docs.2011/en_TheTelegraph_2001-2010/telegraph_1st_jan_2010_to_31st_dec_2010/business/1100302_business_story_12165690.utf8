The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Car makers brace for sales brake
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Car makers brace for sales brake
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                           R.C. Bhargava   Chairman of Maruti Suzuki                                      
	New Delhi, March 1: Car makers after the budget are expecting a short-term demand slowdown in March and April and may go for another round of price hikes when the new emission norms kick in from April.         
	Immediately after Pranab Mukherjee jacked up excise duties on Friday, Maruti, Hyundai and Mahindra amp; Mahindra raised prices. Mahindra even spoke of a price hike in April because of the emission norm.        
	Maruti and Hyundai expect a slowdown in demand as an immediate impact of the duty hike.         
	An increase in excise duty was widely anticipated by the consumers and as a result, many rushed to buy cars before the budget. In our opinion, though there will certainly be no long-term impact, but sales in March and April may get affected a little because of a hike in excise and fuel prices, Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava told The Telegraph.         
	Jnaneswar Sen, vice-president (marketing), Honda Siel Cars India, said the company might witness lower sales this month. Honda sold 5,983 cars in January over 5,773 units sold last year.        
	A Hyundai Motors India spokesperson said, In the past also, there have been such hikes. But on a long-term basis, people dont stop buying cars. Yes, there is a possibility that sales may slow down a little for the next two to three months.        
	According to auto analyst, Murad Ali Baig, There is a doubt whether the demand will sustain at the current levels. Until price stability sets in, a temporary blip is quite likely in two-wheelers and passenger vehicles sales.         
	Pawan Goenka, president (automotive sector), Mahindra amp; Mahindra, is anticipating another round of hikes in April because of the implementation of the new emission norms.         
	From April, 13 cities are scheduled to come under Bharat Stage IV norms, while the rest of the country will upgrade to Bharat Stage III.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had announced a 2 per cent hike in the excise duty on the prices of large cars, sports- and multi-utility vehicles in the budget.         
	He has raised customs duty on petrol and diesel to 7.5 per cent from 2.5 per cent. Excise duty has been raised by Re 1 a litre to Rs 14.35 and Rs 4.60 per litre on non-branded petrol and diesel, respectively.        
	Maruti increased the prices of its models in the range of Rs 3,000-13,000, while Korean rival Hyundai raised prices between Rs 6,500 and Rs 25,000 on an average.         
	M amp;M, too, raised prices from Rs 2,500 for three-wheelers to Rs 18,000 for the top end version of sports-utility vehicle Scorpio.

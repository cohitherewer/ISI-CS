                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Reliance gears up to raise $1bn via bonds
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Cash chase                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 5: Reliance Industries is set to raise around $1 billion in dollar-denominated bonds.         
	The proceeds from the issue will be used to refinance loans taken by the company for acquiring shale gas assets and general corporate purposes.         
	Observers are of the view that Reliance will get a good response to its flotation given the strong demand for bonds and the robust potential of the Indian economy.         
	The oil giant is not the only one looking to raise resources overseas through a bond issue. ICICI Bank  the countrys largest private bank  is also understood to be considering a $1-billion issue for which it has supposedly engaged three banks.         
	Sources said Reliance Holding USA, Inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL  has mandated Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland as book-runners and lead managers for the proposed 10-year and 30-year offerings.         
	The issue is also guaranteed by RIL.         
	The transaction is expected to be launched following a roadshow commencing on October 6.         
	RIL has bought three shale gas assets in the US this year.         
	In August, it took a 60 per cent stake in an acreage held by Carrizo Oil amp; Gas, Inc.         
	According to the transaction, Reliance will acquire the stake in Marcellus Shale acreage in Central and Northeast Pennsylvania that is held in a 50-50 joint venture between Carrizo and ACP II Marcellus LLC, an affiliate of Avista Capital Partners.         
	Shale gas is a form of natural gas trapped in sedimentary rocks.         
	In June, Reliance had announced that it would pay $1.3 billion for a 45 per cent stake in US-based Pioneer Natural Resources shale gas assets.         
	Earlier in April, it bought 300,000 acres of shale gas property from US-based Atlas Energy.

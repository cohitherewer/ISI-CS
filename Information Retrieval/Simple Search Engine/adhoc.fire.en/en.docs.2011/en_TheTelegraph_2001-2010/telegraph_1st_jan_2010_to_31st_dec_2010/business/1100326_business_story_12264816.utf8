                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bare-all signal for PSUs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 25: The government today made it mandatory for all central public sector units to follow disclosure and accounting norms as part of a corporate governance code introduced on a voluntary basis in 2007.         
	The move is aimed at ensuring transparency. The guidelines have now been made mandatory and are applicable to all PSUs, an official statement said after the cabinet meeting today.        
	All the 246 PSUs will now have to follow the norms on composition of boards, formation and role of audit committees, functioning of subsidiaries, disclosures, code of conduct and ethics, risk management and reporting.        
	The guidelines come at a time the corporate world is concerned over the recent instances of frauds and financial lapses such as the Satyam scam.        
	The guidelines have been improved in the wake of the experiences gained during the one year experimental phase. There are additional provisions with regard to monitoring of the compliance of norms by the firms and the formation of a remuneration committee.        
	The department of public enterprises said the implementation of the guidelines would facilitate shareholder interest and ensure transparency in operations.        
	According to analysts, the move indicates the governments intent to encourage PSUs to enter the capital market. The decision to make these norms binding on the state-owned units, both listed and unlisted, indicate the governments efforts to bring in accountability in the working of the PSUs and prepare the ground for the sale of stakes in firms.         
	Officials said the implementation of the norms could signal the end of the stranglehold of administrative ministries on the PSUs.         
	The government has set a divestment target of Rs 40,000 crore in fiscal 2010-11.         
	It has decided that all listed profitable PSUs should have a public holding of at least 10 per cent, and all profitable unlisted PSUs should be listed.

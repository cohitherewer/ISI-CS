          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Demand drive                                  
	New Delhi, April 4: Foreign car makers are planning to buy more components from India because of cheaper costs here.        
	Germanys BMW, Japans Nissan and UKs Jaguar Land Rover are among those relying on India as they seek ways to keep their models competitive, globally, in the wake of recession.        
	BMW, which sources components such as gears, castings and assembly parts for its bikes, will buy more parts for its cars over the next two years.         
	This will be done through its purchasing office in the country, Klaus Draeger, member of the board of management of the German company, had said recently.         
	While BMW has not divulged the value of its planned purchases from India, rivals such as Americas General Motors and Ford, Italys Fiat and Germanys Volkswagen are sourcing components worth around $1 billion (around Rs 4,600 crore) each.         
	The decision to outsource more from emerging markets is in line with companies cutting costs in the wake of a slump in demand last year, said auto analyst Murad Ali Baig.        
	According to the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (Acma), the industry is expected to draw more than half of its turnover from exports by 2016. At present, the turnover stands at around $20 billion.        
	Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has set up an office in Pune, said Rajiv Dube, president (passenger car business), of Tata Motors. The move is part of its plan to cut costs and increase profits.        
	There is a significant saving on components sourced from India compared with component manufactured in the developed markets, said Abdul Majeed, leader of the automotive practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers.        
	Nissan Motors, too, is planning to make India a sourcing hub for its plants in east and Southeast Asia.        
	Kiminobu Tokuyama, managing director and CEO of Nissan Motors India, recently said, India will be the export hub for components for our plants in Taiwan, Thailand and Japan.         
	The company is planning to source $10 million worth of parts from India in 2010, which will be scaled up to $20 million by 2011 and $40 million by 2012.         
	We have appointed 97 suppliers across India, some of whose products will be exported to overseas plants, Tokuyama said.         
	Among the parts Nissan is planning to buy are engine pistols, clutch discs and starter motors.

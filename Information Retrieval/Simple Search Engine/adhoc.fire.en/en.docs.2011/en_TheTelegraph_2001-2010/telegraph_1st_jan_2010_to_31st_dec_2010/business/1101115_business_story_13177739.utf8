                              Hu Jintao in Yokohama on Sunday. (AFP)                            
	Yokohama, Japan, Nov. 14 (Reuters): Asia-Pacific leaders agreed to start establishing a free trade area in the worlds fastest growing region with China warning that global economic recovery was far from certain and protectionism was rising.        
	The weekend summit followed hot on the heels of a meeting of the leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) advanced and emerging countries whose vague agreement gave little sense of a united approach to preventing further economic crises.        
	As a result of the concerted action of the international community, the world economy is slowly recovering. Yet the recovery is neither firmly established nor balanced, and there exist significant uncertainties, Chinese President Hu Jintao told leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec).        
	He said protectionism had risen notably, adding, We should emphasise sustainable growth, which includes not only resource and environmental sustainability but also sustainability of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial policies, and the reduction of macroeconomic volatility and risks.        
	In a statement at the end of the Apec summit, leaders agreed to refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies.         
	They also agreed to start work on a vast regional free trade area linking the worlds three biggest economies  the United States, China and Japan  with some of the worlds fastest-growing economies who together account for over 40 per cent of global trade.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 7: Shares of Biocon today surged on the stock exchanges on reports that the Bangalore-based biotechnology firm was planning to outlicense its oral insulin drug, which is currently being tested, to Pfizer Inc.        
	On the BSE, the Biocon scrip hit a yearly high of Rs 412 in intra-day trade after opening at Rs 380.65. The stock closed at Rs 402.25, a gain of Rs 21.60 (or 5.67 per cent) over the previous close. The oral insulin drug is used for the treatment of Type II diabetes.         
	Reports say the deal with Pfizer may fetch Biocon an upfront fee of $200 million. Although the Bangalore-based company is yet to provide data details of the drug called IN-105, which is in the last phase of clinical trials, analysts are upbeat about its prospects.        
	People with diabetes need to take insulin that is normally delivered through injections. Several companies are now engaged in the process of developing an oral drug. Biocon is likely to be the first company that will come out with an insulin pill.        
	Biocon, while declaring the first-quarter results for the current fiscal, had disclosed in July that it planned to commercialise the molecule through a global partner.         
	Chairman and MD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw had then said the company would start licensing discussions by the end of this year when it would have comprehensive data from the clinical trials. She had also indicated that the drug was likely to be launched in India in the next calendar year.

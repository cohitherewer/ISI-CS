The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gujarat NRE Mineral to go public
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Gujarat NRE Mineral to go public

	Calcutta, Sept. 10: Arun Kumar Jagatramka is taking Gujarat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd, the promoter entity in listed Gujarat NRE Coke Ltd, to the public.        
	Jagatramka, the chairman and managing director of Gujarat NRE Coke, today said a draft red herring prospectus would be filed with market regulator Sebi within a month. We are looking at a 25 per cent dilution, he said after the annual general meeting of Gujarat NRE Coke in Calcutta today.         
	The Jagatramka family owns 90 per cent in the unlisted entity, which in turn holds 33.47 per cent in Gujarat NRE Coke. Moreover, Gujarat NRE Mineral has an oil and gas exploration block in Australia and a coke oven plant.         
	Jagatramka said the move was aimed at guarding Gujarat NRE Coke  Indias largest low ash metallurgical coke producer and coking coal miner in Australia  against takeovers.        
	The promoter will use the cash raised from the IPO to scale up holding in Gujarat NRE Coke to over 51 per cent. At the same time, Jagatramkas stake in the holding company will also be comfortable at 65 per cent.        
	Effectively, I will have majority in both companies. So, all takeover threats can be warded off, he said.        
	However, this could be more of a psychological advantage. For instance, dilution of 25 per cent in holding company Gujarat NRE Mineral will effectively bring down Jagatramkas proportionate stake to 34.89 per cent in Gujarat NRE Coke from 46.66 per cent now.         
	Another reason for the listing of the parent company is to give the small shareholders of Gujarat NRE Mineral an opportunity to trade.        
	A few years back, the promoters of Gujarat NRE Coke had made a private placement of shares of Gujarat NRE Mineral to its existing shareholders. Many retail shareholders had then put the money in the unlisted entity. The management had promised to list that company at an appropriate time later.        
	Australia plan        
	Gujarat NRE Coke plans to raise production in Australia to 6 million tonnes by 2014 and invest $400 million.        
	Its Australian subsidiary  Gujarat NRE Coking Coal Ltd  owns and operates two mines in Australia with combined coal resources of over 560 million tonnes.        
	The company has invested $100 million so far and another $100 million was approved last week to increase production.

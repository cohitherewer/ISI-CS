	Calcutta, March 18: State-run United Bank of India today made an impressive debut on stock exchanges to close 4 per cent higher over its issue price.        
	The shares listed at Rs 77 on the Bombay Stock Exchange and closed at Rs 68.80 over its issue price of Rs 66.        
	On the National Stock Exchange, the scrip got listed at Rs 74.90 and finally settled at Rs 68.75.        
	Retail investors gained more as they got the UBI shares at Rs 63 apiece. UBIs performance shows that new offers will do well if they are priced conservatively.        
	A total of 8.34 crore UBI shares were traded on the bourses.        
	Last month, the maiden offer of the UBI got a good response with the issue getting subscribed nearly 33 times.        
	The government divested a 15.8 per cent stake in the bank through the initial share sale. It holds an 84.2 per cent stake in the bank at present.

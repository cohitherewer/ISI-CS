          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                 Bhatt: Rate watch		      
	Mumbai, March 5: SBI chairman .P. Bhatt today said interest rates were unlikely to go up significantly, at least till May, and that the bank would take a call on its special home loan scheme before the end of this month.         
	Only yesterday, private sector banks ICICI, Kotak Mahindra and HDFC Bank raised auto loans by 25-50 basis points.         
	HDFC  the countrys largest provider of home finance  has discontinued its special loan scheme that was announced in December. ICICI Bank also did the same.         
	After a meeting with the central bank on base rate here today, Bhatt said interest rates were unlikely to move up till May and that they would remain stable.         
	Bhatt had earlier also said that the rates would remain stable as there was plenty of liquidity in the system.         
	On the banks special home loan scheme, he said the SBI would review it before the end this month. Under the scheme, loans up to Rs 5 lakh have a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent for five years.         
	For home loans between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 50 lakh, a fixed rate of 8 per cent is applicable for the first year and 8.5 per cent during the second and third years.        
	Meanwhile, the bank is likely to continue its hiring spree in the next fiscal as it plans to recruit around 15,000-20,000 people in 2010-11, Bhatt had said last month.         
	We have recruited 25,000 employees this year. Next year also, it would be somewhere around this number...we may recruit around 15,000-20,000 people. In 2008-09, the bank had recruited 27,000 staff.

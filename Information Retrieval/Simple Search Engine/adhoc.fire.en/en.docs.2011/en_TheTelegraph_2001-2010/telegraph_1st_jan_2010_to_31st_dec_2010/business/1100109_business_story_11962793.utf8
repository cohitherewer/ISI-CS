The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Move to rein in prices of steel, sugar
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Move to rein in prices of steel, sugar
          OUR BUREAU                          Dear, dear                                
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Centre today put a virtual cap on sugar exports and allowed unrestricted steel imports to arrest their spiralling prices.        
	It is also exploring ways of processing imported raw sugar lying at the ports following Uttar Pradeshs move to ban its processing in the state.        
	The government gave 15 more months to sugar millers to meet their export obligations in its bid to rein in the prices which had more than doubled since last January and touched Rs 45 in the retail markets.        
	The government has given the millers time till March 31, 2011 to meet their re-export obligations of around one million tonne sugar against raw sugar imported between September 2004 and April 2008 under the advance licence scheme. The obligation was to be met by December-end. The step is expected to augment domestic supply.         
	The food ministry said it was exploring ways to process imported raw sugar that was lying at the ports because of the ban imposed by Uttar Pradesh.         
	We are looking at what could be done to process the raw sugar lying at various ports, a ministry official said, adding it might relax import norms so that processing could take place in some other states.        
	As a second option, the sugar millers can also discharge their obligation by paying customs duty for the sugar imported between September 2004 and April 2008, the directorate general of foreign trade said.        
	In steel, which has also seen a 10-15 per cent jump in prices in the past 45 days, the Centre today allowed unrestricted imports of hot-rolled steel, mainly used by auto and consumer durables industries, which were planning to raise prices to offset rising raw material costs.

	New Delhi, Feb. 22: President Pratibha Patil today said India would return to the high-growth days enjoyed prior to the slowdown and invited the common man to participate in the governments mammoth divestment programme.        
	In an address to both Houses of Parliament on the opening day of the budget session, Patil said the government would aim for growth of 8 per cent in the next fiscal year and 9 per cent in 2011-12  the rate at which the economy was growing before the global financial crisis and the resultant slowdown of the Indian economy.         
	The economy during the current fiscal was expected to grow 7.5 per cent, slightly more than what has been projected by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) earlier this month. The economy had grown 6.7 per cent a year ago.        
	Patil attributed the economic recovery to the stimulus provided by the government.        
	The President said all profitable PSUs would sell at least 10 per cent of their equity to the public. For providing the common man an opportunity to share in the growth of the central public sector enterprises, the government has decided to list profitable companies on the stock exchanges through a public offer of at least 10 per cent of the equity.         
	Funds from the divestment would help the government to meet its huge fiscal deficit, which is estimated at Rs 400,000 crore for this fiscal.        
	Until now, the UPA government in its second term has listed two energy PSUs  NHPC and Oil India.        
	Along with these two firms, the government has offloaded more stakes in NTPC, while the Rural Electrification Corporation issue is open for subscription till tomorrow.         
	A study by industry association Assocham said the government would be able to mop up Rs 3,00,000 crore through divestment.         
	Patil, however, was silent on the industrys key concern  the withdrawal of stimulus measures.         
	With the economy showing signs of recovery and industry growing 16.8 per cent in December, the government is under pressure to roll back the fiscal stimulus measures.         
	Analysts expect finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to announce the expiry of some of the emergency measures in his budget speech as he looks to cut the fiscal deficit.

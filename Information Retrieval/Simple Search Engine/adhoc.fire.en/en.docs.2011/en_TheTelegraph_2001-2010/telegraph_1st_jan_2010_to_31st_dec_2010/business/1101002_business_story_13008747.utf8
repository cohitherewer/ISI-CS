The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel minister sold on wagon joint ventures
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Steel minister sold on wagon joint ventures
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Singh: Weighing options                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: Steel minister Virbhadra Singh wants to double the capacity of the new joint venture wagon plant at Kulti to nearly 3,000 wagons a year and may consider opening up more such wagon plants.        
	I am in favour of increasing, if need be doubling, the capacity of the Kulti plant from the current 1,400 wagons, Singh told the The Telegraph.         
	The Kulti plant is a 50:50 joint venture between SAIL and the Indian Railways, which is expected to use specialised steel from SAIL.        
	We have enough land, capital, power, water at Kulti and are willing to expand the factory as we know the railways will require more wagons as the eastern and western freight corridors are set up, the minister said.         
	The wagon demand in the country is around 25,000 units annually.        
	The name of the game now is market dominance and value addition. Both are assured by such downstream activities, said steel ministry officials. SAIL gets about 37 per cent of its revenues from value-added steel and wants to increase the share of such specialised steel.        
	Sources say Singh is not only keen to help SAIL but also wants to ensure the Congress-Trinamul alliance has some big projects to show before the 2011 elections in Bengal.         
	Singh is known to be close to finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and is trying to build bridges with railway minister Mamata Banerjee. According to sources, steel ministry officials had toyed with the idea of appointing Mukherjees son Abhijit, a general manager with SAIL, as head of the joint venture but this might not happen as a railway official was likely to head it.         
	The original capital expenditure planned for the wagon plant was Rs 205 crore, which will be considerably increased if the capacity is doubled to 2,800 wagons a year.

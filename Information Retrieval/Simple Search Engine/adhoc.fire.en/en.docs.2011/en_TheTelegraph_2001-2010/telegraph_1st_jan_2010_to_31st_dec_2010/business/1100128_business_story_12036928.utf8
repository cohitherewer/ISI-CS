The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL profit surges 99%
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SAIL profit surges 99%
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Roongta: Cheerful                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: Steel Authority of India Ltd has posted a 98.6 per cent rise in net profit during the third quarter ended December and is upbeat on the future on the back of increased demand from auto and construction.         
	There is generally good demand. We expect to improve our production and sales during the current quarter, SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said.        
	Net profit rose to Rs 1,675.55 crore during the third quarter from Rs 843.34 crore a year ago. Total income grew 12.3 per cent to Rs 9,878.68 crore from Rs 8,792.72 crore. However, the figures are not strictly comparable with those of the year-ago period because of the merger of Bharat Refractories with the company.         
	Apart from the lower cost of imported coal and growth in sales, other factors contributing to the doubling of profit were rise in the production of value-added steel by 25 per cent, improved techno-economic parameters and cost-efficiency measures, the company said. Steel firms have hiked prices in the past two months, especially for flat products, but prices are still lower than in 2008.

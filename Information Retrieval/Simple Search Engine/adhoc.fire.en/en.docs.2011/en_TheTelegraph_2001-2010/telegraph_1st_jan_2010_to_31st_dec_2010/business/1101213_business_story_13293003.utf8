          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                           Cash quandary                                   
	Calcutta, Dec. 12: A stunted debt market could severely dent the governments plans to attain high growth rates in the future, according to investment bankers.         
	A high level of infrastructure growth is a prerequisite for an 8-9 per cent GDP (gross domestic product) growth. The government had envisaged core investment of $250 billion in the Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-07), $500 billion in the 11th plan (2007-2012) and $1 trillion in the 12th plan (2012-2017). A part of the investments envisaged in the 10th and 11th plans has materialised. What you need is a right mix of equity and debt capital, said Sunil Sanghai, managing director (global banking) of HSBC in India.         
	Sanghai, the former joint head of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, said the availability of equity capital was not a problem. Projects need debt capital, too. There is no shortage of funds, but you need the right kind of mix, he said.         
	Arranging debt capital is increasingly becoming a problem for entrepreneurs. The biggest difficulty that we as investment bankers are experiencing in financial closures is for debt capital, said Utsav Parekh, executive chairman, SMIF Capital Markets.         
	The shallow corporate bond market is a cause for concern, he said, adding that it may hit the countrys GDP growth.         
	While the equity market capitalisation at $1.55 trillion exceeds the countrys $1.2 trillion GDP, corporate bond market accounts for only 3.9 per cent of GDP.         
	Simply looking at a debt-equity mix of 2:1 for any project, the debt market should be at least twice the size of the equity market. In developed countries, debt markets are four times larger than equity markets, Parekh said.         
	In our country, the government bond market accounts for 32.1 per cent of GDP. As such, around 92 per cent of all corporate debt capital come from private placement.         
	The debt-equity ratio is much higher for infrastructure firms at 3:1 or 4:1. Besides, core projects need long-term debt capital, for 10 years and more, Parekh said.         
	In the absence of a developed corporate bond market, banks are the prime source of debt. But the demand for bank loans is far greater than what they can provide.         
	Parekh said banks were hesitant in lending to new customers. They prefer to lend to big, established companies with a high degree of creditworthiness rather than small and new firms. Bank credit stands at Rs 36.6 lakh crore.

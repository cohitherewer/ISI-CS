	Calcutta, Dec. 17: Sony India, a leading consumer electronics manufacturer, is targeting a 40 per cent market share in the camera market by the end of the next financial year.

	The total camera market is pegged at Rs 1,750 crore in this fiscal and is growing at 30 per cent per annum.        
	Nayyar also said the company would spend Rs 350 crore on advertisement, which would help it achieve a sales target of Rs 5,700 crore in this fiscal.        
	We are aggressively campaigning and last year our advertisement spend was Rs 250 crore, which will be Rs 350 crore this year, Nayyar said.

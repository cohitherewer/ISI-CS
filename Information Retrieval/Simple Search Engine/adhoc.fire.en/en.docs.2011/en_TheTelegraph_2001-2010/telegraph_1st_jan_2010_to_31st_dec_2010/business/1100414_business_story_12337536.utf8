The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi twist to Ulip tiff
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sebi twist to Ulip tiff
  - New schemes need regulators nod         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, April 13: The Securities and Exchange Board of India  the capital market regulator  dropped another bombshell this evening when it directed insurers to seek its approval before launching any new unit-linked insurance plan (Ulip) after April 9.        
	The order appeared to make a mockery of a finance ministry-brokered truce yesterday between Sebi and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).        
	The two warring regulators were supposed to go jointly before a court of law seeking a binding ruling on an open-ended question: who will regulate Ulips?         
	The late evening development capped another controversy that finance minister Pranab Mukherjee ignited earlier in the day when he said that no financial scheme ought to charge an entry and exit fees from investors.        
	I believe India could set global standards by following a no-load plus fee model for the entire financial sector to ensure a fair deal for all market participants. I hope all financial regulators will work towards this goal, Mukherjee added.        
	Issuers of Ulips usually charge a load  or commission in common parlance  to pay their agents who hawk the policies and it was evident that the finance ministers comment was targeted at the insurers.        
	Mutuals funds were forced to scrap entry loads last August. MFs usually do not charge any exit load either if investors park their money in the scheme for more than 12 months.        
	Status quo remains        
	Sebi officials defended todays order, saying it had not changed the status quo as had been agreed at Mondays meeting in the capital between finance ministry officials and the two regulators, Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave and IRDA chief J. Hari Narayan.        
	Sources said that once the capital market regulator passed an order  as it did on April 9 when it barred 14 of 23 life insurers from launching Ulip products without seeking its approval  it cannot withdraw it. It can only issue a clarification as it has done now.        
	They said Sebi had clarified in its latest order that the Ulip schemes launched before April 9 would not be affected and it would be business as usual. This meant that investors could continue to pay their premia and renew their policies.        
	Finance ministry officials agreed with this view. You have to realise that Sebi is only a quasi-judicial authority and cannot take back past orders. It can only amend them, said one North Block official. We see the latest Sebi order as just an amendment to the earlier order on Ulips.        
	The courts of law will decide on the issue of regulating Ulips. No insurer would have brought out any new schemes until the courts have clarified on the regulatory question. In that sense, Sebis order today really has no meaning, they added.        
	Not everybody thought so, believing that the latest order vitiates the atmosphere before a joint approach by the two regulators to a court of law.        
	It only adds fuel to the fire, said Ernst amp; Youngs insurance and mutual fund analyst Anish Thacker. The Sebi order has reopened the whole controversy of who will regulate issuers of Ulips. Both sides have legal opinion to support their viewpoints.        
	Sebi and the IRDA have been at loggerheads over the regulation of Ulips  a product that mimics the features of a mutual fund and invests a large chunk of its corpus in the capital market but distinguishes itself with the offer of a life risk cover.         
	Ulips have been around for close to a decade and have always been regulated by the IRDA.        
	Sebi started pawing the ground and demanding oversight over the product only in the last few months.         
	The insurers targeted by Sebi are Aegon Religare, Aviva, Bajaj Allianz, Bharti AXA, Birla SunLife, HDFC Standard, ICICI Prudential, ING Vyasa, Kotak Mahindra, Max New York, Metlife India, Reliance Life, SBI Life Insurance and Tata AIG.        
	About 7.03 crore Ulip policies involving a total premium of Rs 90,645 crore were in force in 2008-09. As many as 16.7 lakh policies were sold with a premium of Rs 44,611 crore during April-February 2009-10.

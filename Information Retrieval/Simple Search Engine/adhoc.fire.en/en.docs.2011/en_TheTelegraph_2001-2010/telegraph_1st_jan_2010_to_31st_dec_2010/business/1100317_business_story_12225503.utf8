                              Meena: Clearing the air                            
	New Delhi, March 16 (PTI): The government today said there was no proposal for the merger of any nationalised bank with the State Bank of India apart from the possibility of a merger involving the State Bank of Indore.        
	Although at present there is no proposal before the government for the merger of any nationalised bank with the SBI, the State Bank of Saurashtra, an associate bank of the SBI, was merged with it during 2008, minister of state for finance Namo Narain Meena told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply.        
	The government has allowed the SBI to undertake negotiations to bring the State Bank of Indore into its fold.         
	The SBI had submitted a proposal to acquire its Indore associate and had sought permission to enter into negotiations with the latter under Section 35 (1) of State Bank of India Act 1955, he said.        
	Meena said the government was of the view that the initiative for consolidating public sector banks should come from the management.

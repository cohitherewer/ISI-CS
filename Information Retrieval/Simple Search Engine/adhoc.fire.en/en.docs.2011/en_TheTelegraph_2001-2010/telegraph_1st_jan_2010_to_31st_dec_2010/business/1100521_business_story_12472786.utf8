          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, May 20: The countrys first Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs), which will be launched by the UK-based Standard Chartered Plc on May 25, can be priced between Rs 100 and Rs 105 apiece. Ten IDRs will represent one share of the bank, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange.         
	The price of the IDR will be announced on May 24 and it will be determined on the basis of StanCharts share price on the London Stock Exchange. We are keeping a close watch on Fridays closing price on the LSE. The price band will be fixed at a discount to this share price, said Neeraj Swaroop, StanCharts chief executive officer for India and South Asia.        
	The StanChart share closed at 16.52 on Wednesday and was trading 1.54 per cent lower on Thursday at 16.26.         
	Given the RBIs foreign exchange reference rate for the pound at Rs 67, StanCharts share price in rupees works out to Rs 1,089.42.         
	If the bank offered IDRs at a discount of 4-8 per cent to its share price, the price band could be in the range of Rs 100 to 105 per IDR (since 10 IDRs make one share).

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Raja in New Delhi   on Monday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, April 19: Telecom minister A. Raja today said the government did not suffer any loss when new licences were issued in 2008.        
	The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had earlier alleged that Raja caused a loss of over Rs 26,000 crore to the government by disregarding the advice of many experts and persisting with a faulty and outdated policy for issuing new telecom licences.        
	2G spectrum is only allotted to the unified access services licensees under the service licensing conditions, subject to availability of spectrum, Raja told the Lok Sabha in a written reply today, adding that the government had not incurred any losses because of his decisions.        
	The CAG had noted that Raja issued new pan-India licences in 2008 at a price of Rs 1,651 crore, which was fixed in 2001 when the mobile subscriber base was 45 million.         
	Moreover, the department of telecom advanced the cut-off date suddenly and then incorporated a first-come, first-served clause, which could have helped some bidders.         
	Some months later, Swan Telecom and Unitech, two of the winners, sold large stakes in their operations to overseas companies at high valuations.        
	The auditor added that many experts had suggested to the DoT that the award of the licences should be re- examined as the entry fee had not been revised since 2001. The 2001 fee was based on criteria that did not exist in 2008. The industry had grown bigger and the subscriber base had soared to over 300 million from 45 million.        
	The CAG is a constitutional authority and audits all government departments and public sector enterprises every year.

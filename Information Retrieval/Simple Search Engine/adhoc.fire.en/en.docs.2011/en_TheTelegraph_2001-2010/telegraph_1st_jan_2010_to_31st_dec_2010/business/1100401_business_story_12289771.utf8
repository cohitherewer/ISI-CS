                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata Motors to roll out Aria 
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                              
	New Delhi, March 31: Tata Motors will launch its seven-seater crossover vehicle Aria in the first quarter of fiscal 2010-11. The company also plans to export the vehicle, but not immediately.        
	The Aria is a cross among a sports utility vehicle (SUV), a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) and a car.        
	It will have a 2.2-litre direct injection common rail diesel engine. It is likely to carry a price tag between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 14.5 lakh.         
	The Aria should be launched most likely in May or June. We are going according to our plans. As for exporting it, we will make all our cars available outside the country depending on their need or relevance, a senior Tata Motor official told The Telegraph.        
	Conceived as a global model, sources say, the Aria will later be sold in the US, the UK and Europe.        
	The model will compete with the Toyota Fortuner, Ford Endeavour and Chevrolet Captiva and is expected to come in three variants. All variants will be available in four-wheel and two-wheel drive options.         
	The crossover blends the functionality and comfort of a mid-range MPV with the all-terrain assurance and premiumness of an SUV, the official said.        
	The company is looking at filling the gap across the value chain, said auto analyst Murad Ali Baig adding with Aria, the company is targeting the high-end SUV market.

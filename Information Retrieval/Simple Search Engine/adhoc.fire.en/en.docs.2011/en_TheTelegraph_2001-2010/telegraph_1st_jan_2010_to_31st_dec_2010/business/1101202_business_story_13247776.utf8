	 Lucknow, Dec. 1: Subrata Roy and his Sahara group have been granted interim protection against any coercive action by market regulator Sebi. A division bench of Allahabad High Court assailed Sebis November 24 order that barred Roy and his group from raising money from the capital market for failing to disclose preferential bond issuances by two unlisted Sahara group companies. Justice D.P. Singh and V.K. Dixit have reserved delivery of their order and slapped the restraint on Sebi. Sahara had challenged the jurisdiction of Sebi arguing that unlisted companies came under the fief of the ministry of corporate affairs  a view that the market regulator had refused to accept. Earlier, the Sahara group had approached the ministry of corporate affairs to clarify its stand on the dispute. It had also requested Sebi to wait for the ministrys clarification.

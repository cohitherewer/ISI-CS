The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mixed mood ahead of first-quarter results 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mixed mood ahead of first-quarter results 
  - With earnings season kicking off next week, a few good numbers can work wonders for the sensex         OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Mumbai, July 7: As India Inc knuckles down for another earnings season, the prognosis for the first quarter doesnt look terribly great: sales will be robust during the April-June quarter, but net profits are expected to come under pressure because of rising input costs.        
	The first quarter earnings season kicks off on Tuesday when infotech giant Infosys unveils its results.        
	The good news is that there is growing optimism that India Inc will deliver some knock-out earnings later this year which could once again propel the bellwether sensex to the stratospheric heights that were seen in mid-January 2008.        
	Brokerage Angel Broking says: We expect the sensex to touch 21000 levels (an upside of 20 per cent) by March 2011, based on a target P/E of 17 times the estimated EPS for financial year 2012.        
	Motilal Oswal is a little more circumspect. We expect the sensex universe to report sales growth of 28 per cent, EBIDTA growth of 21 per cent and PAT growth of 19 per cent (in the first quarter ended June 30). The growth rates in sensex universe earnings are expected to improve over the next three quarters with average growth of 22 per cent. The EPS growth will be even higher because of the higher weightage of the growth stocks, the brokerage says in its report on the earnings preview for the first quarter of 2010-11.                  
	The brokerage says the Indian markets had a lacklustre first half 2010, rising just 1-2 per cent. However, just like the ongoing football World Cup, Indian equities could throw up a few surprises in the second half of the year. How the second half plays out for India depends on the interplay of 11 different forces that we have identified and lined up like a typical football team, says Motilal Oswal (see chart alongside).        
	In the first quarter, Motilal Oswal says its universe of 124 companies will see earnings growth of 17 per cent, which is a moderation from the second half of the previous year when earnings grew 31 per cent.        
	The sectors that will do well in the quarter are metals (the eight stocks it tracks will see aggregate net profit rise by 461.4 per cent), textiles (up 126 per cent), retail (up 81 per cent), pharmaceuticals (up 30 per cent) and automobiles (also growing 30 per cent).        
	The brokerage says seven metals stocks  Tata Steel, Hindalco, JSW Steel, Sesa Goa, Nalco, Sterlite and Hindustan Zinc  will show earnings growth in excess of 15 per cent. SAIL will be a laggard with a negative earnings growth. Raymond, Vardhman Textiles and Bombay Rayon will show above 15 per cent growth in earnings, while Arvind Mills is expected to show negative growth in earnings within the textiles pack.        
	In the automobiles segment, Motilal Oswal says Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra and Mahindra will show earnings growth of over 15 per cent. Hero Honda, however, will show moderate growth.        
	Angel Broking reckons that the sensex companies will see net sales rise 19.7 per cent year-on-year, but net profit will remain flat. It says that higher input costs will restrict operating profit growth to 8.8 per cent. Thus, the operating profit margins will decline 285 basis points to end the period at 28.4 per cent.        
	Sectorally, the report says metals, financials and infotech will deliver robust numbers in the first quarter. The metals pack will make a significant contribution to the overall earnings growth of the sensex. If you leave out the metals group, the sensex pack will see net profit decline 6.6 per cent.        
	The FMCG firms are also expected to deliver a good set of numbers. The heavyweights will deliver 14 per cent year-on-year growth largely led by ITC, it adds.        
	The key under-performing sectors will be oil and gas, telecom, power and engineering in the first quarter, says Angel Broking. Oil and gas  one of the largest components of the sensex  will register a de-growth of 35 per cent during the quarter. The big downside in this sector will be shown by ONGC. However, RIL is expected to post a 34 per cent growth in net profits in the first quarter.        
	Motilal Oswal reckons that banks will register an earnings growth of 16 per cent year-on-year. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Canara Bank will report over 30 per cent growth in earnings, while ICICI Bank and PNB will see at least 25 per cent growth. Industry leader SBI is expected to see a 6 per cent growth, while Bank of India will report an earnings decline of 26 per cent year-on-year.        
	Sun Pharma  which was taken out of the sensex in May  is expected to show an earnings growth of 183 per cent. Ranbaxy is also expected to post a 100 per cent growth. Cipla, which replaced Sun in the sensex, will see just 12 per cent growth, driving down the growth in the entire pharma pack, says the brokerage.

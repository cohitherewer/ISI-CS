The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Twist to CSB tussle
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Twist to CSB tussle
                            
	Mumbai/Thrissur, Dec. 14 (PTI): After one-and-a-half decade of rivalry and public sparring, the Catholic church in Kerala has said it is giving up its efforts to wrest control of the Catholic Syrian Bank (CSB), which has many of its community members as shareholders.        
	It, however, vowed to resist any move to shift the headquarters out of Thrissur, or renaming the lender. Neither the Archdiocese of Thrissur, nor the CSB protection committee or the Catholic community have any enmity towards the bank now. The bank is running well under the stewardship of V.P. Iswardas (managing director and CEO), Archdiocese of Thrissurs auxiliary bishop, Mar Raphael Thattill, said.        
	On the change in stance, he said, The Archdiocese is not in a position to put up a fight to control the bank. The shares held by the Catholic community and the church together are now under 10 per cent.        
	He said the church was happy to co-operate with the management for the banks progress. However, If the bank attempts to deviate from the objectives of its original promoters like shifting the headquarters out of Thrissur or change its name, we will resist such moves.        
	The CSB protection committee convener Johny Chandy said, We are not pursuing our effort to take over CSB, as we have been unable to buy shares from (Surachan) Chawla (the largest shareholder). However, we will ensure that the bank maintains the spirit of its initial promoters and uphold the interest of the Catholic community.         
	The bank was set up by around 30 Syrian Catholic families of Thrissur in November 1920.        
	S. Santhanakrishan, CSBs non-executive chairman, refused to comment. I am not aware of such a development, as the church has not spoken to us on anything in this regard. One of the directors, S. Antharaman, too, said, he cannot comment, as all directors have been asked not to talk to the media.

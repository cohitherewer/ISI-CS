The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IOC selloff deferred till next fiscal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      IOC selloff deferred till next fiscal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: The government has put off a stake sale in Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) till the next fiscal. This is because a subsidy-sharing formula for state-owned oil retailers, who are selling fuel at a loss, is yet to be in place at a time global crude prices are on the rise.         
	A loss-laden refiner is not expected to fetch a huge premium in the stock market, said officials.         
	The government can go ahead with the divestment plan for ONGC in March, though there are concerns over its valuation coming under pressure if it is asked to bear part of the subsidy burden of the refiners.        
	Officials of the disinvestment ministry said the government would dilute its stake in SAIL in January followed by Power Finance Corporation (PFC) to meet its selloff target of Rs 40,000 crore for this fiscal.        
	We cannot have divestment of two large companies (ONGC and IOC) from the same sector simultaneously, a finance ministry official said.        
	At current price levels, IOC, HPCL and BPCL are projected to lose Rs 68,361 crore. The oil ministry expects the finance ministry to compensate them for at least half of the losses.        
	The finance ministry has committed Rs 13,000 crore of the Rs 31,367 crore the retailers have lost for selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene below cost during the April-September period.        
	Sources said the oil ministry was opposed to the divestment of IOC without a clear road map on subsidy sharing as it would impact its valuation. They expect a greater clarity on the issue by March when the ONGC issue should hit the market.        
	The Centre had planned to offload a 10 per cent stake in IOC and five per cent in ONGC, and the move was expected to generate about Rs 24,000 crore in this financial year.         
	The ONGC issue, approved by the Cabinet, is expected to raise Rs 13,000 crore. After the issue, the governments shareholding in ONGC will come down to 69.14 per cent from 74.14 per cent.        
	The government is, however, hopeful of meeting the divestment target set for this fiscal. We would reach close to the target of Rs 40,000 crore in the current fiscal. Besides the divestment in three companies, we would get some money from the SAIL dividend, the official said.        
	The government has also decided to defer the Rs 4,000-crore Hindustan Copper follow-on offer till next financial year. The stake sale was expected to take place this month.        
	The government had raised Rs 25,000 crore through stake sales in Oil India, NMDC, REC and NTPC in 2009-10.        
	Meanwhile, a crucial meeting of a ministerial panel headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to decide on raising diesel and domestic LPG prices has been postponed amidst growing political opposition to the hike at a time food inflation is in double digits. Official sources said no date for the next meeting had been fixed nor any reason had been given for the postponement.

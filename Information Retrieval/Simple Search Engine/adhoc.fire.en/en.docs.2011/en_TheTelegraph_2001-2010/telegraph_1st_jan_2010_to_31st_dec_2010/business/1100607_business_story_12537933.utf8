          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, June 6: Domestic and international steel companies have trimmed the size of their new projects, bringing down the requirements of land and iron ore deposits to realistic levels.         
	In Karnataka, ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel and Posco have asked for half of the land that they had sought in Jharkhand and Orissa.         
	The three companies  they are among the top 10 steel producers globally  have signed memoranda of understanding with Jharkhand and Orissa 4-5 years back for setting up 6-12-million-tonne (mt) projects. But troubles over land acquisition and delay in mine allocation have put their plans on hold.         
	Mittal wanted around 10,000 acres, both in Jharkhand and Orissa, for his 12mt plant in each of the two states. The requirement of iron ore was learnt to be 600mt each. Tata Steel had sought 3,500 acres for a 6mt plant in Kalinganagar. Its land requirement for a 15mt plant in Jharkhand was 10,000 acres. Posco wanted 4,000 acres for its plant in Orissa.         
	Compared to the mammoth scale of these projects, the proposals made for Karnataka are modest. Posco and Mittal will set up 6mt plants each on 2,000 acres and 4,000 acres, respectively. Tata Steel, through its subsidiary Tata Metaliks, has proposed a 3mt plant covering 2,000 acres.        
	Sudhir Maheshwari, member of the group management board of ArcelorMittal, attributed the move to judicious utilisation of resources.        
	We thought let us not think too big and get stuck at that. It may be good to start small and then build up on it, he said while explaining why Mittal reduced the size of his project in the southern state.        
	The companys project has made some headway in Karnataka after the government gave a final notification for land acquisition. It has already deposited Rs 270 crore for the land.        
	V.P. Baligar, principal secretary of commerce and industry in Karnataka, said the companies had realised the ground reality. But at the same time, we have made them understand. You must know how to talk to these investors. Nowhere it is possible to get tens of thousands of acres of contiguous land in India, Baligar said.        
	The southern state says it will buy arid land for industry and make sure that investors pay double the market price for the land.         
	The Karnataka government is in the process of acquiring 70,000 acres for various industries.         
	Smaller plants also mean less iron ore requirement. A top bureaucrat said steel companies could only hope to get partial allocation of captive ore. They must buy at least one-third of their ore needs from the market.

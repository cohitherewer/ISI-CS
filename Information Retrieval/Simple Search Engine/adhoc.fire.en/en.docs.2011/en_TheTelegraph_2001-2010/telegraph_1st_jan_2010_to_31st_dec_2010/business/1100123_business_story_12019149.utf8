The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Marginal rise in Bharti profit
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Marginal rise in Bharti profit
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Kohli: Upbeat				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: Bharti Airtel today reported a 2.3 per cent growth in net profit for the December quarter, with a fierce price war eating into its margins.        
	Net profit for the October-December period rose to Rs 2,210 crore from Rs 2,159 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Total revenue rose 1.4 per cent to Rs 9,772 crore from Rs 9,633 crore a year ago.        
	Bharti Airtel continues to ensure a robust market share despite the intense competition, said Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and managing director of Bharti Airtel.        
	The New Delhi-based firm said it could consider an initial public offering for one of its tower units  Bharti Infratel or Indus Towers  in the next fiscal after reviewing the current years financial performance.         
	Bharti will also continue to focus on emerging markets because our business model can be implanted well in these economies, said Manoj Kohli, CEO of Bharti Airtel.        
	The recent acquisition of Warid Telecom in Bangladesh is part of the strategy to grow in the emerging markets. The saturation in the domestic market has prompted Bharti to expand overseas. The company is present in Sri Lanka, Seychelles and Jersey, which is off the French coast.         
	Bharti had 125 million customers at the end of December 2009, a growth of 42 per cent from the same period last year. Its average revenue per user was Rs 230, 8.7 per cent lower than Rs 252 in the previous quarter ended September 30 as the tariff war took its toll. New companies are launching aggressive price plans to attract subscribers, forcing existing players to lower tariffs.                                      
	The telcos average minutes of usage per user also fell to 446 in the fiscal third quarter from the second quarters 450.        
	Its quarterly earnings margin before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda), contracted to 40 per cent from 42.1 per cent in the fiscal second quarter, and from 41 per cent in the year earlier period, as low tariffs hurt and the company continued to spend on adding users.              
	Last week, Bharti Airtel had announced the elevation of Sanjay Kapoor as its CEO for India and South Asia, placing him to lead the charge in the increasingly cutthroat domestic mobile market, and moved incumbent Manoj Kohli to a new role spearheading the global expansion of the countrys largest telecom group.

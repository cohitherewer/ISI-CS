          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          REJIG ROUTE                                  
	Mumbai, March 24: Foreign investors looking to pump money into ventures in India will have to brace for changes in the decades-old process of approvals.        
	Investors may have to seek a security clearance from the Union home ministry before applying for investment approvals for projects in sensitive sectors and locations.        
	Until now, the home ministry would raise objections to a sensitive investment only after the proposal came up before the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), which usually sparked a bout of lobbying and serious disagreements between ministries.        
	This is one of the decisions taken at a meeting of secretaries earlier this month that was attended by national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon among others.        
	The home ministry will also review the list of sensitive sectors and may also recommend sensitive locations that would warrant prior background checks of the investors.        
	The secretaries decided that in the case of automatic approvals, the Centre could mandate post-investment surveillance of the sources of cash.        
	Applications that are routed through the FIPB may also have to carry full disclosures on the sources of cash and the antecedents of the foreign investor.        
	These changes are part of a risk management approach for FDI inflows, particularly in certain sensitive areas that the government has been considering for the past four years. It follows a discussion paper by the National Security Council (NSC) secretariat that mooted improving documentation for those approvals permitted under the automatic route. The paper had also suggested certain changes in the mechanisms prevailing both in the automatic and approval route by taking into account emerging risks.         
	The paper had suggested an umbrella legislation that would allow the government to act in cases where national security issues arise.        
	The new approach that the Centre is formulating is expected to not only rectify sector-specific security concerns but also tackle other issues like sources of funding. At the same time, care will be taken to ensure that liberalisation or FDI flow is not impacted.        
	The department of legal affairs has been asked to put in place appropriate legislation that not only enables post-investment surveillance but also gives powers to the government to take action in those cases where there are issues of national security.        
	The proposed changes come just days after the FIPB tightened rules for foreign companies planning to invest in the areas of defence and security services.

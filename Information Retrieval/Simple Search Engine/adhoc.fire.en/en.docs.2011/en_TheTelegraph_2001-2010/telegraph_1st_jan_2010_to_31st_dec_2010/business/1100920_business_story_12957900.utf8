	New Delhi, Sept. 19: ONGC is looking to induct a global firm to replace Statoil and Petrobras, which have exited the state-owned explorers gas-rich block in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin.        
	Global E amp;P (exploration and production) players have reviewed data and given us presentations. They will come up with their final proposals by the end of this month. By early next month we will decide which firm will partner us, a senior ONGC official said.         
	Three oil majors  ExxonMobil, BG Group and Italian oil and gas major ENI  have initiated talks for an equity stake, sources said.         
	We are talking to a lot of people, ONGC chairman and managing director R.S. Sharma said.        
	According to analysts, the interest from ExxonMobil, the largest oil firm in the US, is heartening for local oil and gas exploration and may encourage other big companies to invest.        
	Analysts said global entities generally preferred explored areas over unknown territory.         
	ONGC, which expects production from the block to begin in 2015-16, is keen on a higher price than the $4.20 per million British thermal unit fixed by the ministerial panel for Reliances KG gas.        
	The state-owned firm is looking for a partner to share the risks in developing the acreage, which is estimated to have gas reserves of 14 trillion cubic feet. The company does not have the technology to produce gas from such a water depth.        
	The block now has 10 discoveries. Appraisal drilling will be conducted to assess potential before finalising the development plan.        
	ONGC is planning to invest at least $5.3 billion in developing finds in two of its eastern KG basin blocks. The PSU expects to produce 25 million standard cubic meters per day of gas.        
	After the selection of one or more partners, ONGC will seek the governments approval. ONGC, however, is tight-lipped about the investments of these foreign partners in the basin.        
	Norways Statoil and Brazils Petrobras signed agreements for 10 per cent and 15 per cent stakes, respectively, in 2007. However, a joint operating agreement could not be signed because of delays in approvals.         
	The ONGC block is next to the Reliance Industries prolific KG-D6 fields.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ZTE warns of cost bite in China ban
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ZTE warns of cost bite in China ban
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ghosh: Voicing concern                                  
	New Delhi, June 1: Mobile phone users stand to lose if there is a bar on Chinese telecom equipment, according to ZTE.         
	The Chinese telecom equipment maker said costs of running a network could go up, forcing operators to raise tariffs.         
	If Chinese telecom equipment companies are not allowed to operate in India, the costs will be borne by consumers as the lack of healthy competition in the telecom sector will lead to extra rates for 3G services, said D.K. Ghosh, chairman and managing director of ZTE.         
	Chinese equipment vendors such as ZTE and Huawei sell their products at about 40 per cent cheaper rates than their counterparts in the West.        
	Low equipment cost is one of the reasons that allowed new operators to offer call tariffs at 1 paise per second. Officials said any ban on Chinese equipment would hamper the industrys growth.         
	Operators are already bogged down in low tariffs along with high licence fees and network rollout costs in the highly competitive mobile sector.        
	The government is in discussions to draw a comprehensive policy on the procurement of equipment from foreign vendors.         
	Chinese telecom equipment companies are under government scrutiny over security-related issues. Security analysts argue that security concerns outweigh any arguments about access to cheap equipment.        
	Last week, telecom minister A. Raja met home minister P. Chidambaram to work out policy guidelines, which are likely to include a proposal for self-certification by operators and a lab for the testing of equipment by a third party.        
	The government is also planning to conduct security checks on all Chinese made telecom gear installed in existing networks before allowing fresh imports.        
	Another proposal is the mandatory submission of the equipments software code.        
	The Chinese ambassador recently met officials of the ministry of home affairs on behalf of Huawei and ZTE. Both the vendors have assured compliance with Indian security systems.        
	We fully comprehend and respect the security concerns of the Indian government and strictly adhere to the policies and laws of the country. While discussions and communication with the government are still on, we are sure we will be getting a positive response from the government, said ZTEs Ghosh.

	Calcutta, Aug. 24: P.R.S Oberoi  the 81-year-old chairman and CEO of EIH Ltd  plans to name his successor within a year or two.        
	I would be stupid if I dont, Oberoi told reporters here today after EIH Ltds annual general meeting when he was asked if he was putting a succession plan in place.        
	I am thinking about it all the time. I want to implement it in a year or two, said Oberoi who has headed EIH since 2002 after taking over from his father, the late Rai Bahadur MS Oberoi who founded the group in 1949.        
	EIH owns the eponymous Oberoi and Trident hotel chains.        
	Vikram Oberoi  P.R.S. Oberois son  and nephew Arjun are on the board of EIH Ltd as joint managing directors. One of them is tipped to succeed Oberoi when he decides to retire.        
	Back in 2007, shareholders had given Oberoi a five-year extension as chairman that would end two years from now.        
	The Oberoi family owns around 46 per cent of the Rs 900-crore EIH Ltd. The other major company with the family is EIH Associated Hotels Ltd, where EIH Ltd owns 36 per cent.        
	EIH Ltd owns and manages 20 properties globally, including hotels, resorts and cruises. The firm only manages but does not hold a stake in one hotel and a cruise. EIH Associated Hotels owns and operates all eight of its properties in India.         
	Vikram Oberoi is the managing director of EIH Associated Hotels and PRS the chairman. Arjun Oberoi is not on the board of EIH Associated.        
	Asked if there was a move to make EIH Associated a second powerhouse of the group to help the succession plan, Oberoi said: Nothing is impossible.        
	To make that happen, EIH Ltd and EIH Associated have to be segregated between Arjun and Vikram, who will take independent charge of two separate companies and grow the businesses.        
	S.S. Mukherjee, executive vice-chairman of EIH Ltd, said there was no such plan. EIH and EIH Associated Hotels had not been developed keeping in mind any succession plan.        
	Oberoi said the company was looking to acquire management contracts for properties in London, Paris, New York, Shanghai, Beijing and Bangkok. The company will focus on managing properties rather than investing in them.

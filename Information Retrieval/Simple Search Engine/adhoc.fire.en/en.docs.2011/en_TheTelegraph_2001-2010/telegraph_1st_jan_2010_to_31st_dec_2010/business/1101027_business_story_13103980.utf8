	New Delhi, Oct. 26: Encouraged by the success of the Coal India float, the finance ministry plans to divest stakes in steel maker RINL, metal trader MMTC and Power Finance Corporation.         
	Top officials said the ministry was talking to the PSUs and their administrative ministries.         
	The disinvestment department has already written to RINL to consider listing through the issue of fresh equity.        
	Sources said the disinvestment department had reminded the Vizag-based steel maker that its navratna status would depend on its listing.         
	At present, the government holds 100 per cent in the Vizag-based steel maker. RINL is likely to issue fresh equity of 10 per cent, and the government can piggyback on it by selling a similar stake. However, this is likely to be done only after capital restructuring of the company.         
	RINL joined the navratna club in March, gaining more financial and administrative autonomy. The firm can now take investment decisions for an amount of up to Rs 1,000 crore, without seeking the steel ministrys approval but needs to list within a year to enjoy its freedom.        
	The divestment department, which also plans to sell stakes in SAIL, PowerGrid and Hindustan Copper by the end of this fiscal, wants to dilute its stake in trading firm MMTC through a follow-on offer in the current fiscal.         
	Commerce minister Anand Sharma supports the move which according to sources, could involve the government offloading 10 per cent in the company. MMTC is already listed on the BSE and has been trading up on rumours of a fresh stock sale.        
	Officials said the government was mulling divesting another 10 per cent of its stake in Power Finance Corporation through a follow-on offer by the end of the current fiscal. The power finance firm will also use this opportunity to raise another 10 per cent capital.         
	The government currently holds 89.78 per cent stake in the firm, having divested a 10 per cent stake through an initial public offer three years back.        
	The divestment in Power Finance Corporation (PFC) is part of the governments plan to sell 25 per cent in profit making PSUs in various tranches to comply with regulatory norms.        
	The government is also keen to list PSUs that are not listed on bourses not only to reduce its fiscal deficit but also to bring the benefits of listing to the entities.

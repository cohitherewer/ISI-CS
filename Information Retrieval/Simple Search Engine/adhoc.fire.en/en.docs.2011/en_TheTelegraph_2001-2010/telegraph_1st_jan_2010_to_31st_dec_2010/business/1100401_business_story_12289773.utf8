	New Delhi, March 31: Industrial production recorded a robust 16 per cent year-on-year growth in February, industry secretary R.P. Singh said. Infrastructure growth, however, slipped during the period.        
	Industrial output in January grew 16.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis, while in December it was up by over 16 per cent.         
	Growth of the six key infrastructure sectors slowed to 4.5 per cent in February, down from a robust 9.4 per cent in January.        
	Analysts said a sustained rise in industrial production could prompt the Reserve Bank to move further away from an easy credit policy adopted as part of its monetary stimulus measures during global recession.        
	After the January data, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said, For two consecutive months, there has been high growth. Perhaps, it indicates that the manufacturing sector is going to make a substantial contribution to GDP growth and the economy is on the path of fast recovery.        
	The analysts expect the central bank to raise rates by 50 basis points in the next monetary policy on April 20 to tame inflation.         
	High inflation has the potential to derail growth. Annual wholesale price inflation for February stood at 9.89 per cent.

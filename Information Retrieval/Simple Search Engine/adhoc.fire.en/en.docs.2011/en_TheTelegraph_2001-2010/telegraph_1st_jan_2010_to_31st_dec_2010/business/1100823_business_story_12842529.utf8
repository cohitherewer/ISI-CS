The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt wants BlackBerry server in India
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Govt wants BlackBerry server in India
                          Call interrupted                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 22 (PTI): BlackBerry maker Research In Motion (RIM) should install its server in India to enable the government to track its messenger and enterprise mail services.         
	RIMs plan to provide data from its Canada-based server could be detrimental to national security.        
	Sources said at a meeting with RIM officials, the government conveyed in no uncertain terms that they should deploy their interception server in India with the Indian service provider having a definitive tracking system.        
	Officials of RIM had offered to provide information on a deferred basis after it faced the threat of a shutdown of the core features by August 31. RIM was ready to provide the information initially manually and later through a non-human interface using the cloud computing environment method under which a separate wall created in the server and code and pass-code is handed over to the overall co-ordinator, in this case India.        
	However, the proposal was rejected prima facie as security agencies claimed that handing over telephone numbers for monitoring was fraught with the danger of exposing the source to an outside company, the sources said.        
	Even the automated system of extracting information from a Canada-based server was not free of danger because the information could be hacked midway, the sources said.

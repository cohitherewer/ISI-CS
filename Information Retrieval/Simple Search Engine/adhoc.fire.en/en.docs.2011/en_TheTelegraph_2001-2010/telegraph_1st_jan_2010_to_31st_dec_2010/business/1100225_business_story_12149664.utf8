The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | April date set for 3G spectrum auction
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      April date set for 3G spectrum auction
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Clear signal                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The much-awaited third-generation (3G) spectrum auction will start on April 9.         
	The government will issue the notice inviting applications  a legally binding document providing details on the amount of 3G spectrum, price and payment format  tomorrow.        
	The sale of broadband spectrum will start two days after the 3G auction closes.        
	According to the revised schedule released by the department of telecom today, the last date for the submission of application by the prospective bidders is March 19. Mock auctions will take place on April 5 and 6.        
	Publication of ownership details of applicants would be issued by March 26, while a list of pre-qualified bidders would be provided by March 30, the telecom ministry said.         
	Analysts expect each firm to spend up to $1.5 billion to get a pan-India licence.        
	The government will auction four slots of spectrum in each of the 22 circles, in addition to the one already allotted to state-owned BSNL and MTNL. It has set Rs 3,500 crore as the starting price for each slot. On the other hand, the two slots of broadband spectrum would be put up for sale at a base price of Rs 1,750 crore.        
	3G services were scheduled to be launched in 2007, but problems regarding the vacation of spectrum by the defence forces and the fixing of bid prices caused repeated delays. The delay has been hurting telecom firms, as high-end services could have arrested the fall in their revenues and profits.        
	Indian firms have the lowest average earnings per user globally and the ongoing price war in the voice segment is eating into their revenues and profits.        
	Analysts said in an emerging economy such as India there would be a lot of unexplored possibilities in value-added services after the introduction of 3G, which would result in increased revenues for firms.

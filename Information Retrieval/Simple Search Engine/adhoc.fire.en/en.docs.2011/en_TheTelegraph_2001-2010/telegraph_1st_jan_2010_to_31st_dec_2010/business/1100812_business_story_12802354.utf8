	Calcutta, Aug. 11: Epson India, the local arm of the global printer and imaging products company Seiko Epson, is targeting a more-than-two-fold jump in revenue to Rs 1,000 crore by 2015 from Rs 400 crore in 2009-10.        
	We will increase our focus on solutions rather than just selling products, N. Sambamoorthy, senior general manager (sales and marketing) of Epson India, said here today. The company hopes to report revenue of Rs 500 crore in 2010-11.        
	The company has identified verticals for growth  banking and financial institutions, retail, education and small and medium businesses. It will spend about 15 per cent of revenue in marketing this year.        
	Our last years revenue was close to Rs 400 crore and despite widespread talks of an economic slowdown, Epsons sales grew at about 25 per cent over the previous year, he said.        
	As part of its marketing strategy, the company has initiated a 10-city partner engagement programme in July. Epson aims to reach out to about 3,000 system integrator partners through the nSolution programme.        
	Epson markets scanners, projectors and dot matrix, inkjet and laser printers. Some of the companys latest solutions include projector solutions for schools, retail stores and hotels.        
	In the projector business, Epson is witnessing better growth in the home consumer space.

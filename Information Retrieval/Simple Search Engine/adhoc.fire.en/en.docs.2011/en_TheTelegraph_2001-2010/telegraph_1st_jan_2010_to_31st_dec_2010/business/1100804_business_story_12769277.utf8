          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cash course                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: The government wants Parliaments approval to spend Rs 54,588 crore more than planned in the 2010-11 budget to compensate oil firms for revenue loss and pay for higher subsidies and social schemes.        
	The extra spending, it said, will not lead to the fiscal deficit shooting past the target of 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).         
	Sufficient cushion has come from the recent sale of 3G and wireless broadband spectrum, which fetched the exchequer a massive Rs 1 lakh crore.        
	The net cash outgo of Rs 54,588.63 crore will not have any adverse impact on the fiscal deficit projected in the budget estimate of 2010-11 because of excess receipts under non-tax revenue, the first supplementary demand for grants for 2010-11 in Parliament said.        
	Excess expenditure is actually Rs 68,294.30 crore, but a sum of Rs 13,705.09 crore will be matched by the savings of ministries and departments along with enhanced receipts.         
	Of the additional funds, oil retailers will get Rs 14,000 crore as compensation for selling fuel below market rates; the subsidy for fertilisers is Rs 579 crore.        
	The country also plans to spend Rs 8,467 crore to raise its vote share in the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has received several requests to grant more powers to emerging economic powers such as India, China, Brazil and Russia.        
	Besides, the finance ministry sought Parliaments permission to set aside Rs 7,338 crore for a rural road scheme, Rs 4,000 crore for an education scheme, Rs 2,212 crore for a farm insurance scheme and Rs 923 crore for the national population register.        
	The government will also spend Rs 1,900 crore to buy the Reserve Bank of Indias stakes in the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development and the National Housing Bank.        
	With the economy set to grow at 8.5 per cent in the current fiscal, the government expects to collect about Rs 7,47,000 crore in taxes during the year.         
	So far, it has received Rs 83,994 crore in taxes in the first three months of the current financial year.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: The Supreme Court has given a judgment against Pernod Ricard India Pvt Ltd, formerly Seagram India, in a case where the tax authorities had accused the Canada-based whisky maker of under reporting the quantity of whisky that was being imported.         
	A CBDT official said, The case pertains to imports between 1994 and 2001, involving duty evasion of about Rs 40 crore. Seagram will have to deposit this entire amount now. In addition, the final provisional assessment of the imports from 2001 is likely to result in significant revenue for the government.        
	According to officials, Seagram imported concentrates of alcoholic beverages (CABs) of Scotch whiskies at undervalued rates from exporter  Joseph E Seagram amp; Sons, Scotland. The declared prices at which the CABs were imported were much lower (by as much as 50 per cent) vis--vis the prices of similar Scotch CABs imported by others, officials said. The importer also allegedly misdeclared the quantity of whisky imported for certain consignments.

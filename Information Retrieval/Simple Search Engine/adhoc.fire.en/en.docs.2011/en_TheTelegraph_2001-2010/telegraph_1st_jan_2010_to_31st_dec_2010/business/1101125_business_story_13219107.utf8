	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Railway minister Mamata Banerjee today said her ministry would respond speedily to project proposals from private parties and assured them of continuity in policies.        
	Mamata was inaugurating a roadshow inviting private participation in railway projects that range from freight terminals and rail lines to shopping arcades and transit facilities for automobiles near stations.        
	It can be done on revenue-sharing basis and we can work it out I am not a businessman but I understand business logic, she said. Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra has developed the plan seeking private investments, and todays meeting was attended by more than 100 representatives from companies and various industry associations.         
	Often perceived as hostile to industry, especially after the Tatas quit Singur, Mamatas attitude was extremely proactive today  taking a problem-solving approach to the issues raised and emphasising on the need to take decisions quickly.        
	She stopped Railway Board chairman Vivek Sahai from giving will see answers and got officers to start actually listening to complaints.         
	When B.D. Sinha, Kribhco managing director, said the railways had changed its pricing policy and no business can plan in a constantly changing environment, Mamata admitted he was right.         
	She asked Sahai to respond to Sinhas problem. He has a point, policy continuity is important.        
	While asking the representatives to submit their proposals at zonal levels as well as to the Railway Board, she directed the board to make a list of the proposals and examine them within a time frame.        
	Assuring speedy response to the proposals, the railway minister said there are areas where the industry can participate by investing funds and the railways will frame the policy keeping the suggestions submitted by you in mind.        
	Already global majors, Alstom, GE, Bombardier, Siemens, Hyundai, Hitachi and ABB are vying to pick up stakes in three joint venture locomotive factories that the Indian Railways plans to set up.         
	However, the roadshow is for smaller Indian firms which want to get a slice of the pie on offer. Railway officers said they hoped to generate a lots of interest through such meetings.

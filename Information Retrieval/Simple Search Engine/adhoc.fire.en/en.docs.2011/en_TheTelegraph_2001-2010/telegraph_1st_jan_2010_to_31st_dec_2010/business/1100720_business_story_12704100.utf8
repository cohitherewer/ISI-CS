                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Takeover set for makeover
   Panel for sweeping changes in rules          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	Mumbai, July 19: A panel appointed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today recommended sweeping changes in the takeover regulations with the threshold for a mandatory open offer to the public raised from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.         
	But it added a rider that corporate raiders might find unpalatable: the open offer will have to be for all the outstanding shares issued by the company instead of 20 per cent at present. This effectively means that small retail investors will be able to get the best possible price for his shares in the case of any takeover.         
	The committee said the old open offer threshold had been fixed in an environment where it was possible to control listed companies with holdings of as low as 15 per cent  which was regarded as a substantial voting power.        
	Since then, promoters have been raising their holdings in companies (see chart) which would, therefore, warrant a higher threshold.         
	The existing trigger threshold of 15 per cent has outlived its contextual relevance and would require an upward revision, the committee said.         
	The market regulator had appointed the committee to examine and review the Takeover Regulations of 1997.         
	Headed by C. Achuthan, former presiding officer of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), the committee also suggested major changes in the methodology that companies use to determine the open offer price. It also proposed to trim the timeline for the entire open offer process to 57 business days from 95 days at present.         
	Voluntary open offer         
	Corporate houses have been given an escape hatch from the onerous clause that mandates an open offer for all the outstanding stock in the company.         
	Companies can volunteer to come out with an open offer for 10 per cent of the stock, provided the share buyout doesnt take the promoters holding above 75 per cent. There is another rider: the voluntary open offer cannot be made if the promoter has already acquired some shares in the company in the preceding 52 weeks. The promoter will also be barred from acquiring any further shares in the next six months if he goes through with the voluntary open offer.         
	If there is a competing offer, the promoter will be permitted to scale up to a full-sized open offer.         
	The committee said that acquirers were allowed to make open offers for more than the minimum 20 per cent but very rarely had anyone made such an offer. It said the 20 per cent rule gave rise to inequality as many shareholders did not get the opportunity to sell their stock. The new 100 per cent rule will enable all public shareholders to obtain a complete exit whenever an open offer is made.         
	The 100 per cent rule could lead to the delisting of a company. The committee said that if the acquirer declared his intention to delist the target company, and the shares tendered in response to the open offer enabled him to cross the delisting threshold, the company should be allowed to delist.         
	However, it pointed out that if the acquirer ended up with a holding above the maximum permitted non-public shareholding (75 per cent) but below the delisting threshold (90 per cent), the target company would have to eventually become compliant with the minimum public shareholding requirements. In other words, the public float will have to be maintained at 25 per cent.         
	Pricing rules         
	The committee also announced some key changes in arriving at the minimum open offer price. It suggested that the minimum price payable would be the highest derived from four methods:         
	a) the negotiated price under the agreement that attracted the open offer;         
	b) volume-weighted average price paid by the acquirer and persons acting in concert in the preceding 52 weeks;         
	c) highest price paid by the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him during the preceding 26 weeks, and         
	d) 60 trading day volume weighted average market price of the shares preceding the public announcement.         
	A public announcement will have to be made by the acquirer on the date of agreeing to acquire voting rights or control in the new set-up.         
	The volume weighted average price represents the total value of shares traded in a particular stock on a given day, divided by the total volume of shares traded in that stock.         
	At present, the parameters that go into fixing of an open offer price include the negotiated price under the agreement which triggered the open offer and the price paid by the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him for acquisition during the 26-week period prior to the date of public announcement, whichever is higher.

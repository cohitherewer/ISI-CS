The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt puts cap on big power projects
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Govt puts cap on big power projects
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                    Rule tweak                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The government today said a company could develop only three mega power projects at a time.        
	The decision was taken by an empowered group of ministers headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Power secretary H.S. Brahma said the panel had decided that no single company can develop more than three mega projects at a time. If a company wants to bid for the fourth one, they can do so only if they have completed at least one of the three projects.        
	This can have a direct bearing on the future plans of Anil Ambanis Reliance Energy, which already has three such projects.        
	The government plans to build nine such mega power projects, of which four have been finalised. While Reliance Energy has bagged three  Sasan (Madhya Pradesh), Krishnapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and Tilaiaya (Jharkhand), the fourth one at Mundra in Gujarat has gone to Tata Power Co Ltd.        
	According to analysts, it takes about five to seven years to complete a mega project. So, Reliance Energy will not be able to bid for the remaining projects.        
	When contacted, Reliance Energy chief executive J.P. Chalasani refused to comment as he was not aware of the decision of the eGoM.        
	A mega power project has a capacity of 4,000mw and requires an investment between Rs 16,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore.        
	Officials said the cap was necessary as arranging for finance for such projects by a single company was difficult and the delay could affect the governments power generation plans.         
	Out of the nine mega projects, four will be at pitheads while five will be located along the coasts.        
	The mega power projects are key to the governments efforts to enhance the generation capacity.         
	At present, the country has a power generation capacity of 155,859mw and the government plans to add 78,577mw by 2012.

	New Delhi, May 18: India, which has started peace talks with Pakistan, has asked its neighbour to open up trade as part of the process. It also wants Pakistan to agree to give transit facilities to its goods to Central Asia and Afghanistan and liberalise the movement of businessmen.         
	Pakistan needs to act on a South Asian Free Trade deal which will open up its markets to its neighbour as well as give India the most favoured nation status that all signatories to the World Trade Organisation pact has to give to fellow members, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told an India-Pakistan business meet here today.        
	South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) came into effect on July 1, 2006. However, Pakistan has not implemented its provisions of maintaining a negative list of imports beyond which it would permit imports from India, Mukherjee said.         
	The list of positive items (goods which India may sell to Pakistan) has been increased from 773 in July 2006 to 1,934 in September 2009, he said.        
	The SAFTA deal said the seven nations that made up the South Asian trade grouping had to open up its markets to goods from each other barring a small list of negative items of products which they wished to protect.        
	While all the other South Asian nations have done this, Pakistan, which fears its markets will be flooded by cheaper Indian imports, has refused to implement the deal, signed six years back. Mukherjee said India granted the most favoured nation status to Pakistan in 1996. Pakistan is yet to accord the same status to India.        
	Pakistani officials were not available for comment. Amin Hashwani, president of Pakistan-India CEOs forum, said, We want peace between the two nations. Opening of each others markets will benefit both countries. It is a myth that the Pakistani business community is apprehensive about it.

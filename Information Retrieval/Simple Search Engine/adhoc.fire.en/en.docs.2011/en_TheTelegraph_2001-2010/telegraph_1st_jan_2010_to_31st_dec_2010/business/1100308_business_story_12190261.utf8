	New Delhi, March 7 (PTI): State-run miner NMDC along with two other companies have submitted a $230-million non-binding bid to buy a 70 per cent stake in an Australian mine owned by Perth-based Atlas Iron.         
	A non-binding bid has been given to the Australian firm to acquire a 70 per cent stake in one of its mines by a consortium comprising NMDC, Saudi Arabias ABS Consulting and Australia-based Boulder Steel, a source said.        
	According to the indicative bid, NMDC will pick up a 15 per cent stake in the mine, possibly the Ridley mines at Pardoo, while Boulder Steel will pick up another 5 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Posco prop for local affiliate
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Posco prop for local affiliate
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 22: Posco, the South Korean steel maker, plans to increase its investment in Posco Maharashtra  a local affiliate  by $284 million (or Rs 1,290 crore) to build a cold-roll mill that will produce automotive grade steel.        
	Poscos board of directors met last Friday and approved the capital increase for the plant, which will have an annual production capacity of 1.8 million tonnes of automotive flat steel products.        
	The South Korean steel makers decision was taken on the very day the forest advisory committee under the Union environment ministry rejected a proposal to grant forest clearance to Poscos Rs 54,000-crore Orissa project.        
	Industry observers said the board decision was well timed and clearly meant to send a message to the Indian government that Posco was keen to stay here and was ready to invest more in the country.         
	The investment in the Maharashtra plant  effective from April 30, 2011  will be over and above that in the Orissa project.        
	This development also signals that the Korean major is keen to have a manufacturing foothold in India, much like ArcelorMittal, they said.        
	After waiting for years to acquire land and iron ore mines, Mittal decided to acquire a strategic stake in Uttam Galva to get a beachhead in the growing Indian steel market.         
	Similarly, Posco has faced resistance from a section of the local people while making efforts to gain physical possession of land in Orissa. It had signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government in 2005.         
	However, the company is now under fire from the environment ministry for alleged deviations in the forest plan. Environment minister Jairam Ramesh is likely to take a final call on the project soon.        
	The Maharashtra plant is much smaller and will not require much land. Work on the project is expected to begin from November 2011, and the plant will be ready by 2014. Incidentally, Posco has already begun work on a galvanised steel project in Raigad district of Maharashtra.         
	The companys decision to set up shop in Maharashtra is in tandem with the plans of a host of steel makers. Pune is one of the largest auto hubs in India where large auto makers such as Tata Motors, Fiat, Bajaj, Mahindra amp; Mahindra, Mercedes, General Motors and Volkswagen are present.        
	Earlier this year, Japanese steel maker JFE Steel bought a 14.98 per cent stake in Sajjan Jindals JSW Steel, and the two are exploring the possibility of an auto grade steel plant in Maharashtra.         
	Industry estimates that demand for cold-roll steel products for automobiles and consumer durables to grow by over 12 per cent annually for next 8-10 years.        
	The automobile industry in the country is moving at a fast pace with sales in October reaching an all-time high for the fourth consecutive month.        
	According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, vehicles sales stood at 14.6 lakh units in October against sales of 13.3 lakh units in September.        
	Industry sources feel that the scorching speed of automobile growth will fuel an increase in demand for automotive flat steel products. Steel makers, source said, wanted to exploit this opportunity to the maximum extent.

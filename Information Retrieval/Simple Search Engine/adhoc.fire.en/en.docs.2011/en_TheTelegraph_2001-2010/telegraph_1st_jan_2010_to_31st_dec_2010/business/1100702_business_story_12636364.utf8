          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 1: The countrys trade deficit in April-May widened to $21.71 billion from $14.51 billion a year ago on the back of higher imports.         
	Imports rose on industrial recovery, stronger domestic growth and rising oil prices, officials said. Industrial production grew 17.6 per cent in April, largely driven by capital goods and consumer durables.         
	Exports during the first two months of this fiscal increased 35.7 per cent to $33.03 billion, while imports were up 41 per cent to $54.75 billion. In May, trade deficit stood at $11.29 billion against $7.85 billion a year ago.         
	Imports surged 38.5 per cent to $27.43 billion, while exports rose 35 per cent to $16.15 billion.         
	The surge in the import of gems and jewellery, chemicals, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals and metal ore indicates growing domestic demand, potential export push and industrial recovery. The trade deficit at current levels is not worrying, a senior commerce ministry official said.        
	Oil imports in May were up 66.7 per cent to $8.84 billion, while non-oil imports rose 32.3 per cent to $18.59 billion. In April-May, oil imports rose 68.5 per cent to $16.9 billion, while non-oil imports grew 31.2 per cent to $37.82 billion.        
	According to commerce secretary Rahul Khullar, during the April-May period, iron-ore exports more than doubled, engineering goods rose 29.6 per cent, gems and jewellery were up 37.8 per cent, leather goods rose 33.3 per cent, pharmaceuticals grew 22 per cent, basic chemicals, 38 per cent, man-made fibres, 27 per cent, cotton yarn, 69 per cent and petroleum products, 70 per cent.        
	A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said the crisis in some European countries was a cause for concern.         
	The growth trend will continue but the only worrying aspect is the crisis in the euro zone, which is likely to affect Indias exports. The change in base rate could increase the cost of export credit, he said.        
	Exports fell for 13 successive months because of the global economic crisis before turning positive in November.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: A government panel has proposed easier norms for foreign investments in Indian stock and debt markets.        
	Instead of registering with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and opening various bank and stockbroking accounts, the U.K. Sinha panel has proposed a single window mechanism through which foreign investors need to just register with a depository participant who will take care of their other obligations.         
	The depository participants (DPs) must have a global presence and will be responsible for enforcing the Know-Your-Client norms prescribed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.        
	Such global DPs will have to pass a Sebi fitness test and have higher capital requirements, the report states.        
	According to the report, the new norms will offer a more clear investment regime, reduce uncertainty, compliance costs and the time taken to make investments.The panel has also suggested that the different classes of investors  foreign institutional investors, NRIs, foreign venture capital investors and private equity investors  be abolished.         
	The different classes of investors have separate investment limits that can be misused.        
	The proposed regime seems to simplify various hurdles faced by the FIIs such as time lag and investment cost. The new simplified norms will certainly increase portfolio investment in the country, Alex Mathew, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services, told The Telegraph.        
	The 16-member panel  Sinha is the chairman of the UTI Asset Management Company  was set up in November to review the existing policy on foreign portfolio inflows and suggest measures to reduce hurdles while ensuring adequate disclosure from investors.         
	The panel said investment in listed or unlisted securities at below 10 per cent of shares would be considered as portfolio investment.         
	Investment above 10 per cent will be foreign direct investment (FDI) and require compliance with existing FDI rules. Besides, numeric caps on investment in the debt market should be removed, or replaced by a percentage cap, in line with the equity market.        
	Removing quantitative restrictions would also provide an impetus to the development of financial services within India and further the sophistication and capabilities of the Indian economy, the report said.        
	The FIIs are currently allowed to invest up to $5 billion in government bonds and $15 billion in corporate bonds.        
	The panel said entities offering security products in foreign markets that are also sold to Indian residents should register themselves with Sebi.        
	Barclays relief        
	Sebi has lifted a ban on British bank Barclays against issuing offshore derivative instruments, a move which will allow the lender to facilitate investment by unregistered entities in Indian bourses.

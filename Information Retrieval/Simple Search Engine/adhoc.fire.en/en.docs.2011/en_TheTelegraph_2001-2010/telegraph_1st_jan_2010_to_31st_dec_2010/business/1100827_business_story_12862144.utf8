	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Maruti Suzuki plans to invest Rs 1,700 crore to set up a third production unit at Manesar, Haryana.         
	The company aims to have an annual capacity of 2.5 lakh units at the new facility, same as the upcoming second unit.        
	We are preparing a project report for the third unit in Manesar, which will come up for discussion before the board. The unit is proposed to have a capacity of 2.5 lakh vehicles annually, Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava today said at a Siam (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) summit.        
	The project report is expected to be completed soon, but Bhargava declined to say whether the report would be discussed in the companys board meeting in October.         
	On investment, Bhargava said, It will be similar to the second unit being set up at Manesar. Ideally, construction on the third unit should start after the completion of the second unit.        
	Marutis Manesar plant has an annual capacity of three lakh units per annum, while the Gurgaon plant produces seven lakh units per annum.        
	Recently Maruti Suzuki managing director Shinzo Nakanishi had said the Indian market was likely to double to five million units by 2015, and the company needed to be prepared to meet the demand.

	Honda Siel Cars India (HSCI) is yet to decide on starting assembly operations at its second plant in Rajasthan. We have not yet decided on the vehicle assembly...it will depend on the full capacity utilisation of our first plant in Greater Noida, HSCI vice-president Jnaneshwar Sen said.        
	Hero Honda plant        
	Hero Honda will take a call on setting up its fourth plant in a months time, according to senior vice-president (marketing and sales) Anil Dua.         
	The company has manufacturing facilities at Dharuhera and Gurgaon in Haryana, and Haridwar in Uttarakhand.

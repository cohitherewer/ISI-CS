The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Operators seek fee to block lost cell
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Operators seek fee to block lost cell
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          PRICE CALL                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: Telecom operators want to charge a fixed fee from customers to block a stolen or lost mobile handset.        
	At present, there is no mechanism to block a handset if it is lost or stolen even if an operator can block the SIM. The telecom regulator has asked operators to evolve a method whereby the IMEI or the ESN number of the handsets are locked.        
	IMEI or international mobile equipment identity is a unique serial number assigned to each handset. The IMEI can be found inside the handset below the battery or by typing * in most GSM devices.        
	In CDMA handsets, the unique identification number is called the electronic serial number (ESN).        
	A nominal charge should be allowed to the service provider for blocking a handset. This will cover the expenses on administration, customer care and creation of hardware and software, said Reliance in a letter to Trai.        
	While operators have not specified the fee, independent telecom consultant Anindya Dasgupta said it should be a minimal amount, say Rs 50, per transaction.        
	Customers are charged a fixed fee of Rs 19 per transaction for changing service providers while retaining their mobile numbers.        
	Bharti Airtel has proposed a cost-based approach, based on the estimated operating expense and number of lost handset requests made to the operators.         
	Bharti added that Trai could come up with a revenue-sharing arrangement between service providers and a third party who would maintain a central equipment identity register (EIR).        
	An EIR is a database deployed in the network of service providers, which store the IMEI or ESN of the handsets.        
	If the EIRs of service providers are shared through a centralised database, the lost or stolen mobile can be prevented from being used in all networks, said Trai officials.        
	At present, customers lodge a complaint with the service provider which blocks the SIM card to disable all services for the lost or stolen SIM. A duplicate SIM is provided to the customer.        
	Though the service provider ensures that the mobile connection is not misused, there is no facility to block the handset or track its future use.        
	In some countries, operators jointly maintain a central equipment identity register to keep mobile theft under check.

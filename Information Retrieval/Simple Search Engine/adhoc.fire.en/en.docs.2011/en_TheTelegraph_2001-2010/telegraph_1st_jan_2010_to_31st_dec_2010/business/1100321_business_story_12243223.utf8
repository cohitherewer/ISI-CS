          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhatt: Decision pending                                  
	Mumbai, March 20: The State Bank of India (SBI) isnt planning to raise interest rates now even though the central bank increased benchmark rates yesterday by 50 basis points in a bid to quell inflation which has risen to almost 10 per cent.        
	The countrys largest commercial bank has decided to wait for a few more smoke signals that are expected to emanate from the monetary policy review on April 20.        
	There is no plan to raise our lending rates immediately, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt told reporters at a function here today to mark the opening of its 1000th branch and its 10,000th ATM. We will wait till the April policy review before taking a call on lending rate hike.        
	On Friday, the RBI raised the repo and the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points each to 5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively.         
	Bhatt endorsed the view of several bankers that the financial system was awash with cash.        
	The SBI chief expects inflation to peak in the next couple of months, which could prompt the central bank to tighten its monetary policy. The RBI has pursued a liberal monetary expansion strategy since October 2008 when it was forced to devise measures to head off the withering effects of a global downturn on the Indian economy.        
	While raising both the key short-term rates, the central bank had said it would continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, particularly the price situation, and take further action if warranted.        
	Bankers reckon that even a small rate hike after Fridays tweak will force banks to raise lending rates across the board. Bhatt said the SBI would take a call on its 8-per-cent home loan plan by the end of March. The bank has targeted a credit growth of 20 per cent in the next financial year on the back of improving demand.

	The SBI has approached the central bank for permission to acquire up to 30 per cent in the vehicle financing company of Tata Motors. We have written to the Reserve Bank. We are awaiting a response, Bhatt added.        
	To go beyond 30 per cent, we will have to go to the government for clearance. So, we will take between 20 and 30 per cent. That means we need approval only from the RBI, he said.        
	R. Gopalan, secretary (financial services) in the finance ministry, said the government and the RBI would ensure a level-playing field for existing banks while permitting new players to operate on a pan-India basis.         
	The government has announced plans to issue fresh banking licences to private players. Several corporate houses, including the Aditya Birla group and Reliance Capital, have expressed their interest.         
	The guidelines will be framed in such a way that it will not be disadvantageous to the existing players, Gopalan added.

	New Delhi, July 19: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said he would prefer to stick to a more conservative growth forecast of 8.5 per cent despite the IMFs higher projection for India.         
	Usually, we have a dispute with the IMF over growth figures. (This time) I am inclined to accept the IMFs assessment of 9.4-9.5 per cent GDP growth. But I am being conservative. I will be happy with 8.5-per-cent-plus growth, Mukherjee told a conference organised by the CII here today.        
	Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had raised Indias GDP growth forecast for 2010 to 9.5 per cent from its April projection of 8.8 per cent.        
	According to Mukherjee, the euro zone crisis will not impact India if it remained confined to Greece and a few neighbouring countries.        
	But if it assumes a larger proportion, if it engulfs Europe as a whole, I dont know what may happen, Mukherjee said.

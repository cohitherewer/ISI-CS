          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Shinzo Nakanishi in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: Maruti Suzuki India today said it could rework royalty rates with Japanese parent Suzuki Motor Corp for a lower payout.        
	As more research and development work is being done in India, we could look at reworking the royalty terms with Suzuki. We certainly do not expect royalty payments to go up, Shinzo Nakanishi, managing director of Maruti, told reporters.         
	Marutis June quarter profit was dragged down 20 per cent by an unexpected rise in royalty payments.         
	The rise in royalty rates has raised concerns that multinational firms are taking advantage of the governments decision to remove the cap on such charges. Many feel that foreign companies often siphon off profits from their subsidiaries in the developing world through such fees.         
	Capacity boost        
	Maruti is planning to advance the date of commissioning of new facilities within its Manesar plant to meet rising demand.        
	Maruti had said it would increase the capacity at its Manesar (Haryana) factory by 250,000 cars a year by April 2012. It planned to invest Rs 1,700 crore to raise annual capacity to 1.25 million cars.        
	I am working with my team to see by how much we can advance the plant commissioning, Nakanishi said on the sidelines of an event to introduce a new version of the Alto with a fuel-efficient engine.

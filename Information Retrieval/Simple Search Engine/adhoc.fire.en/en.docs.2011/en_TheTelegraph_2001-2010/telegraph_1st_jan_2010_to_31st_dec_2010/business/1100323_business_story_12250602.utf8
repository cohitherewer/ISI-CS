	New Delhi, March 22: GAIL (India) Ltd is planning to invest in gas infrastructure globally and is looking at projects in Papua New Guinea, Nigeria, Ghana and Egypt.        
	We are examining the possibility of having a stake in the Papua New Guinea LNG terminal, GAIL chairman and managing director B.C. Tripathi told reporters.        
	The state-owned firm is talking to Canadian firm InterOil Corporation to buy a stake in its proposed liquefied natural gas project (LNG) in Papua New Guinea.        
	In Nigeria, we, along with partners Total and Shell, have been shortlisted as one of the companies to develop the Nigeria gas master plan worth about $7 billion, he said.         
	Nigeria is estimated to hold 184 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, most of which remain unexplored.         
	The short-listed companies would be invited to build three major gas gathering plants and pipelines that would supply fuel to power firms.         
	Tripathi said, In Ghana, we are talking. Whenever the gas production starts we will process the gas and transport it to the desired location.        
	The firm has a presence in city gas distribution projects in Egypt and China.        
	We are also exploring the possibility of expanding our city gas operations in Egypt, Tripathi said.

        Financial scandals do not come as a surprise to investors, says Dhirendra Kumar                                            
	The last two months have been somewhat traumatic for Indian investors. One after the other, a string of scandals has hit Indian businesses. Each one has taken its toll, impacting the credibility, the business prospects and sometimes even the stock prices of some firms.        
	The longest-running one of course has been the one that has been christened the 2G scam, which has now become a festering sore on the body of Indias business and polity.         
	From an investors perspective, the nature of the telecom scandal changed fundamentally in the days after Andimuthu Rajas exit. Suddenly, it seemed entirely possible that businesses that had acquired assets like licences and spectrum by crooked means could actually lose them. What happens to street vendors who are operating without proper municipal licences could also happen to big telecom firms.        
	Even though only those of us who are specially naive about the nature of the Indian state actually expect something like this to happen, it does bring in a completely new variable into an equation we all thought we understood.        
	However, the further unfolding of the telecom scam (and the accompanying publication of the Radiagate recordings) swivelled the spotlight on to another aspect of business-related scandals  the ability of political actions to destroy (or transfer) economic value in unexpected and arbitrary ways in some firms and sectors. Investors can see stark proof of this in the way telecom stocks have lost value over the last two years.         
	While the bellwether indices of the NSE and the BSE have touched the peak levels they had reached in January 2008, telecom stocks seem to have been bypassed in this revival. For a company such as Bharti, its as if the sensex is still at about 6000. From an investors perspective, the reason is simple. Raja has either destroyed or transferred much of the economic value that Bharti once had to newer operators. And the new operators are in no position to actually preserve that value.         
	The government is not only in the business of picking winners and losers, it is actually in the business of converting everybody into losers.        
	The story of the real estate scam is no less egregious. Of course, here the value that has disappeared is fake. It shouldnt have been there to begin with and was created by allowing all kinds of scams, big and small to flourish.        
	However, from the perspective of the ordinary saver, the worst revelation is the recent housing scam. Even though the exact contours of the loan scam are not yet clear, the broad framework is obvious.         
	There are many real estate outfits to whom all legitimate means of financing are closed. No investor in his right mind will subscribe to their IPOs and after the horrors of October 2008, no lender will touch them.        
	The net effect has been that real estate firms have managed to get their hands on lines of credit to which they shouldnt have access.        
	They have managed to sustain criminally high prices and simulate (not stimulate) demand because they had this money to play with. Even in the worst of times, when equity financing and most legitimate debt financing have been closed to them, they have managed to hang on to assets instead of having to sell them at realistic prices. The impact has been on the buyer who has either not been able to buy a house, or has had to pay much more than he should have.        
	Is there a lesson in all this for us as savers and investors?         
	If youre waiting for me to point out a silver lining, then Im sorry to disappoint you because I dont think there is one. One can take heart in the fact that the scams were revealed by components of the same system that created them but thats not much of a comfort.        
	Still, we are left with one positive, which is that you already knew all this. No sensible investor is genuinely surprised at practically any of the revelations. Whether it was Rajas actions or the real estate scam, all the scandals were already out there.

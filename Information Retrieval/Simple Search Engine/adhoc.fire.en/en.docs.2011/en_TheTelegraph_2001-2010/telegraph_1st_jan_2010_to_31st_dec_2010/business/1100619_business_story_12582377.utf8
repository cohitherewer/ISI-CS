	New Delhi, June 18: The Prime Ministers Office is setting up an inter-ministerial committee to assess the impact of the environment ministrys order designating certain coal bearing areas as no-mining zones on steel and power plants.        
	The Tata group, the Chhattisgarh mega power project, Hindustan Zinc and Prakash Industries are among those affected by the decision.        
	The steel, power and coal ministries have told the PMO that the decision would hit big-ticket projects that would turn defunct without raw material supplies that had been allotted to them before the environment ministrys order was issued.        
	The environment ministry has divided forests into go and no-go areas, depending on the forest cover.         
	The move has drawn a flurry of protests not only from industry but also from miner Coal India, which could find much of its mining area reduced and its stock value eroded because of the move.        
	Coal India is coming out with a public issue soon to raise Rs 12,000 crore from the sale of a 10 per cent equity.         
	Several state chief ministers are opposed to the move. Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi is believed to have written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking his intervention in a coal block in the Hasdeo Arand region, that has been designated as a no-go area.         
	The coal ministry is also planning to set up a high-powered committee to deal with the environmental hurdles in mine allocation. The committee will assess the scope of Coal India in the no-go areas.         
	The environment ministrys classification is expected to put 619 million tonnes of coal production annually out of reach.        
	Till now, the environment ministry has analysed forest cover in nine coalfields.

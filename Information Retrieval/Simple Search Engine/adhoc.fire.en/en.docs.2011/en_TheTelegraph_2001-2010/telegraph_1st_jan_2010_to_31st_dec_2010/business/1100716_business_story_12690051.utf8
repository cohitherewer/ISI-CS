          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          S. Sridhar in Calcutta on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, July 15: The Central Bank of India will require Rs 2,500 crore additional tier-I capital to maintain a 25 per cent growth in advances. The bank plans to raise this amount through equity capital and reserves.         
	We are in talks with the government on various options available to raise this money. Our total requirement for the current financial year is Rs 2,500 crore tier-I capital to support a 25 per cent growth in advances and maintain an 8 per cent tier-I capital in the risk-adjusted capital adequacy ratio, Central Bank chairman S. Sridhar said.         
	He was speaking on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry here today.         
	Under Basel II norms, banks are required to maintain a minimum capital adequacy of 9 per cent. For a healthy banking system, the government wants public sector banks to have a minimum 12 per cent capital adequacy with tier-I capital contributing 8 per cent.         
	Central Banks capital adequacy at the end of March this year stood at 12.2 per cent and tier-I capital was at 6.4 per cent. The capital raising will help us to shore up our tier-I capital adequacy to 8 per cent from 6.4 per cent and the overall capital adequacy to 13 per cent, Sridhar said.         
	The government holds more than 80 per cent in the bank and fund-raising instruments such as rights issue and follow-on-public offer are also under consideration.         
	The bank has received Rs 250 crore this fiscal as tier-I capital from the government in addition to Rs 450 crore last year.        
	The bank expects to grow its loan book by 20 per cent and deposits by 10-11 per cent during the April-June quarter.

	Sridhar, who is also the chairman of the National Housing Bank (NHB), said a special purpose vehicle would be formed this year with equity contributions from the government, the NHB and top 10 banks for setting up a Central Electronic Registry.        
	The government had provided Rs 25 crore in the 2009-10 budget for the Central Electronic Registry, which in the first phase will record all the titles of properties against which banks have given loans.

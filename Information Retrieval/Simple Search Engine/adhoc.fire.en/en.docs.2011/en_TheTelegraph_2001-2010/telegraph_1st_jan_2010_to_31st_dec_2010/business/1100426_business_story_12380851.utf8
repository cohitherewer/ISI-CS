The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | High on the bourses
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      High on the bourses
        Exchange traded funds can help the uninitiated make money from equities, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                             
	A simple calculation: At twenty five, a person starts his career at a monthly salary of Rs 25,000. Assuming an annual increment of 5 per cent, his total earning by the time he retires will be Rs 2.85 crore and if his salary grows by 10 per cent every year, it would be nearly Rs 9 crore.        
	Then wonder why more of us dont retire as crorepatis?        
	The reasons are flawed tax planning, highly skewed investment in secured income instruments, low home equity and low equity exposure.        
	Lets begin from the last. Equity investment is a must for long-term wealth creation, because no other instrument can yield as much as equity over a sufficiently long period of time. For example, an investment of Rs 3,000 per month will amount to more than Rs 1 crore after 35 years at an annual compounded rate of 10 per cent.         
	Historically, only equities have given an annually compounded return of more than 10 per cent. In fact, equities have yielded over 14 per cent in the last 25 years.        
	So, should we start investing in individual stocks?         
	Well, not really.         
	The best way for commoners to invest in equities is through a professionally managed collective investment scheme. Mutual funds were created just for this  a pass through vehicle for retail investors.         
	But, courtesy fund houses and their distributors and agents, mutual funds have been sold wrongly to retail investors (for whom it was meant).        
	After the ban on entry load, mutual fund agents are no longer hawking schemes to retail investors as aggressively as they had been doing till a year ago.         
	However, there is one instrument called exchange traded funds (ETFs) through which one can take exposure to equities and many other asset classes such as commodities, bonds and debt securities.         
	ETFs are just what their name implies  baskets of securities that are traded, like individual stocks, on an exchange. Unlike regular open-ended mutual funds, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like any stock.        
	ETFs can be of various categories depending on the underlying asset. There are gold, silver and crude oil ETFs. Similarly, there are index ETFs with the underlying assets being equities of a portfolio of companies that comprise a benchmark stock index.         
	Some equity ETFs also track the index of a foreign stock exchange. Liquid ETFs have underlying assets of the money market and short-term debt instruments.         
	ETFs debuted in the US market in 1993 and some became popular among the investor fraternity, both retail and institutional (half of ETF assets are owned by institutional investors).        
	A study by research firm Novarica last year gained much attention in America.         
	It predicted that the mutual fund industry in the US would become the shadow of its former self in the next five years. The study found that exchange traded funds (ETFs) were rapidly outpacing mutual funds and in the next five years, low-cost ETFs would replace nearly half of actively managed mutual funds.        
	In India, the first ETF was launched in January 2002 by Benchmark Mutual Fund. Now, there are 21 ETFs listed on domestic bourses with a variety of underlying assets, such as domestic and global equity indices, debt and commodity.        
	So far, gold ETFs have been a roaring success. In the last three years, gold ETFs have given an annualised return of nearly 20 per cent compared with 10.6 per cent average annual return of equity mutual funds. The growth in the number of investors lapping up gold ETFs has also been phenomenal  in the last five months, the number of investors accounts in ETFs have grown steadily while that in equity funds went down significantly.        
	In our country, however, ETFs other than gold ETFs are still to find high acceptance among retail investors.         
	In developed markets, investors love for ETFs is not a passing fad, though. ETFs have distinct advantages over mutual funds that make it a preferred investment vehicle for many retail investors.        
	Cost edge        
	ETFs are passively managed instruments and entail lower costs compared with mutual funds. Mutual funds employ teams of analysts and analytic software in an attempt to give a better return on investment than a certain benchmark.         
	This active management of funds entails higher costs. For example, the expense ratio of a diversified equity mutual fund could be as high as 2.25 per cent. But for an ETF, which delivers a similar return as the benchmark utilising a passive investment strategy, the expense ratio could be 1.25 per cent maximum.        
	Different approach        
	The difference in cost between ETFs and mutual funds arises because the two instruments follow fundamentally different investment approaches. While actively managed mutual funds seek to generate excess return by using the investment skill of its fund manager, ETFs own a portfolio of securities similar to the benchmark index so that it can match the benchmarks performance.         
	Liquidity advantage         
	You can buy or sell ETFs on a stock exchange any time during the trading hours. This is not possible in case of a mutual fund. If you want to buy or sell a mutual fund, you can do it on the basis of the net asset value (NAV) declared by the fund house for the day. So, in case of an ETF you get different price points in a day to buy or sell your holdings. In case of a mutual fund, you get only one price point in a day.         
	ETFs can also be sold to the sponsoring fund house if you dont have a demat account. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs thus provide two windows - one is the stock exchange where it is listed and the second is the mutual fund house that has launched the ETF.

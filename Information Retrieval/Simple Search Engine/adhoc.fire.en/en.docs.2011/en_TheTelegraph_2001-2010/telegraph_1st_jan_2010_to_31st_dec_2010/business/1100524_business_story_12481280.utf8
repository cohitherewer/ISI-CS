The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Financial services SEZ takes shape
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Financial services SEZ takes shape
          R. SURYAMURTHY                           Ambitious plans                                  
	New Delhi, May 23: The GMR group has proposed a special economic zone for financial services in Hyderabad.         
	A proposal to set up a financial services SEZ by GMR is on the agenda. The board of approval (BoA) will take it up in its meeting in the first week of June, a senior commerce ministry official said.         
	The SEZ will have firms offering insurance, mutual funds, micro finance and non-banking financial services.         
	Officials said the BoA, headed by commerce secretary Rahul Khullar, would examine the proposal in detail as it was the first of its kind.         
	According to analysts, Indias growth prospects and its vision to emerge as a major economic power suggest that the time is ripe to develop international financial services.        
	The Percy Mistry Committee, set up by the finance ministry, had estimated in its 2007 report that based on conservative assumptions, purchases by Indian households and firms of international financial services would be nearly $50 billion by 2015 and could exceed $120 billion by 2025.         
	According to latest Central Statistical Organisation data, financial services, banking, insurance and real estate grew 7.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2009-10.         
	Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the global economic recession, the government had taken a number of steps to revive the economy, including slashing interest rates, lowering factory levies and more than doubling the limit on foreign investment in corporate bonds.         
	These stimulus measures have resulted in an over 7 per cent economic growth in 2009-10, the strengthening of the capital market and a rapid expansion of financial services.         
	According to latest Sebi data, the number of registered foreign institutional investors were 1,710 and the cumulative investments in equity from November 1992 to March 2010 were $76.74 billion. Investments in debt during the same period stood at $11.85 billion.         
	The average assets under management of the mutual fund industry rose nearly 36 per cent to $174.06 billion in February from $111.55 billion during the same month in 2009, according to data of the Association of Mutual Funds in India. India is the fifth largest among the emerging insurance economies globally, and the segment is growing at a healthy 32-34 per cent annually.

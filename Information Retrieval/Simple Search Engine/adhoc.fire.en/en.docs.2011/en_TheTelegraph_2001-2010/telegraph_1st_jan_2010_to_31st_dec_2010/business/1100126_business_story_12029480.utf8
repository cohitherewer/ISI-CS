          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 25: The State Bank of India  the countrys largest commercial bank  today reported the slowest growth in profits in the past three years at Rs 2,479 crore, a piffling 0.03 per cent increase over Rs 2,478 crore registered in the same period last year.        
	The tepid profit growth arose because the bank took a hit on investments in government securities or gilts  usually a safe-house investment preferred by banks.        
	The numbers were in line with analysts median net profit estimates of Rs 2,400 crore.        
	However, on a consolidated basis, net profit came down to Rs 3,305 crore from Rs 3,608 crore in the same period last year.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt told reporters that its advances at the global level had swelled 19 per cent year on year. The domestic loan portfolio had grown 17 per cent, which was higher than the industry average of 13 per cent.        
	Bhatt added that the bank was confident of maintaining the tempo in the current quarter and that credit could jump by Rs 25,000-30,000 crore incrementally in this period.        
	He said the SBI was able to maintain the interest income on advances despite a fall in yield by 62 basis points to 9.80 per cent as on December 31.         
	Interest on advances was placed at Rs 12,639.37 crore (Rs 12,836.62 crore). On the other hand, interest expenses on deposits were also contained even as the current and savings account ratio improved to 42.94 per cent from 36.58 per cent.        
	The bank was forced to park its surplus cash in government bonds, which yielded sharply lower returns. Bhatt said the surplus liquidity remained a matter of concern. It touched Rs 75,000 crore during the quarter, yielding only 4.77 per cent in the third quarter compared with an yield of 7.53 per cent a year ago.        
	Non-performing assets (NPA) at the bank increased during the quarter. The SBI chief said loan defaults could rise in the current quarter but the pace of growth would be much slower.         
	During the third quarter, there was a net increase in NPAs by Rs 1,485 crore with the bulk of it coming from large companies and the small and medium units.        
	While around Rs 16,796 crore of loans have been restructured by the SBI, around Rs 996 crore slipped into the NPA category during the quarter, Bhatt said.         
	The NPAs will continue to increase both at the bank and industry level. But the growth in NPAs is not significantly high or alarming, he added.        
	The SBI chairman said the bank might raise at least Rs 10,000 crore in the next fiscal to shore up its capital. This sum may go up to Rs 20,000 crore. Though the mode of raising this money has not been decided, the bank may approach the government to step in.         
	Bhatt said the capital requirements of banks could increase in the months ahead on account of higher demand for loans as the economy picked up. At the same time, there was a possibility that the banking regulator could raise reserve requirements to soak up the excess liquidity swirling in the system.

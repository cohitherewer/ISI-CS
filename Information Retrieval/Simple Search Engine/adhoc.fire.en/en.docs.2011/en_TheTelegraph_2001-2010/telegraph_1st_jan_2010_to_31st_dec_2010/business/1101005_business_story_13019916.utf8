The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Core debt fund gets delayed
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Core debt fund gets delayed
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          S.K. Goel in Calcutta on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 4: The Rs 50,000-crore India Infrastructure Debt Fund, suggested by the Deepak Parekh committee on financing infrastructure development, may not take off soon, said S.K. Goel, chairman of India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL).         
	IIFCL will instead launch a credit enhancement scheme to improve the ratings of borrowers by December and help infrastructure project developers to tap the domestic bond market.        
	Though the proposal of the infrastructure debt fund is under discussion, it is very difficult to set up the fund as it involves a number of amendment to the IRDA, PFRDA and banking regulation acts. It is unlikely that the fund will take off anytime soon, Goel said on the sidelines of a banking seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry today.        
	IIFCL will provide guarantee of payment to the bond issues of developers. These guarantees will enhance credit ratings of individual project developers to AA or AA+ in which insurance companies, pension and provident funds can invest, he said. At present, insurance firms, pension and provident funds cannot invest in debt instruments of companies having a rating lower than AA.        
	However, project developers seeking the IIFCL guarantee should have at least a BB rating. With the IIFCL guarantee, rating agencies have agreed to assign an AA rating to a BB-rated infrastructure firm, Goel said.         
	IIFCL will take 50 per cent of the savings towards interest cost for the infrastructure company (for a better rating) as a guarantee fee, he said.        
	Infrastructure projects, which take time to mature, are facing funding problems. Lenders with long-term resources such as insurance firms are not keen because of the risks. Banks, too, are in a dilemma as bulk of their borrowings in fixed deposits have a tenure of less than three years.         
	IIFCL also plans to start a take-out financing scheme  it will buy the bank loan freeing up capital for the lender  from October 12. We have earmarked Rs 25,000 crore for take-out financing till March 2013, Goel said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | EIH weighs rights offer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      EIH weighs rights offer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 20: EIH Ltd today announced that its board of directors would meet on Thursday to consider a rights issue of equity shares, giving a fresh twist to the three-week-old drama that had enveloped the luxury hotel chain ever since Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries picked up a 14.8 per cent stake in the Rs 900 crore company.        
	The announcement sparked speculation that the Ambanis would not only subscribe to the rights shares they were entitled to but also corner the equity renounced by other shareholders.        
	Late last month, Reliance Industries had appeared as a white knight when it acquired the stake and helped 80-year-old hotelier P.R.S. Oberoi to face down a takeover threat posed by cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate ITC.        
	ITC has a 14.98 per cent stake in the hotel chain that it has steadily built up since 2001.        
	With both RIL and ITC on the brink of breaching a 15-per-cent threshold that would automatically trigger an open offer under Sebis takeover rules, no one was quite sure how this game of brinkmanship would pan out.        
	Late tonight, a television channel quoted ITC sources as saying the company would not subscribe to the rights shares if the EIH board cleared such a proposal, indicating that the Calcutta-based company was not prepared to get into a bruising battle with the Ambanis.        
	However, this could not be independently confirmed. An ITC spokesperson told The Telegraph that the company did not wish to comment on market speculation.        
	ITC had always maintained that its investment in EIH  built through market purchases by group firms that began in 2001  was purely for investment purposes. However, the Oberois were alarmed when ITC first consolidated the EIH stake in Russell Credit  a 100 per cent subsidiary of ITC.        
	In April this year, ITC acquired the entire 14.98 per cent stake in an off-market transaction valued at a little over Rs 215 crore, sending a frisson of fear through the Oberois who quickly scrambled to find a white knight to stave off the marauder.        
	Likely scenarios        
	Market analysts have started speculating that EIH could announce an expensively-priced rights issue with the Oberois renouncing part of their entitlement in favour of the Ambanis. The public may also be deterred by the high asking price for the rights shares.        
	The Ambanis had acquired the stake at an average price of Rs 184 per share, at a premium of 36 per cent to the market price. The EIH scrip today dipped a little over 1 per cent to Rs 136.70 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	If such a scenario emerges, RIL can approach market regulator Sebi seeking an exemption from an open offer. Even if Sebi insists on an open offer, RIL  which is sitting on a cash mountain of over Rs 25,000 crore  wont face any trouble in coming out with one. An RIL spokesperson declined to comment on the potential outcome of the rights issue.        
	The interesting aspect is that if the public does not subscribe to the rights offer and RIL crosses the 15 per cent shareholding mark, then the view of Sebi on the pricing of the issue and a possible waiver of an open offer will come into play, said PricewaterhouseCoopers executive director Rajan Wadhawan.         
	There has also been a lot of speculation about changes in EIHs board structure with the possible induction of Nita Ambani.         
	Biki Oberoi still has two years to go before his tenure as EIH chairman ends. At a shareholders meeting in Calcutta just a week before the Ambanis bought the stake, Oberoi had indicated that he was working on a succession plan for the group.        
	The rights issue could emphatically settle all those issues.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Clear reception                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: The Bangladesh telecom regulator has approved Bharti Airtels proposal to buy a controlling stake in Warid Telecom.        
	Bharti will buy 70 per cent in Warid for $900 million and initially invest $300 million.         
	The UAE-based Abu Dhabi Group, a consortium of investors that includes members of the royal family of Abu Dhabi, will retain the remaining stake in Warid - the fourth largest mobile operator in Bangladesh.        
	We have approved Bhartis plan to buy the Warid stake, said Zia Ahmed, chairman of the Bangladesh Telecom Regulatory Commission (BTRC).        
	A Bharti spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.        
	The commission has also approved investment of $300 million by Bharti Airtel for the expansion of their telecom network across the country, said Ahsan Habib, director-general of the BTRC.         
	The regulator has asked Warid to submit a timeline of Bhartis $300 million investment plan within 30 days.        
	We hope the Airtel investment will cross $1 billion within the next few years, said Ahmed. Bharti chief Sunil Mittal had recently gone to Dhaka to negotiate the deal.        
	Whatever price Airtel is going to pay for Warids stake, 5.5 per cent of the amount must go to the BTRC, Ahmed said.         
	Fraud calls        
	Bharti Airtel today asked mobile users to avoid responding to suspicious calls that ask for personal information. The callers pretend to be representatives of the operator and inform the user that he has won a lottery conducted by the operator.        
	A customer receives a missed call from a number starting with +92. On returning the call, the user reaches a fraudster who tries to con the customer into divulging sensitive personal information and to pay a commission to receive the prize money.

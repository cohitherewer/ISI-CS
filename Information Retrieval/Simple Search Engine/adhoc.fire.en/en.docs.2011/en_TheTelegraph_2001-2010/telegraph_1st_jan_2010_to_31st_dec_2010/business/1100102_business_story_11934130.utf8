The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | China beats ONGC on Algerian turf
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      China beats ONGC on Algerian turf
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Big loss                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd has lost an oilfield in Algeria to a consortium led by a Chinese oil firm.        
	ONGC had teamed up with Turkish Petroleum Corp (TPAO) and UAEs Dana Gas to bid for the Hassi Bir Rekaiz acreage in Algerias latest licensing round, sources said.        
	It, however, lost the prized property to a consortium of China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) and Thailands PTTEP. Spains Cepsa and Russias Gazprom were the other bidders.        
	Hassi Bir Rekaiz in the Berkine Basin was relinquished by Australias BHP Billiton after a 2005 award.        
	Algeria awarded three permits in its bid round for 10 exploration areas that closed on December 22, they said.        
	The Hassi Bir Rekaiz block has an approximate area of 5,670 square km. It is nearly 115 km east of the Bir Seba oilfield, which is being developed by Sonatrach (Algerias national oil company), PTTEP, and PetroVietnam Exploration and Production Corporation (PVEP).        
	Last month, ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of ONGC, had lost a bid for the Halfaya oilfield in Iraqs second post-war bid round to a consortium of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), Petronas Cargali of Malaysia and Frances Total.        
	OVL had teamed up with Oil India Ltd and TPAO to bid a $1.76-per-barrel fee to boost output from Halfaya to 550,000 barrels per day. The CNPC-led group offered to boost production to 535,000 bpd from the current 3,000 bpd at a cost of $1.40 a barrel. The Halfaya oilfield has estimated reserves of 4.1 billion barrels of oil.        
	The win over ONGC marked CNOOCs entry into Algeria, where fellow state giants CNPC and Sinopec had already made upstream and downstream forays.        
	Frances Total with Portugals Partex walked away with potentially the biggest prize in the tender, the southerly Ahnet field, which Total says holds some 500 billion cubic meters (17.65 trillion cubic feet) of gas. Total was the sole qualified bidder.

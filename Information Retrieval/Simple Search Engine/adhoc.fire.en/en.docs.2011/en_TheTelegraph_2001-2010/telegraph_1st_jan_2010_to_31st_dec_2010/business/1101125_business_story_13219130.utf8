                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sleuths bust housing loan scam
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 24: Sleuths from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) today claimed to have busted a multi-crore housing loan scam after conducting search operations in five cities, including Calcutta.        
	Ramachandran R. Nair, chief executive officer of LIC Housing Finance, Naresh Chopra, investment secretary of the Life Insurance Corporation, and Maninder Singh Johar, the Delhi-based director of the Central Bank of India, were among eight people arrested for accepting illegal gratification, while processing loans to real estate developers and other companies.         
	The others arrested were R.N. Tayal, general manager of the Bank of India, Venkoba Gujjal, deputy general manager of Punjab National Bank (PNB), Delhi, Rajesh Sharma, chairman and managing director of Money Matters, and two other officials of the firm.        
	Money Matters Financial Services is a financial intermediary that was known earlier as Daiwa Securities.        
	The CBI refused to indicate the size of the scam, but it was clearly on a very large scale, prompting the normally reticent bureau to hold simultaneous press conferences in Delhi and Mumbai.        
	Five cases have been registered by the investigating agency in Mumbai, and the officials arrested have been remanded in CBI custody till November 29.        
	CBI joint director P. Kandaswamy told reporters here today that the financial intermediary had been facilitating corporate loans and other facilities in exchange for bribes meant for the senior officials in the financial institutions.        
	The CBI conducted searches at various locations in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Jaipur, Calcutta and Jalandhar and several documents had been seized.        
	It is learnt that the remand notice of the CBI filed before the sessions court has alleged that R.R. Nair showed undue favours to some companies for which he allegedly received more than Rs 45 lakh from Rajesh Sharma of Money Matters.        
	Chopra provided investment information on a number of listed companies to Money Matters. The remand copy also accused Johar of showing undue favours to a prominent real estate project coming up in Maharashtra, and that he received Rs 30 lakh for this.        
	Later, it was learnt that the CBI had filed a first information report (FIR) naming real estate firms such as DB Realty, Mantri Realty, Lavasa Corporation and Suzlon as possible loan beneficiaries. However, they have not been chargesheeted as yet.        
	Money Matters is a little known company that was originally incorporated as Daiwa Securities Ltd on November 15, 1994. (It had, however, no connection with the Japanese financial services group, Daiwa Securities). Since then its name was changed to Dover Securities Ltd on May 19, 1999 with its registered office on Sarojini Naidu Sarani in Calcutta. The registered office was later shifted to Mumbai.         
	The website of the company, which was shut down late in the evening, says it provides various services such as asset financing, loan syndication and promoter funding.        
	News of the scam sent shivers in the stock markets with the benchmark sensex falling over 231 points at 19459.85.         
	LIC Housing Finance plunged 18.32 per cent to Rs 1068.55, while the Central Bank of India slid over 8 per cent to Rs 197.90. On the other hand, Money Matters Financial Services tumbled nearly 20 per cent to Rs 531.20.        
	Market mavens fear that equities may take a beating tomorrow with realty and banking stocks likely to take a knock.        
	In a statement, LIC Housing Finance said it had followed all procedures and board-approved guidelines while approving loans that were secured by underlying assets.         
	It further said that as on date all the loans in question were fully performing assets and that builder loans constituted 11.34 per cent of the total loan portfolio as on October 31.        
	Some of the companies named by the CBI such as DB Realty said they had given a mandate to Money Matters to raise funds and that there had been no wrongdoing. A senior official of the company added that payments to Money Matters were made through cheques.        
	S. Sridhar, chairman and managing director of the Central Bank of India, told The Telegraph that M.S. Johar was an independent director and not an employee of the bank. The CBI has not approached anybody in the bank, he added.

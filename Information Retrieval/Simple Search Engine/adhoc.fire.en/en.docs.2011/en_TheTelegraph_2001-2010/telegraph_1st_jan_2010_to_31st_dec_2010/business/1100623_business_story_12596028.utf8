The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL close to new shale gas deal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RIL close to new shale gas deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukesh: Growth drive                                  
	Mumbai, June 22: Reliance Industries Ltd is set to acquire another shale gas asset in the US.         
	The Mukesh Ambani-owned company is on the verge of announcing a 45 per cent stake purchase in US-based Pioneer Natural Resources Eagle Ford shale gasfield in south Texas in a deal valued at $1.35 billion        
	Ambanis interest in acquiring a stake in Pioneer has been known for sometime now. An RIL spokesperson declined to comment.        
	Sources, however, said that the Pioneer deal was similar to the one it signed in April with US-based Atlas Energy.         
	RILs pact with Atlas focused on joint development of shale gas in the latters Marcellus shale acreage position. The acquisition cost of around $1.7 billion for a stake in the joint venture with Atlas comprised an initial one-time payment followed by capital costs staggered over a seven-and-a-half-year period.        
	Reports indicate that Barclays and UBS advised RIL in the Pioneer deal. The US firm was aided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. On Tuesday, the RIL scrip closed 0.15 per cent lower at Rs 1,063.65.        
	The fact RIL is betting on shale gas, a relatively new source of energy, was made abundantly clear when the RIL chairman spoke to shareholders at the companys 36th annual general meeting last week.         
	Shale gas is the most promising development in the energy area in North America. It is likely to overtake both conventional gas as well as liquid fuels as a source of energy within the next decade, said Ambani.        
	The RIL chairman also spoke of committing capital alongside proven low-cost operators to accelerate the development of shale gas.         
	Reliance has reportedly been in talks with several operators in North America ever since it has decided to focus on this energy source. The move is also interesting as cash-rich RIL has been pursuing what is seen as slightly risky businesses.         
	The company has already announced an entry into 4G by buying out a 95 per cent stake in BWA auction winner Infotel.        
	Broadband is perceived to be an unproven area of business. International ratings agency Moodys, while maintaining its rating on the company, has observed that RILs increasing appetite for growth and diversification in geographies, sectors, and relatively unproven technologies is also demonstrated in its shale gas deal with US-based Atlas Energy.

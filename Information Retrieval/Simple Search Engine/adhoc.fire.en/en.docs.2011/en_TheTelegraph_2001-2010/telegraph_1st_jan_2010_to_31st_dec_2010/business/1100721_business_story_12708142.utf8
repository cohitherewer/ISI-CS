The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bill to replace Ulip ordinance

  - Legislation to outline future course of action          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           (From left) Finance secretary Ashok Chawla, CII president Hari S. Bhartia, cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar and Planning Commission secretary Sudha Pillai in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, July 20: The finance ministry will bring a bill during the monsoon session of Parliament to regularise the ordinance allowing the insurance regulator to administer unit-linked insurance products (Ulips).        
	North Blocks assertion comes at a time the Reserve Bank has expressed reservations about the ordinance.        
	Regulators have raised their points of view. The finance minister has taken note of those issues. The ordinance in whatever form has to be placed before Parliament. It is a matter of few days when this (bill) will be tabled and everybody would know what the future course of action on this particular piece of regulation is, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said.        
	After market watchdog Sebi and insurance regulator IRDA locked horns over the jurisdiction of Ulips, the government issued an ordinance last month giving the insurance regulator the powers to regulate these schemes.        
	Ulips are insurance schemes whose value is linked to the market value of shares they have been invested in.        
	However, a few days later RBI governor D. Subbarao met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and asked the government to reconsider the ordinance.         
	I have come to meet the finance minister in connection with the ordinance that they have issued regarding settlement of the dispute on regulatory jurisdiction. The RBI has certain reservations and concerns, which we have expressed in the letter, Subbarao had said after the meeting.        
	Mukherjee later clarified that his ministry did not intend to interfere or curb the autonomy of regulators, but would step in to resolve turf wars through existing mechanism.         
	The intentions are quite clear. We are not going to intervene in the autonomy of regulators, the finance minister had said.        
	At present, a high level coordination committee, comprising financial sector watchdogs and finance ministry officials, looks into inter-regulatory issues.         
	The government had also sought to set up a Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) in Budget 2010-11, which regulators felt could curb their autonomy. However, the government believes the proposed body will merely function as an arbiter in case of disputes between regulators.        
	Though the insurance regulator supports the idea of FSDC, popularly dubbed a super-regulator, the RBI and Sebi have serious objections and feel it could actually create more confusion in the marketplace.        
	Chawla added that the government had not decided on any sovereign wealth fund.         
	The proposal has been mooted by some people. We will consider carefully as there are both points, in favour and against. At this point, no decision has been taken, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL, oil ministry lock horns
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RIL, oil ministry lock horns
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, July 20: The petroleum ministry and Reliance Industries are headed for a showdown after the Mukesh Ambani-owned company refused to comply with a directive to sign binding agreements to supply gas from its KG-D6 basin with 16 new customers, including the Ruias of the Essar group.        
	On July 12, the petroleum ministry had directed RIL to sign gas sale and purchase agreements (GSPAs) with all the customers who have been allocated KG-D6 gas and are ready to take it.        
	Reliance wrote to the ministry on July 15 that its directive was not in consonance with the gas allocation policy framed by the empowered group of ministers (EGoM) in May 2008.        
	It said the EGoM had set two conditions for the supply of gas. First, the consumers would have to be in a position to consume the gas and second, they would need to be connected to the existing pipeline network.        
	RIL argued that the gas allocations that had been decided in favour of the Ruias, the Adanis, Indian Oil Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, National Thermal Power Corporation, GAIL Gas Ltd, Ratnagiri Gas and Power Pvt Ltd and a couple of others ought to be treated as lapsed.        
	The nub of the dispute centres on the reservation of gas for certain consumers who were allocated the gas but did not meet either of the two conditions that the EGoM had set.         
	RIL said these 16 consumers who were either not ready to receive the gas when it became available or lacking the necessary pipeline connectivity cannot claim to have a quantity reserved for them.        
	The petroleum giant has claimed earlier that it needed to cap gas production at 60 million standard cubic metres of gas a day (mmscmd). It has already signed GSPAs for a total quantity of 57.8mmscmd. With no headroom to take on new customers, it had requested in a letter to the ministry on June 3 that RIL should be allowed to allocate the remaining 2.2mmscmd to its own downstream units.        
	Turning down that request, the ministry had said in its July 12 letter that RIL should sign the deals with the new customers and make pro rata cuts on gas supplies to all firm customers on the days that KG-D6 production was not sufficient.        
	In its letter, RIL said it could not impose pro rata cuts on customers already allocated gas on firm basis by the EGoM in order to sign additional GSPAs for more firm quantities of gas.        
	Our position remains that as a responsible producer we cannot sign firm GSPAs beyond the available quantities of gas, RIL said.        
	The Mukesh Ambani firm wants the gas allocation issue to be taken up at the next meeting of the EGoM on July 27. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee heads the committee.        
	Allocations which do not survive in terms of EGoM directions (should) be recognised as having lapsed and the balance quantity of 2.2mmscmd be re-allocated, the company said.        
	Last December, RIL had tested facilities at KG-D6 for a peak production rate of 80 mmscmd. However, it estimates that this level of output can only be achieved by next year after more wells are drilled. RIL has 18 producing wells and has sanction for another 12 to produce peak output. According to the Directorate-General for Hydrocarbons, the field development plan provided for a peak output of 80mmscmd in 2011 will continue till 2016.

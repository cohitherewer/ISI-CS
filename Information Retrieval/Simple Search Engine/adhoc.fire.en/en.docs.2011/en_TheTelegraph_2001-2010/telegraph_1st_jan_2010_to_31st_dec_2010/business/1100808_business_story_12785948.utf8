The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hint of fresh rate hike
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Hint of fresh rate hike
                            
	Hyderabad, Aug. 7 (PTI): The Reserve Bank of India may hike benchmark rates during the mid-quarterly policy review in September if inflation levels do not come down in the next four weeks, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council, said today.        
	The RBI in its July review raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent and the reverse repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.5 per cent.        
	I think the RBI will take a decision. But that depends on how inflation continues to behave in the next four weeks. Therefore, they will make some decision towards the end of next month, Rangarajan said.        
	He said if inflation persisted at double-digit levels, action would probably be required.        
	Food inflation declined to 9.53 per cent for the week ended July 24 as fruits and vegetables became cheaper. It was marginally higher at 9.67 per cent in the previous week.        
	Rangarajan, however, said the good monsoon might ease the inflationary level.        
	Our own projections say as a result of a good monsoon, the agriculture output will go up between 4 per cent and 5 per cent this year and it will have a favourable effect on the availability of foodgrain. This will also dampen the inflationary expectations, Rangarajan said.        
	He said the central bank was not hawkish and was doing what was appropriate to bring down inflation.

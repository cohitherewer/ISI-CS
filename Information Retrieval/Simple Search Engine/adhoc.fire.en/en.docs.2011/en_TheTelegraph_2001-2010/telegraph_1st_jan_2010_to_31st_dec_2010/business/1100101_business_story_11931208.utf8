The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Minority investors spike Taro proposal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Minority investors spike Taro proposal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          SHOT IN THE ARM                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 31: In a major boost to Sun Pharma, which is locked in a battle to acquire Taro Pharmaceutical Industries, the minority shareholders of the Israeli company today rejected a proposal to elect its external director nominees.        
	Sun Pharma  the single largest shareholder in Taro with a 36 per cent stake  has been trying to take control of the company for more than two years.        
	Shareholders voted against the election of Taros external director nominees, Sun Pharma said in a statement today. In doing so, the shareholders have sent a strong message of disapproval to Barrie Levitt and his continuing control of Taro, the company said.        
	Levitt is the chairman of Taro. According to Sun Pharma, the minority shareholders also voted against the continued service of the Levitt slate of directors and a similar number voted against the boards indemnification proposals. The shareholders comprise about 78 per cent of the minority votes cast and are not affiliated with the Levitts or Sun Pharma.        
	Taros shareholders have spoken today, clearly and loudly. Taro shareholders holding more than two-thirds of its equity want to remove the Levitts and their associates from the board. It is clear to the shareholders that the Levitts and Taro directors have misappropriated the minority shareholder protection argument to justify their illegal actions, Dilip Shanghvi, chairman and managing director of Sun Pharma, said.        
	Sun Pharma, however, said despite the vote, the Levitt family would continue to control Taro, at least for some more time.         
	Under Taros capital structure, the Levitts hold a little over 33 per cent of the voting power by owning a special class of non-equity shares.         
	The Levitts used these special shares to pass a resolution, rewarding Taros independent directors with widely expanded indemnity.        
	According to Sun Pharma, the Levitts have a contractual obligation to sell their shares to the company at a price that has been fixed by mutual consent.         
	In line with this, Sun Pharma opted to buy the familys shares in June 2008. However, the Levitts, with full support of the directors, have prevented the takeover.        
	Ahead of its AGM, Levitt had urged the shareholders in separate letters to reject a takeover bid by Sun Pharma.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas, Lockheed join hands
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tatas, Lockheed join hands
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: The Tata group will partner Lockheed Martin through subsidiary Tata Advanced Systems to make structurals for the C-130-J transport aircraft. The Tatas will hold a 74 per cent stake in the venture, to be based in Hyderabad, and Lockheed the rest.        
	Lockheed and the Tatas were tight-lipped about the scope of the venture.         
	However, sources said the venture would not make the usual spares such as doors and windows, which aviation sector joint ventures usually concentrate on. It will make components such as floorbeams and ribs, the main structure on which an aircraft stands.        
	The government today gave its go-ahead to the joint venture, officials said. The Lockheed C-130-J is a transport aircraft, which is favoured by the military but can be used for civil transportation too. Called the Super-Hercules, its a four-engine turbo-prop aircraft that can carry 64 fully armed troopers, or 74 patients with medical attendants or an armoured personnel carrier.         
	Indian Air Force has recently ordered 10 C-130Js. These will be designed for use by paratroopers and special operation forces.         
	Equipped with an infrared detection set, the aircraft can perform precision low-level flying, airdrops and landing in blackout conditions.        
	For the Tatas, who have tied up with Sikorsky Helicopters to make helicopters, its another move in the lucrative defence industry. The initial equity investment is meagre  just Rs 122 crore for the Tatas and Rs 42 crore for Lockheed Martin. The joint venture will access long-term finance to fund the high-cost project, which will involve the transfer of crucial technology.         
	Only last month, the Tatas bought a 74 per cent stake in Hyderabad-based Elta Avionics, a provider of radar, communications and surveillance systems solutions to Indian defence forces.

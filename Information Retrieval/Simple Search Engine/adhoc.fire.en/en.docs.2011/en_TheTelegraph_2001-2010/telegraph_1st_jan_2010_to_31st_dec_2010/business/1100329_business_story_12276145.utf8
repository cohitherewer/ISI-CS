The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | China firm buys Volvo Car for $1.8bn
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      China firm buys Volvo Car for $1.8bn
                          Deal sealed                    
	Gothenburg/Beijing, Mar-ch 28 (PTI): In the biggest overseas acquisition by a Chinese auto maker, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group today bought US auto giant Ford Motors ailing Swedish car unit Volvo Car Corporation for $1.8 billion.        
	The deal, which meant that Geely would own 100 per cent of Volvo Car, was inked by Geely chairman Li Shufu and Fords chief financial officer Lewis Booth at the headquarters of the premium Swedish auto firm in Gothenburg.        
	Booth said the sale was for $1.8 billion (1.35 billion euros), less than a third of the $6.4 billion Ford paid for Volvo Car in 1999.        
	China, the largest car market in the world, will become Volvos second home market. Volvo will be uniquely-positioned as a world-leading premium brand, tapping into the opportunities in the fast-growing China market, Li said.        
	The deal will bring to an end Fords association with Volvo, known for its sturdy, family-friendly cars.        
	But Li promised that Geely would maintain the strong collaborative relationship that Volvo had built with employees, unions, suppliers, dealers and customers.        
	Volvo Car will eventually be a separate company with its own management team based in Gothenburg and a new board of directors, Li said.        
	The transaction will be made through a $200 million note, while the remainder will be paid out in cash, Booth was quoted as saying.        
	Geely said it had secured all the financing necessary to complete the deal.        
	Auto sales in China soared 46 per cent last year to 13.6 million, helping it to overtake the US as the worlds largest automobile market.

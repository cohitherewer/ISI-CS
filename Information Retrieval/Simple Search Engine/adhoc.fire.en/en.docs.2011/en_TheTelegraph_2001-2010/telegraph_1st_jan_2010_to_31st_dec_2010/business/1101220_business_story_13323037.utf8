The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi clears EIH rights issue
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sebi clears EIH rights issue
                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 19 (PTI): The hotel industry may see a renewed battle with Sebi approving the rights issue of the Oberois-promoted EIH Ltd, which was able to thwart a possible hostile takeover bid from ITC in August with the help of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).         
	When RIL picked up a stake in EIH in August, it was seen as a strong investor to counter ITC, which holds 14.98 per cent in the Oberoi group firm. RIL has 14.80 per cent in EIH, while the promoters of EIH have 32.31 per cent at the end of the September quarter.        
	The Rs 1,300-crore rights issue presents an opportunity for both RIL and ITC to up their stake beyond 15 per cent, which will trigger the mandatory open offer.        
	The Sebi takeover code mandates that any entity owning more than 15 per cent in a firm has to make an open offer for at least an additional 20 per cent stake.

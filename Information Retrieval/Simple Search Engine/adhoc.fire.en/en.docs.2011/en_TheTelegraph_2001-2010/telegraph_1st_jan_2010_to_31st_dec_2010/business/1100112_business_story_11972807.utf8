          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ramanathan: Reaping gains                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 11: Exide Industries profit rose 132 per cent to Rs 130.48 crore in the September-December quarter over the same period last year.        
	However, when compared with the previous quarter, sales and profit have fallen.        
	Indias largest auto and industrial battery maker posted a 16 per cent growth in net sales at Rs 912.57 crore.         
	Profit and revenue in the preceding quarter (June-September) was higher at Rs 149.67 crore and Rs 950.70 crore, respectively.        
	T.V. Ramanathan, managing director and chief executive officer of Exide, said: Apart from a low base effect, the robust profit growth is a direct result of volume growth, an improved product mix, and cost efficiencies secured on sourcing of materials, in addition to continued austerity measures. In automobile batteries, Exide benefited from new launches and the general bouyancy in the vehicle market.        
	Besides its sales team managed to prise open new markets; a strong after-sales service also helped.        
	In industrial batteries, growth in power, traction and other infrastructure segments overcame a slackening demand in telecom        
	With an improved economic scenario, both domestic and international, we hope that the current momentum of growth will continue in the near term. However, volatility in global lead prices remains a cause for concern, he said.

                                If the head of a Hindu Undivided Family gives a gift to his own HUF, and the HUF generates income out of it, will this HUF income be clubbed with the kartas income for tax purposes?          R.K. Patel, Serampore
                      Under Section 64(2) of the Income Tax Act, if the member of an HUF, including the karta, transfers directly or indirectly any property to the HUF without adequate consideration, the member making the transfer shall be deemed to be the owner of such a property and the income accruing or arising from such a property shall continue to be chargeable in the hands of the member. Even after the division of the HUF, if the property so transferred by the member is received by his/her spouse, the income from such property received by the spouse shall be deemed to be the income of the member who has transferred the property.                                      Parent care      What are the tax implications of giving a gift to my parents? Will it be taxable? Under which section of the Income Tax Act shall I show it? I am married and my parents are dependant on me. Can I get any tax           efit on this?          Satarupa Haldar, Calcutta
                      Under Section 56 of the Income Tax Act, your parents will be exempt from paying any tax on gift received by them from you. However, you cannot claim any deduction for the expenses you bear for your parents from your total income.                                      Point to prove      Can the second holder of a joint account claim tax benefit under Sections 80C or 80CCF?        Avinash Roy, Howrah
                    Whoever pays the money for investment will get the tax benefit, irrespective of whether you are the first or second holder of the account. So, you shall have to prove with documents that you, as the second holder of the account, have paid the money for the investment.

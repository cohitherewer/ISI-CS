          A STAFF REPORTER                          Picking up                                  
	Calcutta, June 5: The countrys tea production increased 9.12 per cent in April, while exports grew 12.3 per cent during the month.        
	Better output in north India saw production rising to 68.24 million kg in April compared with 62.59 million kg in the corresponding month a year ago, latest data by the Tea Board of India show.        
	Exports grew 12.3 per cent to 12.76 million kg during the month against 11.36 million kg in the same month a year ago.        
	Production in south India fell marginally. While the shortfall in production was anticipated, the impact of late rainfall is likely to get reflected in the May crop, according to the United Planters Association of Southern India.         
	Bulk of the growth in north Indian plantations came from Assam, which recorded a rise of 8 million kg. Production growth in Bengal was marginal.        
	Output during January-April was up 12 per cent at 162.30 million kg against 144.47 million kg in the corresponding period last year.         
	According to the Tea Board, price per kg fell around 3 per cent to Rs 117.95 a kg from Rs 133.68 a kg during April last year. But the growth in volume ensured that the total realisation from exports did not register any significant fall.        
	The volume of exports during the January-April period registered a 20 per cent growth at 59.97 million kg compared with 49.82 million kg in the year-ago period.        
	Experts feel rising production in Kenya and Sri Lanka is likely to affect Indias tea exports in the years ahead. Sri Lankan output for the first four months of the year is up by 27 per cent from a year ago.

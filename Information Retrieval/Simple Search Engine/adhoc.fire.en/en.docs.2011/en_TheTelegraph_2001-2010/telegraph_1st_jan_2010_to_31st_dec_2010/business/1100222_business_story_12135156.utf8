The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Citi seeks capital infusion
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Citi seeks capital infusion
                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 21 (PTI): Citigroup plans to infuse a substantial amount of capital into its Indian banking operations by next month to strengthen its foothold in the domestic market, a top bank official said.        
	We plan to infuse a substantial amount of capital into our Indian operations by March. This will equip us in a better way to go ahead with our business expansion here, he said.         
	Sources said fresh capital infusion could be above Rs 750 crore and even go up to Rs 1,000 crore.        
	So far, Citigroup has pumped $3.1 billion into the country and is the single largest foreign direct investor in the domestic financial services industry, according to information available on its website.        
	Out of the total investment, the groups banking arm Citi has received around $2.4 billion, the official said. The proposed additional capital infusion will equip the US banking major to face competition from its deep-pocket global opponents such as Standard Chartered and HSBC as well as from domestic players.         
	As part of its business strategy, the bank has been reducing its dependence on unsecured loans  primarily personal and credit card advances  in the country over the past few years.         
	Instead, it is focusing more on expanding its business involving institutional and commercial clients.

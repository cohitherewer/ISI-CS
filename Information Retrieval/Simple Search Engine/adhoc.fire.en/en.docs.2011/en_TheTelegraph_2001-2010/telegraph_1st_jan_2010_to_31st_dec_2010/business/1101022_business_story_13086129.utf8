                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cairn deal needs ONGC nod
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) today reiterated that Cairn Energy needed its consent to sell a controlling stake in Cairn India to metals conglomerate Vedanta Group.        
	ONGC said it had the option to exercise its pre-emptive rights in the blocks it jointly owned with Cairn India.        
	Earlier, the Solicitor-General of India had upheld ONGCs view that oil and gas assets were national resources and transfer of controlling interest needed the governments as well as the partners consent.        
	London-listed Vedanta Resources, controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, and oil explorer Cairn Energy announced on August 16 that Vedanta would buy up to 60 per cent of Cairn India for $9.6 billion. Cairn Energy owns 62.36 per cent of Cairn India.        
	Cairn India holds stakes in 10 oil and gas blocks in the country. Its key asset is the RJ-ON-90/1 oil block in Barmer in the northwestern state of Rajasthan. The blocks current production of 125,000 barrels a day accounts for about 17 per cent of Indias total crude output.        
	In its statement, the domestic flagship explorer ONGC said it had asked Cairn to provide details of Vedantas financial strength, technical capability and past experience in the field of oil and gas to help decide on what course of action to take.        
	On August 30, ONGC had made it clear that the Cairn-Vedanta deal needed its consent and that it had pre-emptive rights in the blocks.        
	Cairn has always said that we will take the necessary consents and approvals and work in a consensual way to process this transaction, said a Cairn spokesperson.        
	Earlier this month, Cairn Energy chief executive Bill Gammell said while ONGC had pre-emptive rights over the transfer of assets by Cairn India, it didnt have any such rights in case of a stake sale in the company.        
	ONGC, which is currently paying 100 per cent royalties on production from the Rajasthan RJ-ON-90/1 block, wants to evenly split royalty payments with Cairn India before giving its consent to Cairn Energys stake sale. ONGC has been paying the complete royalty as part of a government strategy to offer incentives to attract private investment in the sector.        
	ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma on September 23 said total royalty payments over the life of the block could be $2 billion, based on current production.        
	In October, Sesa Goa, a unit of Vedanta Resources, had to postpone its open offer to acquire a 20 per cent stake in Cairn India as it didnt have the necessary regulatory approvals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Apple posts profit at $3.38bn
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Apple posts profit at $3.38bn
                            
	Cupertino, Jan. 27 (Agencies): Apple has announced financial results for the first quarter ended December 26, 2009. The company posted a revenue of $15.68 billion and a net quarterly profit of $3.38 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share. These results are comparable to $11.88 billion revenue and a net quarterly profit of $2.26 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.               
	Gross margin was 40.9 per cent, up from 37.9 per cent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 58 per cent of the quarters revenue.              
	Apple sold 3.36 million Macintosh computers during the quarter, representing a 33 per cent increase over the year-ago period. It sold 8.7 million iPhones, representing 100 per cent growth. The company saw an 8 per cent decline in the sales of iPods, which stood at 21 million.              
	During the quarter, Apple adopted new financial accounting standards related to certain revenue recognition. Adoption of the new accounting standards significantly changes the way in which the company accounts for certain items, particularly sales of iPhone and Apple TV.              
	If you annualise our quarterly revenue, its surprising that Apple is now an over $50 billion company, said Steve Jobs, Apples chief executive officer.               
	The new products we are planning to release this year are very strong, starting this week with a major new product that were really excited about, he said.              
	We are very pleased to have generated $5.8 billion in cash during the quarter, said Peter Oppenheimer, Apples chief financial officer. Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2010, we expect revenues in the range of $11.0 billion to $11.4 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of about $2.06 to $2.18.              
	Apple began selling both iPhone and Apple TV in fiscal 2007, because of which the company retrospectively adopted the new accounting principles as if they had been applied in all prior periods. Consequently, the financial results of each quarter from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 have been revised. The company believes retrospective adoption provides analysts and investors the most comparable and useful financial information and reflects the underlying performance of the companys business better.

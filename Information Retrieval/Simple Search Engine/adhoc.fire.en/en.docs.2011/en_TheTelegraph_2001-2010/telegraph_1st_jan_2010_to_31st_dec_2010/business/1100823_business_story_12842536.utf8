          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Khullar: Watchful                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: The government in its annual review of the foreign trade policy (2009-2014) tomorrow is likely to offer sops to exporters in labour-intensive sectors such as textile, handicraft, carpet and leather amid fears over the health of the key US and European markets.        
	Commerce minister Anand Sharma could announce an incentive package as well as a simplification of procedures. Sources said the incentives could be in the form of increasing the number of items eligible for sops; besides exports to more countries would be eligible for relief.        
	Policy-makers are concerned that the recovery in the US and Europe are losing pace, and the situation from the second half of this fiscal can be very challenging.        
	According to commerce secretary Rahul Khullar, The era of 30 per cent export growth is over. We will have to be very circumspect about the high exports growth in the early part of this fiscal. Things are not going to be easy.         
	The second half is going to be tougher than the first half (of 2010-11). Exports may weaken in the coming months as the global economic recovery flounders.         
	President of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations A. Sakthivel said, Exporters are not expecting much in terms of the financial part of the Foreign Trade Policy, but I think the government would take some steps on the non-financial part.         
	He said he was expecting the streamlining of procedures for clearances through the reduction in transaction costs.        
	Fieo has sought the continuation of schemes such as the duty entitlement passbook and the export promotion capital goods schemes. It has asked for capping export credit at the base rate of banks so that exporters can get loans at about 8 per cent.         
	Sources said the government was expected to add more markets such as Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Nigeria and Vietnam under the Focus Market Scheme, while giving a thrust to product diversification through the Focus Product Scheme.

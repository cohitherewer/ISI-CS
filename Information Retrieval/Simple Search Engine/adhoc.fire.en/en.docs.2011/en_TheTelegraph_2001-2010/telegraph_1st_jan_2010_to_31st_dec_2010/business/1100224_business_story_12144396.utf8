          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: The commerce ministry plans to restructure the export incentives after April to help the sectors still struggling under the impact of the global economic slowdown.         
	The decision for any kind of change in the stimulus measures for the sectors coming out of the impact of the financial meltdown will be taken after March 31, minister of state for commerce and industry Jyotiraditya Scindia said at an industry event.        
	While tobacco, spices, man-made yarn, gems, jewellery and chemicals have shown satisfactory growth in the past few months, textiles, handicrafts, carpet and engineering goods are yet to come out of the woods.        
	After declining for 13 straight months, exports grew 18.2 per cent in November. Growth stood at 9.3 per cent and 11.5 per cent in December and January, respectively.        
	Textiles minister Dayanidhi Maran was in favour of the continuation of stimulus measures for some more time as the sector is yet to recover fully. Yes, we support the views of the industry and I am sure that they will be considered. Its not that we have jumped out of the recession and running, Maran said.        
	Ficci president Harsh Pati Singhania said, With the global recovery in its initial stages, the government should watch the export performance in 2010 before taking a call on the stimulus measures.

  - Apex bank raises two key rates        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                          
	Mumbai, July 27: The Reserve Bank of India today raised two key short-term lending and borrowing rates as part of its inflation-busting strategy.        
	The central bank raised the reverse repo by 50 basis points to 4.5 per cent - the fourth time this year that it has nudged up the key short-term rate. The reverse repo is the rate at which banks park surplus cash with the central bank.        
	The RBI also raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent. The repo is the rate at which the RBI lends overnight funds to banks in exchange for gilts.        
	Bankers said they wouldnt immediately raise rates on home, auto and personal loans  once again showing a deep reluctance to raise lending rates at a time bank credit growth isnt broad based.         
	The repo rate hike was on expected lines. I dont see an immediate hike in interest rates. But another round of hikes could prompt lenders to increase their interest rates, said Renu Sud Karnad, managing director of HDFC Ltd.         
	There will be no immediate impact on the interest rates. Banks are going to absorb it (the rate hikes), State Bank of India chairman .P. Bhatt told reporters at the RBI headquarters after a meeting with RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao.        
	Non-food credit provided by banks swelled over 22.3 per cent as on July 2  well above the 20 per cent target set in April. But thats been skewed by the borrowings by companies that grabbed telecom spectrum to offer 3G and broadband wireless services after a frenetic auction in mid-April and early May.        
	Some bankers felt that the rates could rise in a few months, starting with an increase in the rates on deposits that have shrunk sharply this year.        
	The RBI had raised the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 per cent on March 19  the first time since November 2008 when it had unveiled an expansionist monetary policy to tide over the effects of global recession. It followed that up with 25 basis point increases on April 20 and July 2.        
	The RBI said it would manage liquidity to ensure that it remained broadly in balance. It said it did not want to allow excess liquidity to dilute the effectiveness of policy rate actions.         
	Experts said this statement seemed to indicate that the central bank would not hesitate to raise the cash reserve ratio  currently pegged at 6 per cent  to soak up excess cash in the system.        
	The RBI also raised its forecast for economic growth to 8.5 per cent with an upward bias from the 8 per cent that it had projected in April.         
	It upped the forecast for inflation by the end of March next year to 6 per cent from 5.5 per cent earlier.        
	The dominant concern that has shaped the monetary policy stance in this review is high inflation With growth taking firm hold, the balance of policy stance has to shift decisively to containing inflation and anchoring inflationary expectations, Subbarao told reporters at a press conference after the central bank announced the first quarter review of the monetary policy.        
	Robust recovery        
	Subbarao said the policy actions were based on three major considerations.         
	While the domestic economic recovery is firmly in place and is strengthening, there is a need to contain demand-side inflationary pressures.        
	Moreover, there is a need to wind down some of the monetary measures taken to quell the effects of a global downturn without disrupting the economic recovery.        
	The RBI also announced that it would undertake mid-quarter reviews at an interval of about one-and-a-half months after each quarterly review. Such mid-quarter reviews will be in June, September, December and March.                                       
	Subbarao said the recovery process had consolidated and become more broad-based since April. Significantly, the better rainfall so far this year, could lead to improved farm sector prospects, thereby leading to a pick-up in rural demand.         
	This should give further momentum to the performance of the industrial sector which has been growing firmly. The strength of the recovery is also reflected in the sales and profitability growth of the corporate sector with more investment intentions being translated into action across a range of sectors, the RBI governor added.         
	He cautioned that while domestic drivers of growth were robust, any slowdown in the global recovery would affect all emerging economies including India.              
	In a rapidly evolving macroeconomic situation, we need to combine the rigour and comprehensiveness of the quarterly process with the responsiveness and flexibility of more frequent reviews, Subbarao said.

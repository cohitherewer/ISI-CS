The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Eveready net takes a hit
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Eveready net takes a hit
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, July 30: Eveready Industries India today reported a 5.55 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 15.15 crore for the quarter ended June against Rs 16.04 crore a year ago.        
	During the same period last year, we made a one time profit of Rs 3.9 crore from exceptional items. This impacted our net profit during the April-June quarter, chairman Deepak Khaitan said.        
	According to him, the price of zinc, which constitutes 17 per cent of input costs, stood at $2,314 a tonne against $1,390 last year. So our margins were impacted, he said.        
	Eveready, which manufactures flashlights, lighting products and packet tea, might hive off its mosquito repellant business within a year because of poor returns.         
	We have given it another year and if the turnover crosses Rs 50 crore, then only we will continue it, Khaitan said.

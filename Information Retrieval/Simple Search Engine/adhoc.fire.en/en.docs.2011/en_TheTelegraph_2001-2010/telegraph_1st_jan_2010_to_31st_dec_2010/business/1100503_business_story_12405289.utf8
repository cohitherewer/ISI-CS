                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bid to rein in credit card rates
                            
	New Delhi, May 2 (PTI): A Parliamentary committee has suggested that RBI should prescribe the maximum interest rates that can be charged by banks from its credit card customers.        
	Maximum interest rates to be charged (by banks from credit card customers) may be specified so as not to allow exploitation of customers, a report of the standing committee on finance said.        
	The committee did not agree with the contention of the finance ministry that credit card dues were in the nature of non-priority sector personal loans and, hence, the banks should be free to decide the interest rates.        
	The RBIs circular, covering various aspects of credit card operations of banks, has not been of much help in addressing the grievances of the general public, the committee noted. The effectiveness of such circulars in bringing down credit card related complaints is doubtful given the past record, the report said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: A revamped wholesale price index showed inflation dipping to 8.51 per cent in August but remaining well above the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank, which is expected to raise interest rates at its policy review on Thursday.        
	Inflationary pressure is still there as food prices have gone up because of the erratic monsoon and certain other things. The RBI is constantly watching the situation. We are in touch with the RBI. The central bank and the ministry of finance will take appropriate measures at an appropriate time, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said.        
	Wholesale price index-based inflation for August stood at 8.51 per cent according to the new series of inflation data based on 2004-05 prices against 9.78 per cent in July.        
	Using an old index with 1993-94 as the base year, inflation for August was pegged at 9.50 per cent against 9.97 per cent in July.        
	The new WPI series has 241 new items, including ice-cream, microwave ovens, mineral water and dish antenna, in the basket of commodities to reflect changes in the price line and consumption patterns better.        
	It (the new index) will help in informing both the government and people how prices are moving. This will give a robust picture and reflect actual price movement, commerce minister Anand Sharma told reporters here after releasing the new series of data.        
	Economists expect food prices to begin easing from October when summer crops will arrive in the market. This years monsoon has improved the prospects of a good harvest.        
	Data showed that food articles became 14.64 per cent dearer in August year-on-year, while prices of non-food articles such as fibre and oilseeds soared 16.04 per cent. Minerals became 23.82 per cent more expensive.        
	The RBI should take note of the fact that the current high inflation is not because of inflation in manufacturing items. The inflation is mainly because of high food and primary article inflation, which was not fully reflected in the old series, industry secretary Rajinder Pal Singh said.        
	He said inflation would decline in the coming months because of good monsoon. High inflation was also because of the base effect of last year.         
	The new data series shows the price index for manufactured products to be up 4.8 per cent year-on-year in August, while primary articles index rose 15.8 per cent and fuel index was up 12.5 per cent.        
	Shanto Ghosh, principal economist of Deloitte, said, An inflation of near 10 per cent is still very high and the RBI may not deviate from its ongoing stance of tightening monetary policy in its next review.

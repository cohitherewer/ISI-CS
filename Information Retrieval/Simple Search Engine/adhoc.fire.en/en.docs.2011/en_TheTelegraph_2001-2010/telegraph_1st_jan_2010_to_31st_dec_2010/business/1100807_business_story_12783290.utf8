The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pranab, Asim meet to break GST deadlock
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Pranab, Asim meet to break GST deadlock
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee: Soft approach                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: Asim Dasgupta, who is heading the state finance ministers panel on goods and services tax (GST), today met Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to streamline the process of introducing the new tax regime.        
	The proposed GST is under threat of getting derailed by states refusal to cede greater constitutional powers to the Centre and bring oil products within the fold of the tax system.        
	The meeting comes a day after Mukherjees reassurance to the states that he does not intend to become a super finance minister  referring to the veto power given to the Centre in the draft GST bill. I have no intention of becoming the super finance minister..., Mukherjee said yesterday.        
	This has been a very useful meeting with the Union finance minister aimed at a convergence on issues related to the constitutional amendment for GST. This is the closest to convergence, Dasgupta said.        
	On the demand of the states to exclude petroleum products from GST, Dasgupta said, Only after discussing with the state finance ministers in the empowered committee, I can comment on it.        
	On Wednesday, the empowered committee of state finance ministers on GST had rejected a draft constitutional amendment bill prepared by the Centre on the ground that it gives the Union finance minister veto power on state taxation issues. The states feared that the veto right would dilute their fiscal autonomy.                  Dasgupta: In search of solution      
	The states have asked the Centre to give at least a month to provide a detailed response to the legal changes proposed by the government. The states have suggested that the chairman of the GST council should be appointed on a rotational basis. States also feel that the GST dispute authority should not find a place in the amendment bill and might be incorporated in legislations, Dasgupta had said.                           
	GST could not be implemented this fiscal because of differences between the states and the Centre. The new deadline is April 1, 2011.                                 
	Mukherjee tabled the bill in the current session of Parliament to avoid delays.        
	A constitutional amendment bill is required to give powers to states to levy service tax and the Centre to impose tax beyond production.        
	Last month, the finance minister had proposed a three-rate GST structure and also offered to compensate any loss suffered because of shifting to the new regime.        
	However, the finance minister may have to relax other terms as well to convince the states. Mukherjee has already given in to most of the demands of the states  dual rate structure, keeping alcohol and petroleum products out of GST and full compensation  to facilitate the tax reform.                    
	They (states) will have their rights and I shall have my rights...They have a responsibility to their states. That basic structure cannot be altered, he had said.

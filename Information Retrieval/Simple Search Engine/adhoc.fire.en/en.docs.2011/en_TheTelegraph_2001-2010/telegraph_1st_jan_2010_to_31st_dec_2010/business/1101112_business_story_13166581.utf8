The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Weak global cues spoil sensex mood
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Weak global cues spoil sensex mood
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 11: The sensex plunged 286 points  its biggest one-month fall  to close at 20589.09 on Thursday as weak global cues and lacklustre buying hurt the Indian markets.         
	The broader 50-share Nifty fell 81 points to 6194.        
	Early gains of roughly 60 points on the Bombay Stock Exchange were wiped out as rumours of widespread selling in Asian markets gained ground.         
	Analysts attributed the decline of the sensex by 1.37 per cent to massive selling in Korea during the last few minutes of trade as US President Barack Obama failed to reach a free trade accord with the country during the G20 talks. A weakness in the European markets also contributed to the fall.        
	Market participants are also blaming the decline on lack of buying at higher levels as investors seek dips to enter the markets again.         
	Thursdays movements had more to do with weak global cues that dampened the sentiment, said ShareKhans head of research Gaurav Dua.         
	Last minute selling in the Korean markets led to the fall, said brokerage house Motilal Oswals associate director Manish Shah. He, however, saw the fall as a blip in the upward movement of the benchmark index. We will start to worry when the Nifty falls to 5950 points, Shah said.        
	Dua echoed a similar sentiment. We are still bullish on the medium to long term, he said.        
	Marketmen are largely seeing dips in the sensex as an opportunity to buy for those participants who have been waiting on the sidelines.         
	Some analysts said another factor weighing on the market was the tight liquidity as a result of a spate of recent initial public offerings and follow-on offers.        
	Stocks across the board were hit on the BSE, including oil and gas, realty, information technology, banks and FMCG.         
	All 13 sectoral indices were in the red with realty worst hit with a 3.15 per cent decline as DLF recorded a 5 per cent fall in net profit during the second quarter of this financial year.        
	There were 1,696 declines against 1,288 advances out of a total of 3,103 scrips on the BSE.         
	The biggest gainers were Reliance Power, which rose 8.9 per cent, Hindalco (2.65 per cent) and Tata Power (1.47 per cent). The biggest losers were TVS Motors, which fell 5.36 per cent, DLF by 4.41 per cent, HPCL by 3.93 per cent and Reliance Industries by 1.85 per cent.

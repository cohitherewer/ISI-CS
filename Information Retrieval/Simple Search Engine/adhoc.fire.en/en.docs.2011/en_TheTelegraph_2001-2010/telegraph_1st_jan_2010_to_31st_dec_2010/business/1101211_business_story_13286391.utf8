	Mumbai, Dec. 10: The strong industrial growth led to a rebound in equities. The BSE sensex rose more than 266 points to close at 19508.89, while all the sectoral indices ended with gains.         
	The sensex opened lower at 19201.89 with investors adopting a cautious stance following Thursdays slide. It hit a low of 19074.57 before momentum returned on the news of the robust factory growth.         
	According to market circles, bargain hunting along with optimism regarding economic growth drove buying in various counters.         
	The Nifty of the NSE followed a similar trend and ended 90.85 points, or 1.58 per cent, higher at 5857.35.         
	Reliance Industries, which has the largest weightage on the sensex, soared 4 per cent to give a much needed push to the broader market.         
	Financial institutions, which have been battered over the past few sessions, witnessed buying. While ICICI Bank rose 5.71 per cent, the State Bank of India finished with a gain of 1.87 per cent.

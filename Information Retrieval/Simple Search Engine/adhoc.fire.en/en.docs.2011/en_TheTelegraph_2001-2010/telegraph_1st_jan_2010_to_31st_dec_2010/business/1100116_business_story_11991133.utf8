          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 15: HDFC Bank today led a batch of banks that announced stellar profits in the third quarter, underpinned by a sharp surge in interest income on the loans they give out.        
	The countrys second largest private bank  HDFC Bank  has been consistently posting a profit growth in the region of 30 per cent.         
	On Friday, it reported a net profit of Rs 818.5 crore, a rise of nearly 32 per cent over Rs 621.74 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	Analysts had expected the bank to report profits of around Rs 800 crore.        
	Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, IDBI Bank and Uco Bank, which also reported results for the third quarter ended December 31, surmounted worries on the Street that their net profits might be crimped by the slow growth in credit offtake and the squeeze on treasury income.        
	The banks continued to make money from fee-based income (earned from selling third-party products such as mutual funds and life insurance) and their core operations. This more than offset the reversals on the treasury business as the yields on government bonds rose during the period amid worries that the central bank might signal an increase in interest rates later this month.        
	Paresh Sukhtankar, executive director of HDFC Bank, told reporters that the strong bottomline growth came largely as a result of a good growth in its net interest income (NII).         
	NII represents a banks core income and it is the difference between interest earned and interest paid. One of the reasons for the rise in NII despite the challenging conditions is that banks have been able to maintain better margins or hold on to them as the cost of deposits have fallen more than the yield on advances. NII of HDFC Bank increased 12.4 per cent to Rs 2,223.9 crore, driven by asset growth.        
	Another factor that contributed to the good profit growth was the lower provisions during the period. Provisions and contingencies for the quarter were Rs 447.7 crore against Rs 531.8 crore for the corresponding quarter ended December 31, 2008.        
	More surprises        
	Axis Bank also surprised analysts with a strong set of numbers because of a hefty jump both in its NII and other income. Net profit of the bank rose nearly 31 per cent to Rs 655.98 crore compared with Rs 500.86 crore in the same period last year. It notched up a 45 per cent growth in its NII which stood at Rs 1349.11 crore (Rs 929.68 crore).         
	Uco Bank, the nationalised bank, saw profits surge by 43.22 per cent to Rs 245.82 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, over the same period in the previous fiscal. Total income of the bank increased to Rs 2,608.7 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, against Rs 2,433.52 crore in the corresponding period last year.        
	A strong NII powered IndusInd Bank to report a 95 per cent growth in net profit. The banks net profit grew to Rs 88.04 crore from Rs 45.06 crore in the same period last year as NII stood at Rs 237.70 crore (Rs 1,16.58 crore), a growth of 104 per cent.         
	IDBI Bank also beat analysts estimates with a 28.98 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 287.15 crore for the quarter.

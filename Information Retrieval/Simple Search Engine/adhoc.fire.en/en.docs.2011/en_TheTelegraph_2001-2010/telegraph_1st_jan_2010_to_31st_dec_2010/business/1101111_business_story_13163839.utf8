	Calcutta, Nov. 10: Top domestic steel companies are keen to develop iron ore mines in war-ravaged Afghanistan.        
	The Tatas, the Mittals, the Essar group, Vedanta and Ispat are among those interested, Wahidulla Shahrani, minister of mines of Afghanistan, said today. Afghanistan also has huge deposits of copper, lithium and oil and gas.        
	The large Hajigak iron ore deposit  located about 100km west of Kabul in the Bamyan province  is up for international bidding. The bidding will close by January 13. The mine contains 2-billion-tonne reserves with 62 per cent ferrous content, Shahrani said at a mining conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry here.        
	The project may attract investments worth $6 billion over the years. The mine can produce around 10 million tonnes of ore a year.        
	The minister allayed fears about law and order problems in Afghanistan where the US was reviewing the option to withdraw its troop in a phased manner.        
	However, Indian industry is cautious. Partha Sengupta, vice-president (raw material) of Tata Steel, said it was too early to comment whether his company would invest in Afghanistan. The geo-political situation is volatile. We need to be cautious.        
	The minister said a special security force had been set up to protect investments in mines.         
	When people see development around them, they tend to support the project, Shahrani said.

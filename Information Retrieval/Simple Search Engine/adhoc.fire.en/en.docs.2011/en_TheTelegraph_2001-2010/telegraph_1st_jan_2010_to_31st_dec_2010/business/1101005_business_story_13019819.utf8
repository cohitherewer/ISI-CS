The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deora backs ONGC bid for BP block
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Deora backs ONGC bid for BP block
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Evincing interest                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: ONGCs plan to raise its stake in BPs Vietnam gasfield gathered momentum today with oil minister Murli Deora pitching for it.        
	Deora discussed ONGC Videshs keen interest in buying BPs stake in Vietnam during dinner with BPs chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg and newly appointed chief executive, Robert Dudley, who is visiting the country just three days after assuming office.        
	Sources said the two leaders discussed ONGC Videshs bid for BPs 35 per cent stake in Block 6.1 in Nam Con Son basin, off Vietnams southeast coast. At present, OVL holds 45 per cent interest in the block and Petro Vietnam has 20 per cent.        
	Both OVL and Petro Vietnam were interested in jointly buying BPs stake in the Nam Con Son project, which consisted of two offshore gasfields, a pipeline and a power project.         
	At present, the consortium of OVL, BP and Petro Vietnam produce around 14 million standard cubic metres a day of gas, which supports about 30 per cent of Vietnams power generation capacity.        
	The British energy major was hit by the worst oil spill in history in the Gulf of Mexico of the US and had to cough up billions of dollars to seal the wells as well as compensate the affected for environmental damages.         
	BP was forced to put a slew of assets across the globe on the block.         
	It is considering the sale of fields in Colombia, Venezuela and Vietnam to finance its liability.         
	Chinas CNOOC and Sinopec and Thailands PTTEP are likely to show interest in BPs Vietnam stake, sources said, adding that ONGCs presence in the project gives it an edge.        
	National oil companies usually hold the right of first refusal in case an overseas partner decides to exit a block.        
	However, it is not clear whether such provisions are there in the production sharing contract, which was signed in 1998 when resource nationalism in oil and gas-rich countries was still not so strong.         
	The exploration licence for the block was acquired by OVL in 1998. Following the foreign exchange crisis in Vietnam, it had to rope in BP as partner, with 35 per cent participating interest.         
	The consortium has developed the Lan Tay field in the block. During 2008-09, OVLs share of production from the project was about 1.848 billion cubic meter (bcm) of gas and 0.046 million metric tonne (mmt) of condensate.

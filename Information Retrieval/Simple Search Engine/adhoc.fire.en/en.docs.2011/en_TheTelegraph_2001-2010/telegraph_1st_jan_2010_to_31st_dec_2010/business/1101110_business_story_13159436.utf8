	Calcutta, Nov. 9: Power Grid Corporation of India, which plans to mop up Rs 3,700 crore through its follow-on public offer, is targeting a revenue of Rs 800-900 crore from the telecom business.         
	Last month, the company had invited tenders to rent out 20,000 transmission towers in Jammu amp; Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to telecom players. Already six to seven large telecom tower infrastructure providers bought tender documents, director (project) I.S. Jha said. The tender is scheduled to open on November 22.        
	In May, PowerGrid had appointed Booz amp; Co to evaluate business diversification. Booz had suggested renting out its towers to instal antennas for mobile communication and wireless applications. PowerGrid had appointed KPMG to study the feasibility of leasing out its towers.         
	According to KPMG, 15 per cent of our 1,50,000 towers are capable of transmitting high-voltage power and ether wave without interfering with each other, Jha said.        
	In fact, we are running a pilot project on tower renting in Gangtok where Vodafone has taken one tower on lease and pays a rent of Rs 2.5 lakh per annum, he said.        
	PowerGrid provides telecom network, including private leased line and Internet bandwidth services, through its overhead optic fibre network under the PowerTel brand.         
	We earn a revenue of Rs 366 crore from this business. The revenue from tower renting business will be an add-on to this, R.T. Agarwal, executive director (finance), said.        
	Follow-on offer        
	The Rs 7,600-crore PowerGrid follow-on offer was subscribed 1.08 times on the first day today. The FPO attracted bids for 90.53 crore shares against 84.17 crore on offer according to NSE data.        
	While the portion reserved for qualified institutional buyers was subscribed 2.09 times, the retail category was subscribed 0.06 times.

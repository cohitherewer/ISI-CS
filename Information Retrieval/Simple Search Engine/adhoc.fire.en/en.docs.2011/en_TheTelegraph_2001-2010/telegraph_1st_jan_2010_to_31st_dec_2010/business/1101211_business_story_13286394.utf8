          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 10: Reliance MediaWorks and Inox Leisure today announced their open offers to the shareholders of Fame India to gain control of the company. Both the offers are from December 16 to January 4.         
	This follows the green signal by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to the companies to proceed with their open offers. The approval comes nearly eight months after the two had expressed their interest in acquiring the multiplex operator.         
	Inox had announced its open offer at a price of Rs 51 per share aggregating around Rs 42 crore, while the Anil D. Ambani group firm had priced its offer at Rs 83 per share.         
	Reliance MediaWorks holds a little less than 16 per cent in Fame India, acquired from the open market. Inox owns 50.02 per cent.         
	ICICI Securities, managing the offer made by Reliance MediaWorks along with Reliance Capital Partners and Reliance Capital Ltd, today said the offer would open on December 16 and end on January 4. The offer is for 2.17 crore shares, representing 62.36 per cent of Fame Indias equity capital.         
	It remains to be seen whether Inox revises its offer price, a possibility which market circles do not rule out.        
	In its letter of offer sent to Fame India shareholders, Inox has said its offer will open on December 16 and run till January 4. The last date for revising the price is December 24. Inox wants to acquire around 82.32 lakh shares.         
	The battle for Fame began when its promoters sold a 43 per cent stake to Inox for Rs 44 per share.         
	Subsequently, Inox picked up 7 per cent from the market and took its stake to over 50 per cent. Inox made the mandatory open offer for an additional 20 per cent at Rs 51 per share, while Reliance MediaWorks made an offer for Rs 180 crore at Rs 83 per share.

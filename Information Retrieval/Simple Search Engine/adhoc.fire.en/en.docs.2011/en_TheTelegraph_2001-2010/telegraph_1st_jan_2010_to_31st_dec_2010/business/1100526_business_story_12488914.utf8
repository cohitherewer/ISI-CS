	Calcutta, May 25: Bajaj Auto, which is developing power bikes jointly with Austrias KTM, hopes to bring in a new model next fiscal.        
	The product will be launched in Europe first and then we will bring it to India during the next financial year, S. Sridhar, chief executive officer (Bajaj Autos two-wheeler unit), said here today.        
	In India, the bike will be assembled at the companys plant in Pune and marketed under the KTM brand. It will be priced at more than Rs 100,000, Sridhar said.         
	Bajaj Auto had invested 20 million euros to raise shareholding in KTM to 35.7 per cent from 31.9 per cent.         
	Sridhar said profit margins would be less affected in the near future though input costs had increased substantially. The company is focusing on expensive bikes as Bajaj Autos majority sales were in the mid-priced section.

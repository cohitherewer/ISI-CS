          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 28: Tata Steel, the countrys largest steel producer, today dished out a pleasant surprise when it posted better-than-expected profits for the third quarter ended December 31, 2009 as demand for the commodity improved from consuming industries.        
	On a stand-alone basis, Tata Steel posted a net profit of Rs 1,191.75 crore compared with Rs 466.24 crore in the same period last year, a surge of nearly 156 per cent. This number came ahead of analyst estimates of around Rs 1,000-crore profit for the period.        
	The better demand environment was visible when net sales jumped to Rs 6,307.48 crore from Rs 4,750.61 crore a year back, a rise of nearly 33 per cent.         
	During the quarter, steel sales jumped to 1,596,487 tonnes from 1,071,805 tonnes in the previous year. Analysts had estimated the company to record net sales of around Rs 5,900 crore.        
	Analysts explained that a strong demand from the automobile and construction sectors was responsible for the better than expected performance.         
	Since the second half of this fiscal, the automobile industry has been witness to robust sales, and this has pushed up its demand for raw materials such as steel.        
	Apart from the better demand scenario, Tata Steel was helped by lower raw material costs which came down to Rs 1,422.31 crore (Rs 1,610.27 crore).         
	Other income also shot up to Rs 263.56 crore from Rs 11.72 crore in the year-ago period. Tata Steel did not provide details on what comprised this other income.        
	The good results led to a rally in the Tata Steel scrip, which ended higher by 4.81 per cent, or Rs 26.85, to Rs 585.55 on the BSE today.        
	It also came on a day when the company announced a joint venture with Japans Nippon Steel Corporation to make cold-rolled flat products for the automobile industry.

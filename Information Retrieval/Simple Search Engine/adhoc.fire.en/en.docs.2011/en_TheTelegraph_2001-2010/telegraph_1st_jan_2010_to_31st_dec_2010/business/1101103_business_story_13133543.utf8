          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Expanding reach                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: Milwaukee-based iconic bike maker Harley-Davidson will set up a factory in India in the first half of 2011 to assemble some models.        
	The plant, which will be built near Bawal in Haryana, will assemble motorcycles from parts produced by the firms factories in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Missouri in the US, as well as by its component suppliers.         
	For Harley-Davidson, this will be the second assembly unit outside the US after Brazil.        
	This investment will allow Harley-Davidson to improve market responsiveness and production flexibility, while reducing the tariff burden, which we expect will drive growth over time by making our bikes more accessible to Indias consumers, said Matthew S. Levatich, president and chief operating officer of Harley-Davidson.        
	Harley-Davidson, which started its India operations in August 2009, sells 12 models imported from the US and priced between Rs 6.95 lakh and Rs 34.95 lakh.        
	These are available in New Delhi, Mumbai, Chandigarh and Hyderabad.        
	We are building a strong foundation in India, first by establishing a dealer network, and now by commencing CKD (completely knocked down) assembly operations, said Anoop Prakash, managing director of Harley-Davidson India.        
	The bike maker has given a three-year contract to AT amp;T India to provide network services connecting its offices in India to the US headquarters.         
	Bike sales in the country have grown 25.86 per cent between April and September, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.        
	Local players such as Hero Honda, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor have seen rising sales this year as the rapidly expanding economy continues to pull buyers.         
	Besides Harley-Davidson, other players, including Ducati, Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha have launched high-end bikes.        
	Last month, Germanys BMW said it would launch its Motorrad range of premium motorcycles through exclusive outlets.         
	It initially plans to import the bikes and sell them through outlets in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. Sales of these bikes, priced at Rs 18-20 lakh, are likely to begin from December.        
	Some of the models that the company plans to bring are the R 1200 GS, S 1000 RR and the bigger K series bikes with 4-cylinder engines. The Motorrads will be imported as completely built units from Berlin.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 22: The government today said it was not worried about the current level of steel prices and it did not expect extreme volatility in the coming months.        
	However, it plans to hike the export duty on iron ore lumps to keep domestic prices of the vital raw material in check.        
	Steel producers and government officials today held a meeting on prices.         
	Producers such as Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India Limited had raised prices by around Rs 6,000 a tonne over the last two months.        
	Steel prices have increased but not alarmingly. There is no reason for anxiety about prices in the next 5-6 months. We dont see extreme volatility in prices in the next few months, steel secretary Atul Chaturvedi said after the meeting.        
	Asked whether prices will go up, he said this was unlikely in the near future.         
	Volatile input cost is no reason for the price speculation. The increase in steel prices has had some impact on the demand of consumer products, he said.        
	Chaturvedi said that the export duty on iron ore lumps might go up.        
	The export duty on iron ore lumps may go up from the current 10 per cent. A decision could be taken soon, he said.        
	Prices are moving upwards on the back of a rise in the cost of vital raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal as well as high demand from consuming sectors such as automobile and infrastructure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Philips needs cash
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Philips needs cash
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sivaraman: Growth focus                                  
	Calcutta, June 28: Philips Electronics India Ltd plans to increase its borrowing limits to Rs 1,000 crore for acquisitions and capacity expansion.        
	The company will seek shareholders approval for this at its annual general meeting tomorrow. At present, it can borrow up to Rs 400 crore.        
	We are open to buyouts, preferably in the lighting and healthcare space. We will also go for acquisitions in the consumer lifestyle segment if something reasonable comes up. However, nothing is in hand right now, managing director and CEO Murali Sivaraman said here today.        
	Last year, the company acquired Indian healthcare equipment firms Alpha X-Ray Technologies and Meditronics.        
	Philips is also planning to enter the mother and baby care segment in the third quarter of 2010. We had plans to start within the second quarter, but things got delayed because of regulatory issues, Sivaraman said.         
	The company had acquired Britains Avent in 2006 and sells mother and baby care products under the Philips Avent brand. The same brand will be marketed in India, he said.        
	Philips Electronics India, which has been buying back shares from its minority shareholders to raise the holding of the promoter company Koninklijke Philips Electronics, will not tread the buyback route this year. Koninklijke holds around 96 per cent in Philips Electronics.

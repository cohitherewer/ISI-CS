	Mumbai, Oct. 1: The stock markets remained unfazed by the Sebi move against FIIs today as continued inflows from them saw the benchmark sensex gaining 376 points to touch its highest level in nearly 32 months.        
	The 30-share index breached the 20400-mark to end at 20445.04, with realty and metal stocks leading the surge.         
	With FII flows not showing any signs of abating despite some concerns over the speed of the current rally, market mavens reckon the sensex can breach its all-time peak recorded in January 2008 by the end of this calendar year, if not by Diwali.        
	After opening marginally higher at 20094, the index did not show any signs of fatigue as it rose to an intra-day high of 20475.47 points and later ended at 20445.04, a rise of 375.92 points, or 1.87 per cent.         
	Index heavyweight Reliance Industries, which has been hammered in the past few trades, bounced back smartly and ended 2.04 per cent higher at Rs 1,006.45. Metal stocks shone with Sterlite rising 5.13 per cent, Hindalco 3.81 per cent, Jindal Steel 3.42 per cent and Tata Steel 2.46 per cent. Auto stocks were in top gear on robust sales in September. M amp;M jumped 2.91 per cent, Tata Motors 1.96 per cent and Maruti Suzuki 2.89 per cent.         
	The wide-based 50-share Nifty index of the National Stock Exchange rose 1.88 per cent to 6143.40, with the maximum contribution coming from realty, metal, consumer goods and IT stocks.

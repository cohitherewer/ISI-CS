          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, Jan. 10: Indian companies are likely to enjoy a sustained period of rising incomes and profits starting with the announcements of the third-quarter results from Tuesday, analysts said.         
	Opinion is almost unanimous on companies coming up with strong numbers in the October-December quarter on the back of a good show by several industries, led by automobiles; besides, the impact of a low base effect vis-a-vis the third quarter of 2008-09 should translate into higher percentage increases.        
	For the future, brokerages optimism has been fuelled by a recovering global economy and expectations about local giants such as Reliance Industries performing well in the coming months.         
	Motilal Oswal in a recent report has even gone on to say that the Indian markets have witnessed four distinct earnings cycles in the past 18 months; and the stage is now set for the beginning of a new cycle of earnings growth.        
	The brokerage estimates the sensex earnings per share to show a compounded annual growth rate of 23 per cent from 2009-10 to 2013-14, against the negative 1 per cent estimated in 2007-08 till 2009-10. The new cycle of earnings growth should drive markets.         
	In the third quarter of 2009-10, automobiles will outshine others on the back of continuing strong sales and increased availability of finance, ensuring that the overall performance of firms is strong vis--vis the same period last year.        
	Passenger car as well as two-wheeler companies will see a surge in their bottomlines.         
	Margins are expected to be stable, though raw material prices are rising.        
	According to Surjit Arora, auto analyst with Prabhudas Lilladher, commercial vehicles have also witnessed a consistent rise in volumes on account of better highways and steel and iron ore firms using road transport.        
	Arora projects the automobile segment to post a 116 per cent growth in net profit and a 31 per cent growth in net sales.        
	Besides automobiles, metals, capital goods, cement, sugar and pharmaceuticals are expected to do well.        
	Cement will benefit from strong volume growth and better operating margins.        
	An improved demand will see the steel industry reporting good numbers, though prices have fallen over most of the quarter.         
	With the prices of base metals surging in the third quarter, non-ferrous metal players such as Sterlite are expected to do well.        
	The laggards        
	The outlook for telecom is not good as the fierce tariff war can hurt the industrys average revenue per user.        
	The forecast is mixed for IT. While the 3.6 per cent appreciation of the rupee against the dollar is likely to hurt the industry, it will be balanced by cross-currency movements and better volumes.         
	Salary hike is another factor which is likely to affect margins.        
	Sharekhan says IT companies will exceed their third-quarter dollar revenue guidances.         
	Angel Broking, on the other hand, expects the quarter to be a modest one if the results of IT firms are compared on a sequential basis.        
	The prospects are not bright for banks, either, because of low credit growth.         
	Profits from treasury gains are also expected to take a hit because of a rise in the yields of government bonds.

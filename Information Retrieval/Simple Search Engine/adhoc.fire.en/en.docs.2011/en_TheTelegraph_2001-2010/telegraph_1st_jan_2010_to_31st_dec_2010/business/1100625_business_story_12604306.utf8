	New Delhi, June 24 (PTI): After spending 33 years at Unilever, M.S. Banga, popularly known as Vindi, has joined private equity fund Clayton, Dubilier amp; Rice (CD amp;R).

	Banga, a member of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs council of trade and industry since 2004, has also served as CMD of Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), Unilevers operating company in India.        
	HUL is the largest consumer products company and one of the most valuable companies on the Indian stock markets.         
	Earlier this month, HUL said it would buy back up to Rs 630 crore of shares at a price not exceeding Rs 280. The purchases will be made periodically from the open market.         
	The company recorded a 47 per cent increase in net profit in the fourth quarter of 2009-10 as it made a large onetime exceptional gain during the period.

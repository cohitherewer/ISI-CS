	Prior to the IPO, AT amp;T was granted some share options and the company decided to exercise this option, the source added.         
	Tech Mahindra had come out with its share flotation in August 2006.        
	Tech Mahindras shareholding data sourced from the stock exchanges show that the two promoters held 82.98 per cent at the end of December 31.        
	Of this, while M amp;M holds 43.99 per cent and BT 30.86 per cent. The remaining 8.13 per cent stake belongs to Mahindra-BT Investment Company, Mauritius.         
	The announcement came after market hours. Earlier, the Tech Mahindra scrip closed at Rs 910.20, down 0.18 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | AIG-Prudential deal off
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      AIG-Prudential deal off
          MARY WILLIAMS WALSH AMP; MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED                          Quit call                                  
	New York, June 2: The American International Group scuttled the deal to sell its huge Asian life insurance arm to Prudential of Britain for about $35 billion, in a major setback to repaying the government for its 2008 rescue.         
	Trying to appease its angry shareholders, Prudential had kept the faltering transaction alive by lowering its price for the unit to $30.37 billion at the last minute. But AIG rejected that proposal, issuing a terse statement on Tuesday that it would not consider revisions of the original terms.         
	On Wednesday, Prudential withdrew its bid and said it would pay a breakup fee of 152.6 million, or $223.7 million, to AIG.         
	Two months ago, AIG heralded the sale of its prized Asian subsidiary  American International Assurance, or AIA  as a quick, breakthrough solution to raise money.         
	AIG has tried to disentangle its network of subsidiaries and sell them for the best returns, in part because markets are inhospitable and potential buyers include rivals looking for a fire sale.         
	Even in good times few companies would have the ability to buy a company as big and diverse as AIA. With Prudential no longer in the picture, AIG has no obvious suitor and may have to revert to its previous plan of selling the Asian subsidiary in an initial public offering, probably on the Hong Kong stock exchange.         
	Robert H. Benmosche, chief executive of AIG, said in a letter to his staff on Tuesday that the company will have several options to consider regarding AIA  more than we did in March. He did not reveal them, but said because of progress in other areas, we have more flexibility regarding timing than just a few months ago.         
	In 2009, AIG was just weeks away from offering its subsidiarys stock on the Hong Kong stock exchange when Benmosche became chief executive and said he thought the company was selling its units too quickly, and for too little.         
	He commenced talks with Prudential, convincing sceptical AIG directors that the sale would prove more beneficial than an initial public offering, which would take much longer.

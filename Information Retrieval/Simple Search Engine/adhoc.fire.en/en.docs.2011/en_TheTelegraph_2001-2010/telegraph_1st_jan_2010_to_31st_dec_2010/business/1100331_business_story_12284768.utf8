The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fresh portability date
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fresh portability date
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 30: The government has fixed June 30 as the new date to launch mobile number portability.        
	The facility was scheduled to be implemented from January 1 in the metros and category A circles, while the rest of the country was slated to have it from April.        
	Portability allows customers to change operators while retaining their numbers. Subscribers will be charged a maximum Rs 19 for the service, and the process will take four days, according to telecom regulator Trais norms.        
	The portability deadline has been moved as companies need more time to get ready for the implementation, said DoT officials.        
	Availability of number portability is expected to increase the overall churn in the industry, especially in the case of top operators in each circle. Moreover, operational costs for existing players could increase as they would be forced to provide additional incentives to retain customers.        
	While there is no restriction on the number of times a subscriber can switch operators, the change can be made only after a gap of three months from the date of activation of a number or the date of the previous switch.         
	It would take four days for a subscriber to switch between operators and porting charges would be payable by the subscriber to the recipient operator  the operator to whom the subscriber wants to port his number, said Trai. Porting is the process of moving from one operator to another.        
	New telecom operators may approach corporate houses to acquire a large chunk of customers at one go by forgoing porting charges and offering other attractive deals, said analysts.

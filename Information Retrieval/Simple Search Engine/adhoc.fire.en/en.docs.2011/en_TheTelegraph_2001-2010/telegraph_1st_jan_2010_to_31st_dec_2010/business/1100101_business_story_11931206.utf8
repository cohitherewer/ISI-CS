	Calcutta, Dec. 31: The government cannot continue with the economic stimulus packages for long but is not in favour of withdrawing them in a haste either, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.        
	Our aim is to maintain economic growth and stimulus measures should not be withdrawn in a haste. It is too early and it can have adverse impact on the economy.         
	However, the measures cannot be prolonged as it will increase government borrowing and public debt and prevent the private sector from accessing resources, Mukherjee said at a function organised by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce.        
	The finance minister, however, refused to set a deadline to review the packages.        
	The government had infused Rs 2,20,000 crore into the economy through various stimulus measures between December 2008 and February 2009, which resulted in an increase in fiscal deficit to 6.8 per cent of the gross domestic product. Such a high deficit cannot be sustained. Again, it is too early to conclude that the economy has firmly come out of the morass, he said.        
	The finance minister, however, is confident that the second quarter growth rate of 7.9 per cent would be sustained for the rest of the year.         
	He sees overall growth for this fiscal at 7.5 per cent or more. Growth in the first quarter was 6.1 per cent.

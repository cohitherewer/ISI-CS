          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Loan Logic        
	Mumbai, Feb. 21: Bankers are expecting finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to make three key announcements in Fridays budget  extension of the farm loan waiver scheme till June, details on World Banks $2-billion capital support programme and tax-free status to banks proposed long-term infrastructure bonds.        
	Sources said poor rain had increased bad loans in farming, which might lead to the extension of the farm loan waiver scheme to June 30 from December.         
	The package, which was introduced in the 2008-09 budget by Mukherjees predecessor P. Chidambaram, underwent some modifications.         
	Firstly, the size of the waiver was hiked to over Rs 71,000 crore from Rs 60,000 crore. Second, the scheme was till June last year, but Mukherjee extended it till December in the 2009-10 budget. In the scheme, loans of small farmers and 25 per cent of dues of large farmers were waived.         
	We feel that the farm loan relief package is likely to be extended up to June 30, a PSU bank official said. An analyst from brokerage Sharekhan said such an extension would benefit nationalised banks such as Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda as the extension would mean lower non-performing assets at least in the short term.         
	For the period ended December 31, 2009, both these banks have reported bad loans from the debt waiver scheme amounting to Rs 360 crore and Rs 215 crore, respectively.        
	PSU bankers are also looking forward to details about the World Bank aid to nationalised banks. It is expected that the cash will be infused into those banks with low core capital. Dena Bank and Syndicate Bank could be among the few to benefit.         
	Those banks with a total capital adequacy ratio of less than 12 per cent may be recapitalised. It will be a positive for small government-owned banks as it will provide them adequate capital for growth for the next 2-3 years, an analyst at IIFL said.        
	Banks have long been rooting for tax incentives on their proposed long-term bonds to fund infrastructure projects. At present, they dont issue such bonds but fund infrastructure from loans of short-term projects.        
	Since infrastructure projects are long-gestation projects, this creates the possibility of asset-liability mismatch.

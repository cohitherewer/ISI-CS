The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stage set for coal mine auction 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stage set for coal mine auction 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jaiswal: Strict stance                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: Parliament today cleared a bill that will allow open bidding of coal mines among steel mills and power plants.        
	The lower house cleared an amendment to the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act (India) (MMRDA) of 1957 through a voice vote today, three days after the Rajya Sabha passed it.         
	The changes allow auction of coal blocks instead of the current norm of allocating coal mines to user industries, a process which has been criticised for breeding corruption. However, state-run Coal India will still be able to get coal blocks through allotments.         
	Coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said the government would soon bring in a bill that would ban illegal mining and guarantee equity stakes of mining projects to displaced locals.        
	Illegal mining will be banned in the days ahead, he said, referring to another bill that also seeks to amend the mining act to set up a regulator for the sector and to provide compensation to villagers and tribals displaced by mining. This new set of amendments will be brought through the MMRDA Bill 2010.         
	The Prime Ministers Office and the Planning Commission have long sought to bring in the auction system for coal and iron ore blocks similar to that of telecom auction. Mine auctions are expected to fetch state governments more money while bringing about transparency in the way user industries get coal mines.        
	There have been allegations in the past of rampant corruption in the process of allocating coal mines with accusations of bribery and favouritism. Mines sometimes have been allocated to firms which are mere paper entities.         
	However, ministries that look after interest of user industries, especially power, had represented that a 3G-type auction among limited user industries could drive up the cost of the final products on offer.        
	Power utilities work on a pass through basis with prices fixed by regulators on the basis of actual costs. Officials had pointed out that if the cost of fuel in coal-fired power plants were to go up by a huge margin because the cost of acquiring the mine was high, electricity costs would have to go up by that extent.        
	Plan panel advisers, however, said auctions were the only way to ensure investments of Rs 118,000 crore in order to ramp up production to 1,061 million tonnes a year by 2025.         
	Allocated resources are never exploited properly ... but once purchased at a fair auction at high prices, buyers will do their best to exploit the resources to extract profit from their investments, plan panel advisers said. Blocks that have been fully explored as well as those that need further exploration will be put up for bidding.

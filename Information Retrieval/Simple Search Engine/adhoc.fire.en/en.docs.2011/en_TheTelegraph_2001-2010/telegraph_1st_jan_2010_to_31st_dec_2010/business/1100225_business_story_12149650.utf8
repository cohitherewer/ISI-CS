The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wagons wobble
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Wagons wobble
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Commuters cross a railway line in Mumbai on Wednesday. (AFP)                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 24: Mamata Banerjees proposal to set up five wagon plants, and her target to buy 18,000 units next fiscal failed to boost investor confidence.         
	Shares of wagon makers such as Titagarh Wagons, Kalindee Rail Nirman and Texmaco fell 5-8 per cent after todays announcement as investors were not convinced about the governments ability to fund the projects, analysts said.        
	The government has set an annual spending target of Rs 41,426 crore and proposes to spend Rs 1,314 crore on wagons and other locomotives in 2010-11. The new wagon plants will be set up in the PPP model.         
	Wagon makers are worried that the railways will build its own capacity under the PPP model instead of buying from private companies, the analysts said.        
	There is tremendous opportunity for our company. The stock market is a little sensitive to the news that five coach factories will be set up. But as far as we are concerned, the future is very bright. My company expects 6,000-8,000 wagon orders from the railways in the short term, Texmaco vice-chairman Ramesh Maheshwari said.         
	Umesh Choudhury, vice-chairman of Titagarh Wagons, said, Mamata Banerjee has announced the plan to set up five wagon plants but we need to see what exactly is she talking about. My understanding is it will be for repair and maintenance. There is no clarity on it yet. Overall the budget was nice and it has provided a road map to the railways for the next 10 years. More orders are always welcome for the industry, Choudhury said.        
	Jessop chairman Pawan K. Ruia said companies would be happier if the target of procuring new wagons for the next year was increased from the level of the previous year.        
	Last year, Mamata had announced orders for 18,000 wagons, but the companies said the deals had not been finalised.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fortis counter-offer for Parkway
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fortis counter-offer for Parkway
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, July 1: Fortis Healthcare today responded to Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanahs bid to control Singapore-based Parkway Holdings by offering to acquire all the shares of the company.        
	Fortis, along with its promoters, has made an offer of S$3.80 a share to acquire Parkway against Khazanahs offer of S$3.78 a share.        
	In March, Fortis had acquired a 25 per cent stake in Parkway Holdings from TPG Capital. In May, Khazanah Nasional, which holds a little over 24 per cent, made an offer to increase its stake in Parkway to 51.5 per cent at a price of S$3.78 per share.         
	Fortis today countered the Khazanah move by offering to acquire the remaining 31.3 crore shares (around 75 per cent) of Parkway at a higher price of S$3.80 per share. This marks a slight premium to the offer made by the Malaysian state fund.         
	Parkway has a network of 16 hospitals with 3,400 beds spread across six countries in Asia, including India.         
	Though the Fortis offer is marginally higher than that of Khazanahs, observers feel the latter will soon revise its bid.         
	We are in for a bidding war between the two. The Fortis offer may only be at a slight premium to begin with, but it seems it wants to gain complete control over Parkway, an analyst with a domestic brokerage said.         
	The offer has been made by RHC Healthcare, a company jointly owned by RHC Holding  the holding company of Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh  and Fortis.         
	While Fortis holds 49 per cent, the Singh brothers have a 51 per cent stake.         
	Merger buzz        
	Royal Bank of Scotland and Macquarie Capital, advisers to RHC Healthcare, indicated plans of a merger between Fortis and Parkway. Observers are keen to know about the procedure since a cross-border merger (two entities in different nations) is not allowed. This has led to speculation that the Fortis promoters may look to delist the company.        
	The advisers said if RHC was successful in its offer, it would examine the possibility of consolidating the operations and businesses of the Fortis group with Parkway to create an integrated pan-Asian healthcare services entity with Parkway as the flagship vehicle.         
	One of the options currently being studied is that of consolidating the Fortis group into Parkway such that Parkway will have a majority equity interest in the Fortis group.         
	The combination of Parkway and the Fortis groups networks will create a leading integrated healthcare services provider in Asia.         
	The group will have a combined network of 54 hospitals with potential to grow in other markets such as the Gulf region, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand.         
	The announcement led to Fortiss shares gaining on the bourses today. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the scrip ended higher by 1.22 per cent at Rs 154.10.        
	The scrip opened on a strong note and surged 3.34 per cent to hit a high of Rs 157.35. On the NSE, it ended a tad lower with a 0.95 per cent gain at Rs 153.80.         
	The rise was significant as the benchmark sensex ended 191.57 points down at 17509.33.         
	Brokers said the markets reacted positively to the offer as it indicated that the Fortis balance sheet would not get stretched.

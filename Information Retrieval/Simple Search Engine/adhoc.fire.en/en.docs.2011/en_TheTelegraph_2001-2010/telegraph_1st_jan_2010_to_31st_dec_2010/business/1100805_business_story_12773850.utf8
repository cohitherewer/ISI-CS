	Calcutta, Aug. 4: ZTE Corporation is aiming for a minimum 30 per cent year-on-year revenue growth in India during 2010-11. The $9-billion Chinese telecom equipment maker earned $1 billion revenue from India last fiscal.         
	We have witnessed a slowdown in sales in India during the last few months following the governments curbs on telecom equipment vendors because of security reasons. We aim to grow by at least 30 per cent during the year, D.K. Ghosh, chairman of ZTE Telecom India, said here today.        
	The Centre had earlier modified rules for telecom operators and equipment vendors to address security-related concerns. We will comply with every rule that the government may come up with, he said.

	New Delhi, June 2: Petronet LNG  the countrys largest liquefied natural gas importer  today appointed Ashok Kumar Balyan as its new chief executive officer and managing director.        
	Balyan, who is the director for human resources and business development in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, has accepted the offer at a Petronet board meeting here today.        
	He will take over from Prosad Dasgupta, who will now reportedly look after ArcelorMittals power division.         
	Balyan, who is likely to join Petronet by the end of this month, is due to retire from ONGC on July 31, 2011, on attaining superannuation age of 60 years.        
	Being a private firm, the retirement age in Petronet is 65 years. Initially, Balyan will be appointed for five years, which can be further extended till he attains the age of 65 years.        
	The top post in Petronet fell vacant after Dasguptas early retirement. His five-year term would have ended on August 31 and he was eligible for a two-year extension till he attained the retirement age in 2012. He, however, quit the job last month.        
	Oil secretary S. Sundareshan is the Petronet chairman.         
	Four oil PSUs  ONGC, GAIL, Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corporation  hold a 12.5 per cent stake each in Petronet. French national gas firm Gaz de France is the strategic partner with a 10 per cent stake and the Asian Development Bank holds 5.2 per cent. The remaining 34.8 per cent is held by the public.

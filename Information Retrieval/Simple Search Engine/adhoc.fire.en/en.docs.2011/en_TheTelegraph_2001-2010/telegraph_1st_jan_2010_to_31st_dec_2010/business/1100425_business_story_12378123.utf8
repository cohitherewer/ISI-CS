          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 24: HDFC Bank today beat analyst estimates with a 32.6 per cent rise in net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2010.         
	Backed by a strong loan growth, net profit rose to Rs 836.62 crore compared with Rs 630.88 crore in the corresponding previous period.        
	Analysts had expected HDFC Bank to report a net profit of Rs 800 crore.         
	The better-than-expected growth in its bottomline came despite the bank taking a hit on account of rising bond yields.         
	A strong loan growth in a fast-recovering economy helped the bank post a 27 per cent growth in net interest income (NII), which is interest paid minus interest earned. NII for the bank grew 27 per cent to Rs 2,351.4 crore during the quarter.        
	While core operations witnessed a good growth at the private sector bank, other income showed a drop on a year-on-year basis.         
	For the quarter, other income (non-interest revenue) was Rs 903.6 crore, lower than Rs 1,114.69 crore in the same period last year.         
	The main contributor to other income for the quarter was fees and commissions of Rs 765.3 crore, a rise of 5.7 per cent from the preceding quarter, and 7.1 per cent from Rs 714.8 crore in the corresponding previous quarter.        
	HDFC Bank said its total balancesheet size increased 21.4 per cent from Rs 183,271 crore as on March 31, 2009 to Rs 222,459 crore. Total gross advances as on March 31, 2010 were Rs 127,262 crore, a growth of 27 per cent over the same time last year.         
	On the other hand, total deposits were at Rs 167,404 crore, a rise of 17.2 per cent from March 31, 2009.        
	Savings account deposits grew nearly 43 per cent compared with the previous year to reach Rs 49,877 crore, while current account deposits at Rs 37,227 crore registered a growth of around 31 per cent over the same period.         
	As a result, the core CASA ratio, which comprises a banks low- cost borrowings, was at 50 per cent of total deposits as on March 31, 2010 compared with 45 per cent as on March 31, 2009.        
	At its meeting held today, the HDFC Bank board recommended an enhanced dividend of Rs 12 per share against Rs 10 per share in the previous year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Biggest global airline set to take off
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Biggest global airline set to take off
          JAD MOUAWAD AMP; MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED                              
	New York, May 3: United Airlines and Continental Airlines have announced a $3-billion merger that would create the worlds biggest airline.         
	The all-stock deal will form a coast-to-coast American behemoth with a leading presence in the top domestic markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, along with an extended network to Asia, Latin America and Europe.         
	The deal was completed in a remarkably swift two weeks, and would give the airlines the muscle to fend off low-cost rivals at home and to take on foreign carriers abroad.         
	United is buying Continental, and the combined company will keep the United name and be based in Chicago. Jeffery A. Smisek, Continentals chief executive, will run the company. Assuming the deal wins antitrust approval, the merged airline will replace Delta AirLines as the top carrier.         
	The boards of both companies met on Sunday to approve the all-stock deal. The UAL Corporation, Uniteds parent company, will issue 1.05 shares for each Continental share, valuing the acquisition at $3.17 billion, based on Fridays closing price.        
	The merger is expected to be completed before the end of the year.         
	For consumers, the merger could eventually result in higher prices.         
	Though the new company does not intend to raise fares, according to people briefed on the matter, one of the rationales for airline mergers is to cut capacity. That reduces the number of seats in the industry and allows airlines to increase fares.         
	United and Continental will no longer be competing against each other on some routes, allowing them to save money but offering travellers fewer options.         
	Airlines are struggling to find a business model that makes sense, said Scott Sonenshein, an assistant professor at the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University.         
	Consolidation gives them more leverage. As a consumer, you will have less choices, fewer routes, higher prices and more fees, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jute suffers fresh jolt
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Jute suffers fresh jolt
          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                          Hard-pressed                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 15: The government has decided to use mostly plastic bags to pack rabi crops. Almost 80 per cent of the crop will be packed in plastic instead of jute bags till the end of February.        
	Under the Jute Packaging Materials Act 1987, foodgrain and sugar are supposed to be packed entirely in jute bags, but the ongoing strike at the jute mills from December 14 has affected supplies.        
	On Thursday, the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, convened a meeting to review the supply position of jute gunny bags and place orders for plastic bags.         
	According to Sanjay Kajaria, chairman of the Indian Jute Mills Association, it was decided in the meeting to place an order for 3.79 lakh bales of plastic bags over and above the 3.8 lakh bales ordered on December 24. The ministry had estimated the total requirement for packing rabi crop at 9.77 lakh bales of 50-kg gunny bags.        
	Kajaria said he chose to skip the meeting to avoid the humiliation of attending a meeting where officials would place orders for plastic bags because the jute industry failed to keep its supply commitment.        
	The jute industry had supplied 1.40 lakh bales before the strike began.         
	After the 7.59 bales of plastic bags are procured, the jute sector will be left with an order of 78,000 bales only.        
	Even if the strike is called off, the industry will have a meagre order book.

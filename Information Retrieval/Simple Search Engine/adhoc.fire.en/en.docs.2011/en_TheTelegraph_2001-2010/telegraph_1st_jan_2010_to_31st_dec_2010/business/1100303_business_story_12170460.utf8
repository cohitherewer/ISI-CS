          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 2: Exports have contracted around 18 per cent in the first 10 months of the current fiscal till January, though a recovery from November has mitigated the situation.        
	Merchandise exports declined 17.8 per cent to $131.93 billion till January against $160.43 billion a year ago, according to latest data of the government.        
	Exports grew 11.5 per cent in January to $14.3 billion  the third month running  and imports rose 35.5 per cent to $24.7 billion.        
	Analysts said the initial contraction was caused by global recession, while the rebound was a result of the governments stimulus measures and a gradual revival of the global economy.        
	After falling for 13 straight months, exports grew 18.2 per cent in November; the growth was 9.3 per cent in December.        
	The countrys aspiration to achieve higher growth rates will depend a lot on what happens in the developed world. The current revival is because of the improvement in global demand, D.K. Joshi, an economist with rating agency Crisil, said.        
	Officials said fruits and vegetables, marine products and tobacco did very well in January, while sectors such as tea, coffee, gems and jewellery, drugs and plastics also improved their performance. However, engineering goods, textiles, jute, carpets, handicrafts and leather continued to fare badly.        
	Global recession seems to be lifting. But trade recovery is still vulnerable and fragile given the fact that it is mainly government support and policy driven, H.A.C. Prasad, senior economic adviser in the finance ministry, said.        
	Oil imports in January went up 56 per cent to $7.05 billion from $4.52 billion a year ago. Non-oil imports grew 28.8 per cent to $17.65 billion compared with $13.7 billion in January 2009.        
	However, oil imports during April-January dipped 25.3 per cent to $63.97 billion from $85.62 billion in the corresponding period last fiscal. Non-oil imports dipped 17.1 per cent to $154.56 billion.         
	Trade deficit till January stood at $86.6 billion compared with $111.59 billion in April-January 2008-09.

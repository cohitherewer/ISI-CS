	Calcutta, July 16: The Export Import Bank of India and the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (ECGC) are developing a credit product for importers of Indian goods, wherein the Exim Bank will provide the buyers credit and the ECGC will cover the non-commercial risks.        
	We are working with the ECGC towards putting in place a partially structured buyers credit. ECGC will provide the political risk cover, Exim Bank chairman and managing director T.C.A. Ranganathan said on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industries here today.         
	Exim Bank will offer credit to overseas buyers for importing eligible goods on a deferred payment basis. The bank is also aiming at cluster financing , which involves the extension of comprehensive credit to units in clusters exporting pharmaceuticals, chemicals, processed food and leather.         
	Buyers credit will help exporters to focus on expanding their business as we take care of the credit risk arising from an importer. We do a thorough due diligence of an importers credit-worthiness and country risk assessment before extending such a facility, Ranganathan said.         
	The new product will fill up the gap where government or multilateral credit are not available. The new credit tool can be the third-best choice after multilateral funding and government line of credit, he said.

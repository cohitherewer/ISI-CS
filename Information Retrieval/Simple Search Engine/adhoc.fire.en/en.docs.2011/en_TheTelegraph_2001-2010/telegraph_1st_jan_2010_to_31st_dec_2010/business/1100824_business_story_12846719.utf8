The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Planners come to the rescue of Coal India
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Planners come to the rescue of Coal India

	New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Planning Commission has proposed that coal mining be allowed in phases in all blocks allotted till the end of last fiscal, with tree cover restored once mining was over.         
	Earlier this year, the environment ministry had divided forests into go and no go areas on the basis of forest cover, which would severely limit production of miners, particularly Coal India Limited.         
	Recently, the Prime Ministers Office had reviewed the environment ministrys position. However, the Planning Commission, in a note, has observed that going by the environment ministrys directive Coal Indias mining area will be reduced by 30 per cent.        
	According to the note  Meeting Coal Demand in Eleventh Plan and other Issues  Coal India could see a drop in output by about 45 million tonnes annually. This move was seen jeopardising one of the biggest public issues planned by the finance ministry  Coal Indias Rs 15,000-crore IPO in October.        
	Coal belts affected by the environment ministrys order are Hasdev and Mandarigarh in Chhattisgarh, Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh and Ib Valley in Orissa. Besides Coal India, several other groups that would be affected include the Tatas, Reliance Power and Hindustan Zinc.         
	The environment ministrys classification can put 619 million tonnes of coal annually out of the reach of miners.        
	According to the plan panel note, It has to be appreciated that coal mining is carried out in the world in most developed countries. No country is letting its energy resources idle unless it has other alternative.         
	A broad balanced approach will be to utilise our domestic mineral resources while taking full safeguards for the development of forests and environment.         
	It suggested a review of the policy by an inter-ministerial committee and permitting mining in phases in the blocks allotted till March 31, 2010. As one gets completed, the area should be afforested (by the miner) and handed over for management to the ministry of environment and forests.        
	The note goes on to say that in case of extremely dense forests, the ministry of coal should explore underground mining. Senior government officials said Coal India, too, had proposed an alternative several months back.

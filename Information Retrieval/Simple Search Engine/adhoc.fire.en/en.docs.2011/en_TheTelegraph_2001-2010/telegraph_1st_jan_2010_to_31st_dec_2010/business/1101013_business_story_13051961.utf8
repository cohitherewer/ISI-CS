          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CAsh route                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: A group of ministers, under finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, today fixed the price band of Coal India Ltds initial public offering  billed as the largest in the country  at Rs 225-245 per share.         
	This could fetch the government over Rs 15,000 crore.         
	The government will sell 10 per cent of its 100 per cent stake in the miner.         
	Coal India IPO price band has been fixed at Rs 225-245 apiece . We expect to raise over Rs 15,000 crore from the issue, coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said.        
	Coal India should beat the previous record set by Anil Ambani-run Reliance Powers IPO in January 2008 that raised Rs 11,500 crore.         
	The PSU will offer 631.63 million shares at a face value of Rs 10 each. There is a 5 per cent discount for retail investors and 5 per cent for our employees, Jaiswal said.         
	The four-day IPO will open on October 18. Sources said several top banks and mutual funds were waiting in the wings to snap up the shares.         
	Its a mammoth issue, the biggest one till date, and a prestigious one for the government. We cant afford to go wrong on this one as that would be bad news for other PSU offerings being lined up, officials said.         
	Sources said the eGoM considered the share prices of major global coal firms, including China Shenhua Energy Company, the worlds most valuable producer, to arrive at a figure.         
	Deutsche Equities (India) Private, DSP Merrill Lynch, Enam Securities, Citigroup, Kotak Mahindra Capital and Morgan Stanley are among the book-runners and lead managers to the issue.         
	The Centre aims to divest stakes in PSUs to mop up around Rs 40,000 crore this year.

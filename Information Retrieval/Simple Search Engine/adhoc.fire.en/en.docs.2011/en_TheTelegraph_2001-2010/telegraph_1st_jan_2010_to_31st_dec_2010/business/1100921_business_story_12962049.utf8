          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: Indian Oil Corporation will raise petrol prices by 27 to 29 paise across the four metros from midnight, the first since the governments deregulation of fuel rates in June.         
	However, there will be no increase in diesel price, which is the preferred fuel of transporters and politically sensitive as its increase has a cascading effect on the prices of food articles.        
	While the price will be increased 27 paise in Delhi, it will go up 29 paise in Calcutta and Chennai and 28 paise in Mumbai.        
	A litre of petrol in Delhi will cost Rs 51.83, in Calcutta it will be Rs 55.69, in Mumbai it will go up to Rs 56.25 and in Chennai, Rs 56.31.        
	IOC took the decision to marginally increase the price as it started making a loss of 25 paise per litre in the wake of rising cost of crude in the international markets. The losses were the first since the June deregulation.        
	Other state-owned oil firms will increase petrol prices in a day or two. Both HPCL and BPCL are expected to raise rates in the same range.        
	The oil ministry has asked the three marketing companies to change their prices on different days to avoid accusations of forming a cartel. Private oil firms such as Reliance and Essar have made such a charge. The differential rates, officials said, can help the state-owned oil firms to avoid the scanner of the Competition Commission of India.        
	It makes no sense for PSUs to compete among themselves if only petrol prices are being freed. Oil marketing companies will continue to co-ordinate on the pricing of petrol, a top oil PSU executive had said.         
	Turkmenistan pipeline deal        
	India today signed an initial agreement for a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan via Afghanistan and Pakistan, a project that the US has been backing as an alternative to a pipeline from Iran. The four nations signed the Gas Pipeline Framework Agreement for the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan- Pakistan-India pipeline project in Turkmenistans capital Ashgabat, an official release said. The Asian Development Bank in its pre-feasibility study had backed the 1,680-km long pipeline project.

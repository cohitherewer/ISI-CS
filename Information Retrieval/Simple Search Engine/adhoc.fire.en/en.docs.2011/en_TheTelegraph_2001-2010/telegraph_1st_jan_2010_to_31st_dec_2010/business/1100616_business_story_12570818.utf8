                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Govt to sell 10% of CIL, Hind Copper
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Chidambaram: Action time                                  
	New Delhi, June 15: The cabinet committee on economic affairs today cleared a 10 per cent stake sale each in state-owned mining firms Coal India Ltd (CIL) and Hindustan Copper, while railway minister Mamata Banerjee was away from the capital. The minister had stalled the proposals last week during a meeting of the cabinet committee.         
	Trinamul leaders said, Mamata wasnt aware they would take up the divestment of these two firms this week ... the government didnt send the agenda yesterday.         
	The stake sales in the two Calcutta-based firms are expected to raise about Rs 16,000 crore for the governments kitty to construct roads, ports, hospitals and schools.         
	The government will offload 10 per cent of its equity in Coal India through an initial public offering. Hindustan Copper will issue fresh shares equivalent to 10 per cent of pre-issue paid up capital and the government will sell another 10 per cent in the firm through a follow-on public offer, home minister P. Chidambaram told reporters.         
	The Manmohan Singh government hopes to raise Rs 40,000 crore from divestment this fiscal. So far, divestment in Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam has fetched Rs 1,000 crore.         
	Divestment of CIL would be through a book-building process in the domestic market. One per cent of the equity will be offered to employees of CIL and its eight subsidiaries at a discount of 5 per cent, he said.         
	Coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said the IPO for Coal India was likely to hit the market by September but could be delayed by two months if the markets were not conducive.        
	Hindustan Copper, which returned to profit in the last fiscal, aims to increase output more than six-fold in five years to meet the rising demand for the metal.         
	The company is trying to secure the rights to new mines in India and abroad. The share issue will part-finance its expansion and asset buys.

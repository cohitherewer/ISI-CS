          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Neeraj Swaroop in Mumbai on Wednesday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 4: India has become Standard Chartered Banks biggest market worldwide, pipping Hong Kong which had so far enjoyed the numero uno status.         
	StanCharts Indian operations posted a profit before tax of $624 million for the first half of this year, higher than Hong Kongs pre-tax profit of $511 million.        
	India has topped the StanChart totem pole nearly two months after the bank successfully listed its Indian depository receipts (IDR)  the first time that such an instrument has been listed on the local bourses.        
	Declaring its first half numbers today, StanChart said it had posted an operating profit of $3.12 billion, 10 per cent higher than $2.83 billion in the same period last year.         
	Operating profits before tax in India rose 19 per cent to $624 million compared with $526 million in the first half of last year. While India not only saw a jump in profits before tax, it also pipped Hong Kong whose profits fell 11 per cent to $511 million.        
	The economic fundamentals are very strong in India and we consider it to be our core market. We have grown both in the consumer as well as wholesale banking here, Neeraj Swaroop, Standard Chartereds chief executive for India and South Asia, told reporters here today.        
	The Indian operations of StanChart also witnessed a jump in net interest margins that rose to 3.8 per cent. Loans grew 24 per cent. The bank is now targeting a 17-20 per cent rise in deposits and advances in India in the current year, Swaroop said.         
	StanChart also announced a dividend today under which Indian investors will get 2.3 cents for every IDR they hold.

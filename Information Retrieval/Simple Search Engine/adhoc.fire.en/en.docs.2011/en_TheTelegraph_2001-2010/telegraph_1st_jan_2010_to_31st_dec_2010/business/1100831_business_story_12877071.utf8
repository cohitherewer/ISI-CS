The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Win some, lose some for economic zones
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Win some, lose some for economic zones
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rule recast                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: Developers of special economic zones notified before March 31, 2012 will continue to enjoy tax benefits; units in SEZs that come up before March 31, 2014 will also get reliefs.        
	However, the direct tax bill has proposed a 20 per cent MAT and 15 per cent dividend distribution tax on new entities, and developers said this would make the zones unattractive.        
	Developers will be allowed profit-linked deductions for all SEZs notified on or before March 31, 2012, revenue secretary Sunil Mitra told reporters here.        
	According to Ajay Nijhawan, the convenor of a panel of SEZ developers, The provisions of DTC have taken out the benefit and spirit of the SEZ Act. The tax-free zones, according to the SEZ Act, get three years to develop from the date of notification and the unit owners get two years to develop.         
	The five-year period offered under the SEZ Act has been overlooked by the bill. The developers will petition the government to make the bill in line with the SEZ Act, Nijhawan.        
	Balbir Singh Mastan of DSK Legal said the provisions could make SEZs unattractive, especially for the manufacturing sector.        
	At present, SEZ units get 100 per cent tax exemption on profits earned in the first five years and a 50 per cent waiver for the next five years. They get 50 per cent exemption on re-invested profits for another five years.         
	SEZ developers get 100 per cent tax waiver for 10 years and are exempted from MAT.        
	Analysts said the DTC bill might be a violation of promissory estoppel  a principle which bars the government from going back on promises  as the developers had invested in the special zones based on the tax relief promised by the government.        
	There are 576 formally approved economic zones, of which 114 are operational. The commerce ministry expects Rs 10 lakh crore more investment in SEZs. The new provisions could dampen the optimism. The developers said investments would not be feasible under the proposed levies.        
	Since the first DTC draft was released in August last year, there have been apprehensions over the SEZ provisions.         
	The number of companies keen to develop new zones have started declining. In 2009-10, only 20 SEZs became functional compared with 40 in 2008-09 and 56 in 2007-08.

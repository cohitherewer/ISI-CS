The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coal India invests big in superior varieties 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Coal India invests big in superior varieties 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TACTICAL MOVE                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 22: Coal India Ltd (CIL), which is expected to hit the markets with its maiden public issue in October, will invest Rs 2,327 crore to set up 20 washeries with a capacity of 111.10 million tonnes (mt).         
	Washed coal with low ash content and higher calorific value will help the state-owned company realise a better price per tonne and improve profitability.        
	The company runs 17 coal beneficiation facilities comprising five non-coking and 12 coking coal washeries with an aggregate capacity of 39.40mt per annum.         
	The new washeries, of which 15 will be non-coking and five coking, will be operational between 2013 and 2018. CIL will sell 150.5mt of washed coal by then. Of the proposed washeries, 18 will be set up on a build-operate-maintain basis and the remaining on a turnkey basis.         
	The company has proposed that all its new open cast mines with production capacities greater than 2.5mt per annum will be equipped with dedicated beneficiation facilities.         
	The coal mined in the country, mainly of sub-bituminous, bituminous and lignite (brown coal) grade, contains high percentage of ash and has a low calorific value. Raw coal contains 35-38 per cent of ash and one kg produces 4,000 kilocalories of energy.        
	However, the coal here has low sulphur, iron and chlorine content, high ash fusion temperature, refractory nature of ash and low toxic trace elements. CIL  the worlds largest coal company with an estimated 63 billion tonnes of reserves  plans to sell only washed coal in the future.        
	When coal is washed, the ash content gets reduced by 7-8 per cent and the calorific value increases to around 5,000 kilocalories per kg, which is on a par with imported coal. CIL sells raw coal at pithead for $21.5 per tonne, which will go up for washed coal to $28 per tonne because of higher costs.        
	Indonesian coal  the cheapest imported variety  costs around $45. Therefore, CIL enjoys a cost advantage of at least $27 per tonne compared with imports. A rise in washed coal prices will increase CILs profit.        
	Consumers, particularly the power producers, will also benefit from using the washed variety because the transportation costs will decline, as they will require lower amount to get the same calorific value.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Industrial output expanded 7.1 per cent in June  the slowest in 13 months  which disappointed finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.         
	Blaming base effect for the poor show, analysts said they expected manufacturing to bounce back to around 9 per cent by the end of this fiscal.        
	I expected it to be a little better, Mukherjee said.        
	The 7.1 per cent expansion marked a sharp deceleration from Mays revised growth of 11.3 per cent. Manufacturing, which accounts for 80 per cent of the index of industrial production, rose 7.3 per cent against 8 per cent a year ago.        
	Industrial output was boosted by government spending and monetary easing to counter the global financial crisis. Both those measures are now being unwound as the economy recovers.         
	I will not conclude from the June figure that this is going to be the trend for rest of the year. A lot of individual components seem to be showing good growth, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said. The slowdown in output stems from a sharp fall in the growth of capital goods, which fell to 9.7 per cent from 13.4 per cent a year ago.        
	Electricity generation expanded 3.5 per cent from 8 per cent in June, 2009. Mining grew 9.5 per cent against 14.2 per cent a year ago.         
	Consumer durables expanded 27.4 per cent against 16.2 a year ago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance shares take a beating
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Reliance shares take a beating
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 28: Shares of Reliance Industries fell 3 per cent on the bourses today on disappointment that the company might not ramp up gas production at its KG-D6 block any time soon.         
	The development led to worries that the company might not report any earning surprises over the next two quarters.         
	The Reliance scrip closed at Rs 1,020.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, a drop of 3.09 per cent, or Rs 32.55, over its previous close of Rs 1,053.50.         
	Some brokerages downgraded the stock and cut its earnings estimates for the current fiscal and the subsequent year.        
	Announcing the first quarter results on Tuesday, Reliance said there would be some delay in ramping up production in its KG-D6 block to 80 million standard cubic metres from the present average of 60 mmscmd a day.         
	Reliance has commenced a detailed reservoir study at KG-D6 to assess the potential and methodology to increase the reserve life. Typically, these studies take anywhere between three to four quarters, which effectively rules out the KG-D6 ramp-up from 60 mmscmd to 80 mmscmd in the fourth quarter 2010-11, in our opinion, Alok Deshpande, analyst at Elara Capital, said in a note.        
	The brokerage cut RILs estimates and target price.        
	Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal also downgraded RIL to neutral from buy. It said against the earlier expectation, RIL had indicated that the production was unlikely to increase for the next 6-12 months.         
	The brokerage cut RILs 2010-11 and 2011-12 EPS estimates by 3 per cent and 9 per cent to Rs 67 and Rs 75, respectively.         
	It also cut the target price for RIL from Rs 1,133 to Rs 991 per share.

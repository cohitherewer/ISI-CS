          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Comeback course                                  
	Mumbai, June 28: Private oil refiners are expected to start pulling the polythene wraps off their petrol pumps after a gap of almost three years  a beneficial fallout of Fridays decision by the empowered group of ministers to raise petro-product prices across the board.        
	Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is one such private refiner that is likely to gain from the price increase and may invest again in drumming up the number of retail fuel outlets in the country.         
	According to a report by Morgan Stanley, RIL may revisit its strategy to build 5,000 gas stations. The company already has 1,500 outlets but was forced to stop further rollouts when it was no longer economical to operate them.        
	In 2007, the Mukesh Ambani-led company started shutting down its pumps when the government had gone into a funk over the rising global crude prices. It ordered state-owned oil refiners to sell the auto fuel below cost as political expediency smothered economic pragmatism.         
	The state-owned refiners were, however, offered some compensation through a mix of discounts from upstream oil majors and subsidies paid out through oil bonds. The private refiners, who were denied the concessions, had to shut the petrol pumps after valiantly trying to sell these fuels at a slightly higher price.         
	RIL started re-opening these pumps in January. At present, some 600 fuel stations are in operation. An RIL spokesperson declined to comment on the speculation that the firm could soon start expanding its fuel retailing business.        
	Essar Energy, which has a network of 1,342 petrol pumps, is the other private refiner that will ramp up its retail presence.         
	Naresh Nayyar, CEO of Essar Energy and managing director and CEO of Essar Oil, said, As the largest active private sector fuel retailer in India, we are well placed to capture additional sales for fuel and non-fuel items and expect to see significant volume growth in both areas. We already have in place plans to increase significantly the number of retail fuel outlets that we have across India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Food inflation declines
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Food inflation declines

	New Delhi, Nov. 4: Food inflation fell to 12.85 per cent for the week ended October 23 as vegetable prices softened on improved supplies, justifying the RBIs optimism that it may not have to up rates further.        
	This is the third straight week of decline in food inflation, which stood at 13.75 per cent in the previous week.         
	Vegetable prices eased around 3 per cent week-on-week. However, the prices of protein-based items such as meat, egg and fish rose 28.85 per cent year-on-year. Pulses turned expensive by just 0.67 per cent.        
	In its monetary review, the RBI pointed towards protein-based items getting costlier because of a change in consumption pattern.        
	As income goes up, people tend to have a more protein-rich diet, which is pushing up their prices. It is unlikely that their prices will come down in the near future, Crisil chief economist D.K. Joshi said.         
	Experts said food inflation would soften further by November-end when the kharif crops come to the market.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      PSU duo cash in on early-bird edge
          JAYATI GHOSE                          One step AHEAD                                  
	New Delhi, May 31: State-owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) are stepping on the gas to attract customers to their 3G services before private players enter the fray.        
	MTNL, which operates in Delhi and Mumbai, has allowed its 2G (voice) customers to upgrade to 3G without any extra cost.         
	BSNL, which operates in the remaining circles, plans to provide rental-free 3G services where the user will only have to pay for data services. It will also extend its coverage to 760 cities from 366 at present by the end of this fiscal.        
	Both the PSUs expect to use innovative marketing strategies to increase the number of 3G subscribers to at least 5 per cent of their total user base by the end of 2010-11.        
	Our target is to get 5 million 3G customers by the end of this fiscal. We expect 5 per cent of our total user base to come from 3G initially. This percentage may go up to 10 per cent later, BSNL officials said. The company has 1.5 million 3G customers out of a total of 60 million.        
	MTNL, which has around 4 lakh 3G customers out of 50 lakh subscribers, plans to attract over 6 lakh users by the end of March.        
	The PSUs were given 3G spectrum ahead of private operators, who had to go through an auction, on condition that they pay the winning bid price for each service area.        
	While MTNL had to shell out Rs 6,564 crore for Delhi and Mumbai, BSNL paid Rs 10,186.6 crore for the remaining circles.        
	Private operators, who have paid over Rs 50,000 crore for 3G radio waves, will be ready to offer high-speed data services such as video on demand, Internet and mobile TV by the end of this year.        
	Research firm Crisil expects Indias wireless subscriber base to reach 850-900 million by 2013-14, of which 12-15 per cent will be on the 3G network.         
	The potential of the firms to introduce innovative applications will ensure a premium of 10-15 per cent on 3G services.        
	According to analysts, the PSU duo, who have been lagging behind the private players in offering voice services, need to give strong incentives to gain a headstart in 3G.        
	BSNL in Calcutta has 16.7 lakh users compared with 32.2 lakh for Vodafone and 26.9 lakh for Bharti.

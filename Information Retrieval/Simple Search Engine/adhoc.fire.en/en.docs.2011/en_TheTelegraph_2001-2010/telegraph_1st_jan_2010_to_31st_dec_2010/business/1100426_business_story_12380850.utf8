The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt, RBI favour teaser rate burial

	New Delhi, April 25: The finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India want banks to wind up teaser rates  very low interest rates offered for a limited introductory period to attract new borrowers.         
	Both feel the practice can create large number of bad loans as borrowers with low financial means can be enticed by the low interest offerings to take money beyond their repayment capacity.         
	The US mortgage crisis was triggered by indiscriminate bank lending to home buyers with low financial ability who were unable to pay back their loans.         
	The worry is that people may borrow because the rate offered is low and may default once lending rates start rising, senior officials said.         
	Banks start charging higher interests once the initial teaser rate period is over.         
	With rates stiffening in the near and medium term, the actual interest rates may go up beyond what many borrowers have calculated, officials said.         
	Many banks had offered teaser rates of 8-8.5 per cent compared with market rates of 10-14 per cent.         
	Teaser rates had been introduced in the home loan segment but have now spread to other forms of consumer financing. HDFC, the State Bank of India and ICICI Bank are among those to offer the attractive rates.         
	The SBI, the countrys largest bank, kickstarted the trend in January 2009 with home loans at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent in the first year, 9 per cent for the next two years and a floating rate thereafter.         
	RBI deputy governor Usha Thorat had earlier expressed fears on teaser rates. In housing loans, teaser rates are increasingly being offered which is a cause for concern. I hope banks are ensuring that borrowers are well aware of the implications of such rates and the appraisal takes into account repaying capacity of the borrowers when the rates become normal, Thorat had said.         
	The fear is also backed by statistics showing that nearly 75 per cent of the loans are at rates below the benchmark prime lending rate.        
	An RBI committee has recommended that the base lending rate be linked to the one-year cost of funds.         
	Officials said they expected state-run banks to discontinue teaser rates soon. However, banks said attractive schemes gave a boost to lending during a period when credit growth was sluggish.         
	The finance ministry, however, feels that with the economy picking up such schemes should be shunned as they are risky and somewhat akin to what the US banks have done through the 1990s and this decade.

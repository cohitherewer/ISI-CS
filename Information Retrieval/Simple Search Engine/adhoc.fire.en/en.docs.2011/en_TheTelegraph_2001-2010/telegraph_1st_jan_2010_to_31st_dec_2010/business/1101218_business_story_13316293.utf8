          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 17: Google India is focusing on new technologies to target the rising mobile Internet traffic in the country.         
	Mobile queries will take over desktop queries by 2012 in the country, Vinay Goel, head of products at Google India, said.         
	Mobile Internet users have gone up to 40 million this year from 2 million in 2007. Google Indias mobile traffic has gone up three times this year alone.         
	There are 100 million Internet users in India, of which 40 million use it through handsets. With the decrease in the price of smartphones and rise in the use of 3G-enabled services, use of the search engine is set to rise.         
	Google has launched features such as search by voice, search by images and Google Goggles for Apple phones and Androids. It has recently launched the Google Instant search interface, which is also available on these phones.         
	Voice services        
	Google will not be able to launch its voice services in India as the regulations in the country do not permit calls to a mobile phone from the Internet.         
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India allows calls emanating from a personal computer to another in the country, from computers to telephones outside the country and from one IP-based terminal to another within the country and outside. However, the revised licence scheme on Internet telephony does not allow calls emanating from computers to telephones in the country.         
	We hope that with the coming of long term evolution technology we will get the permit to emanate calls from PCs to telephones. We will launch the services in India only then, Goel said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mining rules take shape
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mining rules take shape

	New Delhi, Sept. 9: The government plans to auction 50 per cent of coal bearing land that has been cleared for mining by the environment ministry. The remaining 50 per cent will be allotted to companies that had to give up their coal blocks because of objections raised by the environment ministry.        
	Former cabinet secretary and plan panel member B.K.Chaturvedi held a meeting of secretaries last week to work out a solution to the ongoing tussle between the environment and coal ministries over the ban on mining by the former in forest areas marked as no-go.Chaturvedis proposal has the support of the Prime Ministers Office, said sources.         
	According to the minutes of the meeting available with The Telegraph, of the coal blocks cleared by the ministry of environment and forests, 50 per cent can be put (up) for auction and the remaining 50 per cent for alternate coal block allottees.         
	A bill to allow the auction of coal blocks among user industries will be passed in Parliament soon. The new law is expected to ensure transparency in allocation and earn better revenues for state governments.         
	It was decided in the meeting that in allotment preference should be given to companies that had made huge investments in existing coal blocks but stopped mining after the orders of the environment ministry. Firms with small investments in bared blocks will be expected to participate in the bidding. If they fail to win the auction, they can be made joint owners with successful bidders for large blocks but will have to pay the winning amount.        
	Officials in the law ministry, however, said developers did not have the legal right to demand alternative blocks just because the previous allotments had been blocked on environment grounds. Developers can only seek legal help to demand greater priority for their projects.

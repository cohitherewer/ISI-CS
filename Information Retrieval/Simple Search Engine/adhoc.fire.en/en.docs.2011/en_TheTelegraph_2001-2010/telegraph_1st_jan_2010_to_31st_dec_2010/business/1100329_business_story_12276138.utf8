   Errant players to lose blocks 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, March 28: The Centre is readying to ignite big-bang reforms in the energy sector as the Indian economic juggernaut starts to roll.        
	First up is a plan to take back large tracts of land that were farmed out more than a decade ago to investors who were supposed to extract coal bed methane  a natural gas occurring in coal seams  but didnt do so.        
	The government has discovered to its dismay that a number of players have not even put down the money to assess the levels of coal bed methane gas that could be commercially exploited.        
	With the economy projected to surge 9 per cent by 2012, there is a huge demand for energy resources and the government reckons it cant allow investors to duck their contractual obligations.        
	Officials from the ministry of coal and the ministry of petroleum and natural gas have started to knock together a set of proposals to push for energy sector reforms.        
	The ministry of coal wants the unexploited coal bed methane (CBM) blocks to be taken back from the lazy investors. It has even suggested that these tracts can be auctioned again for coal mining projects. Theres another reason for this: unlike CBM projects, which sprawl over huge land tracts, coal mining areas are much smaller. It isnt clear whether the government now wants to dice up those large CBM tracts for more effective exploitation of natural resources.        
	The coal ministry has also suggested the possibility of allowing simultaneous exploitation of coal and CBM in a block, arguing that this is a practice followed in several nations.         
	But by far the most radical proposal is to allow vertical separation of land tracts for coal mining and CBM  with possible separate and distinct ownership of the mineral-bearing layers.        
	Although a specific timeline has not been fixed for this proposal, the government hopes to bring in certain amendments in the CBM contracts after it is examined by the department of legal affairs.        
	On the other hand, the ministry of labour and employment has been given the responsibility of carrying out necessary amendments in the Mines Act, 1952, so as to recognise different owners for two separate minerals.        
	The Centre has also asked the directorate general of mines Safety to suggest safety measures for simultaneous exploitation of coal and CBM.        
	Industry circles said that though the proposal for extraction of both CBM and coal was positive, its actual implementation on the ground could see certain challenges, particularly with regard to safety issues.        
	While the vertical horizons will have to be clearly demarcated, there has to be a minimum distance between two vertical horizons. Otherwise, there could always be the danger of overlaps, resulting in safety issues, a source said.        
	In a recent communication to the petroleum ministry Murli Deora, Sriprakash Jaiswal, the minister of state (independent charge) handling coal and statistics and programme implementation, said several CBM blocks had been awarded to the private sector but till date only about 6.2 trillion cubic feet of gas had been estimated in four blocks. Only one CBM block has started production.        
	Jaiswal has now sought that wherever the development work for CBM is not progressing according to the commitment made by the parties, these blocks may be taken back and offered for coal mining.        
	He has also suggested that if there are approved mining plans in unviable CBM blocks, the block allottees may be allowed to undertake coal mining.

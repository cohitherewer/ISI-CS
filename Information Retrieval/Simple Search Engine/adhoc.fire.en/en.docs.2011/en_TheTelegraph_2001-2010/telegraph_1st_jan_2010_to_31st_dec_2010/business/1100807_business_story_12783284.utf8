          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Hasina: Closer ties                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is likely to promise Bangladesh a quicker free trade pact and an easy transit facility to Nepal during his visit to Dhaka tomorrow.         
	Mukherjee will sign a $1-billion line of credit for its eastern neighbour. The loan through the Exim Bank is likely to have a 25-year repayment period with an interest rate of just 1.25 per cent, far lower than rates charged by the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank.         
	Bangladesh need only spend 30 per cent of the loan on goods and services from India.        
	Dhaka has been upset with India over delays in exchanging border enclaves, giving it transit facilities to Nepal and Bhutan and free trade access to the larger Indian market.         
	Bangladesh has provided transit facilities to India through its territories and access to Chittagong port from the Northeast.         
	Mukherjee is seen by Bangladesh not only as an important and influential Indian leader but also as someone who has Bangladeshs interests at heart.         
	Bangladesh wants India to allow its truckers access to Indian roads to go to Bhutan and Nepal. India is likely to agree to the demand after working out the modalities.         
	It also wants to become the preferred port for Bhutan and Nepal and feels that India has been delaying transit arrangements to retain the revenues for Calcutta and Haldia ports.         
	Indian officials said they were working on a blueprint for a free trade agreement which could be signed as early as next year.        
	The pact will free the import of products in which Bangladesh enjoys a cost advantage such as ready-to-wear garments, ceramics, tea, marine and farm products, besides leather goods.         
	Trade barriers        
	Finance ministry officials said, There are directions from both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to be liberal in our trade offer and to be sensitive to concerns on non-tariff barriers.         
	Bangladesh had previously complained that it could not import for some time garments at zero duty according to an agreement because of non-tariff barriers.        
	India sells $3.375 billion worth of goods annually to Bangladesh and imports a mere $358 million from its smaller neighbour.         
	Bangladesh has often complained that trade sops offered by India do not help as non tariff barriers or delays in notifying the rule changes hold up its exports.        
	Bangladesh which grew 6.2 per cent last year, exports $15.91 billion worth of goods, mostly to the US, the European Union and Japan. However, the recent economic downturn is forcing Bangladesh to look at other markets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nokia Siemens in selloff talks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Nokia Siemens in selloff talks
                            
	New York, Aug. 1 (PTI): Nokia Siemens Networks is in talks with private equity firms Blackstone and Bain Capital, among others, for a potential cash infusion of at least $1 billion in exchange for an up to one-third stake in the telecom gear maker, The Wall Street Journal said.        
	Citing sources familiar with the plan, the report said the discussions were still at the exploratory stage.        
	The news comes just days after Nokia Siemens agreed to buy Motorolas telecom equipment unit for $1.2 billion, which is supposed to enhance the companys attractiveness to private equity buyers.        
	According to the report, Silver Lake Partners, TPG, Blackstone, Bain Capital and KKR are among the firms in contact with Nokia Siemens about a deal that could see private equity ownership of up to one-third of the company.        
	No formal proposals have been made and both sides can decide against pursuing such a deal. If the firms do make an offer, it is not clear if they will team up or go it alone.        
	A spokesperson for Nokia Siemens declined to comment.        
	However, such a deal will be complex because Nokia Siemens is a joint venture between Finlands Nokia Corp and Germanys Siemens AG, with each parent owning a 50 per cent stake.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 6: The $15-billion Essar group has acquired US-based Trinity Coal Partners for $600 million.         
	Essar Minerals, a group company, has signed a definitive agreement with private equity firm Denham Capital to buy Trinity Coal. The deal is expected to close by month-end.         
	Trinity Coal will give the Essar group access to around 200 million tonnes of reserves  equally split between metallurgical coal and steam coal  from its mines in Kentucky and West Virginia.         
	According to a statement by the group, Trinity produces 7 million tonnes of coal annually and expects to increase this to 10 million tonnes per year.         
	Essar group chief executive Prashant Ruia said, With the acquisition of Trinity Coal, the Essar group has invested $4 billion in North America and it is possibly the largest employer from India in the region with nearly 8,500 employees.        
	Ruia declined to provide details on how the transaction would be financed. It will be a mix of debt and equity that will be raised from internal resources. We will offer more information on financing at a later stage, he said.         
	Nearly 50 per cent of the coal from Trinity will be supplied to power producers in the US, while some of the rest will be used at Essars Algoma steel making facility that the group acquired in 2007.

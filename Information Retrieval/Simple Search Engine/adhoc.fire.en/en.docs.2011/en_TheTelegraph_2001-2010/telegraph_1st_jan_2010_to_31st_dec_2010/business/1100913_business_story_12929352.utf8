	New Delhi, Sept. 12: India is likely to allow foreign banks to open more branches on the condition that they adhere to the principles of financial inclusion by spreading to rural areas and serving the poor.        
	Top finance ministry officials said the Reserve Bank of India was receptive to opening up the sector to foreign entities in view of reciprocal gestures by the British, European and US regulators.         
	At present, foreign banks are allowed to open up to 12 branches a year, which is likely to be increased to 20.         
	This follows a visit by the UKs commercial secretary to the countrys treasury, Lord James Sassoon, who met top RBI and finance ministry officials.         
	British Prime Minister David Cameron, too, had lobbied for the easier entry of banks during his July visit. John Varley of Barclays Bank and Peter Sands of Standard Chartered were among the bankers who made up his entourage. Both banks want to expand their Indian operations, which have been stymied by the RBI regulations.        
	According to sources, Cameron had also pressed for the opening up of insurance. Sassoon, however, had been more pragmatic and indicated that Britain was aware of the politics that could delay the raising of the foreign investment bar on insurance to 49 per cent from 26 per cent.         
	Quid pro quo        
	The Centre also wants to enter into quiet reciprocal deals, which will allow Indian banks to expand in the UK, the US and Europe.         
	Indian banks have around 125 branches abroad and own about 21 subsidiaries. The State Bank of India, which earns about 12 per cent of its revenues from overseas business, plans to increase the amount by setting up subsidiaries in Canada and West Asia.        
	The Bank of Baroda wants to set up 12 branches abroad this fiscal, while Allahabad Bank and IDBI Bank want to set up operations in Dubai, Beijing and Singapore. Even the small Indian Bank wants to set up three branches abroad.         
	In the UK, around 10 Indian banks are believed to be in the queue for licences. Existing banks such as ICICI Bank, the SBI, Punjab National Bank, the Bank of Baroda and the Bank of India, want to open more branches .         
	The government has been supportive of the aspirations of domestic banks. Recently, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told bankers, The global banking landscape is changing fast. Indian banks should use this opportunity to carve out a place for themselves at the global platform.        
	The US, the UK and European banks are keen to get a slice of the booming Indian market.         
	The RBI has been cautious in opening up the sector for two reasons. Firstly, it wants to ensure that Indian banks will be able to compete with global players.         
	Second, it does not want to bring in weak global banks laden with toxic assets into India as they may prove to be bad bets for Indian investors and account holders.         
	Though amendments to the banking regulation act, which seek to remove the 10 per cent cap on voting rights of foreign investors, are pending before Parliament, it is unlikely that India will go ahead with the change in the future.         
	At present, India allows 49 per cent foreign direct investment through the automatic route and a further 25 per cent through the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, taking the total to 74 per cent.

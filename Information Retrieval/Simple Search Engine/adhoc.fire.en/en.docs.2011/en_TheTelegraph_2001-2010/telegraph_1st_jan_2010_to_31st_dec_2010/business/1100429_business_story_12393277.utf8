                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Healthy rise in BoB profit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mallya: Weighing gains                                  
	Mumbai, April 28: The Bank of Baroda (BoB) today reported a 20.41 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 906.28 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 31.         
	The nationalised bank had earned a net profit of Rs 752.69 crore in the same period last year.        
	Analysts had expected the bank to post a net profit of over Rs 800 crore.        
	The robust growth in its bottomline was led by a 19 per cent jump in its net interest income (NII).         
	NII, which represents the core operations of a bank, is the interest earned by a bank on the loans that it disburses minus the cost of deposits. In the case of BoB, NII jumped 19 per cent to Rs 1,745 crore from Rs 1,471 crore in the year-ago period.        
	M.D. Mallya, chairman and managing director, said the growth in NII came not only on account of a strong expansion of its loan book but also as the bank had been able to trim its high cost bulk deposits. Further, its low cost deposit (CASA) base showed a growth during the period. CASA comprises current and savings account deposits.        
	Mallya added that the bank expected a credit growth of 25 per cent during this fiscal and that it would try to maintain the net interest margin at 3.5 per cent.         
	During the year ended March 31, 2010, the bank posted a net profit of Rs 3,058.33 crore, up 37 per cent from Rs 2,227.20 crore last year.

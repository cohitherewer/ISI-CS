The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal 3G bidders drop out
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bengal 3G bidders drop out
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 12: The Bengal circle had no bidders for 3G spectrum at the end of the third day of auction, though it had as many as four bidders in the second day.        
	Analysts said this could be a temporary situation, reflecting a sudden spurt of interest in the Uttar Pradesh and the Rajasthan circles where those who had bid for Bengal shifted their money.         
	It seems these four players have bid for Uttar Pradesh east, west and Rajasthan circles. These three circles till day two of the auction did not have any excess demand, said telecom department officials.        
	Bengal which is a B circle will see more action towards the later part of the auction as there is no dearth of 2G or normal telecom spectrum in this category of circles unlike in the A circles or in some B category circles such as Uttar Pradesh where there is hot competition backed by a fast expanding market, said Mahesh Uppal, director Com First India  a telecom consulting firm.         
	Bidding is a dynamic process and all slots stay open till the end, Uppal said. Once a clear picture emerges about the bidding in the coveted circles, those who have Bengal on their radar will come back, possibly those who provide 2G services in the circle. The Calcutta circle is in Category A and separate from the Bengal circle.

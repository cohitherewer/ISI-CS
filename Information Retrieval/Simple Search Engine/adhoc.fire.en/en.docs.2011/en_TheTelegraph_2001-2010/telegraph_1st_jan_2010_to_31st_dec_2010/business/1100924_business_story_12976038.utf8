	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Hyundai Motor India today introduced a new version of the i10 and plans to sell over 15,000 units of the new model every month.        
	The Next Gen i10, which made its global debut today, will replace the existing model. It will be priced at Rs 3.49-5.91 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) compared with the existing models price of Rs 3.48-5.58 lakh. The new car will be displayed at the Paris Motor Show, beginning October 2.        
	The Next Gen i10 reflects our big plans for India. I am confident that this will further strengthen our position in this segment, H. W. Park, managing director and CEO of Hyundai Motor India, said.        
	We have boosted the design element and packed the car with safety and comfort related technological innovation. We believe this will set a new benchmark in this segment.        
	The company is also considering the feasibility of setting up a diesel engine plant near its Chennai unit. It has a petrol engine plant  that makes the Kappa engine  at Sriperumbudur near Chennai. Hyundai developed the Kappa engine for the i10 at a cost of over $400 million.         
	Since the launch of the i10 in 2007, the company has sold about seven lakh units of the hatchback. The car contributes about 50 per cent to Hyundais exports. Globally, Hyundai expects to sell about 5.9 lakh units of the hatchback in 2010 compared with 5.61 lakh units last year. In India, the target is to sell 3.4 lakh units this year.

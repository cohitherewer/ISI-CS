	Berlin, May 22 (PTI): The European Union has launched a new initiative to contain the debt crisis in the eurozone and calm down financial markets by agreeing to tighten rules governing the single currency.        
	The finance ministers of the 27 EU nations pledged to enforce strict budget discipline and to impose sanctions on those who violate the budget deficit and debt limit enshrined in the growth and stability pact. They agreed to react speedily and more efficiently in future and to scale down their existing debt.        
	The agreement at the first meeting of the new EU economic task force in Brussels comes at the end of a week which saw the euro plunging to a four-year low and massive sell-offs of global shares over new concerns that Europes debt crisis could stifle the global economic recovery.

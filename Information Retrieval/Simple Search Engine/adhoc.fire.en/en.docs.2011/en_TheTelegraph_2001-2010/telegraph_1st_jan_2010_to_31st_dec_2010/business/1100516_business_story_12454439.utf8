          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 15: Shristi Infrastructure Development Corporation, the company owned by the Hemant Kanoria family, is going ahead with a new phase of real estate development in Asansol even as the initial response to such projects in the tier II and III cities of Bengal is lukewarm.        
	The company has launched upmarket houses within Shristinagar, the township project it is building along with the Asansol Durgapur Development Authority.        
	Chairman Hemant Kanoria said he was confident of demand picking up when the projects near completion. You have to carry on construction and not be worried about the slow pace of sale. That will eventually pick up. This has been our experience in Durgapur, he said.        
	Shristi is also developing projects in Haldia and Krishnanagar, where the first phase is almost complete but sales are not more than 5 per cent. Upfront investment will be very high. Unlike Calcutta, a developer must delve into his pocket to carry on in tier II and III cities, he said.

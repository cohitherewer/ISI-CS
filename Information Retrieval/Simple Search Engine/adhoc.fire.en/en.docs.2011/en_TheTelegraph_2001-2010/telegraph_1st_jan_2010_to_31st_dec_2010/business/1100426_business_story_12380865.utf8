          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, April 25: Australia has invited Indian companies to invest in uranium mines in that country. However, the mineral cannot be exported to India.        
	South Australia has 40 per cent of the worlds deposit of uranium, a critical raw material for civil nuclear power generation that can also be used to make warheads.        
	Brian Hayes, special envoy to India, government of South Australia, said his country would not export uranium to India unless the latter signs the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).        
	Indian companies are free to invest in our mining sector, including uranium. They can export uranium to all those countries who have signed the NPT, Hayes said. He was in Calcutta heading a mining delegation to India.         
	Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries is the only Indian company to be present in South Australia through a joint venture in uranium mining.        
	Hayes expressed hope that government policies can be reviewed going forward without giving a time line when the country would allow uranium exports to India.        
	Over the years, the policy for uranium mining in Australia has been reviewed. Three years back, the government did not allow more than three mines to operate.         
	Now four more mines are in different stages of development.         
	India had signed a nuclear treaty with the United States to expand civil nuclear power generation and meet the growing demand for electricity.        
	This agreement will not cut ice with Australia unless India signs a specific NPT. The Indian government has so far maintained that it would not sign the pact.        
	According to India, the treaty helps to prevent countries from making nuclear weapons but is silent on those that already possess them.        
	So, while countries such as the US and Russia can continue to hold nuclear weapons, a NPT signatory such as India will not be able to either test or build warheads for its self defence.        
	This stance, however, has restricted Indias option to source uranium from abroad, especially from a select body such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group.         
	Industry observers say companies are still eager to invest in Australia because they are looking at a scarce natural resource from a long-term perspective.        
	Besides uranium, South Australia has deposits of iron ore, nickel and cobalt. It also provides opportunity in geothermal energy.

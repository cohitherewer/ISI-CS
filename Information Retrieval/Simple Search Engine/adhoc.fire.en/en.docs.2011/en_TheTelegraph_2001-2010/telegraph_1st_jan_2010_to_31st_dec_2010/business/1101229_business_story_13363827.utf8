                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Primary issues fare well
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 28: Companies raised a record amount in 2010 through the issue of new shares, comprising initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offer (FPOs).         
	A little more than Rs 69,000 crore was raised this year, which is three-and-a-half times higher than the previous year (Rs 19,567 crore) and 53 per cent higher than the earlier record year of 2007 (Rs 45,142 crore), Prithvi Haldea, chairman and managing director of PRIME, a database on the primary market, said.         
	The markets sparkled mainly because of a successful divestment programme of PSUs. During the period, three PSU initial public offers and six FPOs realised Rs 49,007 crore, through divestment of Rs 42,056 crore and fresh capital raising of Rs 6,951 crore. In 2009, Rs 8,816 crore was mobilised through two PSU IPOs.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Family matter
                                One female member, who has joint inheritance in a Hindu Undivided Family, is holding some investments in shares and mutual funds. The head of the HUF now wants the assets transferred to him. Is such a transfer permitted under the Income Tax Act? Will such a transfer attract any tax?           Deepti Saha, Calcutta
                    A total partition can be affected, whereby the karta or the head of the family takes the shares at the original cost and other assets can be given to other members of the HUF. Otherwise, the shares held by the karta can transfer the same to the individual. This will, in effect be partial partition, if there are other assets held by the HUF. However, in case there is a partial partition, the same will attract the clubbing provisions. However, a better way would be outright sale of the investment to the individual.                                   Audit not required      I have a long-term gain of about Rs 30 lakh from sale of shares. Besides, I have an income of Rs 12 lakh. I am self-employed. Do I have to get my income return audited?         Soumen Dutta, Calcutta 
                    Tax audit will not be required for you as it is only for income from business and professions. If you are buying and selling shares, you can treat it either as investment or as business, depending on the period of holding the investment. Investments are chargeable to tax under capital gains. In that case, tax audit is not required. But in case of day trading and investments in derivatives markets, tax audit is required.                                  Surrender signs      I have bought a Ulip for 10 years. I plan to surrender it. How will the income after the surrender be treated for tax?        Paromita Chatterjee, Calcutta
                    If you have claimed deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act on the premium paid for the insurance policy, then you should not sell or discontinue the Ulip units before five years. If you do that, the deduction shall be considered as income in the year in which you sell and you shall have to pay income tax thereon.

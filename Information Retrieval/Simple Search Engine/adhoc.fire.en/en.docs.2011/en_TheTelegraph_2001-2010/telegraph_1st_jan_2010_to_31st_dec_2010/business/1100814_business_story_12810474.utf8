          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 13: Bombay High Court has given the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) the green signal to proceed in its proposed inquiry against audit firm Price Waterhouse (PW) that was responsible for signing off on the accounts of scam-tainted Satyam Computer Services.        
	Audit firm Pricewater House had reviewed Satyams books before founder Ramalinga Raju confessed he had been cooking the software firms books for years.        
	PwC had appealed against a show-cause notice issued by the market regulator in Bombay High Court. The order was handed down by a bench, comprising Justice P.B. Majumdar and R.M. Sawant. A Sebi spokesperson declined to comment on the development.         
	However, a statement by Price Waterhouse said, We are informed that Bombay High Court has disallowed the writ petitions of Price Waterhouse challenging Sebis jurisdiction over accounting and auditing professionals.        
	However, further proceedings of Sebi have been stayed by the high court for four weeks. Meanwhile, we await receipt of the high courts written order, which we will examine to decide our next course of action, including the option of filing an appeal in Supreme Court.        
	Sebi reportedly had issued show-cause notices to Price Waterhouse under the Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices regulations. Sebis contention was that the inquiry against Price Waterhouse was in the interest of investors and the stock markets.        
	While the high courts written order is awaited, it is learnt that the court will not allow Sebi to pass any order restraining any chartered accountant from practising.

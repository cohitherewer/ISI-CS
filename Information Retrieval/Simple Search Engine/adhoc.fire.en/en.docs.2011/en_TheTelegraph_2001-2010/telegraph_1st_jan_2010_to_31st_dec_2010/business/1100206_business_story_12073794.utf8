          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Ahluwalia: Freedom call                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today said fuel prices must be in sync with international prices and a decontrolled regime did not push up inflation but softened the generalised rise in prices.        
	It (decontrolling fuel price) will not flare up inflation. I just think that it is not sustainable to have prices those are not in line with the global rates, Ahluwalia said.        
	On Wednesday, an expert group, headed by former Planning Commission member Kirit Parikh, had suggested the deregulation of fuel prices.        
	By keeping the price of petroleum down you are actually bearing a subsidy that causes a generalised rise in price. If you get rid of the subsidy, there will be a rise in petroleum prices, but it will soften the generalised price rise.        
	He said freeing fuel price was there in the integrated energy policy. We had said that any policy that did not link petroleum and diesel price to evolving trend in world price was absolutely unsustainable. So, I agree with the recommendation of the (Parikh) committee.         
	At present, the government does not allow state-run fuel retailers to fix the prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG in line with global cost, resulting in huge revenue losses for the firms and a subsidy burden on the government.

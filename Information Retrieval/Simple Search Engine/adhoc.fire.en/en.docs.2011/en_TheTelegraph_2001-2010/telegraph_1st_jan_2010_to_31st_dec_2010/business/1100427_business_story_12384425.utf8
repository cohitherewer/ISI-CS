                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Housing start index on way
                            
	Mumbai, April 26 (PTI): The Reserve Bank of India has initiated an exercise to set up a housing start-up index (HSUI) to track new residential projects in 31 major cities and measure the changes in construction activities.        
	The HSUI will cover new residential projects in all major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Bangalore, the RBI said while inviting quotations from consultancy organisations.        
	Housing start-ups in a particular quarter would be estimated from the permits issued in that quarter and the various past quarters by using the rates at which the permits got converted into start-ups in the recent past.        
	According to the RBI, The periodicity of this survey will be once in three years. The agency needs to visit about 350 sites to get the details on house start-ups in each city.         
	The housing index will give insights into consumer activity as construction of new houses typically requires large investments.         
	It depicts forward trends in the economy. An economy that is growing rapidly has an increased demand for housing and HSUI could be used to forecast demand for new houses, it said.         
	Besides, the index will act as an indicator of economic growth as more houses will lead to increased demand for input materials such as steel, cement and credit.         
	The RBI today relaxed the norms for the appointment of business correspondent, permitting any individual to act as a bank agent and offer services in rural areas.

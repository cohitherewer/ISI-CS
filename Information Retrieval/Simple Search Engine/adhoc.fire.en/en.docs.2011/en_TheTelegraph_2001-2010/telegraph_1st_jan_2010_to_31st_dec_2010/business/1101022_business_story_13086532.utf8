The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Chances of strong G20 currency accord bleak
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Chances of strong G20 currency accord bleak

	Gyeongju (South Korea), Oct. 21 (Reuters): G20 officials are unlikely to reach an accord rejecting currency devaluations and capping current account balances, a source said on Thursday, after US proposals ran into stiff opposition.        
	The swift rebuff of a US call for numerical targets for sustainable trade surpluses and deficits underscored the difficulties facing the Group of 20 finance ministers gathering in South Korea as they try to defuse tensions over currencies and economic imbalances.        
	The G20 source said the proposals had not found favour with India, China and other emerging economies, or even the likes of Germany, which has a large current account surplus.         
	In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner called for an agreement on exchange rate policy norms.        
	Right now, there is no established sense of whats fair, he said. We would like countries to move towards a set of norms on exchange rate policy.        
	Washington is also floating the idea of specific targets for current account balances. This will build on a G20 pledge a year ago to tilt growth away from exports in fast-growing surplus countries, such as China, and to boost savings in rich deficit economies, including the US. We are exploring whether we can agree to commit to keep the external imbalances to more sustainable levels, Geithner said.        
	The source said the drafting of a communique would only begin late on Friday after a first round of meetings between finance ministers and central bank governors in Gyeongju.         
	If the US persists with that line, we will oppose it, he said, adding that the final communique would make a rather subdued reference to currencies and current account balances.        
	French economy minister Christine Lagarde said coordination on currency policy was lacking and that Asia had a vital role to play.         
	Sceptical mood        
	Diplomats said Washington was proposing that countries should aim to limit their surplus or deficit on the current account the broadest measure of trade in goods and services  to 4 per cent of gross domestic product.        
	But German economy minister Rainer Bruederle said he was opposed to numerical goals. Macroeconomic fine-tuning and quantitative targets are not the right approach.         
	Russian deputy finance minister Dimitry Pankin was also sceptical about the US initiative. The US will try to put the question of exchange rates and current account balances at the top of the agenda, to try to press China to make some commitments on this issue. In my view, it is unlikely that they will succeed, Pankin said.        
	Most likely, there will be some general words, along the lines of lets all live in peace. I do not expect much success in this sphere, he said.         
	China growth slips         
	Chinas growth ebbed in the third quarter while inflation edged higher, suggesting that the worlds second-largest economy was far from overheating and that an interest rate rise this week may be enough for now.        
	Coming a day ahead of G20 finance ministers meeting where the US and others are expected to push for a stronger Chinese currency, the data could in fact lead Beijing to put appreciation back in the slow lane to reflect the cooler economic conditions.        
	The window for large yuan gains is closing fast. Export growth is slowing and, assuming the current trend is sustained, year-ago growth is on track to fall well below 10 per cent, said Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist with RBS in Hong Kong.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                
	Mumbai, Jan. 22: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has ratcheted up net profits by 15.8 per cent at Rs 4008 crore in the third quarter ended December 31.         
	The oil to petrochemicals giant had reported a net profit of Rs 3462 crore in the same period a year ago.        
	The countrys largest private conglomerate not only beat the Streets estimates of profit growth but also snapped a streak of falling profits over the past four quarters.        
	Gas production from the Krishna-Godavari basin  which is at the centre of a major court battle between the Ambani brothers  provided the ballast for the strong recovery. It was good enough to more than offset the reduced margins from its refining business.        
	The analysts had expected RIL to post net profit in the region of Rs 3500 crore to Rs 3,900 crore.        
	Turnover at RIL during the period spurted nearly 93 per cent to Rs 58,848 crore over Rs 30,537 crore in the same period last year as RIL benefited from the new refinery of Reliance Petroleum Ltd (which is now merged into RIL).        
	Gas production at KGD6 field has been ramped up to 60 million standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd).        
	In the refining business which generated revenues of Rs 48,000 crore (Rs 19,763 crore) during the quarter, RIL posted a gross refining margin (GRM) of $ 5.9 per barrel, down from $ 6 per barrel in the preceding period. However, this figure was ahead of analysts estimates of $ 5.5 per barrel for the third quarter. GRM is the difference between value of petroleum products produced and crude oil price.        
	RIL said that during the quarter, its SEZ refinery operated at 115 per cent of its capacity. The older refinery in the domestic tariff area (DTA) operated at 100 per cent. The company claimed these operating rates were the highest in the world. The refineries collectively processed 44.25 million tonnes of crude as compared with 24.21 million tonnes in the corresponding period of the previous year due to commissioning of the SEZ refinery.        
	Revenues from the exploration amp; production (E amp;P) business jumped to Rs 3530 crore (Rs 1031 crore), a growth of 242 per cent. This was largely due to oil and gas production from KG-D6.         
	The petrochemical business also threw up a positive surprise when segment revenues jumped 17 per cent to Rs 14,756 crore (Rs 12,621 crore). The margins in the segment also improved to 13.9 per cent from 13.1 per cent in the same period last year.        
	I am delighted that both our key projects namely, the new SEZ refinery and KG-D6 oil amp; gas development have ramped up successfully and safely. This reaffirms our belief in our ability to create truly world class assets in the integrated energy value chain. Reliance is well poised to benefit from the improving global economic environment and domestic markets opportunities, said Mukesh D. Ambani, chairman and managing director.        
	RIL clarified that as these are standalone results, it had not included profits from the sale of 1.50 crore equity shares of the company that were held as treasury stock by Petroleum Trust.        
	Although RIL shares ended marginally lower at Rs 1053.15 on the BSE today, its robust results lifted some of the gloom that had hovered over the market since Thursday.        
	The BSE sensex, which had slumped 443 points in intraday trades to 16,608.09, recouped a part of the losses to close at 16,859.68, a drop of 191.46 points.

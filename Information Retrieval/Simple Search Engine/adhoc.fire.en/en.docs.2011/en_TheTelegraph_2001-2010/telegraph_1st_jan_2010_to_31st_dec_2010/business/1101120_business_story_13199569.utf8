          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bansal: Big plans                                  
	New Delhi, Nov 19: State owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will invest around Rs 961 crore to pick up a 26 per cent stake in Nuclear Power Corporations 1,400-mega-watt (MW) project at Kota in Rajasthan.        
	We will join Nuclear Power Corporation by picking up 26 per cent equity in their 1,400MW Kota atomic plant. The joint venture agreement will be signed in a month, IOC chairman and managing director B. M. Bansal said.        
	The project, which will entail an investment of Rs 12,000 crore, will be funded through a debt-equity ratio of 70:30.         
	The facility will be completed by 2015-16.         
	Sources said IOC would initially pick up a 26 per cent stake but would have the option to increase it up to 49 per cent.        
	The cost of setting up a mega watt of nuclear power is Rs 8-10 crore.         
	The foray into nuclear power is part of a blueprint drawn up by Bansal to make IOC an integrated energy firm.         
	The company has ventured into wind power and joined hands with the Tatas to set up a thermal plant for its refinery and petrochemical complex at Paradip in Orissa. The Tatas will hold a 74 per cent stake in the venture.         
	IOC has commissioned its first wind farm, which generates 21MW, at Kandla in Gujarat.        
	Nuclear Power Corporation has a preliminary agreement with Frances Areva to provide it with six reactors with lifetime fuel supply for a proposed park at Jaitapur in Maharashtra. Toshiba and GE also provide reactors to the company.        
	Bansal said IOC expected to enter the markets with its follow-on offer in the third or fourth week of January.

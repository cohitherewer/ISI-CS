          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 28: Reliance Industries Ltd has made its fourth oil discovery in the Cambay basin, Gujarat, that increases the potential of these exploratory blocks.        
	The discovery is significant as this play fairway is expected to open more oil pools leading to better hydrocarbon potential within the block, the company said. The current flow at this onland block, which was awarded under the Nelp-V round of bidding, is 300 barrels of oil per day. So far, RIL has drilled 14 exploratory wells in the block, in which it holds 100 per cent participating interest.         
	The potential commercial interest of the discovery is being ascertained through data gathering and analysis, the company said. RIL expects that there are several more prospects with upside potential at different stratigraphic levels.        
	RIL, which began pumping gas in the Krishna-Godavari basin last year, has ramped up production to 60 million standard cubic metres of gas a day (mmscmd) in nine months from 16 wells. The company has also signed up with about 50 customers according to the governments gas utilisation policy for over 69mmscmd in the fertiliser, power, city gas, steel, LPG, refinery and petrochemical sectors.        
	The countrys largest listed firm crossed a turnover of Rs 2,00,000 crore in 2009-10 and posted a 30 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 4,710 crore for the quarter ended March 31.        
	Gas verdict        
	Shares of Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Natural Resources Ltd surged 8 per cent in morning trade after reports that the Supreme Court verdict on the gas tussle is expected next week as Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan, who is leading the 3-member bench on the case, will retire on March 11. While RNRL rose over 6 per cent to close at Rs 66.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, RIL was down 4 per cent to close at Rs 1,017.

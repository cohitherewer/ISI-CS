          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, July 12: The sensex today breached the 18000-mark for the first time in three months on expectations of strong first-quarter results.         
	Though the BSE benchmark pared some of its gains, the Nifty of the National Stock Exchange closed at a new 30-month high.         
	The earnings season will commence tomorrow with Infosys Technologies declaring its first-quarter numbers.         
	Many analysts expect the Bangalore-based company to not only post better-than-expected results but also come out with an optimistic guidance for the year, resulting in the stock hitting a 52-week high on Friday.         
	The sensex opened strong at 17875.97 and breached the psychological 18000-mark to hit a high of 18010.07, a level last seen on April 7.         
	However, the index could not hold on to its gains on disappointing IIP (index for industrial production) numbers. IIP for May stood at 11.5 per cent, lower than the expectation of around 16 per cent. This led the sensex to recede from its high and end at 17937.20, a rise of 103.66 points, or 0.58 per cent.         
	However, the wide-based Nifty of the National Stock Exchange crossed the 5400-mark after 29 months before ending 0.57 per cent higher at 5383 points.         
	This is Niftys best closing since February 5, 2008.         
	According to market observers, much will depend on the guidance to be given by Infosys tomorrow.         
	We may see the sensex settling above the 18000-mark if the guidance is something which the markets like. However, at the same time, it needs to be noted that a correction is in the offing, an analyst said.         
	Infosys today rose 0.80 per cent to close at Rs 2,894.95 on the BSE. The scrip climbed 1.38 per cent to touch a 52-week high of Rs 2,911.55. Other IT firms such as TCS rose 2.19 per cent and Wipro, 2.25 per cent        
	On the NSE, the Infosys scrip rose 0.74 per cent to close at Rs 2,895 after hitting Rs 2,910 in morning trade.        
	Domestic brokerage Emkay expects a revenue growth in the range of 3-5 per cent in dollar terms for frontline IT firms, with Infosys expected to clock the highest at 5 per cent.         
	Edelweiss, too, sees Infosys surpassing its revenue guidance of 2.6-3.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter, despite the currency impact.        
	The Bangalore-based firm had posted a better-than-expected net profit of Rs 1,617 crore in the March quarter, and for the full year, its profit had risen 4.64 per cent to Rs 6,266 crore.         
	The Infy scrip registered good gains during the previous trading session on Friday. It has witnessed a huge run-up of over 77 per cent in the past 52 weeks as the counter touched an annual low of Rs 1,635 on July 10, 2009.         
	The BSE realty index led the list of sectoral gainers, with DLF rising 2.38 per cent, the most among sensex scrips.         
	Some of the other notable gainers included Tata Motors, which rose 2.32 per cent.         
	Among the banking stocks, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank surged 2.06 per cent each, while the State Bank of India rose over 1 per cent.         
	Metal stocks were also in the green on better prices at the the London Metal Exchange.

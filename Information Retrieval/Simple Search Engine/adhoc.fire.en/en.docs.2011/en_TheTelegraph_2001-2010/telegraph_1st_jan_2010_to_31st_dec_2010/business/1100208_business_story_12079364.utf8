The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gift for daughter
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Gift for daughter
                                On attaining age 18 my daughter will receive about Rs 2 lakh as gift (Children Career Growth Scheme). Would she be liable to pay tax on that? Would she need a PAN?           B. Ghosh, Kadamtala
                    Presuming that the name of the scheme you mentioned is a mutual fund, your daughter wont need to pay any tax because capital gains tax on equity mutual funds is zero if the units are held for more than 12 months.                                   Need a PAN      I am 20 years old and have income from running an agency and from private tuitions. What is the threshold income limit to apply for a PAN?        Sushmita Ganguli, Calcutta
                    The basic exemption limit on annual income for women below 65 years of age has been increased to Rs 1,90,000 in the financial year 2009-10. However, there is no threshold income limit for applying for a PAN. You can apply for a PAN even if you have no taxable income.                                  Senior citizens      I am a senior citizen (over 70 years) and have interest income from Senior Citizen Savings Scheme and Post Office Monthly Income Scheme. My total income is Rs 2,35,175. Do I have to pay income tax and submit return?        R.K. Banerjee, Selimpur
                The basic exemption limit on annual income for senior citizens (above 65 years of age) is Rs 2,40,000 for the financial year 2009-10. So, if you have a total income of Rs 2,35,175 in 2009-10, you dont have to file income tax return.                                  Tax query      I am above 71 years. In 2008-09, I paid an income tax of Rs 1,050. But in 2009-10, the basic exemption limit for senior citizens have been increased to Rs 2,40,000 and my total income was below that. Do I need to submit income tax return?        M.C. Basu, Howrah
                    g of income tax return is voluntary for those who dont have taxable income. So, you can skip filing IT return if your total income is less than Rs 2,40,000 in 2009-10.

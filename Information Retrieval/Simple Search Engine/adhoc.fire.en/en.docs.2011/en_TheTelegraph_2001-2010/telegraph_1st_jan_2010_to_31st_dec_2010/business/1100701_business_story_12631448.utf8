          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 30: Private banks chose to play safe and set their base rates in close proximity to the State Bank of Indias 7.5 per cent announced yesterday, nixing speculation that they would trigger a rate war by aggressively setting their benchmark rates at way below 7 per cent.        
	ICICI Bank  the countrys largest private bank  fixed its base rate at 7.5 per cent as also Axis Bank. HDFC Bank kept its base rate at 7.25 per cent.        
	On Tuesday, the SBI had announced a base rate of 7.50 per cent, and a host of its public sector peers set their minimum lending rate at 8 per cent.         
	According to an RBI notification, banks will have to switch to the new regime from July 1.        
	After the SBI announced its rate, there was a big buzz that large private sector banks would set their minimum lending rate way below SBIs and, thereby, lure away prized corporate customers. The banks have announced their rates in the range of 7-8.5 per cent. The lowest rate of 7 per cent came from Dhanalakshmi Bank and DBS Bank.        
	Senior officials at HDFC Bank indicated that the base rate of 7.25 per cent had been set on the basis of a combination of short-term rates and other factors. They added that the new rate regime would not bring about any material change in existing lending rates for both retail and corporate customers.        
	The SBI had considered the six-month deposit rate (around 5.5 per cent) as its cost of funds to which it added the negative carry-on cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), overhead costs and average return on net worth to arrive at the base rate.        
	SBI teaser rates stay        
	The SBI today decided to extend its popular home and car loan schemes till September 30 and offer the same interest rate structure as given to its new customers now.        
	Many had expected the SBI to scrap the scheme, especially after the RBI had voiced its concern that borrowers might not understand clearly the implications of taking a home loan that promised a low teaser rate in the initial years and then bumped up to a market-driven rate subsequently.        
	The bank decided to extend its flagship home loan schemes  SBI Advantage Home Loans and SBI Easy Home Loans  and car loan schemes. The bank said it was not altering their terms because of the transition to the new system, with effect from July 1. The new loans will be benchmarked against the base rate and not the benchmark prime lending rate.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 27: Tata Sons will infuse close to Rs 1,350 crore, or about $290 million, in Tata Steel by way of a preferential issue.        
	The main promoter of the Tata group informed the stock exchanges that it would subscribe to 1.5 crore ordinary shares and 1.2 crore warrants.        
	The price will be determined later following the Sebi-approved formula. However, going by the closing price of the Tata Steel scrip on the Bombay Stock Exchange today, the preferential issue could raise as much as Rs 1,350 crore.        
	The decision was taken by a committee of the board of directors a day after Tata Steel announced a loss of Rs 2,010 crore in 2009-10 because of a poor market condition in Europe in the first half of the fiscal.        
	Tata Steel group CFO Koushik Chatterjee yesterday said the company would consider raising equity to reduce debt, expand steelmaking capacity and develop mines. On the BSE, the Tata Steel scrip settled at Rs 493, up 1.76 per cent from its previous close, even though the news of the issue came after market hours.        
	The development comes at a time when the value of the Tata Steel stock has eroded 23 per cent from the peak it reached this month and 33 per cent from its year high though the sensex has dropped only 5 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.        
	Following the conversion of warrants into fully-paid equity shares, the combined holding of the promoters will go up around 2 per cent to 33.34 per cent from 31.46 per cent now, provided there is no further dilution of equity.        
	Tata Sons directly holds 29.13 per cent in Tata Steel.        
	According to analysts, the equity-raising exercise will help the company reduce its net debt, which stood at $9.88 billion at the end of March 31 against $11.21 billion a year ago.        
	This year, Tata Steel intends to repay $250 million debt and pre-pay a debt of around $162 million. The company had said it wanted to raise a loan with a maturity of 20 years during this year.        
	Tata Sons also plans to invest Rs 400 crore in Tata Chemicals.

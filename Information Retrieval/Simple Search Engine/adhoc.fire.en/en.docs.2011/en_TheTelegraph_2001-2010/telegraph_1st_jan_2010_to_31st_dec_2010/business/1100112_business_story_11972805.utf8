	New Delhi, Jan. 11: India has agreed to remove 47 items from its negative list of imports from Bangladesh and allow their duty-free entry.        
	The decision to remove the 47 items, including readymade garments, was taken during the meeting of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina today.        
	Sources said India would remove the items from its negative list of over 480 products from Bangladesh, narrowing its trade surplus with its neighbour.         
	Dhaka had sought duty-free access for 232 products.        
	Hasina, sources said, expressed the need for better trade infrastructure. She sought institutional mechanisms to promote two-way trade, easy travel for businessmen and measures to settle trade disputes.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said India wanted to withdraw tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods from Bangladesh.         
	We want many products from Bangladesh to enter India without any duty, Mukherjee said.        
	Dhaka exports chemical products, raw jute and finished good, frozen food, farm products, leather, readymade garments, tea and knitwear to India.         
	It imports cereals, all types of cotton, boilers, machinery oils, bituminous substances, edible vegetables, vehicles and its parts, iron and steel, plastic and rubber articles, among others.        
	In energy, the two countries agreed to trade electricity amounting to over 900 million units per annum.        
	The price and various modalities will be worked out later in a memorandum of understanding. Initially, about 250MW would be exchanged.

                                I want to know about the deduction from my gross annual income under Section 80D for premium payment towards the LICs Health Plus scheme. I have spent a large sum of money for the treatment of my brother. He had an heart attack and got angioplasty in a renowned hospital. I paid all expenditure. Can I get deduction under section 80DDB?          Swapan Kumar Mondal, Howrah
                    Tax benefit under Section 80D is available under the plan for the premium amount allocated for hospitalisation benefit. Section 80DDB allows for deduction of medical expenditure incurred for specified ailments. However, the list of specified diseases doesnt cover heart surgery. So, you cannot claim tax benefit on the expenditure.                                  Tax count      I have a non-resident ordinary account (NRO account) in a bank. I have three fixed deposits of Rs 15 lakh each. FDs are of 1000 days and the rate of interest is 10.6 per cent per annum. My interest income in all these three FDs after maturity in the year 2010-11 will be Rs 15 lakh. How much will be the TDS on the interest income?        A. Sagar, Calcutta
                    The rate of tax deducted at source on interest income in the case of an NRO account is 33 per cent if the payment is Rs 10 lakh or more. So, the amount of tax deducted will be around Rs 4,95,000.                                  Share it with daughter      I have invested some amount from my savings jointly with my wife and daughter. Earlier, I used to show the entire income from the investment in the Post Office Monthly Income Scheme in my tax return. My daughter has joined service and her income is taxable. What part of the interest income should be included in my daughters income?        N. Banerjee, Calcutta
                    Your daughter will have to show the interest income (her share only) as part of her total annual income for tax purposes. However, TDS is not applicable. You can split the interest amount among three of you. Give your daughters share to her. She will pay the tax on this amount.

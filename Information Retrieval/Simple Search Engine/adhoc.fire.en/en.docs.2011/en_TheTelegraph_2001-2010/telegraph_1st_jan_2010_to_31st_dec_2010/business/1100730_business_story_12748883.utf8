          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Colao: Stern                                  
	New Delhi, July 29: Vodafone today said it was not liable to pay any tax in India on the $11.1-billion deal with Hutchison International in 2007.        
	We continue to be convinced and advised that no tax is due. We have made an acquisition in this country. We have not sold assets, Vodafone-Essar CEO Vittorio Colao told reporters here.        
	We have confidence in the court process. India has a very solid legal system.        
	Vodafone has filed an appeal in Bombay High Court, challenging the income tax departments decision to levy tax on the company for the 2007 stake buy. The court has deferred the hearing on the appeal till August 2. A source said Vodafones dues, according to the I-T department, was about Rs 12,000 crore.        
	Vodafone has also expressed disappointment over the telecom environment in India. Colao said, We need stable policies. We need investment-oriented policies. Players like us who believe in this market, who invest in this market, who have brought competition in the market should be allowed to continue the investment strategy.        
	Meanwhile, the Essar group confirmed that it was considering an initial public offering to sell its 33 per cent stake in Vodafone         
	All options are open. An IPO is one of them and that is under preliminary discussions, said Prashant Ruia, chief executive officer of the Essar group.        
	The steel-to-shipping conglomerate has been in talks with banks for options, including an IPO, said sources. A 10 per cent stake sale may take place early next year, the sources added.        
	Following Vodafones deal with Hutchison, the Ruias of the Essar group  which is a partner in the telecom venture  has the option of selling its entire 33 per cent stake to the UK firm for $5 billion between the third year and the fourth year of the deals completion. Alternatively, Essar can get an independent valuation by selling a small stake in the open market by May 2011.        
	We have a partner here. We will decide together what to do, Colao said today.

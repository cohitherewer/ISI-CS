The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Steel priority to debt recast
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata Steel priority to debt recast
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tata Steel chairman Ratan Tata with vice-chairman B. Muthuraman in Mumbai on Friday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 13: Tata Steel is looking to pare its Rs 45,000-crore debt and restructure the company before it starts raising cash once again to fund its ambitious growth plans.        
	We are looking at ways and means to de-leverage the borrowing in the balance sheet and restructure the company to meet our requirements going forward, Tata Steel chairman Ratan Tata told the companys shareholders here today.        
	Tata did not give the specifics of the restructuring plan but drew a broad outline of the steel makers growth plans in India and at UK-based Corus, which it acquired three years ago.        
	Tata Steel is setting up a 6-million-tonne (mt) plant at Kalinganagar in Orissa and a 5mt unit in Chhattisgarh, while it plans to expand capacity at Jamshedpur. It has also made huge investments to ensure raw material security. These include significant investments in a coal project in Mozambique and an iron-ore project in Canada.         
	Tata said the group would look to improve the prospects for its European operations (Corus), which had not seen investments over the past few years.        
	He said the global economic environment continued to pose challenges with the US showing some signs of recovery and western Europe struggling to get back on its feet. The UK is not showing great signs of recovery, but Asia is booming with India and China providing much of the momentum. In such a scenario, the challenge for Tata Steel will be to expand both its capacity and capabilities in India.        
	There is tremendous opportunity in this part of the world to grow this particular business (steel), he said. Yet, the major concern before the industry was the rising price of raw materials such as iron ore and coal.

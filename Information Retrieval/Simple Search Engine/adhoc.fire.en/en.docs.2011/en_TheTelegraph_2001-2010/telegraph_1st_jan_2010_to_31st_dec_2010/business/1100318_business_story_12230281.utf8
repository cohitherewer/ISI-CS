The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Qualcomm bids for broadband
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Qualcomm bids for broadband
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 17: US-based technology developer Qualcomm today filed an application with the department of telecom to bid for broadband wireless spectrum, becoming the first overseas firm to participate in the auction.         
	We are planning to bid for one broadband wireless spectrum slot. Over a five-year horizon, it is an attractive proposition for us to invest, Kanwalinder Singh, president of Qualcomm (India and South Asia), said.         
	Qualcomm will take Indian partners after the auction, in compliance with the foreign direct investment regulations.        
	The government plans to auction two slots of broadband spectrum in the 2.5 gigahertz band in April at a base price of Rs 1,750 crore for one pan-India slot.         
	Wireless broadband technologies enable high-speed data communication and provide better coverage than fixed-line broadband systems.        
	The auction for broadband radiowaves will start two days after the sale of third-generation (3G) spectrum. The government will start 3G spectrum auction from April 9.         
	Vodafone and Telenor are expected to bid for 3G radiowaves, while Google is said to be interested in the broadband spectrum. Maxis-owned Aircel may bid for both 3G and broadband spectrum. The last day for applications is March 19. Qualcomm said it would have Indian partners if it succeeded in getting spectrum. Indian rules stipulate 74 per cent foreign direct investment in telecom.        
	Qualcomm and its partners will decide the ventures strategy. Qualcomms goal is to attract an operator partner or partners at the appropriate time for construction of a TD-LTE (time division duplex long-term evolution) network in compliance with the governments rollout requirement for broadband spectrum and then to exit the venture, Singh said.

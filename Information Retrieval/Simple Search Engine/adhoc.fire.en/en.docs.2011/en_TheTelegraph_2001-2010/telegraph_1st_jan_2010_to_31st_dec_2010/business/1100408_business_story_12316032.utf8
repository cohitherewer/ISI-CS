          OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES                               
	New Delhi, April 7: The government today said the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had sought some clarifications on the telecom licences issued in 2008 but had not come out with any report that criticised the telecom ministry for causing a loss of Rs 26,000 crore to the exchequer.        
	The potential loss arrived at and the administrative decision referred to in the memo have been made on the basis of the views inferred by the P amp;T audit wing of the CAG, the telecom ministry said in a statement. It is premature and unwarranted to call a mere inspection memo as CAG audit report, the official statement said.        
	Earlier in the day, telecom minister A. Raja had said that some queries had been received from the CAG over the issue of telecom licences in 2008 and the department of telecom would respond to them soon.        
	The CAG is sending some queries according to their own perceptions and inferences and it will be duly responded to by the department of telecom, the minister told reporters on the sidelines of a function here.        
	The CAG is a constitutional authority that audits all government departments and PSUs every year. Its reports are placed before Parliament. However, it is up to the government to take appropriate actions against the findings.         
	Raja has been accused of giving new pan-India licences in 2008 at a nominal rate of Rs 1,651 crore  a price fixed in 2001.

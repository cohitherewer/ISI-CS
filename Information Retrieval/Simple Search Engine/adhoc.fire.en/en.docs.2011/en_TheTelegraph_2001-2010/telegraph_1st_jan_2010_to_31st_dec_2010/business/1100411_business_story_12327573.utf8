	Calcutta, April 10: The Securities and Exchange Board of India has asked stock brokers to frame a code of ethics within a year.         
	At a seminar organised by the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (Anmi) here today, Sebi chairman C.B Bhave said, The brokers association should come out with a document detailing the code of ethics. The code will prevent mis-selling of financial products.         
	The market regulator felt brokers encouraged clients in margin trading and derivatives, without explaining the risks involved.         
	We receive complaints from investors about getting highly leveraged and we believe many of them dont fully understand what leveraging means, Bhave said.         
	The Sebi chairman also pointed out at the growing number of complaints on demat accounts based on the power of attorney.        
	When an Anmi member suggested a threshold for margin trading, Bhave said the matter should be discussed among brokers.        
	On the issue of stamp duty, Bhave said the matter would be looked into after the sub-committee submitted its report. The rules and rates of stamp duty vary with states.        
	Stock brokers hoped this ambiguity would be resolved by Sebi.        
	Stimulus rollback        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was present at the seminar, hinted at further rollback of stimulus measures announced in the wake of the global financial crisis, saying an economic recovery offered room for such a move.         
	Mukherjee said the economy could grow by up to 8.75 per cent in the current fiscal.        
	I am hopeful that the growth will climb back to 8.25-8.75 per cent and perhaps at the mid point around 8.5 in 2010-11, he said at the function.

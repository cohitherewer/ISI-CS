	Calcutta, April 29: CESC Ltd has decided to revive the Balagarh thermal power project to meet the growing demand of electricity in the state.        
	The RPG Enterprises flagship had planned the project with a 500MW capacity in 1994 but shelved it in 2001.        
	The company continues to hold 800 acres of land, located on a riverine island on the Hooghly, about 70km (upstream) from Calcutta, for the power project.        
	Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of CESC, today said the board had agreed to build a 660MW plant in the first phase for Rs 3,200 crore. There are plans to double the capacity in the second phase.        
	We are writing to the coal ministry seeking allotment. An environmental study will be commissioned soon, he said.        
	The Balagarh plant will be in addition to a 600MW unit CESC intends to build in Haldia. Taken up two years ago, the project in the port town is stuck over land acquisition.        
	Goenka insisted that the decision to revive Balagarh was taken to keep the company prepared for the huge power deficit that the state would face in the future.        
	However, the announcement came within a two-week deadline set by former CPM MP and Hooghly district leader Anil Basu who had asked CESC to either set up the power plant or return the land.        
	Basu was happy over the development. I am thankful to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for the support to the project, he said.        
	Basu said farmers had given the land willingly for the project in 1998, but they got restless after nothing happened in the last 12 years.        
	People had started cultivating on the plot as it was lying vacant for long.         
	But I dont anticipate any resistance. In fact, there was a rally today in the area in support of the project, Basu added.        
	Goenka said CESC and the state government had mutually agreed not to pursue the project in the past.        
	There was a hostile regulatory environment. But that was in the past. Today, the project has support from the chief minister, power minister, regulatory authority and the Centre, he said.        
	Earlier, CESC was apparently told to focus on the distribution, while the erstwhile state-owned WBSEB was supposed to look after additional generation. The tariff offered by the regulator was also low.        
	The Balagarh project is fraught with challenges. The embankment needs to be strengthened. A bridge has to be built for connectivity over the rivulet created after the Hooghly changed its course.        
	Profit show        
	CESC Ltd today reported a net profit of Rs 100 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, a 6.38 per cent rise over the corresponding period last year.        
	Net sales were Rs 754 crore during the quarter, higher than Rs 741 crore in the year-ago quarter. The power utility reported a net profit of Rs 433 crore, higher by 5.6 per cent, for 2009-10. Net sales for the year under review were Rs 3,291 crore against Rs 3,031 crore in 2008-09.

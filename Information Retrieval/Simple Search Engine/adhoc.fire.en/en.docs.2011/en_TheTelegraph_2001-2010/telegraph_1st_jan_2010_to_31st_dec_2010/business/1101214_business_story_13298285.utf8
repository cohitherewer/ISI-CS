	New Delhi, Dec. 13: The one-man committee to probe the allocation of telecom licences and sprectrum from 2001 to 2009 will look only at the internal procedures followed in the exercises, the department of telecom (DoT) has said.         
	Headed by retired Supreme Court judge Shivraj Vir Patil, the committee does not have the power to interrogate former telecom ministers or officials. It can, however, ask officials to explain any lapses found in the paperwork.        
	The probe is restricted to internal, that is, intra-departmental procedures adopted by the DoT to grant licences and spectrum, Patil, who took formal charge today, said. Matters being looked into by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India are not under its purview.        
	The CBI is investigating any wrongdoing by former telecom minister A. Raja and other DoT officials in granting licences. The CAG has stated that the DoT gave 2G licences to ineligible applicants.        
	According to the DoT, the panel will study the circumstances and developments that led to the formulation of the New Telecom Policy 1999 and subsequently, the introduction of fourth cellular telecom mobile service licence in 2001. The BJP-led NDA government was in power in 2001.        
	In 1999, the DoT shifted from a fixed licence fee model  when operators had to pay an annual fee of over Rs 2,000 crore  to a revenue sharing arrangement  when fees ranged between Rs 5 crore and Rs 10 crore. The move has often been cited by detractors as a bailout of the operators.         
	Ratan Tata in his open letter to Rajeev Chandrasekhar claimed that the switchover had caused a loss of around Rs 50,000 crore to the government.         
	The Supreme Court, which is monitoring the probe, has asked the CBI to extend its investigation of the spectrum scam to 2001, the year radio waves started to be allocated on first come, first served basis.         
	The panel will examine whether the procedures were fair and transparent, and consistent with the policies of the telecom department.         
	However, Patil said, it will not recommend any action if there is any deviation from the accepted practices.        
	Showcause notices        
	The DoT has issued showcause notices to five firms  Loop Telecom, Unitech Wireless, Etisalat DB, Videocon and STel  that were given 85 licences in 2008.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 9: Panasonic India plans to invest around Rs 1,400 crore this fiscal in capacity expansion and to increase its market share to more than the current 10 per cent in consumer durables.        
	The investment, funded from the companys internal accruals, will also be used to push the Japanese companys reach in the rural and semi-urban areas.         
	Panasonic is trying to strengthen its foothold in a market dominated by Koreas LG and Samsung. At present, LG enjoys a market share of 27 per cent, while Samsung has grabbed 19 per cent.         
	As part of its expansion plans, the company is looking to open a manufacturing facility in Haryana, said Sabiha Kidwai, general manager (marketing and corporate strategies), Panasonic India.         
	It also plans to use products of Sanyo Electric Co, which it had acquired four months back, to tap the low-end segment.         
	The Haryana plant will be operational by 2012. It will initially make air-conditioners and later manufacture other products. At present, the company assembles most of its products at its Noida plant.         
	Panasonics thrust will be on tapping the rural and semi-urban markets where demand remained stable even during the slowdown. We are retaining the Sanyo brand. We will soon start selling their products since we now have the distribution rights to sell them. This will enable us to enter the lower end of the market, Kidwai said. Panasonic may sell Sanyo branded products in the rural and tier II and III cities.        
	In the urban areas, the company may sharpen the presence of its flagship Panasonic products. The details of the brand strategy are being worked out.         
	Kidwai said Panasonic was aiming at a turnover of around Rs 3,000 crore for the current fiscal, up from Rs 2,200 crore in 2009-10.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | HDFC Bank ups base rate
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      HDFC Bank ups base rate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Oct. 5: A clutch of banks  HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda (BoB), Andhra Bank and Development Credit Bank  today raised their benchmark rates by 25-50 basis points to maintain their margins after the recent hike in deposit rates.        
	HDFC Bank has hiked its base rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 per cent with immediate effect. ICICI Bank has effected a 25-basis-points increase in its base rate to 7.75 per cent.         
	The largest private lender, which had earlier raised the benchmark rate on loans made up to June 30 by half a percentage point, said the new rate would be effective from tomorrow on all loans, barring fixed rates. The bank has also increased deposit rates by 25-50 basis points.        
	BoB and Development Credit Bank have hiked base rates to 8.5 per cent and 8.25 per cent, respectively.         
	Deposit rates and consequently cost of funds have increased, especially in the shorter tenor, necessitating an increase in the base rate, Development Credit Bank MD Murali M. Natrajan said.         
	The possibility of a rate hike looked certain last month when the RBI raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6 per cent and the reverse repo by half a percentage point to 5 per cent.        
	The reverse repo is the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity from banks, and repo is the rate at which it provides money to banks.

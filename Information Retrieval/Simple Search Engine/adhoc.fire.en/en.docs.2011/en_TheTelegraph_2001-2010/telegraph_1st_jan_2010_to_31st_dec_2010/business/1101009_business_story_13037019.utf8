                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Auto sales approach speed hump
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Goenka: Fingers crossed                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 8: The automobile industry will grow 18-20 per cent by the end of this fiscal with car sales alone projected to surge 23 per cent  but thats only after it negotiates a slight hump that is expected in the third quarter (October to December).        
	Pawan Goenka, president of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), said here today that the industry had seen robust sales in the first half of 2010-11, fuelled by rising incomes and a spate of launches.         
	However, the third quarter is expected to see some moderation in growth as producers come to terms with the high base effect and other challenges such as rising interest rates and capacity constraints at the suppliers end.        
	Car sales for September alone rose 30 per cent to 1,69,082 units from 1,29,684 units in the same month last year.         
	The previous best was recorded in August when sales stood at 1,60,794 units.        
	Motorcycle sales grew 15.50 per cent to 7,78,352 units from 6,73,893 units in the same month last year.         
	The previous highest of 7,27,542 units was achieved in August.        
	Total two-wheeler sales achieved a record figure of 10,05,162 units, up 19.93 per cent from 8,38,152 units in the year-ago period.         
	The previous best was recorded at 9,57,304 units in August.        
	Sales of commercial vehicles increased 29.56 per cent to 59,455 units from 45,889 units a year earlier.        
	According to Siam, in September, the total number of vehicles sold in the country touched a record 13,29,086 units.         
	However, the stellar growth numbers may not be repeated during the December quarter. An indication to this effect was given by Goenka.         
	In the third quarter, we expect some moderation in growth because the third quarter of last year was one of the best growth quarters for the industry, he said.        
	Goenka warned that another rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India could hurt sales.         
	The central bank is set to unveil its monetary policy on November 2, and many observers do not rule out the possibility of the RBI hiking key short-term rates by 25 basis points to combat inflation which is still beyond its comfort zone.         
	Banks have already made car and auto loans dearer by raising their base rates by 25-50 basis points. Since a large part of the auto sales in India is financed, a rise in interest rates is seen as impacting demand.        
	If there is a hike in policy rates in November, it will have a significant impact on the industry, Goenka said.        
	Siam has, however, raised its growth forecast for the current fiscal to 18-20 per cent from an earlier projection of 13-15 per cent.        
	Utility vehicle sales are expected to grow 17-19 per cent. Commercial vehicle sales are projected to rise 22 per cent and two-wheeler sales by 20 per cent.

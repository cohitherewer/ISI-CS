                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Euro crisis fears haunt sensex
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, May 17: The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange sensex fell nearly a percentage point on Monday to close 159.04 points lower at 16835.56 as worries over the crisis in the Euro zone continued to persist.         
	The sensex, which had plunged over 400 points earlier in the day to touch a low of 16551 points, made a smart recovery as sentiments revived with engineering major Larsen amp; Toubro Ltd posting strong earnings.         
	We seem to have found the bottom at current levels. The global opening cues were weak on Monday and the smart and sharp recovery was surprising, said brokerage house Motilal Oswals vice-president (equity sales) Jigar Shah.         
	Analysts said a recovery in European stocks later in the day as well as news on the monsoon also aided the U-turn. Asian markets continued to be weak on Monday.        
	Some expect the volatility to continue in the Indian markets even though the prospects of economic growth look strong. Sharekhan Ltds head of research Gaurav Dua said, Expect volatility to continue as global issues, including the European debt crisis, persist.        
	The National Stock Exchange index Nifty ended 33.60 points lower to close at 5059.90. Its heartening to see that we still managed to make the 5000-mark, Shah added.        
	Oil and gas, information technology, automobile, and realty stocks were the worst hit during the day. The BSE saw 1,056 advances, 1,746 declines, while 87 scrips remained unchanged during the day. Index heavyweight Reliance Industries lost 2.57 per cent to close at Rs 1,016.75.         
	Rupee takes a hit        
	The rupee today touched a two-month low of 45.77 against the dollar on heavy purchases of the US currency by importers. The rupee closed at 45.62 a dollar, down 40 paise from the previous close.

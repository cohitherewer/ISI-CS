The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rio threatens to spoil Tata African safari

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 6: Tata Steels most prized raw material asset outside India is under threat of being taken over by the worlds second largest miner  Rio Tinto.        
	Riversdale Mining, a company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASE) and having world class coal mines in Mozambique, has confirmed talks with Rio. Tata is the biggest shareholder in the Aussie firm.        
	In a communication to the ASE, Riversdale said Rio had indicated an Aus$15 per share offer that valued the company at Aus$3.2 billion. However, it has said there is no certainty that Rio will make a formal proposal even as discussions are on.        
	Apart from a 24.21 per cent stake in parent Riversdale, which has the licence for several big-ticket coal assets in Mozambique, the Indian company owns 35 per cent of a specific block called Benga in the African country.        
	After buying into that block three years back for a mere Aus$100 million, the Tatas found the potential reserve to be four times more after a detailed exploration. Tata Steel considers Benga to be strategic for the long-term sustainability of its European operation.        
	In a statement today, the company said it considered Riversdale as a valuable strategic investment and continues to be interested in developing the Mozambique block. Tata Steel said it would continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action when necessary.        
	NMDC, Indias largest iron ore miner, had earlier expressed interest in picking up 10 per cent in Riversdale. It had floated an idea to work in tandem with Tata Steel and forge an Indian majority in the company, saying the move will be good for the country.        
	It would be interesting to see if the Tatas and NMDC together make a counter-bid if such a situation arises.         
	In any case, a Rio offer does not mandatorily mean a Tata exit. The Indian company can hold on to its stake despite the Rio offer. Shares of Tata Steel on the BSE and Riversdale on the ASE jumped on the news.

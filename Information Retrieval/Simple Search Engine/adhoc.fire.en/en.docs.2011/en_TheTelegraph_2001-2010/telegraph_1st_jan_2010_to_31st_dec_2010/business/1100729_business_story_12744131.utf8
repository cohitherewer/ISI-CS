The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to check telecom security lapse
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bid to check telecom security lapse
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Call alert                                  
	New Delhi, July 28: Telecom equipment must be subject to third-party security checks, the government said today.        
	Paying heed to the security alarm raised by the intelligence agencies, the telecom department also said that equipment maintenance should be done locally.        
	Other changes  the department has amended the licence conditions  are for equipment vendors to share the source code and design details.        
	Suppliers will have to pay a penalty equivalent to 100 per cent of the contract value if there is a security breach.        
	Earlier, vendors had opposed the revealing of source codes as this would compromise their patent rights.         
	The amendment said all operators would have to get their networks audited for security bugs from a list of approved certification agencies. The third-party audit will be initially limited to core equipment such as routers, switches, firewalls and software used for billing.        
	Intelligence sleuths fear that these equipment, usually imported from countries such as China, can have secret interfaces or backdoors that allow them to be monitored and even controlled from a location outside the country.         
	Systems such as firewalls often prove ineffective against such embedded bugs.         
	Security agencies, in notes to the government, have warned that Chinese spying agencies were currently more keen to keep tabs on Indian telecom networks but could in the future use embedded bugs to attack or disrupt telecom services. The effect on telecom services could be catastrophic.        
	Earlier this year, India had barred Indian operators from placing orders with Chinas Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp.        
	China has become Indias largest trading partner, and the government feels it cannot legitimately ban trade in certain goods with it. At the same time, it wants to take heed of threats which security agencies have flagged since an attack on Indian websites in April, probably launched from China.

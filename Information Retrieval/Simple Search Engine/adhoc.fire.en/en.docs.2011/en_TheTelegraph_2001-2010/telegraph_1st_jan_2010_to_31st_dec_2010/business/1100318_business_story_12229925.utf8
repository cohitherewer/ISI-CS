	Calcutta, March 17: Xerox Corporation today opened a research laboratory in Chennai, which will work with local universities to develop document-management services for the emerging markets. The Chennai centre is Xeroxs first in an emerging market.         
	Connecticut-based Xerox also has two research centres in the US and one each in Canada and France.        
	Creating a research facility in India allows us to make use of local knowledge and to extend that expertise to our global initiatives, Sophie Vandebroek, chief technology officer and president of Xerox Innovation Group, said.        
	The initiative is expected to give the worlds largest maker of high-speed colour printers a larger base in India. The company is eyeing a bigger market share in the next few years. Xerox garners nearly 50 per cent of its revenue from the US.        
	The India Innovation Hub in Chennai will enable Xerox to forge closer ties with Indias top technical and business schools.        
	Linking the talent in India with Xeroxs 500 scientists at our centres in the US, Canada and France will allow us to leverage the power of global innovation networks and engage in cutting-edge research to create a unique value for our customers around the world, said Meera Sampath, director of Xerox India Innovation Hub.        
	Xerox bought Affiliated Computer Services Inc for $6 billion last month to increase its services business.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Industry backs Obama stand
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Industry backs Obama stand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          US commerce secretary Gary Locke shakes hands with M amp;M vice-chairman and MD Anand Mahindra while Ajay Piramal, head of Piramal Enterprises, looks on in Mumbai on Saturday. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 6: India Inc was happy to play along with President Barack Obama sidestepping the outsourcing issue, a potential hot potato between the two democracies, and instead focus on the big picture: improve trade relations between US and India.         
	Its not all about outsourcing. What the President was saying is that there is a new model of doing business between India and the US and this doesnt revolve around bringing cutting-edge technology to India. This new model looks at how US products and services fit the bill in the Indian economy that is growing at a rapid rate, said Ajay Piramal of Piramal Enterprises.         
	Piramal was among one of the select few Indian businessmen and young entrepreneurs who spent an hour with President Obama. For instance, I spoke to him about how we are taking drinking water to rural India at just 25 paise a litre and were doing that with American technology, he added.        
	Similarly, Rashmi Barbhaiya (CEO of Advinus Therapeutics) and I spoke about partnerships in drug discovery while Anand Mahindra spoke with the President on the Reva electric car and its positive impact in an economy like India, said Piramal.        
	Obama was obviously gung-ho over these collaborations: he mentioned all three projects in his address to the CEOs of Indian and US corporations later in the evening.        
	A majority of the CEOs from corporate India who assembled at the Trident on Saturday afternoon were equally enthused by the Presidents address to the countrys business community. Rajan Bharti Mittal, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, described the Presidents address as a very pragmatic speech.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph after Obamas speech, N. Chandrasekaran, CEO and managing director at TCS, Indias largest exporter of software services, said, President Obamas address was positive as it focused on the significant opportunities that existed in both the countries and the fact that both countries can contribute to each others growth.        
	M amp;Ms Arun Nanda echoed a similar sentiment. The US President adopted a balanced approach in his speech, he said.         
	It was a very positive speech. He was very focused on the opportunities for trade that exist between the two countries. While he was very upfront about the outsourcing issue, he wanted to move on to the scope in other sectors, said Swati Piramal, a director of Piramal Heathcare.

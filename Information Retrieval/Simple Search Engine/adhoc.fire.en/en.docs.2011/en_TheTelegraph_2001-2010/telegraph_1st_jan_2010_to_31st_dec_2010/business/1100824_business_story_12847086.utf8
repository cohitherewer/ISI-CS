	Calcutta, Aug. 23: Tata Global Beverages, formerly Tata Tea, seems to have reworked its growth projection.         
	CEO Peter Unsworth today said the company would become a $5-billion entity by 2015 from $1.5 billion at present.         
	Unsworth was speaking to shareholders at the companys annual general meeting (AGM) here today.        
	At the AGM last year, vice-chairman R.K. Krishna Kumar had said Tata Tea was in the process of creating an enterprise with a turnover of $10 billion, which was 10 times the current revenue, in five years.        
	The management today did not give any explanation why the projections had been reworked.        
	However, the new forecast looks stunning. Krishna Kumar said the growth would come from the firms own as well as acquired brands, product development and acquisition.        
	Earlier, Ratan Tata outlined the road map of the company. This company will now emerge as a global player in a very worthwhile segment of the market with new products, new technologies and aggressive new markets in India and abroad.        
	He said Tata Global, which was so far engaged in tea, non-tea non-carbonated beverages and mineral water, planned to foray into food and fortified health drinks.        
	The company is looking to explore a joint venture with PepsiCo for the global distribution of its products, excluding tea. Pepsis distribution will help the reach of Himalayan (mineral water) products and the losses will be turned into profits, whenever we start (joint) operations, Tata said. Plans are afoot to build operational scales in the US and Russia.        
	There was a hint of Tata Sons raising stake in the company. The only avenue available was creeping acquisition of five per cent each year. We are keen to raise stakes in key companies, he said.

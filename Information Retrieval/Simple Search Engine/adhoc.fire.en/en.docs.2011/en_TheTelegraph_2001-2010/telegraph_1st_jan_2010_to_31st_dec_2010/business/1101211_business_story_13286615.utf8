The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ramsarup proposal to recast debt
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ramsarup proposal to recast debt
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Jhunjhunwala: Hopeful                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 10: Financial institutions have agreed to consider the case of debt-laden Ramsarup Industries under a corporate debt restructuring (CDR) mechanism, giving the steel maker an opportunity to stay afloat.        
	The city-based company has Rs 1,800-crore loan on its balance sheet putting a strain on its financials and constraining the promoters ability to upgrade from a pure commodity player to a value-added steel product manufacturer.        
	Chairman and managing director Ashish Jhunjhunwala said the company was seeking an interest waiver from the financial institutions for the next 18-24 months.        
	We are not asking for any haircut (reduction of principal amount) or lowering down the interest rate. All the company needs is time to stabilise the business before starting to pay both interest and principal to lenders, he said.        
	The CDR proposal will include the addition of Rs 700 crore by way of fresh debt and equity to finance expansion and upgradation, and to meet working capital needs.        
	Ramsarup will submit a detailed plan before the CDR panel within six to eight weeks seeking the approval of the lenders. Cash infusion and debt restructuring are likely to be completed by the end of this fiscal.        
	The company had taken a resolution for a rights issue to raise capital. Jhunjhunwala said equity would be raised through rights and from private equity investors.        
	He said he was seeking a loan of Rs 350 crore and a similar amount via equity to set up new facilities.        
	Ramsarup is building a sinter plant to replace expensive ore lumps with iron ore fines in steelmaking, leading to a lower use of coking coal and saving of cost. Ramsarup will put up a steel melting shop to produce special grade billets (a semi- finished steel), alloy steel and high carbon steel.         
	The company also plans to improve and increase the production of wires at its Kalyani and Durgapur facilities.        
	Jhunjhunwala said the firm would earn a revenue of Rs 4,000 crore when the projects were completed and an EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin of 15 per cent.        
	Promoters stake         
	The CDR proposal comes at a time the promoters stake in the company has come down to 49.42 per cent from 75.06 per cent during the second quarter of this fiscal.         
	The steep decline can be attributed to either the sale or revocation of pledged shares. IDBI had picked up around 10 per cent when the promoters failed to pay up.

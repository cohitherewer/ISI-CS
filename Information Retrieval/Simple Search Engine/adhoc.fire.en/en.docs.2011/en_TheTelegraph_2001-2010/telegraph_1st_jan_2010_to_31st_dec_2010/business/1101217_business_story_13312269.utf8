          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with R.S. Sharma in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: The board of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) today approved a bonus share issue and a stock split, ahead of its follow-on public offer (FPO) in March.        
	The state-run explorer will also pay a special dividend of Rs 32 on each share with a face value of Rs 10, which will be split into two.         
	The special dividend will fetch the government Rs 5,074 crore, ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said. Total dividend payout will be Rs 6,844 crore, of which Rs 5,074 crore will go to the government, which holds 74.11 per cent in the company, Sharma said.         
	Besides, ONGC will also pay Rs 1,163 crore in dividend tax to the government.        
	Even after paying Rs 8,007 crore in special dividend and associated tax, the PSU will be left with a healthy Rs 7,000-crore reserve, officials said.         
	ONGC shares, valued at about $63 billion, closed at Rs 1,329.10, up 0.55 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.         
	Sharma said the book-running lead managers for the FPO are likely to be appointed by the first week of January. The five independent directors, needed to meet market regulator Sebis listing requirement, will be in place before January-end when the draft prospectus for the offer will be filed.        
	The Centre has approved a 5 per cent stake sale in ONGC that is expected to raise more than $3 billion. Sharma said the firm was likely to come out with the FPO in the first week of March.         
	After divestment, the governments holding in ONGC will come down to 69.14 per cent from 74.14 per cent.        
	Sharma said ONGC would get its oil and gas reserves certified by international auditors  DeGolyer amp; MacNaughton and Gaffney, Cline amp; Associates  within a month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ONGC reveals Cairn card
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ONGC reveals Cairn card
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          R.S. Sharma: Strategy time                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: State-owned ONGC Ltd will not make a counter offer to Vedanta Resources bid for a majority stake in Cairn India but can use its right of first refusal to protect its interests.        
	The counter-offer date is gone and we did not make an offer. We made a conscious decision based on legal and commercial considerations. ONGCs interests will be protected, chairman and managing director R. S. Sharma said.        
	We have done a very thorough evaluation. We have done whatever should have been done to protect ONGCs interests.        
	LSE-listed Vedanta Resources will buy a 51-60 per cent stake in Cairn India from its parent Cairn Energy of the UK for $8.5-$9.6 billion. Cairn Indias Rajasthan blocks are Indias largest onland oilfields. As part of of the deal, Vedanta will acquire 20 per cent from the minority shareholders of Cairn India through its subsidiary Sesa Goa.        
	The open offer, which is set to open on October 11, awaits Sebis approval.        
	ONGC, which is a 30 per cent partner with Cairn India in the Rajasthan oilfield, had claimed that it had pre-emption right, or the right of first refusal, on Cairn Indias assets.        
	On whether ONGC had waived the pre-emption right, Sharma said, I didnt say that. All I have said is that we did not make a rival offer by the deadline (on September 7).         
	The oil ministry has also said any change in ownership of the blocks would need the governments consent under the production-sharing contracts.        
	Shale gas venture        
	ONGC has ventured into shale gas exploration by starting to drill the first well at Ichapur village near Durgapur in Bengals Burdwan district. ONGC has awarded the drilling contract to oilfield services provider Schlumberger, and the potential of the well is expected to be known by October.        
	In March this year, the ONGC board approved a Rs 128-crore pilot project for the exploration of shale gas in the Damodar basin. The PSU plans to drill three more wells in the Damodar valley by the end of the Eleventh Five Year Plan in March 2012.

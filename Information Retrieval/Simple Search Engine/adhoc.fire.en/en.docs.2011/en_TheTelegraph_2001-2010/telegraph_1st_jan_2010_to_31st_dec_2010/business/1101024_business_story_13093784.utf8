The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | India moves up IMF quota ladder
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      India moves up IMF quota ladder
                              Pranab: Bringing change                            
	Gyeongju (South Korea), Oct. 23 (PTI): India will improve its rank by three notches to the eighth position in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the group of 20 nations (G20) today decided to increase the quota of emerging markets in the multi-lateral lending agency by over 6 per cent.        
	An agreement on IMF reforms has been reached. There will be a shift in quota shares to dynamic EMDCs (emerging market developing countries) and to under-represented countries of over 6 per cent while protecting the voting share of the poorest, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said here.        
	With this, Indias rank in the IMF will improve to the eighth position from the current 11th in terms of quota, he told reporters after a meeting of finance ministers of G20 nations.        
	What we have achieved is significant. The quota share (of India in IMF) will improve to about 2.75 per cent (from the present level of 2.44 per cent), Mukherjee said.        
	Similarly, China will see an improvement in its ranking to the third position from the present sixth.        
	Quota represents the relative position of members of IMF. It is based on various parameters such as a countrys GDP, openness, forex reserves etc.        
	The finance minister said the quota reforms will give legitimacy to the IMF in the new world economic order.        
	India and other emerging market economies have been demanding reforms in IMF to give more powers to them in line with their share in the global economy.        
	Emerging market economies contribute around 47.5 per cent to the global economy in terms of purchasing power parity, but have only 39.5 per cent share in the IMF.        
	Their share will now increase to over 45.5 per cent in the 187-nation body IMF. Also, Europe will give up two of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the IMFs executive board, which will continue to have 24 members according to the agreement.        
	Now the next phase of reforms will start in 2013.         
	Curbs on volatility        
	The developed world today vowed to reduce excessive volatility in capital inflows to emerging markets, the risk of which may be looming large on countries such as India.        
	In a joint statement issued by the G20 nations, the developed world sought to mitigate this risk by being vigilant against disorderly movement in exchange rates and by refraining from competitive devaluation of currencies.        
	The statement, issued after a meeting of finance ministers of the G20 nations, also said the member countries would resist all forms of protectionist moves.        
	The move assumes importance amid growing demand for protectionism in countries such as the US.        
	Advanced economies, including those with reserve currencies, will be vigilant against excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates. These actions will help mitigate the risk of excessive volatility in capital inflows facing some emerging countries, the statement said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | China for give- amp;-take policy
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      China for give- amp;-take policy
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Wen Jiabao with commerce minister Anand Sharma in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Beijing is willing to open up its market for Indian infotech and pharmaceutical firms provided Delhi eases rules for investments and movements of Chinese workers and gives better access to Chinese power and other project exports and to its manufactures.        
	China and India are partners for co-operation, not rivals in competition, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told a gathering of Indian and Chinese CEOs at the start of a two-day visit to India after a gap of five years.         
	India and China have been locked in competition for mineral and oil resources globally as also for commercial influence in Africa, South East Asia, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka.         
	Analysts see this visit as one that will focus on trade and investment. Wen said: The two nations are the largest recipients of FDI, yet investment flows between the two countries have been a low $700 million.         
	He promised to address Indias concerns of a growing trade imbalance, which is likely to be $19 billion this year.         
	China has emerged as Indias largest trade partner with two-way trade standing at $60 billion, but while India exports mostly raw materials, China sells manufactures and power equipment.        
	However, India has been wary of Chinese investment plans in strategic sectors such as telecom, ports and power projects, fearing security risks, while it views much of the cheap import of consumer durables and electronics as an attempt to undersell Indian manufacturers by offering ridiculously low prices. Yet both want to ease trade rules and have completed a study to set up a regional trade agreement for East Asia.         
	Analysts say the two Asian giants want to concentrate on trade and put on the backburner contentious border and ethnic issues.         
	China takes seriously the imbalance in trade and is willing to take steps to promote IT and bio-technology exports from India, Wen said.         
	However, Indian industry feels the offer is flawed. Said Nuclear Software CEO Vishnu R. Dusad, We should take what Wen is saying with a pinch of salt  their protection of intellectual property rights is extremely poor  our entry may simply strengthen Chinese software firms who will be able to access our research and development.         
	Indian attempts to sell manufactures have often come up against a wall of non-tariff barriers, says business association Ficci in a study.         
	However, Wen made it clear what China expected from India in return. It is necessary to ease entry and exit norms for investment and for movement of people.         
	Indian officials said the country was open to easing investment rules as we cannot keep saying no to our biggest trade partner on every issue ... while keeping our own interests in mind.

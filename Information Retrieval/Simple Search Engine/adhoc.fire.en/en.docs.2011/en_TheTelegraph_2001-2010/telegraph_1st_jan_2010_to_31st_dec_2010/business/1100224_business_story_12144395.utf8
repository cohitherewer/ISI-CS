          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: The cabinet secretariat has directed the department of telecom to provide a progress report on the third-generation (3G) spectrum auction process.        
	The move comes a day after telecom minister A. Raja said notice inviting applications would be sent to the bidders by the end of this week.        
	The letter sent by the cabinet secretariat to telecom secretary P.J. Thomas states that fortnightly progress report may be sent for the perusal of the cabinet secretary. If there is any slippage in the achievement of the target, efforts would be made to make up for the loss of time to ensure completion of the work in a stipulated time.         
	Meanwhile, the telecom regulator today said there were 19.9 new mobile users in January which took the total number of subscribers to 545.05 million.

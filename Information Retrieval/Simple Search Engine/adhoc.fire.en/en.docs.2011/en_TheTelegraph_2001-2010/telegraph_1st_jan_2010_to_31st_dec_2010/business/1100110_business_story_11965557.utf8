	Mumbai, Jan. 9 (PTI): Air India today decided to go for bridge financing of its aircraft deliveries this year but deferred plans to redeploy its manpower and appoint a global consultancy firm to work on its commercial transformation project.        
	The decisions were taken at a board meeting of National Aviation Company of India Ltd (NACIL), which also reviewed a series of cost-cutting measures ahead of getting a Rs 800-crore equity infusion from the government, airline sources said.        
	The board, which met here, approved the managements proposal for bridge loans for aircraft deliveries this year, the sources said.         
	Bridge financing is a short-term loan extended to a borrower by a bank to meet its immediate funding requirements.        
	Air India is likely to take delivery of three Boeing 777 aircraft this year, valuing around Rs 700 crore. Full payments for planes ordered are expected to be made when they are delivered.        
	The board was supposed to take up the manpower redeployment issue in the airline. But this issue did not come up for discussion at all, the sources said.         
	The Air India management has been holding talks on this contentious issue as well as on salaries and allowances with the various unions for the past several weeks.        
	The national carrier, which suffered a loss of Rs 5,548 crore in 2008-09 compared with Rs 2,226.16 crore in 2007-08, is focusing on cutting costs by Rs 1,500 crore and increasing revenues by Rs 1,200 crore as part of its turnaround plan. It is also mulling slashing salaries of its over 30,500 employees, who are resisting any such move.        
	On the proposal to appoint global consultancy firm McKinsey to advise it on the commercial transformation project, the board asked the management to take more time and study the proposal comprehensively before taking a decision on its approval, the sources said.        
	The Air India management had sought a financial sanction of Rs 12.86 crore from the board for the commercial transformation project for which it wanted to appoint McKinsey as adviser.        
	The NACIL board also decided to extend the tenure of another consultancy firm Accenture by a year to smoothen the process of merger between the two erstwhile state-owned carriers, Air India and Indian Airlines, they said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Free flow                                  
	New Delhi, March 26: The finance ministry can now clear FDI proposals up to Rs 1,200 crore without waiting for the approval from the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA). This will accelerate the flow of foreign direct investment into the country.        
	According to the modified FDI rules notified by the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), the Foreign Investment Promotion Board will clear proposals worth up to Rs 1,200 crore. Earlier, FDI proposals above Rs 600 crore were referred to the CCEA.        
	Analysts said, This alone does not ensure success unless FDI norms are kept transparent, consistent and regulations benign to maintain an investment climate.         
	Controversies over Vodafones majority investment in Hutchison Essar and the ownership of foreign banks such as ICICI and HDFC highlight the need for transparency and control over regulations.         
	According to the DIPP press note, proposals of less than Rs 1,200 crore can be referred to the CCEA in special cases such as relating to national security.        
	Foreign investors also need not seek fresh approvals from the government or the FIPB for additional investment in sectors that have been transferred to the automatic route or where FDI caps have been removed.        
	Foreign companies will not be required to obtain no-objection certificates from domestic firms for a second time for raising investment in ongoing projects.        
	According to a 2005 directive, foreign companies needed NoC from their domestic partners for taking up activities in the same sector through joint venture or technical collaboration with other entities.

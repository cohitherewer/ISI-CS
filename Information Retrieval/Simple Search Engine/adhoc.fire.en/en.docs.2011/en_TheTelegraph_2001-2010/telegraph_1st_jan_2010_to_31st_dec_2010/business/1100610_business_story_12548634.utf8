          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, June 9: The three- day strike at Hyundais plant near Chennai was withdrawn today after a government-brokered peace deal saw the company and the union signing a second MoU.         
	Representatives of the management and the union arrived at a solution in the presence of Tamil Nadu labour minister T.M. Anbarasan, who said the management had accepted certain conditions.        
	Production had come to a halt when 250 workers squatted on the conveyor belt on Sunday night.         
	We only want discipline and to produce good quality cars. Since we have invested Rs 8,000 crore, and a similar amount has been invested by our vendors, we consider Chennai to be our home and also a jewel in Hyundais global network. We want this issue to be resolved so we can get back to producing cars here that numbered 600,000 last year, managing director H.W. Park said. A group of workers had struck work demanding the reinstatement of 67 sacked employees.

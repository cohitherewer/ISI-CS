          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Taking off                                  
	New Delhi, March 31: Jet Airways has awarded a $750-million engine maintenance contract to Singapores ST Aerospace.        
	The firm will provide maintenance service to the engines of Jets 67 Boeing 737s over the next 10 years. The Singapore firm will also start an engine shop in Mumbai.        
	Jet and its low-cost arm JetLite awarded the maintenance-by-the-hour contract for the CFM56-7B engines that power the aircraft, statements issued by the private carrier and the Singapore firm said.        
	Under the pact, signed in Singapore by Jet executive director Saroj Dutta and ST Aerospace president Tay Kok Khiang, an engine hospital shop will come up at Jet Airways hangar at Mumbai.         
	The engine shop will enable Jet and JetLite to service the engines.        
	We are confident that as a leading MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) service provider, ST Aerospace will be a reliable partner as we expand our operations, Jet CEO Nikos Kardassis said.        
	The Singapore firm said in a statement that work for both airlines would involve off-wing, on-wing and on-site support, as well as fleet technical and asset management support.         
	The agreement will provide high-quality maintenance, better technical reliability and longer on-wing life of the engines, it added.        
	Jet began its relationship with ST Aerospace in 1993 for component services for its B 737 Classic fleet, which later expanded to service support for engines.        
	Shares of the airline rose marginally by 0.43 per cent from its previous close to finish at Rs 480.05 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

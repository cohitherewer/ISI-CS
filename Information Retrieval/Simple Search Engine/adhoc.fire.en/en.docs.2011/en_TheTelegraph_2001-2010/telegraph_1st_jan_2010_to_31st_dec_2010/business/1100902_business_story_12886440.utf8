                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Analjit keen to exit
                          Analjit                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 1 (PTI): Analjit Singh, the chairman of Max India, today said he was talking to the Oberois to sell his 4 per cent stake in EIH.        
	I have been in the process of exiting EIH through a dialogue with Mr (PRS) Oberoi, Singh said in a statement.        
	Earlier this year, Singh had reduced his stake in EIH to 4 per cent from 7 per cent. Max Indias shares today closed at Rs 154.25 per share, a rise of 0.33 per cent, on the BSE. Experts say Singhs announcement does not seem to have any connection with the RIL-EIH deal.

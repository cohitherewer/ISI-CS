	Standalone revenues rose 88.7 per cent from Rs 4,758.62 crore in the year-ago quarter.        
	The companys operating margin came in at 12.8 per cent. Volume recovery and marginal price hikes have helped Tata Motors to maintain double-digit margins, the company said in a statement.        
	Vehicle sales in the quarter stood at 165,413 units  a 67.5 per cent jump over the year-ago quarter.        
	Car and utility vehicle sales rose almost 46 per cent year-on-year to 61,593 units. The company claimed a market share of 11.8 per cent in passenger vehicles.        
	Commercial vehicle sales increased 88.8 per cent to 93,520 units, giving it a market share of 64.3 per cent.        
	The company said it had ramped up production of the Nano at its plant in Uttarakhand. Till December 31, it had delivered 17,537 Nanos.        
	In the nine months ended December 31, the company had clocked revenues of Rs 23,363.35 crore, a growth of 24.5 per cent over Rs 18,765.91 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	Profit after tax during the nine-month period amounted to Rs 1,643.04 crore, a growth of 300.9 per cent over Rs 409.84 crore in the corresponding period last year.

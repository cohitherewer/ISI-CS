          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 1: Gee Pee Infotech Pvt Ltd, the city-based mobile handset maker, is scouting for private equity (PE) investors to raise a little over Rs 100 crore to partially fund its plans of setting up an assembling unit in the state.        
	We are looking for a PE investor to offload up to 20 per cent stake in the company. We also have plans to list Gee Pee Infotech on domestic bourses in 2012, managing director Bijay Agarwal said here today.         
	The company is yet to appoint any consultant for the valuations.        
	Gee Pee, which hopes to close 2009-10 with a revenue of Rs 300 crore, is planning to set up a semi knocked-down assembly unit in the state at an estimated investment of Rs 300 crore spread over about 150 acres.         
	We hope to start the project this year, the managing director said.         
	Gee Pee already had talks with the state government for a suitable location.         
	It is learnt that the government is willing to offer land at Raghunathpur in Purulia, where the state wants to develop a telecom park spread over 1,000 acres.        
	We have also expressed our interest to develop the infrastructure for the proposed telecom park in Purulia, Agarwal said.         
	Gee Pee, which hopes to achieve a revenue of Rs 1,000 crore during 2010-11, plans to expand its retail business.        
	We will open about 250 retail stores nationwide under the name of Mobile Bazar this year. We have started the retail venture two years back on a smaller scale and now we intend to expand our network, he said.        
	Gee Pee also plans to launch a GSM colour handset at Rs 500 by the end of this month.        
	This will be an aam admi phone. We are targeting the rural mass. There are people in rural India who aspire to have a mobile phone but cannot afford even Rs 1,000, Agarwal said.

	New Delhi, March 25: The government today approved a project to connect 1,500 educational institutes across the country through high-speed data communication network.        
	A meeting of the cabinet committee on infrastructure, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, today approved the establishment of the national knowledge network (NKN) at an outlay of Rs 5,990 crore to be implemented by the National Informatics Centre over a period of 10 years, an official spokesperson said.        
	The NKN will have about 25 core points of presence (PoPs) and 600 secondary PoPs. It will connect around 1,500 institutions, the official said, adding that the setting up of the core network was expected to be completed in 24 months.         
	On January 21, the cabinet committee on infrastructure had given its in-principle approval to the project  a recommendation of the National Knowledge Commission.        
	The network is expected to encourage the sharing of knowledge, specialised resources and collaborative research. The NKN was announced by former finance minister P. Chidambaram in his budget speech of 2008-09.         
	Initially, Rs 100 crore was allocated to the department of information technology and the ministry of communications and IT for establishing the network.        
	The architecture of the NKN will be scalable and the network will consist of an ultra-high speed core in multiples of 10 GBPS and above.         
	The core shall be complemented with a distribution layer at appropriate speeds. The participating institutions can connect to the NKN at a speed of 1 GBPS or to the distribution layer through a last mile connectivity bandwidth, the spokesperson said.        
	The NKN will provide a nationwide high speed data-network highway. Various other networks in the country can take advantage of this high-speed backbone, with national and international reach to create independent and closed user groups, the offical said.        
	NKN is expected to enable scientists, researchers and students from diverse spheres to work together in critical and emerging areas.

	New Delhi, March 23: The country needs to double its spending in infrastructure to $1 trillion over the next few years and as part of a strategy to shovel more funds into the sector, the government plans to allow private entities to issue long-term infrastructure bonds carrying tax benefits.        
	Preliminary exercises suggest that investment in infrastructure will have to expand to $1 trillion in the 12th Plan period, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said at an infrastructure conference. I urge the finance ministry and the Planning Commission to draw up a plan of action for achieving this level of investment, he said. He said the spending on roads, ports, power and other infrastructure between 2012 and 2017 would help accelerate economic growth to 10 per cent and cut poverty.         
	It looks ambitious but is not impossible. For eliminating poverty and providing productive employment, we must aim at accelerating the pace of economic growth, he said.        
	The government has estimated that the country needs $514 billion for infrastructure in the five years to 2011-12, the year when the economy is expected to grow 9 per cent. The bulk of this investment is expected from private sources. Singh said a growth rate of 10 per cent would hinge on continual improvement in our policy regime and our implementation procedures.         
	Our experience shows that private participation in infrastructure development is indeed a feasible proposition and can help expand infrastructure much faster than it would have by relying only on public resources, he said.

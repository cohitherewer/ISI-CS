                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SAIL tender for pellet unit
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          S. K. Roongta in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 28: Steel Authority of India Ltd plans to set up a 4-million-tonne (mt) pellet plant at Gua in Jharkhand to use its huge reserves of iron ore fines in the region.        
	The plant, for which it issued a tender today, can cost up to Rs 1,000 crore and will be part of the Rs 12,500-crore capital expenditure approved by the companys board for 2010-2011.         
	Pelletisation plants use fines or iron ore wastes to make pellets with high ferrous content that can be used by steel makers. SAIL owns 35 million tonnes of iron ore fines at Gua, its oldest mine, valued at nearly $700 million.         
	Chairman S.K. Roongta said the company was setting up a 14mt mining facility at Rowghat in Chhattisgarh. The mine has estimated reserves of 500mt iron ore that will be sufficient to feed the Bhilai Steel Plant for 30 years.        
	The steel maker today announced a 6 per cent decline in net turnover for 2009-2010 at Rs 40,551 crore mainly on account of lower prices. Profit before tax went up 8 per cent to Rs 10,132 crore during the year.                                            
	The dump is valued at nearly $700 million in the international market.               
	The company board has recommended a final dividend payment to company shareholders at 17 per cent of paid-up equity, with total dividend payout (including interim dividend of 16 per cent) for the year 2009-10 at 33 per cent amounting to Rs. 1,363 crore.              
	Officials said the pelletisation unit was part of its strategy to increase the iron ore availability to over 45 million tonnes by 2012 from 23 million tonnes at present.                          
	Officials said mining had to be doubled for its Rs 70,000-crore expansion plan.         
	The development of the poor tribal districts of Jharkhand and Chattisgarh is part of the central governments strategy of creating jobs in these areas.         
	A large chunk of this years capital expenditure plans, for which SAIL may borrow upto Rs 6000 crore, will be spent on mine development.         
	The steelmakers mines division also plans to increase mining at Kiriburu, Meghahatuburu, Bolani, Barsua, Gua, and Kalta to 5.50, 6.50, 10.00, 4.50, 10.00, and 2.00 million tonne respectively, to take ore mining to 38.50 mt by 2012-2013.         
	At the same time it wants to increase output from its Chiria mines to 15 mt in two phases and has appointed Hatch Consultancy of Australia for development of the Chiria mines. SAIL earlier had to legally fight the state governments bid to take away part of the Chiria mines, considered to be Asias largest and richest iron ore deposit, to give away to other private steelmakers.        
	Though a final outcome is still awaited, SAIL has decided to go ahead with plans to develop the mines and eventually build a greenfield steel mill nearby which would be fed from Chiria mines.               
	SAIL said it did its best in the fourth quarter on the back of better prices. In January-March of 2009-2010 it posted a profit after tax of Rs. 2,085 crore, a year-on-year increase of 40 per cent. The company posted a net sales turnover of Rs. 11,955 crore during the same quarter, against Rs. 11,790 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	The SAIL Board consequently has recommended final dividend payment to company shareholders at 17 per cent of paid-up equity, with total dividend payout (including interim dividend of 16 per cent) for the year 2009-10 at 33 per cent amounting to Rs. 1,363 crore.

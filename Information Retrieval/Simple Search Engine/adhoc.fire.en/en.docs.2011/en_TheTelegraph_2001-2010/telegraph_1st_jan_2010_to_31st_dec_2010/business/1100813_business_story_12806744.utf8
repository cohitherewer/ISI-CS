          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 12: Metals and mining magnate Anil Agarwal is looking to snap up a stake in Cairn India  the oil and gas entity credited with Indias biggest onshore discovery in the past 20 years.        
	Agarwal-owned Vedanta Resources, the holding company of Indias largest diversified mining group, confirmed today that it had started talks with Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy Plc to buy a stake in its Indian subsidiary.        
	Cairn Energy has a 63.26 per cent stake in Cairn India.        
	The board of Cairn Energy confirms that discussions are taking place with Vedanta Resources Plc in respect of the disposal of an interest in Cairn India Ltd. Cairn emphasises that there can be no certainty the contemplated disposal will occur or as to the terms of any such disposal, the company said in a statement today.        
	If the deal goes through, it will be the second big acquisition by the 57-year-old Agarwal in the last couple of years. In 2007, Vedanta bought a 71 per cent stake in Sesa Goa, the countrys largest iron ore exporter, for $1.37 billion.        
	Cairn India has a working interest in 10 blocks in India and one block in Sri Lanka. The company is present in Rajasthan where it operates an onshore block. The main development area, which includes Mangala, Aishwariya, Raageshwari and Saraswati fields, is shared between Cairn India and ONGC.         
	Cairn India began production from the Mangala oilfield last August. It is expected that production from the Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya fields will gradually ramp up to a plateau of at least 175,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd).        
	The key question is whether Agarwal will buy out Cairn Energys entire stake in Cairn India or not. Analysts are divided on this aspect. One group feels Agarwal will look to acquire a substantial stake from Cairn and later make an open offer. However, there are others who reckon that Vedanta may settle for a small stake since it has ambitious plans in other areas.        
	At current market prices, Vedanta will have to shell out nearly Rs 6,000 crore to acquire a 14 per cent stake in Cairn India.        
	The Cairn India stock leapt 2.41 per cent to close at Rs 340.60 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.        
	On the London Stock Exchange, the Cairn Energy stock jumped 1.73 per cent to 452.50 pence in afternoon trade.         
	Earlier in the day, it had touched a high of 462.80 pence.         
	Vedanta Resources, however, fell 4.79 per cent, or 113 pence, to 2,244 pence on the London bourse.        
	Kuala Lumpur-based Petronas International Corporation Ltd holds just under 15 per cent in Cairn India. It remains to be seen whether it will also look to raise its stake in the entity.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai May 12: India has no plans to check foreign capital inflows by slapping a Tobin tax on them, RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao said. Named after Nobel laureate James Tobin, the Tobin tax is a transaction tax on currency conversions.        
	As regards a Tobin type tax, we have so far not imposed nor are we contemplating one. However, it needs reiterating that no policy instrument is clearly off the table and our choice of instruments will be determined by the context, Subbarao said at an IMF-organised conference in Zurich yesterday. He said the RBI preferred long-term capital flows to short-term flows, and a gradual path would be taken towards capital account convertibility.        
	According to the RBI governor, India has followed a consistent policy on allowing capital inflows in general and on capital account management in particular. Our position is that capital account convertibility is not a stand-alone objective but a means for higher and stable growth.         
	We believe our economy should traverse towards capital convertibility along a gradual path  the path itself being recalibrated on a dynamic basis in response to domestic and global developments. We will continue to move towards liberalising our capital account, but we will revisit the road map to reflect the lessons of the crisis, he said.

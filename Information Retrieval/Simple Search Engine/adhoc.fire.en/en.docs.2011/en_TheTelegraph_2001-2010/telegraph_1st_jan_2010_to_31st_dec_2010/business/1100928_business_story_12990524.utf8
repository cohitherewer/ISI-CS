          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 27: The government has imposed an anti-dumping duty on a chemical from China used in household cleaning products.        
	After complaints by firms such as Tata Chemicals, the government has slapped a duty of up to $0.671 per kg on the import of sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP).        
	The duty shall be effective up to and inclusive of March 20, 2011, and shall be payable in Indian currency, a notification by the department of revenue said.         
	Tata Chemicals produces STPP at its Haldia plant  the company accounts for over 90 per cent of domestic production.        
	The directorate-general of anti-dumping and allied duties, a nodal agency under the commerce ministry, had recommended the levy after it found cheap imports from China affecting the domestic industry.        
	Imports increased to 41,367 tonnes in 2008-09 from a mere 15,356 tonnes in 2005-06.        
	Local firms manufacturing the chemical were earning profits till 2005-06 but started suffering losses from 2007-08 .        
	The government levies anti-dumping duties to check the import of items at lower prices than those prevailing in the domestic market.         
	Unlike safeguard duties, which are levied uniformly, anti-dumping duties vary from product-to-product and country-to-country.

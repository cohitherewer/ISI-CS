          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        D. Subbarao      
	Mumbai, Aug. 5: Reserve Bank of India governor Duvvuri Subbarao today said inflation targeting could not be the prime objective of the central bank, which must strive to strike a balance between growth, financial stability and price stability.        
	Inflation targeting is neither desirable nor practical in India, Subbarao said while delivering the 10th C.D. Deshmukh Memorial Lecture in Hyderabad today. If inflation is way off target, a central banks first call is to bring it within acceptable range. If it is within the range, the bank should focus on other objectives.        
	His comments come just days after the RBI raised benchmark interest rate such as the repo and the reverse repo by 25 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively, to tamp down on inflation, which is running at 10.55 per cent.                          
	 Inflation has been in double digits since February.              
	Subbarao had said that since growth in the Indian economy had taken a firm hold, the monetary policy stance has to shift decisively to containing inflation and anchoring inflationary expectations.              
	Subbarao said there was a strong view that the domestic economy would be better served if the central bank became a pure inflation targeter.              
	He said that in an emerging economy like India, it is not practical for the central bank to focus exclusively on inflation, oblivious of the larger development context. While the central bank must balance between growth, price stability and financial stability, he pointed out that the drivers of inflation in India emanate from the supply side, thereby diluting the monetary policys effectiveness as an inflation targeter.               
	A necessary condition for inflation targeting to work is effective monetary transmission. Our monetary transmission mechanism is improving but is yet to reach robust standards, he added.              
	The answer to the old question, should central banks be pure inflation targeters, has shifted from an increasingly confident yes to an increasingly qualified yes, he added.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Graft triggers loan quality alert
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today asked banks, financial institutions and insurance firms to study their loan exposure to bribery-linked firms and to improve safeguards against frauds.         
	The CBI yesterday arrested eight senior officers of some state-run banks and financial institutions, including the LIC, the Bank of India, the Central Bank of India and PNB, on charges of accepting bribes to grant loans to real estate developers.        
	At a review meeting with the officers of the department of financial services on the situation arising out of the CBI case, Mukherjee said banks and financial institutions should strictly monitor and manage their non-performing assets to ensure that advance action was taken to identify incipient sickness and take appropriate action.         
	They (banks) should ensure that all procedures and due diligence consistent with guidelines have been adhered to while approving the loans by the competent authority, said the finance minister.        
	Mukherjee added that while the CBI would take action according to its mandate, banks and financial institutions should be instructed to also take action against these individuals.        
	The income tax department will look into any tax angle involved in the matter (housing graft), said an official of the Central Board of Direct Taxes.        
	However, top policy makers and bankers said the scam was the result of a few individuals going astray rather than a collective failure of the regulatory mechanism.        
	They do not expect the scam to impact the issue of loans to the real estate sector.         
	The department of financial services said the racket was an isolated instance of alleged gratification.        
	According to information available with them, the asset quality in these cases have not been impaired, a finance ministry statement said today.        
	I do not think we should make too much of a particular incident, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia told reporters.         
	Banking secretary R. Gopalan held a similar view and said the amount involved in these graft cases was insignificant, looking at the financial sector as a whole. Its a case of individual greed and not a systemic failure.         
	The State Bank of India, the countrys largest lender, sees no impact of the scandal on its loans to the real estate sector.         
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt today said there was no need to review the lending regulatory norms as of now.         
	State-run Punjab National Bank sanctions all its loans according to the policies of the bank, chairman K.R. Kamath said.         
	Meanwhile, the CBI is reported to have asked several companies suspected to be involved in the loan scam to submit documents.         
	The companies include Lavasa Corporation, DB Realty, Suzlon Energy, BGR Energy, and OPG Power. However, this could not be independently verified.        
	Sources close to Lavasa confirmed that it had submitted the necessary documents to the investigative agency. Lavasa maintained that Money Matters Financial Services Ltd was associated with it through a fee-based arrangement and had acted as an agent to sell its properties.        
	Similarly, Suzlon has said that it engaged Money Matters as a financial adviser to a loan raising exercise in 2009.

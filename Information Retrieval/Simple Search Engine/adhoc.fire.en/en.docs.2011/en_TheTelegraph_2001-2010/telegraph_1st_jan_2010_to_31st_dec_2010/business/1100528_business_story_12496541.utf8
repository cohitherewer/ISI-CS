	New Delhi, May 27: Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer today said India had the potential to emerge as the global hub for cloud computing services.        
	India will not only see a surge in consumption of cloud services that will drive growth in domestic IT use, but companies all over the world will also look to India to support their transition to cloud computing, Ballmer said.         
	According to global management consultant Zinnov, cloud services are estimated to create over three lakh jobs in India in the next five years.         
	Cloud computing allows users to access data and applications stored in one desktop from any remote computer in the world. Under this technology, all data is stored on the Internet and there are softwares to help one get information from anywhere.        
	According to analysts, though the Indian retail market is not yet mature for this technology, cloud computing will be suitable for small and medium enterprises as it will help to reduce their infrastructure costs.         
	In cloud computing, firms can share computer resources such as servers, software and data storage through the Internet instead of setting up separate infrastructure of their own.         
	In March, Microsoft unveiled a portfolio of services in India enabling companies to share their software and data storage. Companies have reported a 16-49 per cent cut in IT spend and related services over a three-year period after migrating to cloud computing, said analysts.        
	The software giant also plans to release a revamped operating system for mobile phones by year-end. The focus is on how to make the products more innovative, Ballmer told reporters here, adding that the Windows Phone 7 will be released by Christmas. Windows Phone 7 is a new version of Microsofts smartphone operating system.

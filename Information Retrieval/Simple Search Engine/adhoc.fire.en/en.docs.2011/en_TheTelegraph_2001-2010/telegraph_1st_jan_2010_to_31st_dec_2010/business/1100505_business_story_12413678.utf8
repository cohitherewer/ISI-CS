                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      World Bank blacklists Videocon for 3 years
          OUR BUREAU AGENCIES                      Dhoot: Tough time                          
	May 4: The World Bank has blacklisted Videocon Industries for three years ending January 11, 2013 on the grounds of indulging in fraud and corrupt practices in dealings relating to procurement, a claim hotly denied by company chairman Venugopal Dhoot. The ban is from January 11, 2010.        
	Videocon was sent a letter of reprimand subsequent to an administrative process permitting the company to respond to the allegations, the World Bank said in its latest update of companies blacklisted for doing business due to fraud and corruption charges.        
	The list of debarred entities from India include two Calcutta-based firms BR amp; Sons and Hemant Tibrewal, and three Delhi-based entities  Om Prakash Jindal, Upasana Jindal and SM Scientific Instruments Pvt Ltd.        
	Videocon today said it had moved a petition to revoke the ban. We approached the World Bank in February 2010 to revoke the ban ... after some hearings, we hope it will be done, Dhoot said.        
	I have never done a financial transaction with the World Bank. Neither have I supplied our products to them. The World Bank statement pertains to a tender floated in 2003 involving an amount of $50,000. We submitted a bid for this tender and they have said that a certificate submitted along with the bid is wrong. We do not agree with the World Banks contention, Dhoot said.        
	He said that given the size of the group, this was not a significant order and his firms would not do anything wrong for securing any supply order.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Food inflation rose to 15.46 per cent during the second week of this month as heavy rains and floods disrupted the supply of essential commodities.        
	A sharp rise in the prices of cereals, select vegetables and milk made food inflation rise 0.36 percentage points from 15.10 per cent during the week ended September 4.         
	Economists said they were hopeful that the price situation would ease as rains receded; by December-end food inflation could come down to a single digit. They said the demand-supply gap was because of improper disbursement and offtake.         
	There is very little doubt that food prices will come down. It will be visible by December when the harvest comes into the market, D.K. Joshi, chief economist with rating agency Crisil, said.        
	Food inflation remained in double digits for seven consecutive weeks after touching a 13-month low of 9.53 per cent in the week ended July 24.         
	Economists attributed the rise in inflation to the new price index, with the old one based on 1993-94 prices. The new base year of 2004-05 gives a better representation of the underlying food inflation in the economy, analysts said.        
	Last week, the RBI had raised repo rates by 0.25 percentage points to 6 per cent, and reverse repo rate by 0.50 percentage points to 5 per cent to tame inflation.

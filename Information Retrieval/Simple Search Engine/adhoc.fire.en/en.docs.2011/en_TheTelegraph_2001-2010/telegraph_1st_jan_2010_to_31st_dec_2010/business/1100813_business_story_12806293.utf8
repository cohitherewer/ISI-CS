          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Aug. 12: Tata Steel has posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,790.19 crore compared with a loss of Rs 2,238.53 crore in the corresponding period last year. However, the number fell below analysts estimates of a net profit of around Rs 2,000 crore.         
	Reflecting the recovery in the global markets, consolidated turnover rose 17 per cent to Rs 27,195 crore from Rs 23,292 crore in the first quarter of last year.         
	Tata Steel said deliveries rose 13 per cent to 6.05 million tonnes as capacity utilisation improved in Europe. The turnover at Tata Steel Europe, or Corus, rose 16 per cent to Rs 17,711 crore in the first quarter. The topline of Tata Steel India gained 17 per cent to Rs 6,551 crore, though it fell 11 per cent sequentially.         
	In April-June, the European operations continued to recover. Coruss year-on-year earning before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) clocked a $692-million turnaround, along with a significant improvement in revenue and capacity utilisation, said Kirby Adams, MD amp; CEO of Tata Steel Europe.         
	This was the result of higher selling prices and the delayed impact of recent raw material price hikes on profitability. European demand has improved in sectors such as automotive and aerospace, he said.        
	H.M. Nerurkar, managing director of Tata Steel, said the coming months were likely to see a strong performance from the companys Indian operations because of the growth in demand forecast and the availability of the full capacity of 6.8 million tonnes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Equity prop for Air India
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Equity prop for Air India
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: The government today approved an equity infusion of Rs 800 crore into Air India.        
	A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, presided over by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, approved the fresh equity for National Aviation Company of India, which runs the national carrier. The equity, to be released in two equal monthly instalments, would be calibrated with the achievement of cost-reduction milestones laid down by the group of ministers on Air India.        
	The company is struggling to address costly legacy assets, a weakening revenue stream and a high cost structure resulting in rising liabilities, the civil aviation ministry said.         
	The equity prop, which would spare the company from borrowing funds from the markets at expensive rates, would help to ease its cash-flow difficulties.         
	Under the terms of the cash lifeline, the airline will reduce its fleet to 105 aircraft from 146 by March 2011.         
	Air India has firmed up plans on phasing out for 22 planes. Some of these would be leased out or sold; the rest had been leased from others and would be given back.

	Bangalore, March 20 (PTI): The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) today said it would meet at the end of this month to decide on the action to be taken against the auditors involved in the Satyam fraud case.         
	We are going ahead. We have fixed one meeting on the 30th of this month. We will go ahead and proceed on the matter, ICAI president Amarjit Chopra said.         
	He said there was no delay on ICAIs part in initiating disciplinary proceedings against auditors Talluri Srinivas and Subramani Gopalakrishnan of Price Waterhouse, which was the statutory auditor of Satyam. The delay was on account of the absence of the auditors, who were behind bars for the last one year.         
	Chopra said a way of dealing with such auditors was to serve notice and proceed and the other was to wait for the completion of the judicial process. He (the auditor) has examined the financial statements with reference to books of accounts. These books of accounts have to be produced and explained. I think that person will be better placed to explain that, he said.

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, April 29: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) will continue to administer Ulips till the courts take a view on which regulator  the insurance market watchdog, or Sebi, the capital markets regulator  is best suited to monitor these offerings.        
	Top IRDA sources said this was the impression that the regulator got from the finance ministry, and it would continue to run the scheme in that spirit.        
	Contrary to their earlier stand of moving court jointly to settle the issue of control over Ulips, differences have surfaced between the two regulators on the legal recourse.        
	The IRDA said it wanted to seek a legal mandate jointly with Sebi, but the market regulator had reservations.        
	Sebi has written a letter to us that according to their legal counsel, the joint application was not valid in this (Ulip) case under section 90 of the Civil Procedure Code, IRDA chairman J. Harinarayan told PTI from Hyderabad.        
	According to sources, a renowned lawyer had suggested that the regulators file a case under section 90, as they were not adversaries fighting each other but only required a legal clarification over jurisdiction.        
	Under section 90 if any person agrees in writing to state a case for the opinion of the court, then the court shall try and determine the same in the manner prescribed.        
	When asked whether the IRDA would again approach the government, he said it could be one of the options.        
	Ulip  an insurance plan sold by life insurers, where the money collected from consumers can be invested in any proportion in the equity and debt markets  has become a bone of contention between the two financial regulators, with both claiming regulatory authority over the scheme.         
	The finance ministry had brokered peace between the two by asking them to maintain status quo and go to court to get a ruling on jurisdiction.        
	Meanwhile, Sebi wants all public interest petitions on Ulips to be clubbed into one. A PIL was filed before Bombay High Court seeking to overturn the Sebi ban on the sale of Ulips. The petition filed by a Mumbai-based investor made the IRDA a party to the petition.         
	The second PIL was filed in Allahabad High Court against the IRDA, which said insurers were guilty of promising high return on unit-linked insurance plans but were mis-selling the units and that the IRDA had not done enough to stop this.        
	The insurance regulator has issued a circular dated April 27, asking insurers to declare commissions or brokerage payable to agents while selling Ulips. This comes into effect from July 1. Sebi had earlier indicated that new Ulip policies issued after April 9 would be under its regulation.        
	Because we continue to regulate this sector we have issued this circular, which is in line with the finance ministers desire that better regulatory framework and transparency should be the norm in financial sectors, IRDA officials said.         
	Insurance companies have been accused of giving up to 40 per cent commission on the first years premium in the case of Ulips.

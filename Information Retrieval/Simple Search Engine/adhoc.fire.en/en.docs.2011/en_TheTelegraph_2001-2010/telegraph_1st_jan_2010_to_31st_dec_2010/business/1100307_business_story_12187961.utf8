	Mumbai, March 6: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the governments borrowing programme of Rs 4.57 lakh crore in 2010-11 would not crowd out the private sector even as the government would like the countrys growth trajectory to come back to 9 per cent as fast as possible.         
	Mukherjee was speaking to reporters after participating in the Platinum Jubilee celebrations of the Reserve Bank of India.         
	The Union finance minister also had a customary post-budget meeting with the central board of the RBI.        
	On the governments borrowing programme of Rs 4.57 lakh crore for the next fiscal, he said in the current year in cooperation with the Reserve Bank, the borrowing was done in such a manner that the private sector did not encounter any difficulty in meeting its credit requirements.         
	This year too, the RBI governor has assured that it will be worked out in such a manner that the private sectors are not elbowed out for their credit requirement, he said. He added that the current economic growth would not be sustainable without fiscal consolidation.

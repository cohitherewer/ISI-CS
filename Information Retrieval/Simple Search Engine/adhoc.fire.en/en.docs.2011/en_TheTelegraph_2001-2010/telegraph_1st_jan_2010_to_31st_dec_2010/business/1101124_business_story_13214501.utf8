The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Korea conflict hurts stocks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Korea conflict hurts stocks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Nov. 23: The sensex today slumped over 600 points reacting to the tension in Korea but recovered on short-covering to end with a loss of nearly 266 points at 19691.84.         
	The sharp fall in equity values came just a day after key heavyweights had led a 372-point rally on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	Analysts who had expected stocks to build on their gains, said equity movement was likely to be determined by overseas cues and the escalation of the Korean conflict might lead to a sharp reversal with foreign investors chasing safe havens.         
	Equity markets are likely to remain under pressure because of geo-political worries and the situation in Europe, an official from a mutual fund said.         
	The market, which is already apprehensive about the debt crisis spreading to other European countries, saw an intense selling pressure after news of North Korean troops firing at a South Korean island came in.         
	The benchmark index, which opened in the red at 19841.42 against the previous close of 19957.59, slumped to a low of 19342.69, a loss of nearly 615 points. It however, ended at 19691.84, a drop of 265.75 points, or 1.33 per cent.         
	The Nifty of the National Stock Exchange slumped 75.25 points to settle at 5934.75.         
	While all the sectoral indices on the BSE ended in the red, the fall was led by heavyweights, which included Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank and the State Bank of India. RIL lost 1.7 per cent, ICICI Bank, nearly 2 per cent and the SBI, 2.83 per cent. Realty stocks, too, bore the brunt of intense selling.         
	The metal index was also not spared, with copper producer Sterlite Industries plunging 2.11 per cent, aluminium giant Hindalco shedding 2.09 per cent, Tata Steel falling 1.79 per cent and Jindal Steel 1.39 per cent.         
	Of the 30 sensex components, only Maruti Suzuki and Hindustan Unilever emerged as gainers.

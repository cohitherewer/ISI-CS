The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt builds dual-tech use defence

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: The government is planning to rework the defence offset policy to facilitate the procurement of dual technology products from abroad as well as transfer of technology in these items. The US, the UK and France have been lobbying for changes in the offset clauses.         
	India is now considering giving credit for bringing dual technology products in areas such as civil aviation and for technology transfer to Indian joint ventures.        
	Defence offsets are arrangements between a national government and a foreign arms supplier to direct some benefits of the contract back into the purchasing country as a condition of sale.        
	At present, foreign firms selling weapons and aircraft have to compensate India by buying 30-100 per cent of the value of goods sold.         
	As part of the offset obligations, foreign entities are required to directly purchase components and services from state-run and private defence firms in India or invest in the domestic defence industry and defence research.         
	According to estimates, the total value of exports from India and technology flows into the country are set to be a massive Rs 50,000 crore over the next five years.         
	Besides high-profile pitches by American officials accompanying President Barack Obama and UK defence secretary Liam Fox, a joint letter from the British, German and French aerospace industries and the US-India Business Council has sought policy changes.        
	The letter raised quite a few hackles in the defence ministry as it was seen as an attempt to impose sellers terms.         
	However, with industry bodies such as the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) supporting the lobbying effort, the government is mulling changes in the offset clauses.        
	According to officials, countries elsewhere have adopted offset clauses to gain proprietary defence and dual-use technologies, which are difficult, time-consuming and costly to develop.         
	India, too, needs to use its huge purchasing power to gain access to high-end technologies which have dual use. Now that the US has also relaxed its rules for the transfer of dual-use technology, we should take advantage, the officials said.         
	The letter also sought a 74-100 per cent stake for foreign firms in Indian defence to help them to meet the offset requirements.         
	A relaxed foreign investment limit will allay the apprehensions of these countries that are reluctant to license their proprietary technology to a company in which their equity is restricted to a minority 26 per cent.         
	Indian companies engaged in defence such as the Tatas, the Mahindras and L amp;T are opposed to such a blanket relaxation and argued for a waiver in the FDI limit of up to 49 per cent with locals having majority control.         
	While Assocham sought an FDI cap at 49 per cent, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) is more conservative. According to Ficci, the 49 per cent FDI limit should be allowed as a special case where the joint venture brings in three things  genuine technology transfer that will benefit India, an indigenisation programme and offset for defence purchases.        
	Ficci believes that India will continue to attract defence investments irrespective of the FDI limit as India and China are the only two countries where spending on new defence platforms and systems will continue to grow in the post global economic crisis period.        
	The joint venture of BAE and Mahindra amp; Mahindra manufactures defence vehicles and guns, while the Tatas make helicopters in collaboration with Sikorsky. The other joint ventures in defence are between EADS and L amp;T, and between Lockheed Martin and the Tatas.               
	Many large industry groups, including Reliance, are eyeing the lucrative segment, given the governments plan to spend around $50 billion on the sector over the next five years.

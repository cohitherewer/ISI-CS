        With stock markets booming, Srikumar Bondyopadhyay offers tips on mutual fund pick                                            
	After the recent regulatory changes it looks like the mutual fund industry is gradually coming back to the right track it had long left behind.        
	Data available with Computer Age Management Services Ltd (CAMS)  a provider of transaction processing and customer care management services for mutual funds  show that since August 2009 retail investors have been increasingly opting for systematic investment plans (SIPs). The number of new SIP accounts being opened every month is at a historical high now. (See Table 1)            
	It is still early to say from the numbers that retail investors have finally realised that putting in a small amount of money regularly over a long period of time works better than one-time lumpsum investments.        
	However, one will surely agree (if you have not missed the advertisements) that fund houses have changed their selling strategies by focussing more on SIPs.        
	Mutual comfort        
	SIP implies a long-term commitment from investors. For the mutual fund industry, SIP means an assured flow of investments and lower portfolio churn, thus ensuring that fund managers get more leeway to generate better returns for investors.        
	For investors, SIP means better return through cost averaging than one-time investments (see Table 2), growing a habit of regular savings and better money management.                  TABLE 2      
	It may sound clich, but equities are the best option for wealth creation. But unless you are a professional, direct investment in equities may ruin your finances as equities are also fraught with risks.        
	Thats why the countrys first mutual fund was created in 1963 by introducing the Unit Trust of India Act in Parliament to provide a pass-through vehicle to the common man for investment in equities.        
	Today, there are 48 mutual funds. By the end of 1999, there were 70 equity schemes. Now, there are more than 350. So, here we have a problem of plenty. While there are different categories of equity funds, some are thematic and some exotic.         
	The right choice         
	Choosing a mutual fund is not an easy task. If you invest in a bad fund, you will be stumped. You dont have to go too much into the technical details while selecting a good fund. You cant choose a fund just because it has given the highest return last year for it may not be able to sustain those levels this year. This year it might be the turn of some other fund to give the highest return.         
	However, its not that difficult to separate the good apples from the bad ones. Good funds are those that have consistently given a good return over a long period of time.         
	If performance is the best measure of a fund, look at its vital statistics over a longer period of time, say five years or more. This will give you a clear picture of how the fund has performed during the good as well as troubled times.         
	When markets are bullish, investment decisions can hardly prove wrong. But the true test is to see how a fund withstands a turbulent market. A good fund is one that will give above average return consistently over long periods of time.        
	Things to check out         
	Now, once you have put your finger on a particular fund, see who the fund manager is and how he/she has managed the other funds over a period of time. The investment return of a fund, particularly in the case of an actively managed fund, largely depends on the stock selection and market judgement of the fund manager. A good fund manager always generates something extra than the market return by his/her investment skills.        
	The third important aspect is the volatility in the return. This largely depends on the portfolio of stocks. If a larger proportion of investment has been allocated to a fewer stocks, it means the portfolio is riskier. Similarly, if a portfolio has too many stocks, the return will be lower. A portfolio of 30 to 35 stocks with 2 to 5 per cent investment allocation in each is a judicial mix. Concentration of industrial sector in the stock portfolio is another source of risk.        
	Finally, check out the cost or the expense ratio of fund. If the expense ratio of a fund is higher, it means your return will be lower. A higher expense ratio also indicate a higher rate of churning of the stock portfolio which is not good for generating a better return. The longer the money stays invested in a particular stock, the greater is the chance for a higher return.        
	Equity investment has several advantages over other instruments, investment return and tax benefit being the primary positives. At present, there is no long-term capital gains tax on equity investments. This provision is kept unchanged in the new direct taxes code. If you hold on to an equity investment, even through mutual funds, for more than a year, redemptions will be tax-free.        
	Equities do involve risks, but over a long period of time the risks get ironed out. In 1996-97, the 30-share sensex on the BSE was around 3100 and banks were offering a maximum interest rate of 13-14 per cent on fixed deposits. Now the sensex is above 20000 and banks are offering a maximum interest rate of 7.5-8 per cent on fixed deposits.

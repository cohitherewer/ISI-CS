                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Govt for realistic oil pricing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 10: The oil ministry today said the pricing of petroleum products should be realistic, paving the way for the implementation of the Kirit Parikh committee recommendations.         
	There is a need for a realistic pricing of petroleum products (so that) the companies do not suffer under-recoveries. It will be impossible for the companies to fund expansion projects (needed to meet the growing demand in the country), petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said at an industry event.        
	He said maintaining the financial health of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) was important to ensure the supply lines did not run dry and investments were made for expansion. At present, IOC, BPCL and HPCL suffer a Rs 190 crore-loss per day on the sale of petrol, diesel, domestic LPG cylinder and kerosene below cost.

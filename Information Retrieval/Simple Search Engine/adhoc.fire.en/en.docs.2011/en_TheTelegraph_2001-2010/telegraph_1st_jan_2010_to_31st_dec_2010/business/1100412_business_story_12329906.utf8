The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | A new beginning
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      A new beginning
        As the new financial year begins, Srikumar Bondyopadhyay lists the investment options                                            
	Jaideep breathed a big sigh of relief. After two months of hard thinking, he could finally manage to invest enough to save his tax liability for 2009-10.         
	If you sleep over tax planning throughout the year, like Jaideep, you may have to lose sleep over it when the year draws to an end.         
	The right approach is to start planning from the beginning of the year rather than leaving it for the last three months.         
	Start early        
	Tax planning from the beginning of the year has other advantages, too.         
	First, you will earn higher return on investments since the money stays invested for a longer period. Second, you need not have to fork out a lump sum if you spread out your investments throughout the year.        
	Tax planning and tax saving are not the same. Most of us approach our tax-saving investments with the sole objective of saving tax for the current year.         
	As long as investing in an instrument gives tax deduction, the immediate purpose of the investment is met. The result is that you end up saving tax but fail to have a proper investment plan.        
	With the financial year coming to an end, your worries may be over for the time being.         
	But, it is important that the mistakes made this time are not repeated next year. Last-minute decisions can lead to big mistakes such as buying an investment product that you do not need or is too expensive.         
	Spoilt for choice        
	Take for example Section 80C, which is the only meaningful deduction available at present.         
	Under this section, investments up to Rs 1 lakh made in specified instruments can be deducted from your taxable income.         
	There is a long list of eligible investments  contribution to employees provident fund, tuition fees for children, principal repayment of housing loan, Public Provident Fund (PPF), equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS) of mutual funds, National Savings Certificate, Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, post-office term deposits, tax saving bank fixed deposits, life insurance premium and so on.         
	If you try to exhaust your Rs 1-lakh investment limit in such a wide range of choices in a haste, you are bound to make mistakes.        
	All you need to do is to ensure that the instruments you choose are integrated into your broader investment portfolio and are in line with your risk profile and financial goals.        
	New attractions        
	In the Union Budget for 2010-11, another tax-saving instrument has been introduced  infrastructure bonds. Under a new Section 80CCF, you can get the benefit of additional deduction up to Rs 20,000 by investing in these infrastructure bonds.         
	However, the income tax department has not yet specified the details of such infrastructure bonds.         
	There is also tax relief on premium paid towards medical insurance  up to Rs 15,000 for self and another Rs 20,000 for senior citizen parents. There is a host of other tax benefits that one can get.         
	If one starts making all these investments at the end of the year, the amount will shoot up to over Rs 2 lakh!         
	Step by step        
	So, how should an investor choose from among the various choices available?         
	First, make a list of mandatory payments, such as employees provident fund, principal repayment of a housing loan, childrens tuition fees, that are eligible for tax relief under Section 80C.         
	By subtracting this total from Rs 1 lakh, you will get to know how much additional investments you need to make to exhaust the limit available under Section 80C.         
	Now you can balance the investment requirement among various options available, such as ELSS, NSC, PPF and so on.         
	For salaried people, a large portion of the investment in fixed-income instruments is automatically taken care of through contributions in EPF.         
	So, if you are young, put a large portion of your remaining investment, say 80 per cent, in ELSS and the remaining 20 per cent in PPF.         
	As you grow older, lower your investment component in ELSS and increase your PPF account.         
	This will ensure that when you attain the age of retirement, PPF and EPF will account for 80 per cent of your total investment, while ELSS will constitute the remaining 20 per cent.         
	The growing contribution to EPF is automatically taken care of by your salary increments every year.        
	Even spread        
	PPF is the best among all fixed-income instruments.         
	An annual contribution of Rs 70,000 will amount to more than Rs 20.5 lakh in 15 years, nearly Rs 35 lakh in 20 years and Rs 55.27 lakh in 25 years!         
	So, if you are 25 years now, by investing a little less than Rs 6,000 a month in PPF, you can build a fund of Rs 55.27 lakh for life after retirement.         
	Equity investment through ELSS is the most preferable way to build long-term wealth. But since it comes with the inherent risks of market volatility, your equity exposure should be low as you approach supperannuation and your risk taking ability declines.        
	Recycle strategy        
	There is another way of tax planning. Recycle your past tax saving investment to take care of your current tax liabilities.         
	This involves liquidating your past investments in, say PPF or ELSS, and reinvest the money in the same or other instruments and thereby reap the benefit of tax deduction.         
	As one can see, it involves no additional investment outlays. You can save up to 30.9 per cent tax (including cess) without spending a rupee.        
	One thing should be mentioned here. Though life insurance and medical insurance, come with tax relief, they should not be looked upon as tax saving devices. Insurance addresses specific needs of life. Besides, these are expenditures and not investments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | MMTC offer next fiscal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      MMTC offer next fiscal
          R. SURYAMURTHY                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: The MMTC selloff is likely to be pushed back to the next fiscal as the PSU trading firm is yet to complete its stock split and issue bonus shares.         
	Besides, officials said, MMTC had also not finalised its independent directors in line with Sebi regulations. The government plans to offload 10 per cent stake in the company.        
	The divestment of MMTC is unlikely this fiscal  but it will happen in 2011, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said. He added that it was likely in the April-June quarter. MMTC is under the administrative control of the commerce ministry.         
	The stock split and the bonus issues was approved by the government in July.        
	The government, which owns 99.33 per cent in MMTC, is considering divesting a part of its stake to fund its social sector projects.        
	During 2011, public issues worth Rs 90,000 crore are likely to hit the markets. Of this, Rs 50,000 crore will be from the private sector and Rs 40,000 crore from the public sector, Jagannadham Thunuguntla, SMC Global Securities strategist and head of research, said in a research note.        
	Indian firms, both public and private, have collected about Rs 59,523 crore from the primary market so far this year. In 2009, only 20 companies raised close to Rs 20,000 crore from initial public offers.        
	Against a budget divestment target of Rs 40,000 crore during the current fiscal, the divestment in six state-owned units  Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam, Engineers India, Coal India, Power Grid Corporation of India, Manganese Ore India and Shipping Corporation of India  have yielded Rs 22,144 crore to the government.        
	The government plans to come up with public offers of Steel Authority of India Limited, ONGC, Indian Oil Corporation and Power Finance Corporation in the last quarter of this fiscal.        
	There are concerns that the ambiguous subsidy sharing formula can impact the follow on public offers of energy firms IOC and ONGC.        
	The Centre plans to offload a 10 per cent stake in IOC and 5 per cent in ONGC, and the move is expected to generate about Rs 24,000 crore in this financial year. IOC was supposed to raise Rs 9,000 crore and ONGC about Rs 14,405 crore through the offers. After divestment, the governments stake in ONGC and IOC will drop to 74.14 per cent and 78.92 per cent, respectively.        
	Deficit target        
	The cash is essential for the government to stick to its budget deficit guidance of 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product for this fiscal, despite a one-time windfall of Rs 1.06 lakh crore from selling telecom radiowaves, which will mostly be spent on social development projects.        
	The government had raised Rs 25,000 crore through stake sales in Oil India, NMDC, REC and NTPC in 2009-10.

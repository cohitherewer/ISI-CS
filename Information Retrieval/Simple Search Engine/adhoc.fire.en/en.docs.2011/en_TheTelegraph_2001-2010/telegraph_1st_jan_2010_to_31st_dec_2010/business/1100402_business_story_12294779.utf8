The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fresh spike in food prices fuels worries
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fresh spike in food prices fuels worries
          OUR BUREAU                          Frown factor                                  
	New Delhi/Mumbai, April 1: Food inflation rose for the first time in four weeks to 16.35 per cent because of a surge in the prices of wheat, pulses and milk.        
	With a little over two weeks left for the Reserve Bank to announce its monetary policy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said keeping inflation under check should be one of the objectives of the countrys financial policies.         
	Economists said the RBI could take more measures in its monetary policy on April 20 to contain the price rise as there were fears of food inflation spreading to manufactured goods.        
	The price of pulses rose 31.55 per cent for the week ended March 20, milk by 18.74 per cent and wheat, 13.54 per cent. Onion prices fell by 13.38 per cent and potatoes by 12.20 per cent.        
	The governments decision to raise fuel prices in major cities from today to implement the Euro IV norms is likely to stoke inflationary pressures further.        
	Speaking at the RBI headquarters, Singh said inflation must be kept under control as it hurt the common man the most and also distorted economic signals.         
	The size of the fiscal deficit is a key parameter in this context. We allowed a large increase in the fiscal deficit in the past two years as we responded to the global economic crisis. This must now be reversed.         
	We are, therefore, firmly committed to bringing the economy back to a fiscally sustainable path. This involves a reduction in the fiscal deficit from 6.8 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) in 2009-10 to 5.5 per cent in 2010-11 with a further reduction in the next two years, reaching 4.1 per cent in 2012-13, he said.        
	I expect overall inflation to be at 10.7 per cent in March. To tame inflation, the RBI could take monetary tightening measures in the April policy by raising repo, reverse repo and cash reserve ratio by 25 basis points each, HDFC Bank economist Jyotinder Kaur said.        
	The wholesale price index inflation, which was initially driven by high food prices, is now getting a push from other segments. Inflation in manufacturing accelerated to 7.4 per cent in February from 6.5 per cent in January.        
	Inflationary pressure is stronger than we anticipated. Between November 2009 and February 2010, in a space of four months, the wholesale price inflation has gone from 5.6 per cent to 9.9 per cent, RBI governor D. Subbarao said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Go-slow on auction of 3G spectrum
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Go-slow on auction of 3G spectrum
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                Call on hold      
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: The government may defer the auction of 3G spectrum because of certain legal complications.        
	Sources said the issues related to the payment of the bid sum upfront with the promise of spectrum at a later date. The law ministry has told the department of telecom (DoT) that the auction should be held when spectrum is available.        
	The auction was scheduled for January 14 but DoT is yet to invite applications. The sources said the auction could be held around November-December.        
	Another problem is the defence authorities insistence that spectrum  radio waves through which phone data travel  for civilians could only be released by September-October.        
	According to the sources, the defence ministry has accused the public sector telecom twins  BSNL and MTNL  of taking too much time to build the alternative optic fibre cable network that it is supposed to use.        
	There is, however, no official confirmation on a change in the auction schedule. Officials said the empowered group of ministers on 3G policy would take a call soon.         
	A change in the auction schedule will have a huge impact on the governments plans to plug the fiscal deficit.        
	In last years budget, the finance ministry had earmarked Rs 30,000-35,000 crore as revenue from the auction to plug part of its fiscal deficit of Rs 4 lakh crore.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had given clear directions to DoT to complete the auction by February so that the revenue would be reflected in the coming budget.        
	Analysts said any move to defer the auction would cost the exchequer huge sums.        
	Operators were expected to bid aggressively, reflecting the scarcity of air waves. The telecom department had recently placed a ban on the allocation of second generation spectrum, adding to the scarcity.        
	The 3G services were scheduled to be launched in India in 2007, but there had been repeated delays because of problems in freeing up spectrum and setting bid prices.

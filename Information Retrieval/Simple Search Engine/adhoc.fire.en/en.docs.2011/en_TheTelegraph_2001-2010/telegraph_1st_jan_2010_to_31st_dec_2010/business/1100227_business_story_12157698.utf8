The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Role of enabler is tough to perform
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Role of enabler is tough to perform
										      GUEST COLUMN: Bharat Ramaswami                         
	This budget is built around two themes: fiscal balance and inclusive growth.         
	Analysts especially from industry will be delighted at the finance ministers resolve to return to fiscal prudence. The governments vision of itself as an enabler of economic activity is realistic and laudable.         
	The finance minister sees the role of the government where it concentrates on supporting and delivering services to the disadvantaged sections of the society.         
	There are two sorts of problems with such a statement. First, while the government does have the primary role in delivering essential goods and services to the poor, the governments responsibility towards inclusive growth should not end here. Second, even if we grant the governments case, the budget is guilty of lip service towards the cause of such a social role.        
	Inclusive growth is not just a matter of directing subsidies towards the needy. Agriculture and small-scale non-farm enterprises absorb much of the labour force in this country. Inclusive growth requires incomes in these sectors to grow as well. The budget speech does not outline a strategy towards this end.         
	The extent of seriousness can be judged by the allocation of Rs 400 crore towards extending the green revolution to the eastern region of the country The allocation is so pitiful that the budget speech does not bother to mention how it will be spent. A strategy for inclusive growth would talk about rural roads, market infrastructure, extension services, water use and soil conservation.         
	It would also pay attention to the pattern of emerging food demand. A quarter of agricultural output comes from livestock activities and public investments in organised marketing (e.g., slaughter houses) and disease control would have high payoffs. Another quarter of agricultural output comes from fruits and vegetables. This is a high value segment and its growth is held back by inadequate supply chain logistics.        
	Here the government has to be an enabler and the tax concessions towards handling systems, cold storage and refrigeration are rightly made in that spirit.         
	However, it is not clear whether it is taxes that have held back investments. The real spoiler here has been government regulation of agricultural market activities. Some progress towards lifting these curbs was made in the early part of this decade. But that was undone in the last couple of years.         
	If enabling investments are lacking in agriculture, can a young person in the countryside switch to a rewarding non-farm occupation? It is widely agreed that despite the abundance of human resources, we face shortages of skilled manpower. Yet this matter receives an allocation of only Rs 45 crore.         
	My second grouse is about the delivery of services to the poor. The finance minister acknowledges that one of the challenges is the weakness in government systems ...at different levels of governance. His speech refers to the bottleneck of our public delivery mechanisms.         
	The economic survey presented before the budget, made a case for direct income transfers to the poor via food coupons and how such mechanisms can be applied to other subsidies as well. Yet, the budget speech gives no hint of any change in the governance structures of our subsidy programs. If there is a bottleneck, how can mere allocation of financial resources resolve it?         
	The budget speech assures us about a draft food security bill. If this legislation does not take into account the efficiency of subsidy delivery and if it ties the hands of governments to the hopelessly outdated and dysfunctional public distribution system, the outcome will be a tragedy to the poor.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, April 24: A higher non-interest income saw ICICI Bank posting better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2010. The countrys largest private sector bank recorded a 35 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 1,006 crore compared with Rs 744 crore in the same period last year.        
	Analysts had forecast a net profit of around Rs 900 crore.        
	There is a mild disappointment regarding core operations as the banks net interest income dipped to Rs 2,035 crore during the fourth quarter from Rs 2,139 crore a year ago. This has been more than made up by a growth in non-interest income at Rs 1,891 crore against Rs 1,674 crore. Fee income, earned from mutual funds and insurance products, rose to Rs 1,521 crore from Rs 1,343 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Lower operating expenses during the period also contributed to strong bottomline growth, believed to be the best for the bank in the past two years.         
	Provisions came down by 9 per cent to Rs 990 crore from Rs 1,085 crore a year ago.         
	During the year, ICICI Bank strengthened its deposit franchise and this resulted in a strong growth in current and savings account (CASA) deposits. CASA deposits increased 34 per cent to Rs 84,216 crore as on March 31, 2010, from Rs 62,668 crore a year ago. The CASA ratio increased to 41.7 per cent from 28.7 per cent.         
	Total deposits were Rs 202,017 crore compared with Rs 218,348 crore as on March 31, 2009. However, the banks loan book decreased to Rs 181,206 crore from Rs 218,311 crore.        
	Its been a good year for us  there was strong growth in CASA deposits, an improvement in net interest margins and a decrease in our net NPAs, ICICI Banks managing director and CEO Chanda Kochhar said.         
	Credit growth this year is likely to be strong and the bank expects to clock a 16-20 per cent loan growth, Kochhar added.

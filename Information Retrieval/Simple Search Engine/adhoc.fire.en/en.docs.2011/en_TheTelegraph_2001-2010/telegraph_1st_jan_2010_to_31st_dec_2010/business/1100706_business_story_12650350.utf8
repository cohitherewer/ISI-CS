The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RNRL shares take a beating
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RNRL shares take a beating
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 5: Reliance Natural Resources Ltd shares today tumbled 27 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange on negative sentiment over the merger terms with Reliance Power.        
	The boards of the two Anil Ambani firms yesterday proposed a 4:1 swap ratio  one Reliance Power shares for four of RNRL shares  that did not find favour with investors today.        
	Though the swap ratio was in line with expectations, many analysts were looking at a better valuation.         
	Based on the closing prices of both these scrips on Friday (Rs 63.65 for RNRL and Rs 175.15 for Reliance Power), the swap ratio was expected to be around 3:1.         
	It is feared that the swap ratio will be negative for RNRL and that explains todays fall. Investors should stay away from the counter for a few days and only enter after it stabilises, an analyst said.        
	The RNRL scrip opened at Rs 50.95 and dipped to an intra-day low of Rs 45.50. It closed at Rs 46.30, a drop of 27.26 per cent, or Rs 17.35.         
	An opposite trend was seen in the RPower counter. Its shares rose 3.57 per cent, or Rs 6.25, to close at Rs 181.40. Initially, the share gained 8.36 per cent to a 52-week high of Rs 189.80.        
	According to analysts, the merger will be positive for RPower since it will give the company better access to gas.         
	RNRL shareholders, on the other hand, will benefit from the good prospects in the power business.         
	The companies had yesterday said the merger would be a win-win situation for both.         
	Gas supply under RNRLs master agreements with RIL will facilitate RPowers plans to generate 8,000MW of electricity.         
	Prospective gas from RNRLs coal bed methane blocks will also benefit the merged entity.

	Almost all recent discussions on Indias economic prospects have identified infrastructure as vital to sustainable economic growth in the country. This is perhaps because of the day-to-day experience that we have on account of poor road connectivity, inadequate capacity of airports, slow average speed of railways and energy shortage.         
	The Planning Commission projects the investment requirement in infrastructure in the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12) at around $500 billion against $220 billion in the Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-07) for the GDP to have a sustained growth of 9 per cent per annum.        
	Considering the huge infrastructure deficit in the country, significant emphasis has been on getting the projects on way. There have been several government initiatives on increasing the availability of finance, easing of procedural issues, land acquisition, increasing the project pipeline and strengthening of institutional capacity of awarding agencies.         
	This has been possible because of a greater political will and focus in recent times. The acceptance of the recommendations of the B.K. Chaturvedi Committee on highways by the government is an indicator of this.         
	However, as infrastructure and therefore the construction industry get set to surge in the next few years, it is also important to begin looking at some other issues, which will emerge as critical areas in the future. They include:        
	Environmental impact of infrastructure development: Construction activities have a significant impact on the environment and few of us realise that the infrastructure we use can be more environmentally sustainable.         
	The industry has already initiated the use of technologies, which attempt to reduce the environmental impact of infrastructure development. However, the government could perhaps consider offering specific and long-term incentives to the construction industry to enhance the use of recycled materials and green technology that reduce energy consumption and, in general, help manage the environment better.        
	Scarcity of skilled manpower to meet the rapid growth: Availability of skilled manpower is going to become an aspect that will need consideration as has been pointed out by studies, which estimate a deficit of various categories of manpower going ahead.         
	The government needs to initiate, either on its own or with the assistance of the private sector, institutional mechanisms which can address the issue of development of skills and expertise at all levels including engineers, diploma holders, mechanics, welders, operators and semi-skilled workers. The government could also consider promoting specific institutes offering courses for infrastructure management both for public and private entities.        
	The need to protect the users of infrastructure services: As more projects start developing on a public- private partnership mode or even as public-funded ones, much of the infrastructure developed here onwards will require user charges to be paid. In this scenario, the mechanism for increasing the awareness of the customers rights needs to be strengthened so that the promised service levels by the developers are actually met in return for the payment of user charges.         
	Going ahead, we hope that the government initiates visible measures to tackle these issues, which will make our long-term infrastructure story a sustainable one.

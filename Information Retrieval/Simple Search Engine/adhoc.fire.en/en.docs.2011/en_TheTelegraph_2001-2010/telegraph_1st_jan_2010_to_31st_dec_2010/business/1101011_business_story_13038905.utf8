        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay suggests options for the best home loan bargain in town                                        
	Home is where one starts from.  T.S. Eliot         
	And a bank is where most people start from to give shape to their dream homes. While choices are aplenty, the search is always for a loan offer with the lowest interest rates.         
	Last month, the State Bank of India extended its 8 per cent home loan offer till the end of this calendar year. This not only encourages prospective buyers to borrow funds from the countrys largest lender at a cheaper rate compared with other financiers, but also gives existing borrowers a chance to shift to the SBI scheme.        
	Change is in air        
	Since July this year, banks have started shifting to base rates  the rates below which they cannot lend.         
	The Reserve Bank of India has asked banks to give their existing borrowers, including home loan customers, an opportunity to shift to the new base rate system from the benchmark prime lending rate system earlier. But many banks have not given this facility to their existing borrowers. For banks that have allowed the switch, the interest rate charged under the new system is still higher than the rates sought from new borrowers.        
	Borrowers may feel dejected for not being allowed to shift to the new regime even after paying the EMIs regularly. But thats how banks lure customers with what is called teaser rates.        
	Should you continue to pay high interests because you had borrowed the money in the previous rate regime? Not at all.        
	If youre annoyed with your existing lender, shift to another lender who will charge you a lower interest rate on the outstanding loan.        
	Pre-close your existing home loan and switch to the SBI if you are a non-SBI customer. If you are an SBI customer and paying anything above 10 per cent, you can consider moving to another lender. However, under the new base rate system, the SBI is charging a floating rate of 9.25 per cent for loans up to Rs 50 lakh.         
	Mood to switch         
	Even if you offer our existing home loan borrowers to switch to the base rate system, there will be no change in the interest rate that they are paying now, said a branch manager of Federal Bank Ltd, a Kerala-based private bank.        
	The bank is charging a 10 per cent interest from its existing home loan borrowers.        
	For a retail home loan borrower, it doesnt matter whether the lending rate is based on the benchmark prime lending rate or the base rate.         
	What matters is whether the borrower is paying a higher interest rate than what he/she can get and whether the difference in the interest rate actually being paid and the alternative rate is more than 2 per cent  a penalty that banks impose during pre-closure of a home loan.         
	Everything remaining the same, if a Federal Bank borrower pays the penalty on the outstanding loan and switches to the SBIs 8 per cent home loan offer, the borrower will still save 2 per cent in interest outgo in the next three years of such a switch.        
	The SBI is offering an 8 per cent interest for the first year and 9 per cent for the next two years after which it is 1.75 per cent above the base rate (currently at 7.5 per cent).        
	The interest rate, thus, adds up to 26 per cent for the first three years in an SBI loan compared with 30 per cent for Federal Bank. Hence by switching to the SBI, a Federal Bank borrower saves four per cent and after paying a two per cent penalty for the foreclosure of the loan, the borrower still saves two per cent.        
	Ideal for new buyers        
	New home loan borrowers will also be better off signing with the SBI because the latters offer is the best among all such teaser rate offers now available in the market (see chart).        
	The current floating rate (based on the base rate) of the countrys leading home loan providers  SBI, HDFC, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank  is the same at 9.25 per cent. But under the special home loan offers by HDFC, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, you will have to pay the floating rate from the third year.         
	In fact, ICICI Bank offers 8.5 per cent interest rate for this financial year only. In 2011-12, the interest rate will be 9.5 per cent.        
	Thus, by signing with the SBI, a new home loan borrower saves one per cent interest in the first two years and 0.25 per cent (considering the current floating rates prevail) in the third year.        
	Points to ponder        
	A prospective home loan borrower should bear a few things in mind before getting lured by the cheap home loan offers. Finance is only one aspect of a purchase, the price of the property being another.         
	If a property is unreasonably high, however, cheap be the finance cost, you should not buy the property.        
	The latest data on residential property prices across different cities published by the National Housing Bank, the regulator of housing finance companies, reveals that property prices in various cities, including Calcutta, have started cooling off a little bit this year (see chart).         
	The NHB calculated the residential property price index considering 2007 as the base year. Assuming the prevailing price in 2007 as 100, residential property price index for Calcutta has come down to 157 in the first half of this calendar year from 185 in July-December last year. But it is still 50 per cent more than that in 2007. This also shows the prospect of investment return in real estate.         
	What are you waiting for? Get started on your dream abode right away.

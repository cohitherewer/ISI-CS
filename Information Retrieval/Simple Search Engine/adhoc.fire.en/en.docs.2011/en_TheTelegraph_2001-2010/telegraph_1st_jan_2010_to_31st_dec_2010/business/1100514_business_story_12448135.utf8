          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Venezuelas President Hugo Chavez with Murli Deora in Caracas on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	New Delhi, May 13: ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) along with Spains Repsol and Malaysias Petronas have signed a deal to develop a $20-billion oil project in Venezuela. Indian Oil and Oil India are OVLs other partners in the consortium.        
	About half of the production from the joint venture  PetroCarabobo SA  will be converted into light crude for export.         
	India is expected to get 3.6 million tonnes of crude oil per year from the project.        
	On Wednesday, OVL and its partners inked an agreement with Venezuelan national oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PdV) to develop and produce hydrocarbons from the Carabobo project in the Orinoco region.         
	Repsol, Petronas and OVL own 11 per cent each in the consortium, which will produce 400,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd).         
	Indian Oil and Oil India will have a 3.5 per cent interest each in the joint venture, while Corporacion Venezolana del Petroleo (CVP), a unit of PdV, will hold the remaining 60 per cent.         
	The joint venture entity will build units for heavy oil production, besides upgrading existing facilities and other infrastructure.        
	The project cost is estimated at $15-20 billion and is one of Indias major investments in Latin America, said an official statement.         
	The new company has a licence for 25 years, with a provision for a 15-year extension, to extract oil.         
	After the signing ceremony, oil minister Murli Deora met Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez Frias to discuss the possibility of sourcing crude. Discussions were also held on the possibility of awarding the Junin Norte block, where new oil reserves are being certified by OVL (to Indian firms), the statement said.         
	The Indian firms in the joint venture will invest $2.181 billion in the Carabobo project between 2010 and 2015. Of this, OVL will invest $1.33 billion, while Indian Oil and Oil India will invest $454 million each.         
	Venezuela had offered seven blocks with combined oil-in-place estimated at around 128 billion barrels. The blocks were grouped into three projects. Of the three projects, bids were received for only two  one by the consortium led by the Indians and the other by Chevron Corp.

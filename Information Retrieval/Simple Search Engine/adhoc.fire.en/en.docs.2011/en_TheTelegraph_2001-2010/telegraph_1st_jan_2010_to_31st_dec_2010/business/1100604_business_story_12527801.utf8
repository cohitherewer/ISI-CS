The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas stare at Orient exit
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tatas stare at Orient exit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           TAKING A BACKSEAT                                  
	Mumbai, June 3: The Tatas may have to finally cut their losses and jump off the Orient-Express.         
	Indian Hotels Company, the Tata group firm, will have to abandon all hopes of ever forging an alliance with Orient-Express after the Bermuda Supreme Court earlier this week threw out a challenge to the hotel giants oppressive shareholding structure that was designed to perpetuate control in the hands of a small group of directors.         
	The proxy battle against Orient-Express has been waged through two US-based private hedge fund owners  Steve Cohen and David E. Shaw.         
	On Tuesday, the court threw out their challenge to Orient-Express circular shareholding structure through a dual class of shares with differential voting rights that allowed a cabal of directors to ward off any takeover threat and stonewall unpalatable changes in its operations.         
	Orient has two classes of shares: a publicly listed class A share that carries one-tenth of the voting right of the class B shares, which are entirely held by a subsidiary of the hotel company.         
	Richard Ground, Chief Justice of the Bermuda Supreme Court, held that it was lawful for Orient-Express Holdings Ltd  a subsidiary of Orient-Express Hotels to hold and exercise voting rights in respect of the Class B shares in Orient-Express Hotels held by it.         
	Competing suitors         
	A takeover threat had loomed over Orient-Express in September 2007 when Dubai Group LLC and the Tatas emerged as two competing suitors.         
	The battle has been brewing since late 2007 after Orient-Express rudely rebuffed both suitors and invoked poison pill provisions to ward off any takeover attempt. The Tatas had used a $300-million war chest to pick up around 11.5 per cent of the Class A shares of Orient-Express Hotels that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.         
	After the Orient rebuff, the Tatas have taken a backseat in the battle, allowing Cohen and Shaw  who had together acquired about 7 per cent of the Class A shares for over $315 million  to slug it out with the Orient management.         
	Immediately after the verdict, the two hedge funds formally broke off their ties and said they were no longer part of a group that may be deemed to beneficially own more than 5 per cent of the stock of Orient-Express Hotels.         
	The ball is now in the Tatas court: they had bought the Orient shares for as much as $60 a share in September 2007. The stock is now quoting at a little over $9, which amounts a substantial dimunition in the value of the investment.

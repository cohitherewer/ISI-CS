          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 22: Sesa Goa Ltd, a subsidiary of Anil Agarwal-controlled Vedanta Resources Plc, will seek shareholders approval on October 18 to raise its investment and borrowing limits.        
	In a notice sent to stock exchanges, Sesa Goa said it planned to increase the investment limit by more than 100 per cent to Rs 16,000 crore from the present Rs 7,125.36 crore.        
	It also seeks to increase the borrowing limit to Rs 15,000 crore. The company was silent on its current borrowing limit.        
	Sesa Goas move to enhance its borrowing and investment limits comes at a time when its parent Vedanta has launched a bid to acquire Cairn India. Under the offer, Vedanta will buy 60 per cent in Cairn India, including a 20 per cent stake acquired by Sesa Goa through an open offer.         
	Sesa Goa also plans to explore possibilities in iron ore, coal and steel and hopes to fund these investments through a mix of internal funds and borrowings.         
	On August 16, the companys board had cleared the proposal to acquire 20 per cent in Cairn India through the open offer for around $3 billion. Minority shareholders, however, have raised objections to Sesa Goa funding an acquisition by the parent.         
	According to the notice of the extraordinary general meeting, the company has an investible surplus of around Rs 6,000 crore and is generating cash on a regular basis.

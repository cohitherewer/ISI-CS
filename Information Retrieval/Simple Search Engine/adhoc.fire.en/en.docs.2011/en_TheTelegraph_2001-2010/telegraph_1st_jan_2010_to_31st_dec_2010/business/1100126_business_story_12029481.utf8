The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Foreign loan rules for 3G made easy
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Foreign loan rules for 3G made easy
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Incoming facility                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: The government has tweaked overseas borrowing rules to make it easier for telecom companies bidding for third-generation (3G) spectrum to arrange for short-term funds.        
	The new norms allow winners of the auction to pay the spectrum fee upfront through funds raised in the domestic market, which can be refinanced later from longterm overseas borrowing.         
	However, the overseas money should be raised within 12 months from the date of payment of the final instalment to the government.        
	Last month, the Reserve Bank of India had allowed telecom companies to use funds raised abroad to participate in the 3G auction.         
	Mobile operators need huge funds to take part in the spectrum sale, to be completed by March 2010, as the reserve price is fixed at Rs 3,500 crore. The government expects to raise over Rs 40,000 crore from the auctions.        
	The amount involved is huge and has to be raised within a limited period of time and payable directly to the government. So, it has now been decided that the fee for spectrum allocation may be met out of the rupee resources by successful bidders, to be refinanced through long-term external commercial borrowing, under the approval route, said finance ministry officials.        
	Under the current guidelines, successful bidders are required to pay 25 per cent of the bid amount within five days of the close of the auction and the balance amount within 15 days.         
	Given the short window available between the date of application for the auction and the date of payment, the bidders find it difficult to raise ECBs to meet the payment obligation, said officials.         
	An industry player said the move would be a big help to reschedule payment.        
	According to current norms, the all-inclusive ceiling for external commercial borrowings (ECB) under the approval route is 300 basis points above the London interbank offered rate  the benchmark for global borrowings and lendings  for loans ranging from three to five years. The all-inclusive ceiling is 500 basis points for loans with a maturity of more than five years.        
	The ministry also said authorised dealers should monitor the end-use of funds and ensure that all other conditions of ECB on the eligible borrower, recognised lender and average maturity is complied with.

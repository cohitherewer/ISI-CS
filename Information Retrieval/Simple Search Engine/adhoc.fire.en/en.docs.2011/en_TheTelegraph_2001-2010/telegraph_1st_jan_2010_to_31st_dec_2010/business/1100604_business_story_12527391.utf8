          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, June 3: Food inflation rose to 16.55 per cent in the third week of May on the back of costlier pulses, milk and fruits. Policymakers are banking on a good monsoon to improve the situation.        
	Analysts said they expected the RBI to intervene as manufacturing inflation was a cause for concern. Besides, food prices may come down only in the later half of the fiscal when the impact of a normal monsoon becomes visible. Food inflation was 16.23 per cent during the week ended May 15.        
	Inflation is worrying the government at a time it is exploring the possibility of implementing the recommendations of the Kirit Parikh committee, which is calling for free market pricing of petrol and diesel.        
	At present, oil firms sell petrol at a loss of Rs 3.35 per litre and diesel at a loss of Rs 3.49 a litre. The loss in kerosene is Rs 18.82 per litre and domestic LPG, Rs 261.90 per cylinder.         
	The empowered group of ministers, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, which is meeting next week, may not accept the committees suggestion to raise kerosene prices by Rs 6 per litre and LPG by Rs 100 per cylinder. It can agree to new norms for petrol and diesel pricing if the Congress gets its coalition partners on board, sources said.         
	The fuel price index rose 14.14 per cent against 12.08 per cent in the previous week because of higher electricity cost.

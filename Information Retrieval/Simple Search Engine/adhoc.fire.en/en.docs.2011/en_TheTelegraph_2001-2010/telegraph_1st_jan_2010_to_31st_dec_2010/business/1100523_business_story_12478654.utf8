The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tea exports grow 22.8%
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tea exports grow 22.8%
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 22: Indias tea exports rose 22.8 per cent to 47.2 million kg during the first three months of the year from 38.5 million kg during the corresponding period a year ago.        
	Favourable weather during the last few months of 2009 has boosted the total output by 14.9 per cent during January-March 2010 to 94.1 million kg from 81.9 million kg a year ago.        
	According to the latest statistics published by both the Tea Board of India and the Indian Tea Association, production rose 9 per cent during March to 49 million kg from 45 million kg a year earlier. Exports increased to 17.96 million kg in March from 14.22 million kg during the same period in 2009.        
	Output in north India rose more than 2 million kg in March against a shortfall of 2.9 million kg during the first two months of this year. Normally, production in north India drops after the winter season as the leaves are damaged by frost.         
	Output in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka also improved to 19.17 million kg from 17.69 million kg. Tea output was lower in Assam, while Dooars, Terai and Darjeeling have reported an increase in production.         
	However, production in Darjeeling and Dooars could be impacted during the coming months because of the lack of rainfall in March, experts said. But lower Assam looks promising after continuous rainfall. Production was also extended in most estates during the lean months of November and December because of high prices.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Aug. 27: In a setback to Harsh Vardhan Lodha, Calcutta High Court today appointed three administrators for the estate of the late Priyamvada Birla.        
	Though the ruling is not to Lodhas expectation, the order may not impact the functioning of the MP Birla group companies in the near term.        
	Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta did not name the administrators today but hinted that a businessman, a lawyer and a chartered accountant would be entrusted with the job.        
	Harsh Lodha is now the chairman of MP Birla manufacturing companies such as Birla Corporation, Universal Cables and Birla Ericsson after the death of his father Rajendra Singh Lodha in October 2008.        
	R.S. Lodha staked claim over the estate of Priyamvada Birla and the entire Madhav Prasad Birla (Priyamvadas husband) industrial empire that included cash cows such as Birla Corp, as the executor and beneficiary of a registered will made by Priyamvada in 1999.        
	The other members of the Birla family challenged the will  for which R.S. Lodha had applied for probate after Priyamvadas death in 2004  ensuring a number of court cases, both civil and criminal, as well as hearings before the Company Law Board.        
	After R.S. Lodhas death, Harsh Lodha and M.P. Birlas sisters  Laxmi Devi Newar, through her legal heir, and Radha Devi Mohta  and two others had applied to become an administrator.        
	Independent people as administrators need to look after Priyamvada Birlas estate and the company, pending the court verdict on the probate because R.S. Lodha was the executor of Priyamvadas will.        
	The jury is still out on whether todays order will undermine the authority and control of Harsh Lodha in the key MP Birla companies.        
	The estate of Priyamvada includes bank balances, mutual funds, bonds, shares in an orchard, fixed deposits and two types of shares  stakes she directly held in manufacturing companies and stakes held in investment companies, which in turn control the promoters holding in the MP Birla firms.        
	It is not clear whether the administrators can exercise voting rights in the investment companies. If they dont get the rights, Lodha may not have much difficulty in running the companies.         
	The contrary may potentially undermine his authority since investment companies have the right to dictate manufacturing companies such as Birla Corp.        
	On a query raised by the counsel for the Lodhas, Justice Sengupta said: Administrators would have all the rights to act as shareholders and exercise all powers in accordance with the provisions of section 247 of the Indian Succession Act 1925.        
	Debanjan Mandal, partner of Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm for Lodha, said his client might challenge the order before a division bench.         
	A spokesperson for the Birla family said, The appointment of independent administrators has vindicated our contentions, though we are yet to see the details.

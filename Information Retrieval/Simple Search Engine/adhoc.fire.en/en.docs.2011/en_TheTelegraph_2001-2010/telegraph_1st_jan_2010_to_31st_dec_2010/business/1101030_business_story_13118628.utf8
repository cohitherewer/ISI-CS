The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | CBI pulled up for slow progress in 2G probe
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      CBI pulled up for slow progress in 2G probe
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: The Supreme Court today said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was doing the 2G spectrum scam probe in a shoddy manner, after the agency sought more time to complete its investigation.        
	You have done nothing. The nature of complaint is serious. One year has gone by. You are doing a slipshod investigation. You are dragging your feet. How long will you take to complete the investigation, another 10 years? asked the apex court.        
	Adjourning the matter to November 15, the bench, comprising Justice G.S. Singhvi and Justice A.K. Ganguly, said it would like to have answers to some of the questions on the next date.        
	The court also sought the Centres response to a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) pointing out irregularities in the allocation of 2G spectrum licences to telecom operators.         
	According to the CAG report, the allotment reflected favouritism and had caused huge losses to the government.         
	However, telecom minister A. Raja has maintained that the cabinet was aware of his decisions on 2G.        
	In October last year, the CBI raided the headquarters of the department of telecom at Sanchar Bhawan and registered an FIR against the department and private companies.         
	However, it is yet to complete its investigations and had sought six more months to investigate the case even during the earlier hearing by the Supreme Court.        
	The allegations of corruption emerged when 2G spectrum, clubbed with licences, were allegedly allotted to favoured parties at throwaway prices on a first come, first served basis in 2007, despite there being over 100 more applicants.        
	At the rate of Rs 1,658.57 crore per licence, the government got only Rs 9,014 crore.         
	However, the price was discovered in an auction in 2001. In 2008, its value had multiplied manifold, leading to a loss of over Rs 70,000 crore to the exchequer.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Status quo on savings rate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Decision pending                                  
	Mumbai, April 21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) hasnt taken a decision yet on deregulating the savings bank rate though it has held discussions on the issue with banks, deputy governor Subir Gokarn said here today.        
	The savings bank rate  currently ruling at a uniform 3.5 per cent  is the only one that the central bank hasnt deregulated. Over time, the RBI has given the banks the freedom to fix their administered lending rates as well as the rates on most deposits.        
	Various banks have been clamouring for freedom in fixing the interest rate on savings bank accounts as it would enable them to wean away customers with the offer of attractive rates.        
	A day after the RBI announced a modest increase in key policy rates, Gokarn told reporters that there were a lot of advantages of deregulating the savings bank rate. Equally, there were fears that such a move could destabilise the system.        
	The RBI deputy governor said the US had to bear the brunt of such a deregulation in the mid 1980s as banks vied with each other to offer attractive rates and they had to subsequently invest in risky assets.        
	Bankers who support the idea of deregulation aver that freeing the savings bank rate may not necessarily lead to such a development as the players are now mature.        
	However, those who oppose the move feel that time has not yet come for the savings bank rate to be freed.         
	We have all kinds of players in our system. If the savings bank rate is deregulated, private and foreign banks may start offering very high rates which can impact the system, said a senior official with a leading nationalised bank.        
	The official added that any deregulation of the savings bank rate should be gradual and that it should come after there is complete liberalisation in the system.        
	Though the savings bank rate remains at 3.5 per cent, the central bank has been making some changes in the product. Recently, it decided that banks would have to calculate interest on a daily product basis.

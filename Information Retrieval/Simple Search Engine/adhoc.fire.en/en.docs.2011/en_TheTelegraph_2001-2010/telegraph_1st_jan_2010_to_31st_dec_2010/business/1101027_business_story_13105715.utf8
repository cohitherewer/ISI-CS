The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Japan pact to pinch local auto parts 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Japan pact to pinch local auto parts 
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Trade effect                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: Auto parts imports will become cheaper after India signs a trade pact with Japan, meaning stiff competition for the Rs 90,000-crore local industry.         
	India and Japan, during Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Tokyo, yesterday announced the conclusion of negotiations on the deal.        
	Under the agreement, Indias 10 per cent duty on Japanese fenders and mufflers will be dropped within 10 years, while the 5 per cent levies on hot-rolled and galvanized steel sheets will be abolished within five years. The tariff on diesel engines will fall to 6.25 per cent from 12.5 per cent over six years.        
	Tariff elimination on auto parts will help car makers to reduce the cost of procuring Japanese components. Cheaper imports of high-grade steel  used to make car bodies  are also likely to bring down prices.         
	Analysts said the move would help companies such as Toyota and Honda, who were likely to leverage the price advantage to expand in India. Toyota plans to import the engine and the transmission system for the Etios from Thailand or Japan.         
	With the cost of procuring components coming down, auto makers are likely to pass on the benefits to the customer, said Vaishali Jajoo, an expert with Angel Broking.        
	Maruti Suzuki, which imports a sizeable portion of its components from Japan, said the trade pact would not have a huge impact as it locally manufactured most of the items where duty and tariffs had been reduced.         
	The local auto parts industry said the pact could lead to an inverted duty structure in the long run.         
	The government needs to ensure that the inverted duty structure, wherein, raw material comes at a higher price vis--vis a finished product, is taken care of. Otherwise it will erode our competitiveness in the country, said the chief of a local component maker.        
	While welcoming the trade pact, the Auto Component Manufacturers Association (Acma) said such agreements should be mutually beneficial for both countries.         
	Trade pacts should be finalised with countries where the strength of Indian firms can also be harnessed, said Acma executive director Vinnie Mehta.        
	Toshiyuki Shiga, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said he hoped the agreement would help maintain the Japanese auto industrys brisk business in India.        
	Initial analyst estimates suggest that the pact will scale up bilateral trade by at least 50 per cent.

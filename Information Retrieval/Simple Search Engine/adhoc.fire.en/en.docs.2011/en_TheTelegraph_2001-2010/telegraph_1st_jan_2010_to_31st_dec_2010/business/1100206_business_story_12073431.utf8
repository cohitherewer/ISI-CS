          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 5: Calcutta High Court today allowed Harsh V. Lodha to step into his father late Rajendra S. Lodhas shoes in the legal battle with the Birla family over the control of the MP Birla empire.        
	The development will pave the way for a faster resolution of the probate proceedings on the will of the late Priyamvada Birla made in 1999, which bequeathed her estate to R.S. Lodha.        
	Lodha was both the executor and beneficiary of the will for which he sought probate in 2004 after the death of Priyamvada Birla. However, Lodha senior died in October 2008 while the proceedings were on. Harsh Lodha then appealed to the high court for making him the heir of his fathers legacy and be added to the case. The Birla family had opposed the move.        
	The hearings went on for almost a year till December, and Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta gave his judgment today.        
	I am happy. We can now go ahead with the evidences without losing significant time, Debanjan Mandal, partner of solicitor firm Fox and Mandal, which is representing the Lodhas, said.        
	If the court had ruled against him today, Lodha would have to seek probate afresh, which was not only time-consuming but also involved huge costs.        
	The Birla counsel, however, on the last day of the hearing had agreed to give a no-objection to Harsh Lodha. But Lodhas counsel demanded that the court give its judgment on the issue. Legal circles said such allowances were unusual. However, given the complexity of the case, the high court must have allowed Harsh to step into his fathers shoes, they added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sarma: Weighing options                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today said it had initiated fresh discussions on the pricing of 2G spectrum, meaning a minimum of six months will be required for the process to be over.        
	Industry experts and operators have been asked to give their views by June 15, and the regulator expects to complete the discussions by July 15. It will take another two months to prepare a new set of proposals and send the report to the department of telecom (DoT). The DoT will then send the recommendations to its policymaking arm Telecom Commission.         
	With Trai going back to the drawing board, operators are worried that they may not get fresh 2G spectrum in the next two years.         
	Moreover, since Trai has told the DoT that its entire 414-page recommendations should be read as an integral document, the other proposals relating to mergers and acquisitions and spectrum allocation to new players could also be put on hold        
	The telecom ministry has put a ban on the allocation of 2G spectrum to all operators till it finalises a pricing mechanism.        
	Have written to them (the DoT) that we will be carrying separate consultation process on 2G-3G price linking. I expect the government to take some time before finalising the proposals, Trai chairman J.S. Sarma said at the annual Infocom-CMAI National Telecom Award 2010.        
	Meanwhile, the DoT today formed a committee to examine the recommendations of the regulator on spectrum management and the licensing framework.        
	Trai had recently proposed that the price of 2G spectrum beyond 6.2 megahertz (Mhz) held by the operators should be linked to 3G auction prices.        
	Sarma, who met telecom operators today to discuss the proposals, said the regulator would not change its stand on pricing 2G spectrum beyond 6.2Mhz.        
	All operators expressed their views on the recent 2G allocation and pricing proposals. We have taken a note of them. We also explained to the operators that the proposals had been made as spectrum is a scarce resource and they should keep that fact in mind, said Sarma.        
	4G services        
	Trai today said it planned to bring out the recommendations on fourth-generation (4G) technology by the end of the year.        
	Sarma said Trai planned to bring out a consultation paper on 4G in the next two-three months. Before the year-end, we should be ready with recommendations on 4G. The fourth-generation telecom technology, known as ultrabroadband, offers download at a much faster speed and high definition video on demand, among other services.

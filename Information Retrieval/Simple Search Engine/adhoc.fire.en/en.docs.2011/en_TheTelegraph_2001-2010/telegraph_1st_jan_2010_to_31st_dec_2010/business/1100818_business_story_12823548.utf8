The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hint of WTO duel over visa fee
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Hint of WTO duel over visa fee
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RAHUL KHULLAR, commerce secretary                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: India considers the US work visa fee hike a protectionist move and could approach the World Trade Organisation.        
	If the US wishes to put up protectionist barriers to hurt itself, let them do it. But where a measure is specifically targeting my commercial interests I cannot keep quiet, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said.        
	We think this (visa fee hike) is WTO incompatible. I will take up the matter. The US cannot pass a law that clearly hurts Indias interests and then expect us to accommodate their commercial interests, Khullar told reporters when asked if India might drag the US to the WTO.        
	The fee hike is expected to cost IT outsourcing firms such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Technologies, Wipro and Mahindra Satyam about $200 million annually.         
	Official sources said the US law could be taken to the WTO for being totally discriminatory against Indian companies and people, adding that the amount of fee hike could also be challenged. They said India might talk to other affected countries such as China and the Philippines for collective action.        
	US President Barack Obama last week signed the controversial proposal to fund increased border security expenses by charging companies hiring from abroad, after US Congress cleared the hike.        
	Under the Emergency Border Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010  popularly called the Border Security Bill  the US has raised the fee for certain categories of H-1B and L1 visas by at least $2,000 for the next five years.        
	The US said the hike would help it to foot nearly $550 million of the proposed expenditure of $650 million to increase security along the US-Mexico border.        
	In a letter to US trade representative Ron Kirk last week, commerce minister Anand Sharma expressed serious concern, saying the bill would hurt companies of Indian origin.        
	Protesting the American move, Sharma wrote that the visa fee hike would cost Indian firms $200 million a year and make them less competitive.        
	Sharma and Khullar are likely to visit the US soon and may take up this issue. The US legislation comes ahead of an Indo-US trade policy forum meeting in September and Obamas scheduled visit to India in November.        
	Merchandise export        
	Merchandise exports grew 13.2 per cent in July to $16.24 billion, the slowest in six months, while imports rose 34.3 per cent to $29.17 billion, taking the trade gap to $12.93 billion.         
	The era of 30 per cent exports growth is over. As I said, we will have to be very circumspect about high exports growth in the early part of this fiscal. Things are not going to be easy. The second half is going to be tougher than the first half (of 2010-11). Exports may weaken in the coming months as the global economic recovery flounders, Khullar said.         
	He said exports in April-July were $68.6 billion, a 30.1 per cent growth, while imports grew 33.3 per cent to $112.2 billion, widening trade deficit to $43.6 billion. Sectors that did not perform well include leather, electronic goods, man-made fibre and textiles.        
	Exporters body Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo) said the government should give more incentives to the laggard sectors in the Foreign Trade Policy review, which is scheduled for August 23.         
	The government should bring sector specific packages for sectors such as apparel, leather and tea, which are not exhibiting growth, Fieo president A. Sakthivel said.

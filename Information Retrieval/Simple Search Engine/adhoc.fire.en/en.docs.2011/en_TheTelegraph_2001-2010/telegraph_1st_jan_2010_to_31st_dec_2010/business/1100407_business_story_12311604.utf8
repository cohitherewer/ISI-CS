	New Delhi, April 6: India today invited US investors to participate in its $600-billion infrastructure programme over the next five years, while Washington sought greater financial co-operation for global economic stability.        
	Immense opportunities are there for investment in the infrastructure sector. As much as $600 billion can be invested in ports, communications and roads in the next five years, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said addressing a joint press conference to announce the launch of the India-US financial and economic partnership.        
	The economic partnership will help strengthen bilateral engagement and understanding on financial sectors and infrastructure related issues.        
	Deepening our ties with India is critical to the broader global effort to develop a framework for strong and balanced growth and will facilitate more trade, investment and job creation in our two countries, US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner said.        
	His two-day visit, the first as treasury secretary, comes ahead of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to the US from Sunday for a nuclear security summit.        
	Analysts say, in principle, the two countries agree on everything but when it comes down to the nitty-gritty things get stuck as neither wants to give the other an inch.        
	While Washington lifted the ban on Indian mangoes after two decades of negotiations, India still faces legal opposition from US lawmakers while accessing nuclear technology and the two countries are at loggerheads over protecting the interest of their farmers at the WTO negotiations.        
	Geithner, who spent part of his childhood in India, said such cooperation would be critical for a stable global financial system, more balanced global economic growth that is less dependent on the willingness of Americans to live beyond our means...And, a more open global trading system.

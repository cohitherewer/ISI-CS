          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 19: ICE (information, communication and entertainment) stocks are hot again.         
	The initial public offering (IPO) of Pune-based Persistent Systems was today subscribed 93.6 times on its last day, making it the highest subscribed issue in a little over two years.        
	More recently, the initial public offering of DQ Entertainment, a niche media player, was subscribed more than 86 times.        
	As the IPO of Persistent Systems closed for subscription, data available from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) showed that as against the total issue size of 5,419,706 shares, the IPO received bids for 507,304,700 shares. This is the highest subscription that a new offering has seen in the past 26 months.         
	The price band for the IPO of Persistent Systems was fixed at Rs 290-310 per share.        
	The response to the offering was stunning from all quarters of investors with the QIB portion being subscribed 144 times, the non-institutional investors category being subscribed 108 times and the retail portion subscribed nearly 22 times.         
	Most of the bids have come in at the upper end of the price band at Rs 310 per share.        
	While market observers say the response to the IPO indicates investor interest in the ICE space, particularly those catering to niche segments, Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS, said the huge response to the issue was because of its good pricing.         
	The major criterion for an IPO investor is that he has to make money after the company is listed on the bourses. The lesson that the Persistent Systems IPO has given is that if a new offering is priced reasonably, it will get a good response, he said.         
	Persistent Systems, promoted by Anand Deshpande and S.P. Deshpande, is a software development company. It plans to use the proceeds from the offering to construct two development centres in Pune and Nagpur.         
	Crisil had assigned IPO Grade 4/5 to the offer, which indicates that the fundamentals of the issue are above average in relation to other listed equities in the country.

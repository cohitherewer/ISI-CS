          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 3: The Centres move to seek Parliaments approval for spending a net additional amount of around Rs 55,000 crore has had its impact on government securities with prices of the benchmark 10-year bond softening in intra-day trades.        
	The price of the 10-year bond price fell by 7 paise, reflecting concerns that the government could end up borrowing its entire budgeted component of Rs 4.57 trillion during the current fiscal.         
	While the Centre had earlier indicated its plans to borrow this amount, the good response to the recent 3G and broadband wireless auctions had kindled optimism on Bond Street that market borrowings might fall below Rs 4.57 trillion this year.        
	Government bonds have been under pressure in recent times because of fears that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may raise key rates again in September in its mid-quarter review. Yields on the benchmark 10-year security is now ruling at around 7.86 per cent.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Ashish Parthasarathy, treasurer at HDFC Bank, said the governments move to spend more is unlikely to make any impact on its borrowing programme for this year. The government has got more revenues from the 3G and broadband auctions than Budgeted and therefore the borrowing programme will not be impacted. The move will also not affect bond markets, he added.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          STYLE STATEMENT                                  
	New Delhi, March 22: BlackBerry maker Research in Motion (RIM) today launched its latest smartphone  BlackBerry Storm2  in India, priced at Rs 31,990.        
	Considered a threat to the Apple iPhone 3G Speed (3GS) version that will be launched later this week in the country, the Storm2 offers better features for a lesser price, say analysts.        
	The basic 16GB version of the iPhone 3GS is likely to be priced around Rs 33,000, while the 32GB version will be available for Rs 42,000.         
	For a lesser price, the Storm2 has 2GB memory but an expandable memory card slot that can support up to 32GB memory.        
	Unlike the iPhone, the Storm2 is capable of multitasking, allowing users to switch between several applications.         
	Analysts said the camera in Storm2 was better. Storm2 has a a 3.2megapixel camera with auto focus, flash and video recording facilities.        
	According to RIM, the touchscreen keypad of the new smartphone is like a clickable screen. Users can press the digital keys on the screen and feel them being pressed and released as in the case of a computer mouse.        
	Compared with the 140,000 applications of the Apple iPhone, BlackBerrys 5,000 appear scanty. However, all the applications are freely available and range from Facebook to games and office productivity tools.        
	The new BlackBerry Storm2 offers customers a powerful and unique mix of advanced communications and multimedia features in a smoothly designed smartphone that will appeal to both consumers and business professionals, said Frenny Bawa, managing director (India) of RIM.

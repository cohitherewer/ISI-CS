          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 23: High inflation and the opposition from UPA allies are likely to hold back a hike in diesel prices.        
	The food inflation data to be released tomorrow will be keenly watched by the empowered group of ministers, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. The eGoM will hold its second meeting on Friday to work out a solution for oil firms that are suffering huge losses for selling petroleum products below cost.        
	Sources said the eGoM could increase petrol prices by Rs 2-4 per litre. The hike will be a one-time increase as the group of ministers is still undecided about the deregulation of fuel prices.         
	However, diesel would be spared as a hike could further spike food prices.        
	The core inflation is now starting to get worrying, with price pressures becoming more pervasive. We are seeing it (inflation) happen in non-agricultural products. That is one area of worry that has to be tackled, chief statistician Pronab Sen said.        
	May inflation rose to 10.16 per cent from 9.59 per cent in April as food prices and certain manufactured items such as metals turned expensive.         
	Mukherjee in the US has said containing oil prices and fiscal deficit were the two major challenges before the Indian economy along with taming high inflation, currently running into double digits.

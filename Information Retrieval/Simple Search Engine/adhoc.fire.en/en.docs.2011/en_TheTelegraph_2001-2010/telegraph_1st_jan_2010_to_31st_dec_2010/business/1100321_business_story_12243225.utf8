          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Call connect                                  
	New Delhi, March 20: The board of Bharti Airtel today approved a plan to spend $9 billion to acquire the African assets of Kuwait-based Zain.        
	Bharti and Zain are in exclusive talks till March 25 to work out a deal that will give Indias largest wireless operator 42 million new subscribers in 15 African countries.         
	A final announcement is expected shortly.         
	The company did not comment on the outcome of the board meeting.        
	Bharti had twice failed in its attempt to buy out Africas largest operator MTN.         
	Talks floundered after the South African government refused to agree to the proposed deal structure.        
	Sources said Bharti might ask Zain to provide legal protection against an ownership dispute in Nigeria.         
	Econet Wireless Holdings, based in a suburb of Johannesburg, is contending Zains plan to sell its 65 per cent stake in the Nigerian operations to Bharti.        
	The Nigerian unit generated about 21 per cent of Zains total earnings and about 22 per cent of its total sales in 2008.         
	Bharti has said the Nigeria dispute is a sellers issue.         
	Standard Chartered Bank has been appointed sole banker to the Bharti-Zain deal as it has a great deal of exposure in Africa.         
	There has been no agreement or settlement in the dispute over the Nigerian unit. So, Bhartis plan cannot include the purchase of Zains Nigeria unit, Strive Masiyiwa, chief executive officer of Econet, had earlier said.

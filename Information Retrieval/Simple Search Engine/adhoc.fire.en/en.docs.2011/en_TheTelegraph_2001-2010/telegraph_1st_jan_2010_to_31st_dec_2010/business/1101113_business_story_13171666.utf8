          SEWELL CHAN AMP; SHERYL GAY STOLBERG                          US President Barack Obama shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao at the G20 summit in Seoul on Friday. (AP)                                  
	Seoul, Nov. 12: Leaders of the worlds biggest economies agreed on Friday to curb persistently large imbalances in saving and spending but deferred until next year tough decisions on how to identify and fix them.         
	The agreement, the culmination of a two-day summit meeting of the leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) industrialised and emerging powers, fell short of initial American demands for numerical targets on trade surpluses and deficits. But it reflected a consensus that longstanding economic patterns  in particular, the US consuming too much, and China too little  were no longer sustainable.         
	US President Barack Obama called the agreement significant, even if not as dramatic or far-reaching as the one that emerged from the first G20 leaders meeting in 2008, when nations came together amid fears of a global meltdown. Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes were going to hit singles, Obama said. But theyre important singles.         
	The measured language on imbalances reflected the clout of China, which successfully resisted pressure for its currency to appreciate quickly, and Germany, which insisted that an examination of imbalances include fiscal, monetary and other policies, not just trade.         
	Chinas president, Hu Jintao, pledged to shift the Chinese economy away from reliance on exports and towards domestic consumption  a strategy urged by the US and most economists. Obama said he had raised Chinas exchange-rate policy with Hu and that we will closely watch the appreciation of Chinas currency.         
	Obama, who had brought a trade-driven agenda to his 10-day trip to Asia but occasionally found his priorities frustrated by global disagreement, warned, No nation should assume that their path to prosperity is paved simply with exports to the US. He also used some of his strongest language to date on Chinas role in the world economy, making it clear that he expected Beijing to assume part of the burden of leadership.         
	Because of Chinas success, its important that it acts in a responsible fashion internationally, he said. And the issue of the renminbi is one that is an irritant not just to the US, but to a lot of Chinas trading partners and those who are competing with it to sell goods around the world. It is undervalued. And China spends enormous amounts of money intervening in the market to keep it undervalued.         
	Obama acknowledged that China would move in a gradual fashion and expressed hope that a visit by Hu to Washington in January would yield progress. We understand that this is not solved overnight, Obama said. But it needs to be dealt with and Im confident that it can be.         
	The G20 leaders largely endorsed an approach to imbalances that finance ministers, including US treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner, hammered out last month at a meeting in Gyeongju, South Korea, but added a timetable.

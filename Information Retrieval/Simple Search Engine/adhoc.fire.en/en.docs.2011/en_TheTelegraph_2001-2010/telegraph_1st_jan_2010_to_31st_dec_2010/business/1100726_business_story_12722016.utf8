The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | To be an NRI
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      To be an NRI
                                If someone leaves India in November 2009 to work abroad, does he need to pay tax on the salary earned abroad during the financial year 2009-2010?          Mridul Sinha, Midnapore
                    To be a non-resident Indian, you should be out of India for more than 180 days in a financial year. You are not an NRI. You need not pay the tax in India on income earned abroad, provided you have paid the income tax abroad and the country you have gone has a double taxation avoidance agreement with India. However if you are staying for more than 180 days in 2010-11, you will become an NRI. In that case, open an NRI account in India and send the money here. It will be tax-free and the interest earned on the NRI account will also be tax-free.                                  Form query      Can I submit Form 15H to my bank after the first quarter of a financial year?        Ranajoy Banerjee, Howrah
                    Yes, you can. But in that case the bank will not deduct tax at source on your interest income only for the following nine months. The bank will, however, deduct the tax for the first quarter since it has not received Form 15H from you.                                  PF puzzle      I had worked in a company for four years and six months. It has been more than five years since my provident fund was being deposited. If I apply for withdrawal from the previous employer, will it be subject to tax?         Ashim Gupta, Calcutta
                    The five-year period is considered from the perspective of continuous employment. If you left the job before completing five years but joined a new employer and got your existing PF amount transferred to the new employer, then the tenure with the new employer is also counted in the five years of continuous employment. If not, the amount in the PF account is taxable. The taxability will be as follows: Your contribution to PF: Not taxable; Interest on the PF contribution: Taxable as income from other sources. Employers contribution and interest: Taxable under the head salaries. You will get tax relief under Section 89(1).

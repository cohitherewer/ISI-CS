          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Aug. 31: HDFC, the countrys largest home loan financier, today raised its prime lending rate by 50 basis points to 14.25 per cent from tomorrow.        
	This (the hike) is in line with the current rates of interest in the economy, which have hardened in the last few months because of rising inflation and tightening of liquidity in the domestic market, HDFC said in a statement.        
	The hike will increase the equated monthly instalments of its existing borrowers.         
	A host of banks, including the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and the Union Bank of India, have hiked their benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by up to 50 basis points after the Reserve Bank raised the repo rate by 25 basis points and the reverse repo by half a percentage point to 5.75 per cent and 4.50 per cent, respectively, in July.         
	The hike will increase the instalments of borrowers, who have loans on floating rates, as interest on these loans is linked to the benchmark rate.         
	Though banks are disbursing loans under the new base rate regime, a significant part of their existing loans is linked to their BPLRs.         
	Sources said the PLR hike would also affect the new borrowers of HDFC. New borrowers will have to pay an interest rate of 9.25 per cent for loans up to Rs 30 lakh, 9.50 per cent for loans between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 50 lakh, and 9.75 per cent for loans over Rs 50 lakh.         
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the HDFC scrip closed at Rs 625.15, down 0.45 per cent over its previous close of Rs 628.

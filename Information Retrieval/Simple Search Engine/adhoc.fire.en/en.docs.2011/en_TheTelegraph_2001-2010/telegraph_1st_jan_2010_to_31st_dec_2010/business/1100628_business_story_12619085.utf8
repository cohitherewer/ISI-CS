	New Delhi, June 27: State-owned refiner Indian Oil Corporation plans to launch a follow-on public offer (FPO) by the end of this year after the government allowed free market pricing of petrol and a partial deregulation of diesel.        
	The governments decision to allow free market pricing has encouraged us to look at the FPO plan. The FPO will provide the required cash for different projects and expansion, a senior IOC official said. The government owns 80.35 per cent in IOC, and a follow-on offer of up to 10 per cent by the end of the year may be considered, sources said.         
	However, the final decision and timing will depend on many factors such as the market condition, subsidy sharing mechanism and full freedom in diesel pricing. The petroleum ministry will also have to clear the proposal.        
	According to an official, free market pricing will lead to a transparent mechanism, resulting in a better evaluation of the firm. If fuel prices are deregulated, we can consider an FPO, S.V. Narasimhan, director (finance), had earlier said.        
	Deepak Pareek, an analyst with Angel Broking, said, The refiners plan to hit the market with an FPO will depend on the subsidy sharing formula that the government will work out. It will keenly watch that before taking a call.        
	A subsidy mechanism is required because oil retailers sell diesel, petrol and LPG at prices below costs.        
	IOC  the countrys largest retailer  is betting big on the follow-on offer to raise funds for its expansion plans.         
	It has earmarked Rs 13,000 crore as capital expenditure for the current fiscal and plans to invest Rs 13,000-14,000 crore annually over the next few years.        
	The maharatna firm had reported a 246 per cent jump in net profit for 2009-10. Net profit rose to Rs 10,220.55 crore in 2009-10 from Rs 2,949.55 crore in the previous year.        
	The government will also be eager on the flotation following concerns that the divestment department may not be able to raise the targeted Rs 40,000 crore this fiscal because of a volatile equity market.        
	Moreover, the FPO will allow the refiner to comply with the finance ministrys norm of listed firms having 25 per cent of their stakes with the public.        
	It is only natural that the government needs to embark on the path of divestment to raise funds and increase the public float of the stocks of national oil companies, analysts said.        
	IOC operates eight refineries with a total capacity of around 50 million tonnes per annum. The company controls nearly 55 per cent market share in retail sales of petroleum products.        
	The firm is a leading producer of downstream petrochemicals such as linear alkyl benzene and purified terephthalic acid. It has recently started a 1.5-million-tonne naphtha cracker and downstream units to produce polyethylene and polypropylene at Panipat, Orissa.

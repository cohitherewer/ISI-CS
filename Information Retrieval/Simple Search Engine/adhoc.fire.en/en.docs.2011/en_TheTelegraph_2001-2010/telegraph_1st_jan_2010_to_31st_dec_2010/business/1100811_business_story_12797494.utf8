          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Object of desire                                
	Calcutta, Aug. 10: Indian entities Mahindra amp; Mahindra and Pawan Ruias Raghav Industries along with Young An of Korea are the final bidders for troubled Korean SUV maker SsangYong.        
	The deadline for submitting the final bid ended today and three of the six shortlisted companies remained in the fray; the rest, including Renault-Nissan, stayed away.        
	SsangYongs administrator, which is conducting the sale process, where the winner will be offered a 51 per cent stake, is likely to announce the result within a week.        
	Sources said both the Indian companies had bid aggressively, and the competition could be restricted between them.        
	Besides Renault-Nissan, Korean private equity fund Seoul Invest and an unidentified bidder did not submit the final bid for SsangYong, which has been under court-led bankruptcy protection since early 2009. The shortlisted six had placed initial bids in June.        
	Valuation game        
	Industry observers say bidders may have to stump up between $340 million and $430 million to acquire a majority stake in the cash-strapped firm, though SsangYong may seek around $650 million, the amount it owes to financial firms and subcontractors.         
	The current market capitalisation of SsangYong is $400 million.         
	The bids are likely to be complex where firms may seek to fork out cash both to buy equity and reduce debt.        
	Some of the bidders may ask creditors to take a cut in their exposure and demand a write-off of equities to make the company viable in the long run.        
	Pawan K. Ruia, chairman of Ruia Group, had last week said factors such as future cash flow, profitability and SsangYongs ability to withstand competition would eventually determine his bid price.        
	Ruia had visited the SsangYong plant earlier this month, where the management made a presentation to him.         
	SsangYong Motor, which has a 2 per cent market share in Korea, suffered severe cash flow problems because of a slump in sales before being placed in bankruptcy protection. Some bidders feel the company can be a $3-4 billion enterprise in the next three to four years.

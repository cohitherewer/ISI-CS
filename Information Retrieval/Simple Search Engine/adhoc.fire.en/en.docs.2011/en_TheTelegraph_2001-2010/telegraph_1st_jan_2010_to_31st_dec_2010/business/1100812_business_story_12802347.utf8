          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: Bharti Airtel today reported a 32 per cent drop in first-quarter net profit and announced plans to acquire Telecom Seychelles for about Rs 288 crore.        
	Net profit for the April-June quarter tumbled to Rs 1,682 crore from Rs 2,475 crore a year earlier as a price war among operators continued to hurt margins. The results are based on international financial accounting standards.        
	On the Telecom Seychelles buyout, Manoj Kohli, CEO (international) and joint MD of Bharti Airtel, said: The board of directors has approved the acquisition deal today morning.        
	The acquisition comes on the heels of Bharti taking over Zain Telecoms Africa assets for $10.7 billion in June. Zain Africa has operations in 15 countries.        
	With Telecom Seychelles, Bharti Airtel will expand its African footprint to 16 countries and its overall presence to 19 nations.         
	Apart from India and Africa, the company is present in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.        
	Revenue per user        
	Bharti Airtel saw its ARPU (average revenue per user) drop 23 per cent to Rs 215 in the reporting quarter from last year. Average rate per minute was down 23 per cent to Rs 0.45, while the average minutes per user remained steady from last year at 480 minutes.        
	The company had a net debt of Rs 60,200 crore at the end of the quarter, which included loans raised for the acquisition in Africa and for the 3G auction.        
	Revenues increased 17 per cent during the quarter to Rs 12,230 crore. Revenue figures include those from the African operations for 23 days starting June 8.

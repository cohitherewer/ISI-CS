	New Delhi, April 14: Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE is trying to localise its identity. The firm wants to be known as an Indian company with headquarters in China.        
	ZTE is increasing its intake of local talent, training Indian engineers to become global experts and hiking investments in its domestic research and development base.        
	Local competence is essential to address local requirements. India is an important market and we aim to create value for the ecosystem by continuous knowledge transfer in the Indian market, D.K. Ghosh, chairman and managing director of ZTE India, told The Telegraph.        
	In 2009, ZTE had hired 1,000 engineers in India. For 2010, hiring will be of a similar size. Eventually, we plan to reduce Chinese employees in India to 2-3 per cent of the total workforce, he said.        
	The company plans to train 314 product experts in the 2G and 3G domain during the first half of this year for its engineering centre.        
	ZTE, which started its Indian operations in 1999, had 2,300 employees across its Gurgaon, Mumbai, Bangalore and Calcutta centres by the end of 2009. Local people made up 87 per cent of the total workforce here.         
	Chinese telecom equipment makers have often come under the lens of Indian security agencies.         
	The department of telecom (DoT) had recently issued a directive asking all telecom service providers to get a security clearance before placing any order to procure equipment or software from foreign companies.         
	The directive was issued after security agencies expressed concern that foreign vendors could embed spyware into telecom networks sold by them, which could then be used by hostile countries to snoop on Indias communication set-up.        
	Though the directive applies to all foreign equipment makers, industry players admit that supplies from Chinese vendors such as Huawei and ZTE are undergoing extra scrutiny.

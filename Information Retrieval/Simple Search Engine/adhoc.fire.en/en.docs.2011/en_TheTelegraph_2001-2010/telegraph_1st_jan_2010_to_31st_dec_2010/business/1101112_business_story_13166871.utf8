The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Britannia to delist from CSE
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Britannia to delist from CSE
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 11: Confectionery maker Britannia has decided to delist from the Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE), raising doubts about its game plan in Bengal.        
	The board of directors has approved the delisting proposal in a meeting yesterday, Britannia said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange. It, however, will remain listed on the BSE and the NSE.        
	Though trading volume on the CSE has been low, many companies, especially those registered in Calcutta, remain listed.        
	The Nusli Wadia-owned company has its registered office in the city where annual general meetings are held. The corporate office is in Bangalore.        
	Britannia also has a manufacturing facility at Taratala.         
	In October last year, Britannia had received an eviction order from the Calcutta Port Trust following a rent dispute. The company had moved court, but little progress was made.        
	The delisting sparks concern that the company may move its registered office and eventually close the manufacturing plant here.        
	Britannia had asked workers at the Taratala factory to take voluntary retirement to cut down on production.

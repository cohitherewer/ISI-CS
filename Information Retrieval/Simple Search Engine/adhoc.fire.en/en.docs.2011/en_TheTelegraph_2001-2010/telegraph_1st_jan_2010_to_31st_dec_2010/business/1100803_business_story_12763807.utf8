          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: The Lok Sabha today approved a bill to reduce the governments holding in the State Bank of India (SBI) to 51 per cent from 55 per cent, which would arm the countrys largest bank with greater fund-raising powers.        
	The public sector character of the SBI will not be diluted. The bill aims to provide flexibility in the management of the bank, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said while introducing the amendment bill.         
	The Left parties were against this bill.        
	The SBI (Amendment) Bill 2010, which seeks to raise the authorised capital of the bank from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 5,000 crore, will enable the bank to split its shares and undertake preferential or private placements for future capital requirements, provided the government holding does not fall below 51 per cent.         
	Under the new law, the SBI will be allowed to issue bonus shares to existing shareholders. The government holds a 59.41 per cent stake in the bank.         
	Responding to queries, Mukherjee said the banking sector survived the financial meltdown as the regulatory mechanism was strong.        
	Earlier, the SBI could access the capital market by issuing equity shares or bonds, but there was no provision under which it could issue preference or bonus shares.        
	The SBI Act, 1955, was amended in 1993 to allow it to tap the capital market.         
	The bill will also empower the government to appoint up to four managing directors, abolish the post of vice-chairman and enable shareholders owning shares worth at least Rs 5,000 to contest the election for the post of a director.        
	The UPA government, during its first term, had introduced the bill in December 2006.         
	The bill was referred to a parliamentary standing committee, but lapsed after the dissolution of the House.         
	The present bill, which will now go to the Rajya Sabha, is on the same lines as the lapsed one but incorporates some recommendations of the standing committee.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had said the bank would have to raise about Rs 40,000-50,000 crore over the next five years to meet its credit need.

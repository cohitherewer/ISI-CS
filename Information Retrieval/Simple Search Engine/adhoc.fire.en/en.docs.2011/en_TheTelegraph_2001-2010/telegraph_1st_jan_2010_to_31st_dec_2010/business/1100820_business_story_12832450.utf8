The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Intel to acquire McAfee 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Intel to acquire McAfee

	San Francisco, Aug. 19: Intel has agreed to acquire McAfee, the computer antivirus software maker, for $7.68 billion in cash.         
	Under the terms of the deal, Intel will pay $48 a share, a 60 per cent premium over McAfees Wednesday closing stock price of $29.93.         
	The deal makes Intel a major player in the security software and services market. As such, Intel will shed some of its identity as a component supplier and climb higher up the technology food chain.         
	Intel expects the market for security technology to grow as electronic gadgets, cars and home appliances increase their computing power and tap into the Internet.         
	Analysts expect many of the tools that McAfee provides today to be built-in to chips and devices over time.         
	Eventually the software features will get embedded in the hardware, said Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst with Rodman amp; Renshaw.        
	According to Intels chief executive Paul S. Otellini, With the rapid expansion of growth across a vast array of Internet-connected devices, more and more of the elements of our lives have moved online. In the past, energy-efficient performance and connectivity have defined computing requirements. Looking forward, security will join those as a third pillar of what people demand from all computing experiences.         
	Intel, the worlds largest chip maker, has posted good results in recent quarters on rising sales of personal computers to both consumers and businesses and the expanded use of servers and data centres. After its most recent quarter, Intel had about $12.2 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand.         
	The companys efforts to put new flavours of lower-power chips into smartphones, television sets, cars and other devices have been slow. As a result, investors have been reluctant to view Intel as a growth bet.        
	The companys share price has fallen about 20 per cent in the last five years, closing at $19.59 a share on Wednesday.         
	Intel, however, has been bulking up its software arsenal. Last year, it bought Wind River for $884 million, giving it a software maker with a presence in the consumer electronics and wireless markets.         
	McAfee sells antivirus software to consumers and businesses and a suite of security products and services to corporations.                     NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

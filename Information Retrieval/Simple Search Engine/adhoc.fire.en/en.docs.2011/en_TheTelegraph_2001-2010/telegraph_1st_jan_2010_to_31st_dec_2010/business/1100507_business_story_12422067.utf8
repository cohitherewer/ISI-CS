          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, May 6: The ministry of corporate affairs has upped its ante to weed out defunct companies.         
	Firms that are no longer in operation but are still on the rolls of the registrar of companies (RoC) are identified as defunct.        
	The plan is to come out with an amnesty scheme under which firms that have failed to file their annual returns and balance sheets with the RoC for the last two years will be allowed to do so and carry on with their business.         
	While companies that are in business will get a final chance to comply with the rules, the non-operational ones can opt for de-registration under the amnesty plan.        
	An annual return provides basic information about a company such as its board of directors, activities and income, while a balance sheet is a detailed account of a companys financial position.        
	Under the companies act, it is mandatory for companies to provide these information to the RoC.        
	The scheme basically aims at weeding out the defunct companies, a senior ministry official said.         
	Among the eight lakh companies, about 6,50,000 are operational and the remaining 1,50,000 are defunct.         
	Around half of the eight lakh firms registered in India at the end of 2008-09 did not submit their annual accounts.         
	Union corporate affairs minister Salman Khurshid had earlier told the Lok Sabha that 370,196 firms did not file their balance sheets and 371,110 companies did not submit their annual returns for 2008-09 and before.         
	Filing of annual returns and balance sheets for a financial year is due after the succeeding financial year.        
	According to the official, a new company can provide the necessary document after 18 months of being incorporated under the companies act.        
	Any wilful default attracts a lump sum fine of Rs 5,000 and a penalty of Rs 500 per day for the number of days delayed from the due date of filing the returns, the official said.        
	However, the amnesty scheme will not be available to all firms. It will be only for those that have not filed their returns and balance sheets for the last two years. It will be a kind of giving them the last chance to comply with the requirement or face stiff legal procedures, he added.        
	The scheme, likely to be introduced in June-July, will provide for a one-time settlement for companies that have not filed the required information.         
	The filing of returns for 2009-10 is not yet due.         
	Every year RoCs initiate legal proceedings against defaulting companies.         
	In the last three years, courts had handed out penalties worth Rs 2.5 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Euro doubt spoils April export show
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Euro doubt spoils April export show

	New Delhi, June 1: Exports grew 36 per cent in April to $16.9 billion, but the European debt crisis has dampened the mood.         
	A falling euro has already hit leather firms, and exporters fear textiles, handicrafts and gems and jewellery are the next in line.         
	We are cautiously watching the situation as more than 60 per cent of our trading are in Europe. Italy is our biggest market, Habib Hussain, chairman of the Council for Leather Exporters, told The Telegraph.        
	He said, The euro has fallen more than 15 per cent in the last three months and will affect those traders badly who have not hedged the currency. Six week from now, the negotiations will start for the fall season, but I doubt we can bargain hard on pricing.        
	Hussain said the sector, which was hit by the global financial crisis, had huge order books for July-September. However, the surge in orders has pushed up the raw material cost as well.        
	The traditional sectors such as leather, textile and gems and jewellery will be impacted if the crisis spreads to Europe. We have to wait and watch the situation, Ajay Sahai, director-general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo), said.        
	The jump in exports over the past couple of months can be partly attributed to a low base effect. There are concerns that the ongoing debt crisis in the euro zone could dampen demand, analysts said.        
	This is the sixth consecutive month of export growth after 13 straight months of decline. Exports dropped 4.7 per cent in 2009-10 as global recession hurt demand.        
	During April, imports grew 43.3 per cent to $27.31 billion, and the trade deficit stood at $10.4 billion against $6.65 billion a year ago.        
	Oil imports grew 70.5 per cent to $8 billion in April against $4.7 billion in the corresponding period last year. Non-oil imports increased 34.3 per cent to $19.2 billion from $14.3 billion.        
	Exports are rising because of a revival in global economic conditions and also because they grew at a slower pace last year. We cannot say we are back to normal as the global economic situation remains uncertain because of developments in Europe, N. R. Bhanumurthy, economist with the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said.        
	Fieo president A. Sakthivel said the figure gave a clear indication that the country would be able to meet the export target of $200 billion for 2010-11. However, we need to regularly review our strategy in view of the recent setback in the euro zone and hope the crisis will not spread further, he said.

	Hyderabad, July 24: The trial in the Satyam fraud case is set to begin on Monday.        
	B.V.L.N. Chakravarti, the 21st additional chief metropolitan magistrate, declared on Friday that he would start the trial despite all legal objections raised by the accused.        
	As a first step we will frame charges on all accused. They will be questioned in the court directly, except for B. Ramalinga Raju. We will send a questionnaire to Raju at the hospital where he is admitted, said the judge.        
	Raju, the prime accused in the case, is not attending court proceedings since September last year.         
	A questionnaire will be served to him at NIMS hospital on July 26, while the remaining nine accused would be questioned in court. All the nine were released on bail, including B. Rama Raju, Vadlamani Srinivas and other auditors.        
	On Friday, the magistrate also dismissed the application of Srisailam to hear the accused before charges were framed. The petitions filed by Srisailam and Suryanarayana Raju, brother of Ramalinga Raju, seeking to discharge them from the case will be discussed on July 26.         
	Apart from the CBI case, the enforcement directorate, the corporate affairs authorities along with Sebi and the US stock exchange commission have lodged cases against the accused in the Satyam scam.

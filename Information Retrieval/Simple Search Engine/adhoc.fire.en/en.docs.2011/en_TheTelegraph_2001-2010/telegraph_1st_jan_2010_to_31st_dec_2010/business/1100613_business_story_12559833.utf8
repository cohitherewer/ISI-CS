	FM pins hopes on growth pace  
	Our Special Correspondent  
	Calcutta, June 12: India will achieve a double-digit GDP growth rate by the end of the Eleventh Plan if the current growth momentum continues, said finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.   
	Inaugurating operations at 15 branches of Yes Bank, Mukherjee said he was happy with the 17.6 per cent growth in the index of industrial production in April. I would have been happier had it been 20 per cent. My appetite for growth is infinite. If the current growth momentum continues, well achieve a double-digit growth by the end of the Eleventh Plan period, the finance minister said.  
	Mukherjee, however, admitted that the spiralling inflation was a matter of concern and the government had already taken supply side measures to ease price pressure.

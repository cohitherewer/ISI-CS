                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ICICI sets 25:118 swap for BoR merger 
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Mumbai, May 23: ICICI Bank today announced the merger of Bank of Rajasthan (BoR) with itself through a share-swap non-cash deal, which values BoR at about Rs 3,000 crore.        
	Under the terms of the merger, 25 ICICI Bank shares will be exchanged for every 118 BoR shares.         
	The BoR promoters, the Tayals, will not get a board seat in the amalgamated entity.         
	After the approval of the deal by the boards of the two banks, Kochhar said, It is a win-win situation for shareholders. Just by diluting 3 per cent of our equity, we will get BoR and it will expand our network by one fourth.         
	The present ICICI board will continue as it is, she said, adding that the deal works out to about Rs 3,000 crore but there is no cash outgo.         
	The BoR share prices had nearly doubled in the last four trading sessions after the two lenders agreed in principle to the merger.         
	ICICI Bank shareholders approval to the deal will be obtained at an extraordinary general meeting on June 21.         
	After this, we will move the Reserve Bank of India for its approval, she said.         
	BoR director K.N. Bhandari said the employees of the bank would not be adversely affected by the merger and there would be no job losses.                                                               
	BoRs dominant shareholder Pravin Tayal, who had yesterday sought one ICICI share for every three held by BoR shareholders, said, I respect the amalgamation scheme decided by the board.                                                                          
	BoRs dominant shareholder Pravin Tayal, who was asked by the RBI to dilute the familys over 55 per cent equity to about 10 per cent, said no decision had been taken on his representation in ICICI after the merger.              
	Tayal, who had yesterday sought one ICICI share for every three held by BoR shareholders, said, I respect the amalgamation scheme decided by the board.               
	The two sides had jointly appointed Haribhakti and Company for valuation, Kochhar said, adding that ICICI Bank had sought internal valuation through Deloitte.         
	On BoR employees, Kochhar said We will be fair. We have always been fair. We have the experience of two earlier mergers and have not retrenched anyone.         
	ICICI will have a rational approach and everybodys interest will be protected, she said but declined to say whether some in BoR could lose their jobs. The last acquisition by ICICI was that of a regional lender Sangli Bank.         
	Kochhar said, It is one of the high points of my career. I would not say we are aggressive but expansion and growth was always at the core of our strategy. She said the proposed merger would substantially enhance ICICI Banks branch network, already the largest among the Indian private sector banks, and strengthen its presence in northern and western India.         
	The BoR has 463 branches and the amalgamation would push up the number to about 2,500. Post-merger, the total business of ICICI Bank will cross Rs 4 lakh crore.         
	Growth focus         
	ICICI Bank today said it was not interested in overseas buyouts and wanted to focus on remaining one of the top players in terms of profitability and productivity.         
	No overseas (acquisition). We are not looking at any prospect (abroad). Internally, our growth strategy is quite India-linked. We are doing just one prospect. I think it is too early to talk of any other prospect, Kochhar said when asked which domestic or overseas prospects are in its radar.         
	Whether the latest deal will help her achieve the dream of making ICICI the top bank ahead of the State Bank of India, she said, The No. 1 position could be in many ways such as productivity, efficiency and profitability.         
	We are the No. 1 in many of these parameters. Clearly, profits will be a key area for our operation, she said, adding that BoR would help ICICI not only in terms of branch expansion by 25 per cent but also great visibility in western and northern parts of the country.                                             
	Normally it takes three to four years in terms of branch expansion of this size and BoR has given the ICICI Bank the surge, she said. It is a strategic move for us. The amalgamation gives wide network and reach in northern and western India, where our network was smaller compared with the southern states.         
	On whether it was the best movement in her 25-year career and as the head of Indias largest private sector bank, whose reins she took last year from her mentor K.V. Kamath, she said, In my long stint as a banker every achievement one could describe as the best movement... yes it certainly is one of the high points of my career.         
	Asked whether ICICI has once again adopted the aggressive approach in expanding through acquisition, she said, I would like to distinguish between the term aggression and growth. Of course, we are a growth-oriented bank that does not mean that we need to be aggressive. A sound sustainable profitable growth is what we are looking at.         
	Elaborating on the deal after approval of ICICI Bank board this afternoon, Kochhar said, I will say that we are living in the growth-oriented economy and branches are very critical for us. Every deal has to make sense by itself and this deal makes a lot of sense.                          
	According to our legal advice, we do not need to go to the government for the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.

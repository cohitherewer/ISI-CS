The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ruia in race for SsangYong Motor
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ruia in race for SsangYong Motor
          SOUNAK MITRA                                            
	Calcutta, May 20: Dunlop owner Pawan Kumar Ruia has bid for bankrupt SsangYong Motor of South Korea.         
	According to sources, Ruia is ready to pay up to $500 million for the Korean company. SsangYong, being recast following an order from the Seoul Central District Court last year, is looking for a buyer to stay afloat with fresh capital.         
	Indias Mahindra amp; Mahindra, SM Aluminum and Seoul Investments of South Korea are also learnt to be in the race for SsangYong.        
	Chinas SAIC Motor Corporation owns about 10 per cent in SsangYong. About 70 per cent are held by creditors, led by state-owned Korea Development Bank. Their debt has been converted into shares. The sale process was kicked off last week by the Seoul court. The deadline for submitting a letter of intent is May 28. SsangYong is expected to select a preferred bidder in August.        
	We are exploring a good number of acquisitions globally. We are not denying, but cant confirm any specific deal until its finalised, an official of the Ruia group told The Telegraph.         
	It is also learnt that a top-level official of the Ruia group is in Korea for specific discussions on a possible deal. When contacted, SsangYong officials declined to comment.        
	PricewaterhouseCoopers is advising Ruia, while KPMG and Macquarie are the Korean companys consultants.        
	Ruia in December had acquired German auto component firm Henniges Automotive Grefrath. A year ago, the group had bought Schlegel Automotive Europe of the UK. Henniges has Audi, BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler as its clients. If the SsangYong deal clicks, the Ruia group will be able to enter automobile manufacturing. Like in the earlier deals, Ruia may set up a special purpose vehicle for SsangYong.        
	In 2004, SAIC bought into SsangYong to become the top shareholder with a 51 per cent stake. However, it failed to turn around the Korean company that manufactures the Rexton and the Kyron SUVs and the Chairman sedan. SAIC has now reduced its stake in SsangYong to nearly 10 per cent after a capital writedown last year.        
	Shares of SsangYong, which had a market value of 413.6 billion won ($365 million) when the sale process commenced last week, have dropped 50 per cent since late last year on concerns about a further capital writedown.        
	SsangYong cut operating losses to 25.8 billion won ($22.7 million) in the first quarter of 2010 and forecast a strong profit growth for the second quarter on the back of improving sales. The companys car sales more than doubled last month, and it expects record sales this month. SsangYong entered bankruptcy protection in February after SAIC decided to withdraw from the company.        
	The company went through a restructuring last year, laying off 2,646 workers, or 36 per cent of its workforce. It now has about 4,821 workers.

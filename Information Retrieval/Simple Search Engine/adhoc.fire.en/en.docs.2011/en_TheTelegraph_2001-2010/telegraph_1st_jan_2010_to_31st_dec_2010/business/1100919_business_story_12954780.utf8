          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Partha S. Bhattacharyya in Calcutta on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: Coal India has proposed a public-private partnership (PPP) model for the acquisition and development of coal mines abroad.        
	Partha S. Bhattacharyya, chairman of CIL, said Indian companies should try to buy overseas mines on a war footing.        
	There should be PPP with people such as the Tatas or the Jindals, he said at the MGMI seminar in Calcutta today.        
	Bhattacharyya said some private companies had approached CIL to participate in their overseas projects.        
	They want us to buy some equity, he said.        
	The CIL chairman said many of the projects were big in size and there was scope for co-operation. There could be more than one player if the target is $3-4 billion, he said.        
	CIL is part of International Coal Ventures, a special purpose vehicle constituted by five public sector companies, to acquire coal mines abroad.         
	However, the chairman suggested that a joint venture with private companies could be done outside the purview of ICVL.        
	Bhattacharyya said ICVL had lost out in a bid recently for $40 million. But some more due diligence is going on, he said.        
	SAIL chairman C.S. Verma said there are four proposals on the table right now for ICVL. We have made two non-binding bids. A team is being sent to evaluate one of the proposals. In another case, we are examining data, Verma said.        
	Out of the four, one is an operational mine while the rest are mining leases.        
	ICVL is mainly looking at coking coal mines as steel companies such as SAIL, RINL and NMDC are part of it.        
	CIL is also looking at thermal coal assets. The coal industry is unable to keep pace with demand as the power sector enters an era of rapid growth, Bhattacharyya said.        
	Coal import is set to reach 80 million tonnes this year compared with 49 million tonnes in 2007-08. Going by this rate, Indias import could inch up to 200 million tonnes by 2015-16. That will constitute around 25 per cent of the global sea borne trade of coal and also impact prices.

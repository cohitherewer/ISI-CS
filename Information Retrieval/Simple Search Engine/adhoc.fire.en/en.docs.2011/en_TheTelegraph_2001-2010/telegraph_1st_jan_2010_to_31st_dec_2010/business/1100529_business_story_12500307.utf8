The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | StanChart IDR pulls through
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      StanChart IDR pulls through
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 28: Standard Chartered Plcs Indian depository receipt (IDR) issue was subscribed 2.2 times today, dispelling concerns that loomed yesterday when it had managed to secure bids for just 11 per cent of the 20.4 crore IDRs on offer.        
	This is the first time that a desi variant of the American depositary right is being floated in the country.        
	StanChart is expected to raise about $500 million, or just over Rs 2,200 crore from the flotation.        
	Retail investors showed little interest in the issue after analysts predicted limited upside gains on listing and qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) had to step in to bail out the faltering issue.        
	The QIB subscription was 4.14 times the total IDRs allocated for the category amounting to 348 million shares. Non-institutional investors, including corporate houses bid 1.9 times, or 82 million shares. Retail individual investors bid 0.25 times, or 18.2 million shares.         
	Bids poured in only on Friday afternoon as investors and funds waited for the final hours owing to a new Sebi rule that makes it mandatory for institutional investors to stump up the full amount on subscription to an issue. Earlier, they had to make an upfront payment of only 10 per cent of the bid amount.        
	The issue, which opened on May 25, was subscribed only 11 per cent till today morning as institutional investors chose to wait it out rather than tie up their capital.         
	On the somewhat tepid response to the issue, brokerage Sharekhan Ltds research head Gaurav Dua said, This was a stock that made sense for the long-term investor. In fact, its a very good bet for the long term. Retail was probably not clear as to what an IDR really was. Besides, volatility in the global markets may have acted as a bit of a dampener.        
	StanChart had offered the IDRs in a price band of Rs 100-115. But most of the bids came in at Rs 104.         
	When the issue closed, bids for 44.9 crore IDRs had come in.              
	The bank, which is listed in London and Hong Kong, considers India as its most profitable region after Hong Kong.         
	UBS Securities, Goldman Sachs, JM Financial, Kotak Mahindra, SBI Caps and DSP Merrill Lynch were lead managers to the issue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cipla dares Bayer with kidney drug
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cipla dares Bayer with kidney drug
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Price war                                  
	Mumbai, April 8: Cipla Ltd today took on Bayer AG when it decided to launch a generic version of the latters kidney cancer drug Nexavar at one-tenth the price marketed by the German company.        
	While Bayer markets Nexavar at a price of Rs 2.80 lakh for a monthly dose of 120 tablets, Cipla will sell sorafenib tosylate (the generic version) at a price of Rs 27,960 for a months treatment.        
	Cipla, which is Indias largest drug maker, is expected to start selling the drug in the next five days. However, the exact size of the market for the drug could not be ascertained.        
	Cipla had captured world attention in 2001 when it offered to sell anti-AIDS drugs at a fraction of that marketed by global pharmaceutical majors.         
	The bigger companies were then selling anti-AIDS drugs at $12,000 per patient per year and Yusuf K Hamied, the legendary chairman of Cipla, had then offered to sell the drugs at about $300 per patient per year.        
	Hamied has since then said on various occasions that while he was not against patents, he was against monopolies.        
	Ciplas decision to market sorafenib tosylate came after a Delhi High Court order in February dismissed an appeal by Bayer.         
	The latter did not want the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) to give marketing approval to the generic version of the drug as it was of the opinion that an approval would amount to infringement of its patent.         
	It had also argued that if the generic drug was granted marketing rights, it would be seen as a spurious drug according to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.        
	Bayer had initially filed a writ petition in 2008 which was dismissed last August by Delhi High Court. It then filed an appeal before a division bench of the court. Later, the division bench ruled against Bayer, thus paving the way for the launch by Cipla. Bayer has now approached the Supreme Court.        
	Last year, Cipla launched generic versions of anti-flu drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir in the local market to treat the H1N1 influenza. While they were branded as Antiflu and Virenza respectively, Antiflu was priced at Rs 475 for 10 capsules and Virenza at Rs 800.         
	Antiflu is a generic version of Swiss multinational Hoffmann-La Roches Tamiflu and Virenza is a copy of GlaxoSmithKlines Relenza.

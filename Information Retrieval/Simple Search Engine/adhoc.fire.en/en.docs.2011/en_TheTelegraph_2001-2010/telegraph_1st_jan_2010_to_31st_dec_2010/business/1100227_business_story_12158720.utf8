The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Correction with caution
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Correction with caution
                                      
	The following are excerpts from Part B (tax proposals) of Pranab Mukherjees budget speech.        
	GST road map        
	I mentioned last year, that the income tax return forms should be simple and user friendly. The income tax department is now ready to notify Saral-II form for individual salaried taxpayers for the coming assessment year. This form will enable individuals to enter relevant details in a simple format in only two pages.         
	I-T slabs widened        
	Last year I provided relief to individual taxpayers by enhancing the exemption limit for all taxpayers and withdrawing the surcharge on personal income tax. Taxpayers have responded positively to these concessions by contributing a higher level of taxes. There is a persuasive case for further relief by broadening the current tax slabs which I propose as follows:        
	Income up to Rs 1.6 lakh Nil        
	Income above Rs 1.6 lakh and up to Rs 5 lakh 10 per cent        
	Income above Rs 5 lakh and up to Rs 8 lakh 20 per cent        
	Income above Rs 8 lakh 30 per cent        
	The proposed broadening of tax slabs will provide substantial relief to a large number of taxpayers.         
	More for the kitty        
	I propose to allow a deduction of an additional amount of Rs 20,000 for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds as notified by the central government. This would be over and above the existing limit of Rs 1 lakh on tax savings. I am sure that these reliefs will put more money in the hands of individual taxpayers for both consumption as well as saving.         
	Besides contributions to health insurance schemes which is currently allowed as a deduction under the Income-tax Act, I propose to allow contributions to the Central Government Health Scheme also as a deduction under the same provision.         
	Surcharge cut, MAT up        
	Taking forward my initiative of phasing out surcharge, I propose to reduce the current surcharge of 10 per cent on domestic companies to 7.5 per cent. At the same time, I propose to increase the rate of minimum alternate tax (MAT) from the current rate of 15 per cent to 18 per cent of book profits. This will further promote inter-se equity among corporate taxpayers.         
	R amp;D boost        
	Last year, I extended the scope of weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on in-house research and development (R amp;D) to all manufacturing businesses except for a small negative list. To further encourage R amp;D, I now propose to enhance the weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on in-house R amp;D from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. I also propose to enhance the weighted deduction on payments made to National Laboratories, research associations, colleges, universities and other institutions, for scientific research from 125 per cent to 175 per cent.        
	I propose that payments made to approved associations engaged in research in social sciences or statistical research would be allowed a weighted deduction of 125 per cent. The income of such approved research associations shall be exempt from tax.         
	Real estate        
	To provide one time interim relief to the housing and real estate sector which was impacted by the global recession, I propose to allow pending projects to be completed within a period of five years instead of four years for claiming a deduction on their profits. I also propose to relax the norms for built-up area of shops and other commercial establishments in housing projects to enable basic facilities for their residents.        
	Audit relief        
	All businesses with a turnover exceeding Rs 40 lakh are currently required to have their accounts audited. A similar provision also applies to all professions whose receipts exceed Rs 10 lakh. I, as finance minister, had introduced these limits in my budget of 1984. It is high time to reduce the compliance burden on small taxpayers. I, therefore, propose to enhance these limits to Rs 60 lakh in the case of businesses and Rs 15 lakh in the case of professions.         
	To facilitate the business operations of small taxpayers, I had extended the scope of presumptive taxation to all small businesses with a turnover of up to Rs 40 lakh. To further reduce the compliance burden on small taxpayers, I now propose to enhance this limit to Rs 60 lakh.         
	One for charity        
	Under the current provisions of the act, the advancement of any other object of general public utility cannot be considered as charitable purpose if it involves carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business. I have received representations from many organisations seeking some relaxation in this restriction. I propose that this restriction would not be applicable if the receipts from such activities do not exceed Rs 10 lakh in the year.         
	My proposals on direct taxes are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs 26,000 crore for the year.         
	The major objectives that have guided me in the formulation of my proposals on indirect taxes are the need to achieve some degree of fiscal consolidation without impairing the recovery process and moving forward on the road to GST.        
	Unlike the time I presented the last budget, symptoms of economic recovery are more widespread and clear-cut now. The improvement in our economic performance encourages a course of fiscal correction even as the global situation warrants caution.        
	Therefore, I propose to partially roll back the rate reduction in central excise duties and enhance the standard rate on all non-petroleum products from 8 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem. The specific rates of duty applicable to portland cement and cement clinker are also being adjusted upwards proportionately.         
	Cars costlier        
	Similarly, the ad valorem component of excise duty on large cars, multi-utility vehicles and sports-utility vehicles which was reduced as part of the first stimulus package, is being increased by 2 percentage points to 22 per cent.         
	Petro punch        
	In view of the pressing need to move back to a fiscal consolidation path, I propose to restore the basic duty of 5 per cent on crude petroleum; 7.5 per cent on diesel and petrol and 10 per cent on other refined products. I also propose to enhance the central excise duty on petrol and diesel by Re 1 per litre each.         
	Tobacco tax        
	Since I quit smoking many years ago, I would urge others to also follow suit, as smoking is injurious to health. To this end, I am making some structural changes in the excise duty on cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos coupled with some increase in rates. I also propose to enhance excise duty on all non-smoking tobacco such as scented tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco etc. In addition, I propose to introduce a compounded levy scheme for chewing tobacco and branded unmanufactured tobacco based on the capacity of pouch packing machines.        
	Cellphone kit        
	India is one of the fastest growing markets for mobile phone connections in the world. Domestic production of mobile phones is now picking up in view of exemptions from basic, CVD and special additional duties granted to their parts, components and accessories. These exemptions are now being extended to parts of battery chargers and hands-free headphones.        
	Medical gear        
	I propose to prescribe a uniform, concessional basic duty of 5 per cent, CVD of 4 per cent with full exemption from special additional duty on all medical equipment. A concessional basic duty of 5 per cent is being prescribed on parts and accessories for the manufacture of such equipment while they would be exempt from CVD and special additional duty. Full exemption currently available to medical equipment and devices such as assistive devices, rehabilitation aids etc. is being retained. The concession available to government hospitals or hospitals set up under a statute is also being retained.        
	The manufacturers of orthopaedic implants have represented that their inputs attract a higher rate of duty than the finished product. I propose to exempt specified inputs for the manufacture of such implants from import duty.        
	Movies and cable        
	India is a nation of movie-goers. The film industry has been experiencing difficulties in importing digital masters of films for duplication or distribution loaded on electronic medium vis-a-vis those imported on cinematographic film, owing to a differential customs duty structure. I propose to rationalise this by charging customs duty only on the value of the carrier medium. The same dispensation would apply to music and gaming software imported for duplication. In keeping with the tradition of Indian cinema, however, I shall provide a surprise ending. In all such cases, the value representing the transfer of intellectual rights would be subjected to service tax.        
	Cable transmission of infotainment is undergoing a transformation with digital technology. The multi-service operators need to invest in Digital Head End equipment. To enable this, I propose to provide project import status at a concessional customs duty of 5 per cent with full exemption from special additional duty to the initial setting up of such projects.        
	Other proposals        
	Toy balloons are a source of joy to millions of children. To bring a smile to their mothers faces, I propose to fully exempt them from central excise duty. Some of the other relief measures that I propose are as under:        
	Reduction in central excise duty on replaceable kits for household type water filters other than those based on RO technology to 4 per cent        
	Reduction in central excise duty on corrugated boxes and cartons from 8 per cent to 4 per cent        
	Reduction in excise duty on goods covered under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act from 16 per cent to 10 per cent.        
	My proposals relating to customs and central excise are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs 46,500 crore for the year.        
	Service tax        
	The service sector contributes nearly 60 per cent of the GDP. The service tax to GDP ratio however, is only around 1 per cent. To bridge this gap, I had the option to raise the rate of service tax to 12 per cent as it was before I introduced the third stimulus package. I am not resorting to this option to maintain the growth momentum and also to bring about a convergence in the rates of tax on goods and services. I, therefore, propose to retain the rate of tax on services at 10 per cent to pave the way forward for GST. I am also proposing certain legislative changes to plug revenue leakages to remove distortions and to clarify certain doubts that have arisen over a period of time. The details are available in the Finance Bill and other budget documents.        
	BPO        
	Export of services, especially in the area of Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing, generates substantial employment and brings in foreign exchange. I propose to ease the process of refund of accumulated credit to exporters of services by making necessary changes in the definition of export of services and procedures.         
	Accredited news agencies which provide news feed online attract service tax. Acknowledging the yeoman services of such news agencies in disseminating news, I propose to exempt such news agencies that meet certain criteria, from service tax.         
	My proposals relating to service tax are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs 3,000 crore for the year. My proposals on direct taxes are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs 26,000 crore for the year. Proposals relating to indirect taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs 46,500 crore for the year. Taking into account the concessions being given in my tax proposals and measures taken to mobilise additional resources, the net revenue gain is estimated to be Rs 20,500 crore for the year.  
	Direct TAXes  
	Income tax  Income tax slabs for individual taxpayers changed: Income up to 
  Rs 1.6 lakh mdash; nil; Income above Rs 1.6 lakh and up to Rs 5 lakh mdash; 10 per cent; Income above Rs 5 lakh and up to Rs 8 lakh mdash; 20 per cent; Income above Rs 8 lakh mdash; 30 per cent  Deduction of an additional amount of Rs 20,000 allowed, over and above the existing limit of Rs 1 lakh on tax savings, for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds as notified by the central government  Contributions to the Central Government Health Scheme allowed as a deduction u/s 80D

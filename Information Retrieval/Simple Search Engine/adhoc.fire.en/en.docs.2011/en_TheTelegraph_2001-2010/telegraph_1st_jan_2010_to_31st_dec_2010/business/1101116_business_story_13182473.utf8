The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court seeks deposit from Vodafone 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Court seeks deposit from Vodafone 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TAXING TIMES                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 15: The Supreme Court today asked Vodafone International Holdings, a unit of UKs Vodafone Group, to deposit Rs 2,500 crore within three weeks as part of a tax liability arising out of its acquisition of a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in 2007.         
	The court, headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia, also asked Vodafone International to submit a bank guarantee of Rs 8,718 crore  which is the remaining amount of the Rs 11,218-crore tax claim  with a state-run bank in eight weeks.        
	The apex court will hear Vodafones appeal on February 24, 2011. Vodafone has appealed against a lower court ruling that stated Vodafones $11.08-billion deal for a 67 per cent stake in Indian telecom firm Hutchison Essar was liable to be taxed.        
	The income tax department will have the right to withdraw the Rs 2,500 crore deposited with the Supreme Court register. However, the I-T department will have to return the amount if the appeal goes in favour of the telecom firm, the apex court said.        
	The three-judge bench asked the income tax department to provide a guarantee that it would bear the interest on the Rs 2,500-crore deposited by Vodafone if the company wins the case.        
	In September, the I-T department slapped a Rs 11,218-crore tax on Vodafone, a claim contested by the telecom firm. The claim includes Rs 7,900 crore in capital gains tax and Rs 3,318 crore in interest payments for 42 months of operations in India.         
	According to revenue secretary Sunil Mitra, the Supreme Court ruling upheld the I-T departments claim.         
	Vodafone maintains that it does not have a tax liability as the transaction took place outside the country between the Netherlands-based Vodafone International and Hong Kong-based Hutchison, and the stake Vodafone acquired was owned by a Cayman Islands-based holding company.         
	Vodafone is confident that there is no tax liability resulting from this transaction and all the tax and legal advice it has received remains consistent with this view, the company said in a statement today.        
	However, the telecom firm had withheld a sum of $352 million from the $11.08-billion buyout deal it struck with Hutchison as a way to indemnify itself against future tax claims.         
	Vodafone also disagrees with the tax calculation, saying the interpretation of Indian laws by the I-T department is against international norms.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Corus finds Thai buyer for Teesside
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Corus finds Thai buyer for Teesside
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Deal TIME                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 27: Corus UK, now part of Tata Steel, will sell its Teesside Cast Products (TCP) plant in the UK to Thailand-based Sahviriya Steel Industries (SSI) for around $500 million.        
	Corus and SSI today signed a memorandum of understanding that sets out the scope of a potential transaction between them, Tata Steel said in a statement today. Tata Steel had acquired Corus in 2007.        
	The deal, if successful, is expected to create a significant number of jobs at the plant and provide a boost to the local economy. TCP now employs over 700 people.        
	Tata Steel said Corus and SSI would continue their negotiations and hold talks with trade unions and the government in the coming months to finalise the terms of the agreement.         
	SSI is the largest steel producer in Thailand.         
	The TCP unit can produce over 3 million tonnes of steel slabs annually.         
	The assets covered by the MoU include the Redcar and South Bank coke ovens, TCPs power generation facilities and sinter plant, the Redcar blast furnace and the Lackenby steel making facilities, Tata Steel said.         
	According to Kirby Adams, managing director amp; CEO of Corus, We are very pleased to announce this significant progress in our long-held objective to sell the TCP assets to a strategic industry investor. This is the first of several steps required to reach a definitive sale agreement in the coming months.         
	With the co-operation of the government, employee representatives and the North East (England) community, steelmaking at Teesside should restart in the first half of 2011, Adams said.        
	TCP was partially mothballed last year after a consortium of buyers broke an offtake contract.         
	Backing out of a 10-year deal, four buyers  Marcegaglia SpA, Dongkuk Steel Mill Company, Alvory SA and Duferco Participations Holding  did not take deliveries of slab steel that accounted for 80 per cent of the production at TCP.         
	Steel analysts said the news should result in a rally in the Tata Steel shares on Monday. On the BSE today, the Tata Steel scrip rose 1.65 per cent to Rs 510.15.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Reliance to bid for power plant in Orissa
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Charged up                                  
	New Delhi, June 14: Reliance Industries plans to foray into power with a bid for a 4000-mega-watt project in Orissa.        
	It is likely to bid as part of a consortium for the coal-based power plant.         
	Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries could not enter the business previously because of a non-compete agreement with Anil Ambani, which has now been scrapped.        
	Power Finance Corporation Limited, the nodal agency for the mega project programme, has invited request for qualification for the Orissa project at Bedabahal. The entire exercise is expected to be over by September.        
	Sources said Reliance was planning to bid for the project as part of a consortium with less than 26 per cent equity holding.        
	It cannot bid alone as it does not have the requisite experience as mandated in the bid document. A team has also been set up within RIL for the project.        
	The Ambani brothers last month scrapped a non-compete pact that had barred Reliance from sectors such as power, telecom and financial services and the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group (ADAG) from refining and petrochemicals.         
	The only part of the earlier agreement that had been retained is RILs pledge not to set up gas-fired plants till March 31, 2022.        
	Reliances foray will not affect Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Power as an empowered group of ministers has put a cap of three mega projects per developer.         
	Reliance Power already has three projects  Sasan, in Madhya Pradesh, Krishnapattnam in Andhra Pradesh and Tilaiya in Jharkhand.        
	A company can bid for a fourth project, if it has completed at least one of its earlier three projects.         
	The government had said the cap was necessary because it would be difficult to get finance, and any delay would hit the governments generation targets.        
	Orissa has acquired land for the project, while the coal ministry has allotted blocks.

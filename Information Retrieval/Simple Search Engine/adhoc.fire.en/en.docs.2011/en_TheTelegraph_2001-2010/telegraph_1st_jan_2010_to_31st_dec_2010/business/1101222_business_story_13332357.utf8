          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 21: Shareholders of Ispat Industries who were hoping to grill the Mittal brothers on the contours and the rationale of the deal with JSW Steel were in for some major disappointment.        
	The brothers didnt turn up.        
	Shareholders had tram-ped in early this morning for the meeting, eager to reel off questions on the deal.        
	U. Mahesh Rao, a director of Ispat, chaired the meeting in the absence of Ispat chairman Pramod Mittal and vice-chairman and managing director Vinod Mittal.        
	Before the proceedings could begin, S.K. Suhani, a shareholder, demanded an explanation on the deal, forcing the directors of Ispat to make a statement.        
	Soon, the Big Question was popped: why hadnt the Mittal brothers struck the deal with big brother Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, the owner of ArcelorMittal, and who was believed to have evinced keen interest?        
	One shareholder said Ispat ought not to have closed its options on inducting someone else other than JSW Steel.        
	Why not L.N. Mittal? He is the largest and everyone knows he wants to set up a plant in India, said one shareholder.        
	But Anil Sureka, executive director (finance) of Ispat, said the decision to induct Jindal as a majority owner hadnt been taken on the basis of emotions.        
	It was purely based on business logic. Jindal is the best fit for the company, said Sureka, alluding to but not confirming that there were other bidders in the fray.

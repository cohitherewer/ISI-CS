The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mutual new offer period shrinks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mutual new offer period shrinks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Time factor                                  
	Mumbai, March 15: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today reduced the offer period of new mutual funds to 15 days.        
	In a late evening circular, the market regulator said the offer period had been reduced to make the process more efficient. At present, offer periods for open-ended and close-ended schemes are 30 days and 45 days, respectively.         
	The time limit will, however, not be applicable to equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) as these are governed by government guidelines.        
	Mutual funds, thus, can use the proceeds of new funds only on or after the closure of the 15-day period.         
	Sebi has also asked mutual funds to allot units or refund money, as the case may be, and dispatch account statements within five business days from the closure of the new offer. Moreover, all schemes (except ELSS) shall be available for trading within five business days of allotting the units.        
	Under the latest Sebi regulations, it will be mandatory for fund houses to provide the ASBA (applications supported by blocked amount) facility to investors of new fund offers from July.         
	ASBA is a facility under which an applicants money is debited from a bank account only after a firm allotment.         
	The facility is already available to investors of initial public offerings.        
	Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research Online, said the extension of the ASBA facility was not relevant for mutual fund investors as they usually get units unlike in an an initial public offering.         
	On reducing the time frame for NFOs, Kumar said the move could cause logistic constraints as fund houses would have to generate awareness about the offer within a shorter span of time.        
	In its circular sent to all asset management companies, the market regulator said the role of mutual funds in the corporate governance of listed companies was considered by its mutual fund advisory committee.         
	According to Sebi, mutual funds should play an active role in ensuring better corporate governance of listed companies.        
	It has been decided that henceforth, AMCs shall disclose their general policies and procedures for exercising voting rights in respect of shares held by them in their websites as well as in the annual report distributed to the unit holders from financial year 2010-11, the Sebi statement said.        
	While the market regulator had earlier banned entry load on all mutual fund schemes, it now clarified that asset management companies should not collect any additional management fee.

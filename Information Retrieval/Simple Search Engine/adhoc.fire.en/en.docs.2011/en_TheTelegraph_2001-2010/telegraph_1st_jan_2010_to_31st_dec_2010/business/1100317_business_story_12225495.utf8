The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pranab lists twin concerns
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Pranab lists twin concerns
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab: Facing challenges                                  
	New Delhi, March 16: India will soon return to 9-to-10-per-cent growth, but double digit inflation and excessive borrowing are the countrys biggest bugbears, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.        
	We shall have to move towards the betterment, towards development and 9-to-10-per-cent growth is achievable. It is not a pipe dream, Mukherjee said while replying to the debate on the budget in the Rajya Sabha.        
	The finance minister feared that inflation would touch double digits in March because of the low base effect. I will not be surprised if it (inflation) reaches double digit in March.        
	The government is making an effort to control inflation to ensure that it does not eat up the benefits of growth. Benefit of growth is necessary, price control is necessary, fiscal consolidation is necessary, he said.        
	Inflation has already touched a 16-month high of 9.89 per cent in February, and analysts expect the Reserve Bank of India to raise its policy rates.        
	The Rajya Sabha passed the vote-on-account and appropriation bills which allow the government to withdraw Rs 8,35,637 crore from the Consolidated Fund of India for expenditure in the first three months of the next fiscal.         
	The bill was earlier passed by the Lok Sabha.         
	Continued strong domestic consumption, spurred by rising incomes and a growing middle class, will be the primary drivers of Indias growth, Anjalika Bardalai, analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit said.        
	She said the country could grow 7.7 per cent in the next fiscal and 8 per cent in 2011-12 but warned that high inflation and a weak fiscal position could hamper growth.        
	Mukherjee said the nation cannot sustain on unlimited borrowings and the economys fiscal credibility will be seriously challenged if it indulges in financial profligacy.         
	We had to borrow over Rs 400,000 crore in the current fiscal. Living on unlimited borrowing is not possible, he said, adding that the government has accepted the road map for fiscal consolidation given by the 13th Finance Commission.        
	Tax worry        
	The finance minister said tax revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) declined to 10.4 per cent of GDP in this fiscal from 12 per cent during 2007-08 because of the global economic meltdown and stimulus packages provided to Indian industry.

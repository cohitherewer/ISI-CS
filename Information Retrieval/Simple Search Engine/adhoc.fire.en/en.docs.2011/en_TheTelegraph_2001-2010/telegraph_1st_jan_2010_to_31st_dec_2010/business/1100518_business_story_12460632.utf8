The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to raise defence FDI
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bid to raise defence FDI
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 17: The government today proposed to hike the foreign investment cap in defence to 74 per cent from 26 per cent.        
	According to the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), current FDI limits have failed to bring in the latest technology. Only 15 per cent of Indias defence equipment can be described as state-of-the-art and nearly 50 per cent is suffering obsolescence, it said.        
	The DIPP suggested in a discussion paper that there need not be any commitment on procurement from foreign entities. These players will have to participate in the request for proposal to technically qualify and also compete in the financial bid. The views of stakeholders have been sought till July 31.        
	The paper disagreed with major industry associations such as the CII and Assocham that the cap should be raised to 49 per cent. By merely increasing the limit from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, we may be accused by posterity of doing too little and too late. In case we really want to have state-of-the-art technology, we have to permit anything above 50 per cent, if not 100 per cent.        
	Allaying security concerns, the DIPP said, We can refuse to allow FDI in the sector by refusing the licence if the background of a company is suspect.

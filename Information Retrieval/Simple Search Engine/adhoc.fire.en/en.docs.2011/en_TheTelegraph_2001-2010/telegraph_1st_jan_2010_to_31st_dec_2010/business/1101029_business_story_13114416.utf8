                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Interest income boosts BoB profit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Mallya: All smiles                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 28: Bank of Baroda (BoB) has reported around 61 per cent rise in net profit for the second quarter ended September 30 on higher net interest income (NII).         
	Net profit rose to Rs 1,019.30 crore from Rs 634.18 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	The jump in profit is attributed to a 46.8 per cent rise in NII, which grew to Rs 2,038.14 crore from Rs 1,388.60 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Besides NII, which is interest earned minus interest paid, a rise in fee-based income contributed to the surge.         
	The better-than-expected numbers led to the BoB scrip hitting a new high on the bourses today. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the share hit a peak of Rs 1,048.65, before finishing at Rs 1,010.80, a gain of 2.07 per cent over the previous close.         
	Chairman and managing director M.D. Mallya said the growth in net profit was driven by core business activities  lending and deposit collection  accompanied with a shift in deposit strategy.         
	While deposits grew over 30 per cent to Rs 2,69,660 crore as on September-end from Rs 2,07,355 crore a year ago, advances rose nearly 30 per cent to Rs 1,92,959 crore.         
	During the period, the bank cut its reliance on expensive bulk deposits and focused on low-cost current and savings accounts, which helped it to post better margins.         
	Retail credit rose 27 per cent to Rs 27,192 crore and constituted nearly 19 per cent of gross domestic credit.         
	Mallya said the bank expected to grow more than the industry on various fronts.         
	It expects a 20-22 per cent growth in deposits, higher than 15 per cent for the industry. The rise in advances for this fiscal is put at around 24 per cent.

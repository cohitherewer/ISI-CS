The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sterlite profit fails to meet forecast
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sterlite profit fails to meet forecast
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Oct. 26: Non-ferrous metals major Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd today reported a 5 per cent rise in profit for the September quarter at Rs 1,008.03 crore against Rs 958.85 crore in the same period last year.         
	The profit, however, was not in line with analyst estimates. Brokerages such as Motilal Oswal had projected Sterlite to report a net profit of Rs 1,164 crore.         
	Net sales were also disappointing, falling to Rs 6,028.98 crore from Rs 6,103.91 crore last year on account of a drop in revenues from the copper business to Rs 2,906.97 crore from Rs 3,431.38 crore.         
	Revenues from aluminium grew to nearly Rs 718 crore from Rs 634.62 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Revenue from zinc, lead and silver stood at Rs 2,145.54 crore against Rs 1,767.91 crore last year.         
	During the first half of the fiscal, net profit grew to Rs 2,016.46 crore from Rs 1,631.51 crore last year. Net sales stood at Rs 11,953.48 crore against Rs 10,684.08 crore in the year-ago period.         
	The Sterlite scrip ended with marginal losses at Rs 172.20 against the previous close of Rs 172.35 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	SBI Life        
	SBI Life Insurance has posted a net profit of Rs 217 crore in the first half of 2010-11, registering an 87 per cent growth over the corresponding period of last year.        
	Total premium increased 42 per cent to Rs 4,830 crore during the period. New business premium surged to Rs 3,173 crore, recording a growth of 30 per cent year on year.

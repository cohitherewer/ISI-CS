	Mumbai, Dec. 6: Two nationalised banks  the State Bank of India (SBI) and the Bank of India (BoI)  today raised their deposit rates by 50-150 basis points across various maturities to raise more funds.         
	The SBI and BoI join their public and private sector peers such as ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank, Syndicate Bank and Allahabad Bank who are offering more on deposits parked with them.         
	The hikes come at a time banks have been witnessing a tight liquidity situation and borrowing funds from the RBI repo window.         
	The SBI today said it was revising deposit rates by 50-150 basis points across various maturities and this would be effective from Tuesday. The bank will offer an interest rate of 5.50 per cent on deposits with a tenure of 46-90 days, up from 4 per cent prevailing now.         
	For deposits with maturity period between 181 days and less than 1 year, the SBI is offering an interest rate of 7.25 per cent against 6 per cent now; for 1 year to 554 days, the revised rate stands at 7.75 per cent against 7 per cent; for 555-day deposits the revised interest rate stands at 8.50 per cent, a rise of one percentage point.         
	For deposits with a tenure of 556 days to less than two years the revised rate is 7.75 per cent; for two years to 999 days, the rate has been revised to 8.25 per cent (7.50 per cent).        
	In the case of 1000-day deposits, the new rate is 8.50 per cent. For deposits with maturity period beyond 1,000 days, the revised rate stands at 8.25 per cent.         
	The BoI has hiked fixed deposit rates by up to 1 per cent on select maturities.         
	Term deposits of 1-2 year maturity will now fetch customers 8.25 per cent compared with 7.5 per cent earlier, while the interest rate on fixed deposits with a tenure of 2-3 years has been increased 100 basis points to 8.25 per cent against the existing 7.25 per cent.

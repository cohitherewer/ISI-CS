The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Infy springs a profit surprise
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Infy springs a profit surprise
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Oct. 15: The go-go days of growth are back again at Infosys Technologies.         
	The frontline infotech company stunned the Street and an army of analysts by reporting a net profit of Rs 1,737 crore in the second quarter ended September 30  a sharp 16.7 per cent increase over the April-June quarter and a 13.2 per cent growth over the same quarter a year ago.         
	Revenues rose by a robust 24.4 per cent year on year to Rs 6,947 crore and 12.1 per cent on a trailing quarter basis.         
	The numbers beat consensus estimates on the Street and easily overtook the cautious guidance that the traditionally conservative management had given out at the end of the first quarter ended June 30. The consensus estimate for second-quarter net profits on the Street was around Rs 1,700 crore.         
	The performance ignited hopes that the frontline IT companies might have been able to shake off the concerns over the growth prospects in the US and Europe  two of the biggest markets for software exporters  and the election-inspired rhetoric in the US against offshoring jobs to Bangalore.         
	Shareholders had something to cheer about as the IT giant declared an interim dividend of Rs 10 per share and topped it with a special dividend of Rs 30 per share coinciding with its 30th year of operations.         
	Though the economic environment continues to be challenging, we have leveraged our client relationships, solutions and investments to grow faster in this quarter, said S. Gopalakrishnan, CEO and managing director.         
	The company added 27 new clients during the quarter.         
	The Infosys stock surged to a 52-week high of Rs 3,249 in early trades on the Bombay Stock Exchange but tumbled in a very skittish market to close at Rs 3,076.15, down Rs 108.10 or 3.39 per cent, amid profit-booking.         
	The company gave out a cautious guidance for the third quarter, estimating revenues at a maximum of Rs 6,953 crore, or just Rs 6 crore higher than the second quarters Rs 6,947 crore.         
	However, it upped the full-year guidance by almost 2 per cent from the estimates it put out at the end of the first quarter. Full-year revenues are expected in the range of Rs 26,951 crore to Rs 27,165 crore.         
	Earnings per share have been projected in the range of Rs 115.07 to Rs 117.07.         
	In dollar terms, the company said it expected sales in the year ending in March to range from $5.95 billion to $6 billion compared with a July forecast for as much as $5.81 billion. And that means Infosys is projecting its dollar revenues to rise 24-25 per cent in fiscal 2011 up from a 19-21 per cent forecast in July.         
	Earnings per share will be $2.54 to $2.58 per American depositary receipt (ADR) compared with a previous estimate of as much as $2.52.         
	The double digit revenue growth was a positive surprise and so was the increase in revenue productivity. The increase in guidance in dollar terms is encouraging. The results reflect the increased demand which large Indian IT companies are experiencing, said Dipen Shah, senior vice-president at Kotak Securities.         
	The company is also sitting on a large pool of cash. Cash and cash equivalents have swelled to Rs 17,338 crore, a sharp 25.6 per cent growth over the year-ago level of Rs 13,846 crore.         
	Infosys now has a cash chest that ranks second after Reliance Industries. It has often spoken in the past of small acquisitions in both the US and Europe but has yet to seal a deal.         
	We have seen record hiring and attrition has decreased, said T.V. Mohandas Pai, member of the Infosys board and head of HRD and education and research.         
	The employee base grew to 122,468  an increase of 6.7 per cent over the first quarter and 16.1 per cent over the level a year ago. The company had gross employee additions of 14,264 and a net addition of 7,646. Trainee ranks have expanded to 11,127 from 7,603 in the previous quarter.         
	Contrary to what Pai claimed, the companys fact sheet showed that the attrition level (excluding its subsidiaries) had actually risen to 17.1 per cent from 15.8 per cent in the first quarter and 10.9 per cent in the same quarter a year ago.         
	Infosys has found its numbers dented slightly by the hardening rupee.         
	The rupee-denominated results were calculated at a conversion rate of 44.94 to the dollar against 46.45 at the end of the first quarter  indicating that the rupee has hardened 3.25 per cent in the last three months. In the same quarter a year ago, Infosys had taken a conversion rate of 48.11 to the dollar.

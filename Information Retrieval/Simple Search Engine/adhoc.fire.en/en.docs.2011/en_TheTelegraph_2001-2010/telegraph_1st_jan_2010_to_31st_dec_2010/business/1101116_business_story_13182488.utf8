The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam earnings take a hit
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Satyam earnings take a hit
          OUR BUREAU                           Gurnani: Focus on stability                                  
	Nov. 15: Mahindra Satyam Ltd (formerly Satyam Computer Services) has posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 23.30 crore during the second quarter ended September, lower than Rs 97.5 crore during the preceding three months.         
	Declaring the results for the quarters ended June and September, Mahindra Satyam said income from operations for the second quarter stood at Rs 1,242.40 crore, down from Rs 1,248 crore in the preceding three-month period.         
	The dip in net profit in both the quarters was on account of employee costs. In the first quarter we had forex gains, which were less in the second, chief financial officer S. Durgashankar said.         
	The company had announced its audited results for 2008-09 and 2009-10 in September. It had reported a net loss of Rs 1,250 crore for the year ended March, almost two years after its founder B. Ramalinga Raju admitted to a multi-crore accounting fraud.         
	Our performance over the last two quarters clearly reflects the stability that has been brought in. We have retained our traditional strengths and leadership in enterprise business solutions and integrated engineering services, chief executive officer C.P. Gurnani said.         
	On the merger of Satyam with Tech Mahindra, Mahindra Satyam chairman Vineet Nayyar said it could take another year to synchronise the synergies of both the entities.         
	The earlier indication of November 15, 2010, was too early. We are in the process of consultation and are trying to see the wrinkles that have to be ironed out. It is a process, which takes at least a year. It (merger) cannot happen in a hurry. I believe it will go on till the end of next year.         
	Mahindra Satyams headcount was 27,722 and 28,068 in the first and second quarter, respectively.         
	The BPO business contributed Rs 25 crore in both the quarters.

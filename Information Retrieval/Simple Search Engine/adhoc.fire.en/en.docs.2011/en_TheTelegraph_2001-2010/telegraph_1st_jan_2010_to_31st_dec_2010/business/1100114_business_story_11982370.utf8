	New Delhi, Jan. 13: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today asked states to sell surplus food stocks in the open market to ease food inflation that has flared up to 20 per cent.        
	The price rise in rice, wheat, pulses and vegetables is primarily a supply side issue that needs to be collectively addressed both in the short and the medium-to-long term, Mukherjee said at a pre-budget meeting of finance ministers of states and Union territories.         
	Later in the day, farm minister Sharad Pawar told states to use their agencies to distribute food items in the retail market. He was speaking to the media after a meeting of the cabinet committee on prices.        
	However, state governments, particularly the ones run by the opposition parties, today blamed the Centre for the soaring prices.        
	There should be a strong intervention by the Centre to keep the price rise in check ... Food inflation is because of the Centres policies, Bihar deputy chief minister and finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi said after the meeting with Mukherjee.        
	According to Mukherjee, there is enough wheat and rice stocks; offloading them in the open market will increase their availability and bring down their prices.        
	Several state-run agencies have stepped up efforts to sell grains held in reserve in the open market. The Food Corporation of India plans to sell 850,000 tonnes of additional wheat.        
	Mukherjee said economic recovery was a collaborative effort between the Centre and states. All provincial governments may co-operate in this regard to lift surplus stocks allotted to them, Mukherjee said.        
	The finance minister also urged the states to strive for a faster return to fiscal consolidation, without compromising on growth. State governments need to utilise the cash surplus for development activities.        
	State finance ministers, however, asked the Centre to allow more room for borrowing to enable them to spend freely on developmental activities. State governments can borrow up to 4 per cent of their GDP, according to the Fiscal Responsibility amp; Budget Management (FRBM) Act.        
	If an appropriate increase in fiscal deficit is used for funding investment in crucial areas of infrastructure, such as irrigation, roads and rural electrification as well as social sectors, it will enhance production and supply, Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta told The Telegraph.        
	The proposed goods and services tax and the new direct tax code, according to Mukherjee, are ways of achieving growth without sacrificing the FRBM targets.        
	The empowered committee of state finance ministers will hold another round of discussion with the Centre on January 28 to talk about the compensation on central sales tax and decide upon a rollout date for GST.

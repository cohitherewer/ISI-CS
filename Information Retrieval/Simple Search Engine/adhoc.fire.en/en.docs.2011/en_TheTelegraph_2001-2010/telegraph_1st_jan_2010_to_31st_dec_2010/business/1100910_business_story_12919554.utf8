	Calcutta, Sept. 9: Coal India Limiteds (CIL) decision-making powers will get enhanced after the proposed Rs 14,000-crore IPO, expected on October 18.        
	At present, the CIL board can decide on investments up to Rs 1,000 crore for each project. Any investment above this has to be ratified by the government.         
	Once listed, CIL will qualify for maharatna status that will empower its board to decide on investments up to Rs 5,000 crore.        
	Earlier this year, the government awarded the maharatna status to four PSUs, giving them more financial autonomy.        
	To get the maharatna status, a listed PSU should have an average annual turnover of more than Rs 25,000 crore, a net profit of Rs 5,000 crore and a net worth of Rs 15,000 crore in the last three years.        
	Coal India has fared really well, but it has a limitation of not being listed on any stock exchange, said Bhaskar Chatterjee, secretary at the department of public enterprises.         
	According to the draft red herring prospectus with market regulator Sebi, Coal India had a consolidated income of Rs 52,592.30 crore and a consolidated profit (after tax) of Rs 9,829.41 crore as on March 31 this year. The companys net worth was Rs 25,843.74 crore.         
	CIL accounted for around 82 per cent of the total coal production in 2009-10, catering to 53 per cent of the countrys energy needs.         
	Foreign asset plan        
	Coal India is looking to acquire five overseas assets in Australia, Indonesia and the US and has cash reserves of Rs 35,000 crore.         
	The company has appointed Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, Royal Bank of Canada and Royal Bank of Scotland.

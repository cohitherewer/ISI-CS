        How effective will the new stock exchange platform be for investing in mutual funds? Dhirendra Kumar finds out                                            
	Investors now have a new way of investing in mutual funds. Buying and selling of funds can now be done through stockbrokers using the BSE and the NSEs trading system. This cannot be called trading as here there is no interaction among investors.         
	The new system is an alternative to a transaction that you would have conventionally done by filling up a form and submitting it to a mutual fund distributor or at the fund office along with the money. The money is routed to the fund house and you are allotted the units.         
	The reverse happens when you redeem your units through a stockbroker. While the new platform is an additional, alternative way of investing in mutuals, the old system will also exist.         
	The stock exchange route has certain advantages and disadvantages which investors need to figure out to know what suits them best.         
	Under this system, investors need to have an account with a stock depository, just as they would for stock trading. At the time of opening a depository account, their identity would be verified under the know-your-customer norms.         
	Single reference point        
	One advantage for investors would be that they would have a single window for dealing with all their stock and fund investments and would get a single statement for their holdings. It would be of greater convenience for those connected through an online brokerage.        
	Investors living in small cities where fund houses do not have any office or representative will also benefit from the new system. The stock exchange infrastructure is also much wider than the fund network.         
	However, investors need to be aware of what the new platform cannot offer.         
	Avoid advice         
	Investors should steer clear of advice from stockbrokers. The gameplan behind investing in stocks may prove lethal for mutual funds. Stockbrokers tend to encourage clients to hold investments for a few days and long-term perhaps implies a month or two.        
	Let me explain this to you with the help of an example. Even before the new system was up and running, a friend of mine got a call from his brokers office. The salesman described the method he would follow for planning mutual fund investments. The broker will analyse the portfolios of mutual funds to see which stocks are likely to go up and then ask clients to take tactical positions (in the brokers words) on the funds they would like to buy.         
	This is a counter-productive way of investing in funds but one which, I guess, would come naturally to someone whose primary skill is supposed to be stock selection.         
	Effectively, this broker has figured out that funds are a new type of trading instrument where hell get about 0.5 per cent from the fund house rather than the pittance he gets at the brokerage.        
	Taking mutual fund advice from a stockbroker is like ordering milk in a bar. You may want the healthy option, but as the set-up is used to offering only the heady and intoxicating, then thats what itll try to serve you.         
	Brokers can be of help for those who dont have access to fund advisers. But brokers are unlikely to be suitable advisers.        
	Wider reach        
	The new system has been introduced by market regulator Sebi for two reasons. The first is to create a way of investing in mutual funds at lower costs. The second is to increase the geographical spread of fund availability.         
	One of the triggers for the move was the inability or the unwillingness of the mutual fund industry to create a joint electronic platform for fund transactions. Such a platform has been talked about for a long time but nothing concrete seems to have happened.        
	For investors, the bottomline is that the new route is a little more than a procedural convenience.         
	The crux of investing in mutuals is about choosing a good fund and investing in it for the long term. It matters little whether your investment is done by punching the keys of a computer or by filling up a form with a pen.

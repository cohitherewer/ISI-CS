	Calcutta, Feb. 19: The initial public offering (IPO) of equity shares by Coal India Limited (CIL) may hit the market by August 10, according to a CIL official.        
	Senior officials of the PSU today met representatives of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to discuss the timeline of the proposed IPO and allotment of shares to employees of its subsidiary companies.         
	The filing of the draft red herring prospectus for the IPO should happen by end-June and the issue should open by August 10, said Partha S. Bhattacharyya, chairman, Coal India.        
	At present, CIL is wholly owned by the government and has a paid-up capital of Rs 6,316 crore.         
	The government is expected to sell a 10 per cent stake in the PSU.         
	CIL has also proposed to offer one per cent shares to its employees. It also has plans to offer shares to people who have lost land because of the CIL projects.         
	If the government agrees, the reservation for employees and project-affected people may constitute an additional 5 per cent dilution of its holding in CIL, Bhattacharyya had said on an earlier occasion.         
	CIL will also seek dispensation for the issue of shares to employees of its seven subsidiary companies, the CIL chairman said after todays meeting with Sebi.         
	The issue of shares to the land losers may not happen during the maiden flotation as the market regulator is believed to have not agreed to this proposal since it involves technical and legal difficulties.        
	It is now believed that the government may dilute a 11 per cent stake to accommodate share offerings to the CIL employees.         
	Coal India, meanwhile, is facing a severe shortage of rakes. Three of its subsidiaries are saddled with 33 million tonnes of stocks at the pit-heads.         
	The PSU has already revised its production target for 2010-11, the penultimate year of the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12), to 486mt from 520mt because of delays in getting forest and environment clearances for as many as 17 projects that are estimated to produce 101mt.

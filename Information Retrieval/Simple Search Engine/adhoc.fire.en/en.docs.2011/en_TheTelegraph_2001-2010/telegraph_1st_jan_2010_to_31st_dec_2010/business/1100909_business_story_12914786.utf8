          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: Domestic IT companies and industry associations have expressed concern over American state Ohios move to ban outsourcing to offshore locations such as India, raising fears of similar restrictions by other US states facing high unemployment.         
	Indian IT firms get a bulk of their business from private US companies, but some are betting big on orders from state governments.        
	Infosys CEO and managing director Kris Gopalakrishnan said, We are concerned with the recent news about banning offshore outsourcing by the Ohio state government. Infosys initiative in the public services sector is focused on creating a domestic delivery centre in the US. Hence, this should not be affected.        
	In June this year, Infosys had set up a subsidiary  Infosys Public Services  headed by Eric Paternoster to get public sector projects.        
	Ohios ban can only be viewed as counterproductive to the US governments thrust on reducing public deficit and possibly lead to an increased tax burden on its citizens, said Nasscom, the apex body of the IT and ITeS industry.        
	Outsourcing is a $50-billion industry in India employing about three million people.         
	The move is extremely protectionist. While all governments tend to be worried about unemployment, they need to look at a global perspective, said the chief of an IT firm.        
	Unemployment has hit a record 9.6 per cent in the US, fuelling concerns about the pace of recovery in the worlds largest economy.        
	The ban imposed on the offshoring of government projects to India is against the spirit of free world trade and creates trade barriers, said Swati Piramal, president of Assocham.        
	Ohios ban follows the US move to increase the fee for certain categories of visas by at least $2,000 for the next five years to increase funds for security along the US-Mexico border. The fee hike is expected to cost IT outsourcing firms about $200 million annually.         
	States such as Virginia are also facing a massive backlash against outsourcing that can further affect the prospects of Indian IT firms.        
	There are pervasive service delivery problems with offshore providers, including dissatisfaction with the quality of their services and with the fact that services are being provided offshore, Ohio governor Ted Strickland said.

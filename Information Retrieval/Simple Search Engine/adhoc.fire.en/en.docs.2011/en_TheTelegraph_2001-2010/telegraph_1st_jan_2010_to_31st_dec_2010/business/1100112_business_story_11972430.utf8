          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 11: The Prime Ministers Office has expressed concern over the excessive import of jute and its finished products from Bangladesh last year.         
	India allowed duty-free import of jute and jute products from January 1, 2008, after gradually reducing the customs duty from as high as 16.5 per cent a decade ago.         
	During April-November 2009, the volume of imported raw jute jumped 120 per cent over the same period last year, according to the Jute Manufactures Development Council (JMDC). The growth in value was 317 per cent.        
	The industry had brought this abnormal rise in import to the notice of both the PMO and the Union textile ministry. The PMO is believed to have sought an independent report from the Jute Commissioner in Calcutta so as to take up the matter during Hasinas visit. The government fears excessive import may affect both the farmers and the industry.        
	According to the JMDC, the government body which promotes the export of jute products and monitors import, the flow of raw jute from Bangladesh during April-November was 79,604 tonnes at Rs 188.7 crore. Import, during the same period in 2008, was 36,161 tonnes at Rs 45 crore.        
	In jute products, import was 69,180 tonnes at Rs 256.3 crore during the period under review, up from 46,840 tonnes at Rs 127.6 crore.

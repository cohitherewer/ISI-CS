          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Max New York Life CEO Rajesh Sud in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Private insurer Max New York Life plans a capital infusion of around Rs 150-200 crore before the end of this fiscal.         
	The company also targets to break even by 2011.        
	We do expect a capital infusion around Rs 150-200 crore during this quarter, depending on growth, CEO and managing director Rajesh Sud said.        
	During this fiscal, the company has invested around Rs 2 crore, taking the total paid-up capital to Rs 1,784 crore.         
	Last year, the companys income from premium, which includes both first year premium and renewal premium, grew 27 per cent to Rs 4,623 crore.         
	Max New York Life, which began operations in 2001, has 715 offices across the country.         
	The private insurer settled 11,000 claims last year and added 10 lakh customers.        
	The company, which witnessed a negative growth of 2 per cent last year, expects to grow anywhere between 15 per cent and 20 per cent this year.        
	The insurer today launched a comprehensive parent-child nurture programme called I-Genius.         
	It intends to support talent development in children by identifying and rewarding those who display all-round skills, Sud said.        
	Under the scholarship programme, children can win more than 3,000 prizes worth Rs 2 crore.         
	According to a research, there are 119 million parents in India in the age group of 25-44 years with children below 12 years of age, he said.         
	Sud said the average age of parents buying insurance was 28 years.         
	Therefore, they opt for better financial instruments, which would offer maximum cover.

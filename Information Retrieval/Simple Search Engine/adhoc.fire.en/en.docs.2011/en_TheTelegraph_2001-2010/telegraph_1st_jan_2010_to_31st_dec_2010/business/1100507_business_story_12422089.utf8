	New Delhi, May 6: Exports grew 54 per cent to $19.9 billion in March and fell 4.7 per cent to $176.5 billion in 2009-10.        
	Export growth turned negative in October 2008 with the onset of the global financial crisis and remained so for 13 consecutive months, reversing the trend only in November.        
	For the 2008-09 financial year, the countrys exports stood at $185.3 billion.        
	Exports during April-March 2009-10 were valued at $176.5 billion, while imports during the same period were $278.7 billion, a fall of 8.2 percent from the previous fiscals $303.7 billion.         
	As a result, the trade deficit declined to $102 billion, from $118 billion in the year-ago period.         
	Some sectors continue to hurt badly such as engineering, which declined by 21 per cent, electronic goods, handicrafts and carpets, said Anand Sharma, Union minister of commerce and industry. The fall was triggered by the global meltdown, but we have been able to perform well, he said.        
	Indian exports are gaining as consumer demand improves in the US and Europe.         
	Sharma said the export target for 2010-11 would be $200 billion. India plans to double exports by 2014 from the current levels, he added.        
	We have a modest target of $200 billion of merchandise exports for 2010-11. We are confident of achieving the target and hopefully exceed it, he said.        
	On the performance in March, Sharma said it was the fifth straight month of growth. Overseas shipments rose 54 per cent to $19.9 billion, after a 34.8 per cent gain in February.         
	Exports are rebounding after an average 16.5 per cent drop in 2009 and expanded at the fastest pace since March 2004.        
	Sharma said the rupee appreciation had not adversely affected exports. The rupee has appreciated 4.4 per cent since January this year, and exporters have been lobbying the government to protect them against the appreciation.        
	The rupee is trading at 45.22 against the dollar.         
	Asean pact        
	The commerce ministry is hopeful of signing a free trade pact in services and investments with the 10-nation Asean bloc by the end of the year.         
	The services sector is of key interest to the government as it contributes over 55 per cent to the gross domestic product.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata plant gets green nod
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata plant gets green nod
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Ready to roll                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: The environment ministry has given its approval to Tata Steel to set up a plant of 5.5 million tonnes annual capacity in Chhattisgarhs Bastar district.        
	Under Jairam Ramesh, the ministry has caused a considerable stir by taking an activist stance against metal giants Vedanta and Jindal Steel.         
	In its letter dated December 3, a copy of which is with The Telegraph, the ministry says Tata Steel can go ahead with its plans to set up the plant along with a 625 megawatt power unit at Lohandiguda in the heart of a Naxal-affected area.        
	The total cost of the plant will be Rs 19,500 crore of which Rs 1,688 crore will be earmarked towards environment pollution control measures, the letter says. The project will use about 1,565 hectares of land within which it will have to create a 516 hectares green belt, covering about a third of the total area. Tata Steel has forest clearance for the project.        
	In recent months, the ministrys approval has been the most elusive and difficult for any steel, mining or power projects. Several companies have seen their plans nixed by the ministry.         
	Last month, Jindal Steel and Power Ltds planned steel plant at Angul in Orissa ran into problems with the ministry issuing a showcause notice.         
	It had earlier stopped Anil Agarwal-run aluminium maker Vedanta from mining bauxite in the state.         
	The Tatas have been warned that they will have to stay within the parameters of their plan and not expand the project scope or capacity without prior clearance from the ministry.        
	Sources said, the Congress-led government had put on fast track industrial projects in Naxal-affected districts, which adhere to environmental and other norms, in a bid to create jobs in these areas.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 27: Domestic banks  both state-owned and private  are increasingly tapping the international markets to issue bonds to meet their funds requirements. The latest to join the party is state-run Bank of India (BoI), which has raised $500 million through a bond issue.        
	The BoI today said it tapped the international markets to raise $500 million under its medium-term notes (MTN) programme at an interest rate of 4.75 per cent. The bonds have been swapped into a floating rate of 175 basis points above Libor.        
	An MTN programme allows an issuer to raise funds on an ongoing basis through various products such as floating rate notes or on a fixed rate after obtaining prior regulatory and other approvals.        
	With this, the BoI has so far raised $1 billion under its $2-billion MTN programme, which was launched in 2005. The lender approached international investors with its roadshow in February for the $500 million issue but later deferred it as market conditions were not favourable.         
	The book size of the issue was $4 billion and orders were spread over 300 quality investors, the bank said.        
	The BoIs announcement comes only a day after Axis Bank raised $350-million through a bond issue under its $2-billion euro medium term note programme. The original deal size was $300 million, but the transaction was raised to $350 million to accommodate the additional investor demand. The private sector bank received bids from banks, fund managers and private banks and allocations were made to more than 100 investors across Asia and Europe.        
	Other lenders that have tapped the MTN route to raise funds include the SBI and ICICI Bank. The SBI has so far raised $2.9 billion through this route, while ICICI Bank raised $750 million last year. The government-owned IDBI Bank is also understood to have plans to go for an MTN issue, under which it plans to raise around $1.5 billion.         
	Banking circles expect that with the lending activity set to improve ahead, the coming months may see more banks approaching overseas markets with bond issues.

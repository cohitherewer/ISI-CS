	New Delhi, Jan. 4: Mercedes today admitted that it had lost the leadership position in the premium segment in India to BMW. For the just-concluded year, Mercedes has reported a decline of 10.43 per cent in sales in the country but is expecting a double-digit growth this year on the back of a string of launches.        
	We were behind BMW in 2009 because of limited availability of our E-Class car ... I dont want to focus on leadership. We want to have a profitable growth, Mercedes Benz India managing director and CEO Wilfried Aulbur said. Mercedes sold 3,247 units in 2009 against 3,625 in 2008 in India; BMW sold 3,619 units in 2009.        
	We see a very strong growth in 2010 and it will be a blockbuster year for us. We are very bullish and we expect it will be a high double-digit growth, Aulbur said.        
	The company today launched a version of its luxury sedan S-Class and sports utility vehicle GL, priced at Rs 95 lakh and Rs 64.9 lakh, respectively. Mercedes will also launch its performance vehicle SLS AMG tomorrow.         
	Besides, it will bring the M class and an all new E-Coupe this year.         
	Both these vehicles will be showcased at the auto expo. It will be part of the 12 cars that we are displaying. While the M class is an SUV and should be competitively priced against the Rs 58-60 lakh bracket it is selling now, the E-Coupe could be priced below Rs 65 lakh, said company sources.         
	Mercedes would not offer discounts to push sales. Just to generate volume is not a good strategy, Aulbur said.

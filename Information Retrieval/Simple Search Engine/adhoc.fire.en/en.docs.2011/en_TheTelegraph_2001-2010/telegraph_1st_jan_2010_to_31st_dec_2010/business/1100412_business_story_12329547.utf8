          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 11: Brokerages expect Indian companies to report robust fourth-quarter results, beginning with Infosys on Tuesday.        
	The mood is upbeat for most sectors, with automobiles, metal and oil and gas seen leading the charge.        
	Telecom is likely to disappoint as also power, FMCG and media, and the outlook on banking is mixed.         
	Infotech firms are expected to report volumes growth as the global economic recovery is pushing up demand.         
	Analysts, however, feel rupee appreciation and cross-currency movement are likely to affect US dollar revenues and crimp margins by at least 30 basis points.         
	For Infosys, net sales could be around Rs 5,870 crore, higher than the guidance of Rs 5,675-5,721 crore. Net profit may be around Rs 1,600 crore.        
	Analysts are more keen on the IT companies outlook for this year apart from the guidance. The street is eagerly waiting for management commentary on IT budgets for calendar year 2010. We expect the 2010 budgets to remain flat or marginally higher compared with 2009. We are looking forward to the comments of frontline companies on how they plan to maintain their margins, considering the wage hike and rupee appreciation related concerns, brokerage Sharekhan said in a recent report.        
	Motilal Oswal expects its universe of 124 companies to report a net profit of Rs 57,500 crore, a growth of 33 per cent over the same period last year.         
	This will be mainly driven by the low base of the fourth quarter of 2008-09 when profits were down 15 per cent year-on-year. Cyclicals such as metals, autos and oil amp; gas will contribute significantly to this growth, Motilal Oswal said in a report on fourth-quarter earnings.         
	According to Angel Broking, net sales of sensex companies in the fourth quarter will increase around 35.6 per cent and net profit will jump around 26.4 per cent, though margins may remain flat at 23.5 per cent level.        
	Leaders and laggards        
	Auto and metals lead the list of expectations. A robust volume growth will see most auto firms report strong numbers.        
	Metals will benefit from higher realisations. Steel and base metal companies are likely to witness strong growth in both topline and bottomline.        
	Banks may gain from higher loan growth on a sequential basis, but last years high base may lead to a subdued quarter year-on-year.         
	As in the third quarter, the forecast is not optimistic for telecom companies that have seen high competition and no tariff hikes. Fierce competition is also expected to impact the profit margins of FMCG firms.

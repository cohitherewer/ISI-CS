          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Ambani comes out of the Supreme Court after the verdict on Friday. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	Mumbai, May 7: Anil Ambani will not get any supplies from the countrys biggest gasfield in the Krishna-Godavari basin until he puts up a power plant at either Dadri in Uttar Pradesh or Shahpur in Maharashtra  the two places where his group intends to establish two such plants.        
	The Supreme Court verdict has virtually stripped him of his entitlement of 28 million standard cubic metres of gas a day (mmscmd), a point that a late night press release issued by Reliance Industries indicated obliquely.        
	RIL can sell gas only at the price approved by the government and only to the entities who have been allocated gas under the gas utilisation policy, the release said.        
	The parties must restrict their negotiations within the conditions of the government policy as reflected  by the gas utilisation policy and the decisions of the empowered group of ministers (eGoM).        
	The release added that RIL had no ability to deviate from price, quantity and tenure as determined under the government policies, or to discriminate amongst various consumers.        
	We will renegotiate the gas supply agreements with Reliance Natural Resources Ltd within the boundaries that have been laid down today by the Supreme Court, RIL president P.M.S. Prasad told a television network tonight.        
	RNRL hasnt been categorised as a recipient under the gas utilisation policy as yet.        
	The apex court has upheld the dominant role of the provisions of the production sharing contract that each gas exploration firm such as RIL signs with the government, and the gas utilisation policy formulated in September 2007.        
	At the same time, the court said the memorandum of understanding (MoU) reached between the warring Ambani brothers in June 2005 was not legally binding on the parties.         
	It was under the terms of the MoU that Anil Ambani-owned RNRL had been assured 28 mmscmd of gas from the KG basin.        
	Pecking order        
	Under the gas utilisation policy, the government has prioritised the recipients of gas supplies from the KG-D6 field. Fertiliser plants producing urea get first priority to the gas followed by existing power plants, LPG plants and city gas distribution plants. If there is any surplus left, gas will be supplied to existing privately-owned steel and gas-based power plants.        
	But the first requirement is that these recipients must have their plants in place  just what Anil Ambani doesnt have at the moment.         
	It is unlikely he will have one in the near future as land acquisition problems have dogged the Dadri venture after Allahabad High Court ordered the district magistrate to look into irregularities over land purchase.        
	Officials from the Anil Ambani camp could not be reached for comment on the contents of RILs release.        
	Last August, petroleum minister Murli Deora made a statement in the Lok Sabha in which he enunciated the contours of the gas utilisation policy. Gas is a scarce commodity and we would like to give it to as many plants as possible. The first priority will be to supply gas to existing plants which are not operating at all or are operating sub-optimally because of non-availability of gas, he had said.        
	In January 2009, the eGoM decided that gas supply from KG-D6 would be made to projects in the pipeline, including the Dadri power plant as and when they were ready to commence production.         
	The Supreme Court verdict raises an unpalatable prospect for Anil Ambani: he may have to stand in a queue like everyone else  and thats only after he gets to put up his plant.

	Calcutta, June 25: B. K. Birla-controlled Jay Shree Tea amp; Industries, which has recently acquired two gardens in Rwanda and one in Uganda, is scouting for more buyouts in Africa.        
	We have just entered Africa and are looking for more opportunities. We are also interested in markets such as Indonesia and Vietnam, chairman B. K. Birla said on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting here today.        
	Birla said there was almost no scope for growth in India. We need to strengthen our presence in black tea. We are scouting for gardens there and will acquire estates at the right time.         
	However, the company has not set aside any funds for buyouts. According to Jay Shree Tea managing director D. P. Maheswari, the company aimed to turn around its African venture within two years. It was a favourable decision.         
	The company has firmed up plans to launch Rwandan tea in the UK, Germany, Pakistan and Kazakhstan under its own brand.         
	Jay Shree Tea, which has produced 23.4 million kg in 2009-10 from 22 gardens two in south India and 20 in north India  will add another 5.3 million kg by way of the African acquisitions.         
	The company, which had bought MP Chini Industries in Bihar for Rs 112.5 crore in March, plans to increase its power co-generation capacity to over 20-22MW from 5MW.         
	We hope to start work on this during the next sugar season, Maheswari said.                     
	There is good scope for growth in sugar in India. We need to tap that. We may also go for more acquisitions if we get something lucrative.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cause for concern                                  
	New Delhi, March 30: An appreciation in the value of the rupee against the dollar, caused by heavy inflows of foreign institutional investor money, has sent alarm bells ringing among exporters who are just recovering from the global recession.         
	The trading community has urged the government to step in and opt for a fixed exchange rate as in the case of China. The FIIs are making short-term profits. There is a need to regulate their investment. The government can contemplate providing a fixed rate of exchange for exports on an optional basis, A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Exports Organisations, said.        
	The dollar has declined around 12 per cent in the last one year. The FIIs brought in $4.1 billion in the last three months. The dollar dropped to a 19-month low to a sub Rs 45 level today.         
	Dollar depreciation results in lower margins for the exporters because they realise less value from the foreign exchange in terms of the local currency. Almost 70 per cent of Indias overseas trade are dollar denominated.        
	Sakthivel has demanded a fixed exchange rate of Rs 47.5 to a dollar for one year. The stability in exchange rate will add to competitiveness in exports as shown by China and Bangladesh, he said.        
	According to Premal Udani, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, the profitability of small and medium-sized export firms, who work on 7-8 per cent operating margins, has taken a hit with the rupee appreciating 4.13 per cent against the dollar and 10.15 per cent against the euro since January 1.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          New message				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: Norways Telenor today invested Rs 1,493 crore in Unitech Wireless, a subsidiary of real estate major Unitech, to increase its stake to 60.1 per cent.        
	Telenors total investment in Unitech Wireless now stands at Rs 4,113 crore. Its shareholding in the total issued and paid-up equity capital will increase by 11.1 per cent from 49 per cent earlier.        
	Delhi-based Unitech had offloaded a 67.25 per cent stake in its telecom venture for Rs 6,120 crore to Telenor. Todays stake buy is Telenors third investment in a four-tranche deal that is set to be completed by fiscal-end.        
	In October, the government gave its approval to Unitech Wireless to sell up to 74 per cent to Telenor.        
	Unitech Wireless launched its services in December under the Uninor brand and has operations in eight of the 22 telecom zones. It holds a pan-India licence and is targeting an 8 per cent share of the market by 2018.        
	This third investment will, as did the earlier transactions, provide Uninor with working capital to fund the roll out of services across India, said Sigve Brekke, head of Telenors Asian operations.         
	Telenor, the sixth-largest mobile communications group in the world, aims at achieving EBITDA break-even within three years and operating cash flow break-even within five years of launch.        
	The newbie also expects its average revenue per user, a key measure of profitability, to be lower in the near term before picking up by the end of 2011.        
	Telenor joins the UKs Vodafone, Japans NTT DoCoMo and Russias Sistema in offering services in India through joint ventures with local partners.        
	In India, Telenor is present in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh (east and west) Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	Foreign companies are increasingly looking at India to boost their margins with growth slowing back home.         
	At present, India is adding more than 10 million subscribers every month.                    
	UAE-based Etisalat and Bahrain Telecom are among the other foreign companies gearing up to start services in India with local partners, Swan and STel, respectively.

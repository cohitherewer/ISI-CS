The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Investments ebb in gold funds
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Investments ebb in gold funds

	Calcutta, June 8: Investment in gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) has slowed down significantly over the past few months as record prices of the yellow metal have led investors to book profits rather than making fresh buys.        
	Gold ETFs are paper securities traded on the stock exchanges and have physical gold as the underlying asset. They track the price of physical gold. Over the last couple of months, we have witnessed a slowdown in incremental inflows into gold ETFs, while redemption requests have increased, said Lakshmi Iyer of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company.         
	Iyer, who also manages Kotak Gold ETF, said, Since gold prices in the domestic and international markets are surging to newer highs, investors are probably postponing their investment decisions for a better entry point.        
	But if they are convinced that the price of the yellow metal will continue to stay above Rs 19,000 (per 10 gram), they will rush in again once the mark is surpassed.         
	Gold ETFs have given a 24.36 per cent return during the one-year period ended June 7, while the 30-share sensex of the BSE yielded 11.11 per cent.         
	In the last three months, ETFs have given a return of 9.81 per cent compared with a negative return of 1.26 per cent of the sensex and 1.07 per cent of the Nifty. Total assets under management in ETFs are Rs 1,711 crore at the end of April this year.        
	In May, gold price surged 3.29 per cent in dollar terms. During the month, global equity markets gave a negative return and major currencies showed weaknesses, said an analyst with Geojit BNP Paribas.

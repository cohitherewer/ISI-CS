          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Power pact                                  
	Mumbai, March 10: Thermax Ltd  the Rs 3,300-crore energy and environment solutions provider  has joined hands with US-based Babcock amp; Wilcox Power Generation Group to manufacture and supply supercritical boilers in India.         
	The joint venture will also manufacture subcritical boilers of over 300 mega watts (mw) in size. Thermax will own 51 per cent in the venture. Both the partners will together invest Rs 700 crore, with Rs 350 crore coming from equity and the rest via debt.         
	According to Thermax, the venture will bring to the domestic power sector its expertise in integrating energy and environment solutions and B amp;Ws skill in power generation technology and project management.         
	The agreement was signed by Thermax managing director M.S. Unnikrishnan and Babcock president Richard L. Killion.         
	Babcock is known to have pioneered the development of supercritical boilers, and Thermax feels this technology will contribute to efficient power generation in the mega thermal plants planned to meet the massive energy requirements of the country.         
	Supercritical boilers operate at a higher pressure than subcritical boilers, producing more energy from the same amount of fuel.         
	The supercritical boilers will be manufactured in a new facility that is being planned. The plant, with an annual capacity of 3,000mw in the first phase, will contribute to local component development.

	New Delhi, March 14: US software giant Microsoft is unlikely to offer a choice of browsers to Windows users in India who have Internet Explorer as their default browser.         
	The option, which allows users in Europe to download any browser from a selection of 12, is offered as part of a settlement of an anti-trust case brought against Microsoft by the European Commission.         
	Experts said while the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had the power to conduct an investigation into the monopolistic practices of Microsoft, the issue would have to be raised by competitors or users before any action could be taken.        
	The CCI has full jurisdiction to inquire into the abuse of dominance by any company in India. However, it would not be able to order Microsoft to follow or discontinue a practice merely on the basis of an order passed by the European Commission, Vinod Dhall, former chairman of the CCI, told The Telegraph.        
	Microsoft did not want to comment on whether it planned to provide browser choices to Windows users in other countries.         
	In January last year, the European regulators brought formal charges against Microsoft for abusing its dominance by bundling the Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system, which is used in 95 per cent of PCs.        
	Dhall said the CCI would have to conduct on its own, under Competition Act 2002, a separate investigation against Microsoft to come to a conclusion. It cannot go by the European ruling.         
	In India, there is a huge scope for investigations into the abuse of dominance in many industries. However, experts agree that the anti-trust environment is weak as the law is new and its principles  contribution to greater efficiencies and more innovation and enhancing consumer welfare  are not fully appreciated yet.         
	At present, these principles are not fully observed in India, and some practices are clearly in violation of the competition act, Dhall said.         
	Private players in the domestic telecom industry have been alleging the denial of interconnection and common carrier facilities by the dominant fixed-line players.         
	The same concerns also pertain to electricity, where the open access mechanism and common carrier principles exist only on paper, amid allegations that distribution companies and the state governments have barred access to prospective private utilities.        
	The CCI is still at an incipient stage. While the legislation was passed in 2002, the competition watchdog came into existence only last year through a notification.

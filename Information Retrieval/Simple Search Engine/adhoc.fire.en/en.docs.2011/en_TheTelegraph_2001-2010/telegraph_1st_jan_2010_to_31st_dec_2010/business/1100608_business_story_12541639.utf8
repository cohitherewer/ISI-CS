	New Delhi, June 7: The insurance regulator may allow banks to turn intermediaries for companies offering specialised health cover (mediclaim).        
	Promoting health insurance is a priority for both the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) and the finance ministry.        
	At present, a bank is allowed to be a marketer for one life insurance company and one general insurer. However, with many specialised health insurance companies coming up, the IRDA is willing to allow this third category of insurers to sell through banks, said sources. A final decision on a third is yet to be taken, though case-by-case decisions may also be taken, finance ministry sources said.         
	Antony Jacob, chief executive officer of Apollo Munich, said, We have been among those who have sought a change in rules.         
	The reason, according to Jacob, is that for a specialised insurance firm  such as one providing health cover  there is a limit to the number of offices it can set up as it sells a single product. A general insurance company does not have this constraint as it sells a bouquet of products. Apollo Munich is a joint venture between Apollo Hospitals and Munich Re of Germany.        
	Mediclaim companies, therefore, want to piggybank on the huge network of banks to sell insurance in a country where just 3 per cent of the population have health cover.        
	Banks would also benefit from the move. R. K. Johri, an independent banking analyst, said, The health insurance business is growing at 25 per annually compared with 11 per cent for motor insurance, which is the mainstay of the general insurance business. Banks would like to hitch a sales ride on to a fast growing though low-value insurance product.         
	According to a World Bank study, healthcare budget in India may gallop to about 10 per cent of GDP by 2015. This is against 4.5-4.8 per cent spent on healthcare now.         
	The health insurance sector is characterised by low penetration amid steep annual rises in medical costs. In the top eight cities, health insurance penetration is about 11 per cent. It is estimated that 80 per cent of the healthcare spending are an out-of-pocket expense for individuals.         
	With costs going up and attitudes changing, health insurance is finding acceptability among larger sections of the population. Our studies project that health insurance will account for 40-50 per cent of the total general insurance in five years, said Jacob.

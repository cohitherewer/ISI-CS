          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          S. Mahapatra in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 8: Dhamra Port in Orissa will start receiving ships from this month.         
	Santosh Mahapatra, chairman of Dhamra Port, said they would commence operations in two berths, though railway connectivity had not been established.         
	We hope the 62-kilometre line up to Bhadrak will be ready by the end of this year. The berths can handle up to 27 million tonnes cargo on an annualised basis when fully operational, he said.        
	Speaking on the sidelines of a CII seminar, Mahapatra said he wanted the deep water port to have a capacity of up to 100 million tonnes in the next five years.        
	The port, an equal joint venture between Tata Steel and Larsen amp; Toubro, has invested Rs 3,000 crore.        
	The promoters will have to arrange another Rs 7,000 crore to take the capacity up to the three-figure mark. They will also have to acquire another 800 acres of land and get environment clearances.        
	Dhamra Port has attracted criticism from environmental activists.        
	Initially, it will deal in bulk cargo such as iron ore and coal and later handle containers and liquid cargo.

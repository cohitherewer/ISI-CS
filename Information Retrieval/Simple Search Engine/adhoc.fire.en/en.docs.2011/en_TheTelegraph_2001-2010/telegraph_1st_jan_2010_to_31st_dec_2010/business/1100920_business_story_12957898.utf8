The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Captive coal rule to be made easy
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Captive coal rule to be made easy

	New Delhi, Sept. 19: An empowered group of ministers on coal is likely to agree to a coal ministry proposal allowing steel and power firms to divert the mineral from their captive mines for use by group companies, associates and joint ventures.        
	Several firms, including the Tatas, Reliance Power and Electrosteel Castings, have sought to use the excess coal of one particular project for other plants.         
	The Tatas have even moved the Supreme Court over the governments decision to let Reliance Power divert coal for its Sasan mega power project in Madhya Pradesh to another project.         
	The coal ministry has now decided to refine the utilisation policy without changing the spirit of the law that says user industries must use the output from the mines only for captive use.        
	At present, companies sell the surplus coal to state-run coal companies at a 20 per cent discount, while by-products such as burnt coal are sold to small units. Washed coal, however, cannot be sold.        
	According to the coal ministrys suggestion, Production targets will be increased only if the increased production is prized to allottees (by) either giving permission (to them) to use surplus coal to their other end use plants or (to) supply such coal to associate companies, subsidiaries.        
	The Planning Commission had criticised the coal ministry for not having a transparent policy following a complaint by Calcutta-based Electrosteel Castings.        
	Electrosteel said it was not allowed to use coal from Parbatpur in Jharkhand for its plants outside the state. At the same time, the company alleged, Tata Steel was allowed to send surplus coal to Tata Metaliks and group firm Tayo Rolls.         
	In June this year, Reliance Power had sought the coal ministrys permission to use the surplus coal at its mega power project at Tilaiya in Jharkhand. Rivals NTPC, Jindal Steel amp; Power raised objections, saying they could have proposed lower tariffs in their bids if they were aware of the advantage.         
	These differing views within the industry along with accusations of a lack of transparency in norms have prompted the shift in policy.         
	However, the changes might create problems in specific situations.        
	Problems might arise if new joint ventures were set up by the recipient of a block with other steel or power firms.         
	This would tantamount to transferring end use to a different power or steel company which is not part of the group. One has to see what will happen then, officials said.         
	For instance, SAIL is expected to set up joint ventures with Posco and ArcelorMittal, and the main reason why the two global players are keen on the tie-up is because of the coal and iron ore mines owned by the PSU.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gold ETFs fare well on Akshay Tritiya
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Gold ETFs fare well on Akshay Tritiya
          AGENCIES                                            
	May 16: The Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange today conducted special trading sessions in gold exchange traded funds (ETF) on Akshay Tritiya.        
	The NSE platform generated volumes worth over Rs 172.39 crore, and the BSE worth Rs 24.87 crore. The special trading session was a big success as reflected in the volume, an NSE official said.        
	Seven gold ETFs  Benchmark Goldbees, Kotak Gold ETF, Quantum Gold Fund, Reliance Gold ETF, Religare Gold ETF, SBI MF-SBI Gold ETS-Go and UTI Gold ETF  were available for trading.        
	Both the exchanges kept the market open from 9am to 3.30pm today for the special trading session.        
	Gold ETFs have been doing well in India. Compared with other regions where ETFs are popular, India is unique in the sense that the ETF market till date has been driven by gold in terms of the number of instruments and assets under management.         
	Akshay Tritiya is one of the two most auspicious days of the year to buy the yellow metal. Many Indians believe they can get lasting prosperity by buying precious metals on the day. The other festival is Dhanteras in November.        
	Indias centuries-old gold industry is the worlds biggest market for the metal with imports meeting almost all the countrys requirements for jewellery and investment.        
	In 2009, India faced its weakest year since gold trade was freed up in 1997.         
	Record high prices and a failed monsoon cut imports by 33 per cent from the previous year to 480 tonnes against an annual range of 600-800 tonnes in the previous five years.        
	Only 23 banks and some private and government trading agencies have licences to import gold because of its implications for foreign exchange flows.

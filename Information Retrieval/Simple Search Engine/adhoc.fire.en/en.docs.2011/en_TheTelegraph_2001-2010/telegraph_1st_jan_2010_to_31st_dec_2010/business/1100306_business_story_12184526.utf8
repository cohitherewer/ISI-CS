	New Delhi, March 5: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) today decided to scrap its controversial Rs 35,000-crore tender to procure equipment for 93 million new GSM lines.        
	The decision is based on a suggestion by the Sam Pitroda committee  set up by the Prime Ministers Office to bolster the deteriorating financial health of the telecom firm  which stated that the multi-billion-dollar mobile contract should be rejected as it was shrouded in controversy.        
	We have the boards decision to abide by the recommendations of the Pitroda panel to the government and it is now for them (the government) to take a final call, a BSNL official told The Telegraph.        
	The BSNL tender, which was initiated two years ago, has been stuck for various reasons, ranging from home ministry objections on Chinese equipment companies to legal battles by disqualified vendors.        
	The hurdles in the project started after BSNL disqualified three of the five bidders on technical grounds.         
	Ericsson had emerged as the lowest bidder in the north and east zones following the disqualification of Nokia Siemens on technical grounds. Chinas Huawei was selected for the south and west zones after ZTE and Alcatel-Lucent were disqualified on technical grounds.

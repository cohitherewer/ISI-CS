          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 5: Istithmar World, the investment arm of Dubai World, today sold its entire 13.4 per cent stake in budget airline SpiceJet for nearly Rs 170 crore to domestic mutual funds and a foreign institutional investor.        
	The Istithmar deal is part of Dubai Worlds move to sell stakes in various companies to cut debt. In November, Dubai World was in the news when it sought more time to pay $26 billion of debt, a move that impacted stock markets.         
	According to market experts, Istithmar had been planning to sell its stake in the budget airline for quite some time now and the recent rally in the stock could have hastened the sale.         
	The SpiceJet scrip has rallied from its 52-week low of Rs 12.10 in March last year and recently hit a high of Rs 63.25.        
	The stake sale was done largely through a bulk deal on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	According to available data, SpiceJet has sold a little more than 3 crore shares at a price of Rs 52.01 per share.         
	The principal buyers were, Birla Mutual Fund (1 crore shares), Reliance Mutual Fund (45 lakh shares) and DWS Invest BRIC PLUS Fund (88 lakh shares).        
	DSP Blackrock Mutual Fund also bought some shares and the deal was done by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.        
	SpiceJet shares were initially impacted by the transaction as it slipped to an intra-day low of Rs 51.80. However, it managed to recover and end the day at Rs 53.80, a loss of 1.65 per cent over its previous close.        
	For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, SpiceJet had reported net sales of Rs 642 crore and profit of Rs 108.94 crore.

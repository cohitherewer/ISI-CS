	Calcutta, April 30: City-based Allahabad Bank is targeting a 25 per cent growth in deposits and advances in 2010-11. The bank today reported a 21 per cent rise in credit and a 24 per cent increase in deposits during 2009-10.         
	We want to focus on core operations and we are also looking at volume growth, J.P. Dua, chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank, said.        
	During the January-March quarter, the state-run lender reported a 14.98 per cent drop in profit at Rs 225 crore because of lower treasury income. Profit during the same quarter last year was Rs 264 crore.        
	Net profit for the quarter was down mainly because of the impact of the treasury income, which stood at Rs 61 crore during the fourth quarter compared with Rs 245 crore in the corresponding period last year, Dua said.        
	The bank, which had a business of Rs 1,78,493 crore as on March 31, 2010, is looking at a business of Rs 2,30,000 crore during 2010-11. The bank managed to achieve a net profit of Rs 1,206 crore during 2009-10 against Rs 769 crore in the previous fiscal. It earned a Rs 164-crore profit from core operations during the January-March quarter against Rs 20 crore last year. Net interest income during the year improved to Rs 2,650 crore from Rs 2,158 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. Net interest income during the fourth quarter was Rs 746 crore against Rs 593 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.         
	Our net interest margin during 2009-10 stood at 2.94 per cent and going ahead, in the current fiscal, we hope to maintain it at 3 per cent, Dua said.

	Uco Bank, another city-based public sector lender, hopes to register a 20 per cent growth in deposits and an 18 per cent rise in credit during 2010-11, CMD S.K. Goel said here today.         
	The bank reported nearly a four-fold jump in net profit at Rs 379.80 crore in the January-March quarter against Rs 103 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.        
	Total income of the bank rose to Rs 2,690 crore for the quarter ended March 31 from Rs 2,520.62 crore during the corresponding period of the previous year. During 2009-10, the bank posted a net profit of Rs 1,012 crore compared with Rs 557.72 crore in the last financial year.                     
	Uco Banks total income stood at Rs 10,492.25 crore for 2009-10 against Rs 9,141.28 crore in the previous financial year.        
	The bank earned an interest of Rs 2,435.91 crore for the quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 2,164.28 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

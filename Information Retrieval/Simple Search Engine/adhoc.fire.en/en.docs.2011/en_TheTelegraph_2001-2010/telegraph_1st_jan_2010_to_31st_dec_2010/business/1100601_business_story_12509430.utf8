          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 31: The economy expanded at the rate of 8.6 per cent in the March quarter of the last financial year, riding on a double-digit expansion in manufacturing and taking the annual growth rate to 7.4 per cent.        
	The impressive growth was fuelled by a rising demand from Indias 1.2 billion consumers who fed on the three stimulus packages in the form of increased government spending and tax breaks.         
	Data released today by the Central Statistical Organisation showed manufacturing growing 16.3 per cent year-on-year in the quarter as consumers bought more cars and durables, while farm output grew at an annual 0.7 per cent because of a good winter harvest.        
	Economists said the growth owed much to the stimulus packages announced since December 2008, involving a total tax give-away of Rs 40,000 crore and an all-time high expenditure budget worth Rs 10,20,838 crore, 36 per cent more than what the government spent in 2008-09.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee expects the economy to grow at more than 8.5 per cent during the current financial year. On the whole it is 7.4 per cent plus (in 2009-10). I have already stated about 8.5 per cent plus (for the current fiscal), he said.        
	China, the only large country with a higher growth rate than India, witnessed an 11.9 per cent growth in the same quarter, while the fragile recovery in most countries remained under the threat of a debt crisis in southern and eastern Europe.        
	The CSO had earlier estimated that the economy would grow 7.2 per cent in 2009-10. Growth had slowed down to 6.7 per cent in 2008-09  because of the global meltdown  after averaging 9 per cent in the previous three financial years.        
	Shanto Ghosh, principal economist with Deloitte, said, The GDP growth data provide continuing support to the claim that India is emerging out of the global slowdown. Robust rise in manufacturing, a rebound in agriculture despite uncertain weather conditions and a continued growth momentum in construction and real estate augur well for the future prospects of the economy.        
	Last week, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said an annual growth rate of 10 per cent was needed in the medium term to address poverty and malnutrition.        
	As he strives for high growth, inflation has come to haunt his government and appears to be undermining its support base.         
	The Reserve Bank of India raised interest rates in April and March as it battled inflation.         
	Rupa Rege Nitsure, economist with Bank of Baroda, said, With the expected normal monsoon in the current fiscal, this growth looks sustainable. This will not be a relevant policy variable for the RBI as they seem to be concerned about the elevated food inflation. I expect them to continue with the gradual exit from the loose monetary policy during the current year.        
	India Inc has cautioned the RBI against signalling a hike in interest rates on the basis of growth numbers of 2009-10 as it may impede future growth. Raising interest rates at this point in time will act as a break on the overall growth process, Ficci president Rajan Bharti Mittal said.        
	Chandrajit Banerjee, director-general of the CII, said, One area of concern is that private consumption demand, which accounts for over 50 per cent of our GDP, remains subdued. We believe that with a good monsoon and the supply-side action, food prices are likely to moderate over the coming months leading to a revival of private consumption demand. This will provide a further boost to the economy.        
	The 7.4 per cent growth in 2009-10 clearly showed that the stimulus provided by the government through excise duty and service tax cuts had yielded results. Manufacturing thrived on the stimulus to grow 10.8 per cent in 2009-10 against 3.2 per cent a year ago.        
	Farm and allied sectors grew 0.2 per cent in 2009-10, whereas advance estimates of the CSO had projected a decline of 0.2 per cent.        
	Growth of community, social and personal services slowed down to 5.6 per cent against earlier estimates of 8.2 per cent. Since the stimulus has been partially rolled back it also indicates the decline in community and personal and social services, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said.        
	The growth numbers of all the previous three quarters have been revised. While the second quarter saw growth at 8.6 per cent against provisional estimates of 7.9 per cent, third quarter GDP rose 6.5 per cent against 6 per cent. The first quarter GDP, however, was revised downwards to 6 per cent.        
	Chief statistician Pronab Sen said, Normally , we do not change the quarterly figure, unless the annual figure firms up. This time it was done because we changed the base year to 2004-05 from 1999-2000 earlier.

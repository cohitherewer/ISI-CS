	Advances grew 39 per cent to Rs 1,08,609 crore as on June 30 from Rs 78,105 crore last year. On its other businesses, Axis Bank said fee income registered a growth of 19 per cent at Rs 743 crore against Rs 627 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Net non-performing assets (NPAs) as a proportion of net customer assets were lower at 0.35 per cent as on June 30 compared with 0.41 per cent on June 30, 2009 and 0.36 per cent on March 31. Gross NPAs as a proportion of gross customer assets stood at 1.13 per cent during the period.

	New Delhi, Feb. 3 (PTI): The government has approved the auction of coal blocks for captive use.        
	The cabinet cleared the bill last week, coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said today.         
	The bill is likely to be placed in the budget session of Parliament and propose amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The bill has been pending for over two years.        
	The Rajya Sabha had sent the proposed bill to the standing committee on coal and steel for further consideration. The mines act regulates the exploration, mining and allotment of coal and lignite blocks.        
	At present, companies are granted captive coal blocks after being screened by a committee that examines the short- and long-term requirements of end users such as steel and power firms.        
	The auction route is expected to expedite the allocation of mining resources to companies and encourage private investment.         
	State-run firms, however, can get coal blocks for captive use through both the auction and the existing routes.         
	Private firms such as ArcelorMittal, JSW Steel, JSPL will now have to bid for the coal blocks.        
	The 4,000mw mega power projects will be exempted from competitive bidding. The government has sanctioned four such projects and will be coming out with more such ventures.        
	The allotment of coal blocks was put on hold for a long time as the new policy took shape.         
	The government will put only the fresh blocks and the cancelled ones under the hammer.        
	The proceeds of the bidding will go to the states owning the reserves. The state governments will also be entitled to the royalty they get every year on mining.         
	States get Rs 2,000-4,000 crore per annum from public and private companies as royalty from coal mining.

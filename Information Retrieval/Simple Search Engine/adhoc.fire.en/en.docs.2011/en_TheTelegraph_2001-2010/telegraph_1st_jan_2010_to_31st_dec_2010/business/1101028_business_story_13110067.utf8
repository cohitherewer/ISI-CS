          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RBI governor D. Subbarao (right) in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 27: Reserve Bank of India governor Duvvuri Subbarao has called for concerted global action to deal with the rising tide of cash that is pouring into emerging markets such as India since the lumpy and volatile flows (of capital) are a spillover from the policy choices of advanced economies.        
	India has seen a gush of dollar inflows over the past few months, kindling the central banks concerns over the long-term effects that this could wreak on exchange rates and the exigent monetary policy responses that could stoke inflation and interest rates. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), for instance, have pumped in $ 34.36 billion between January and October, an over 121 per cent surge over a year ago.        
	Speculative flows on the lookout for quick returns can potentially lead to asset price build-up, Subbarao added.        
	The easy monetary policy of advanced economies is being cited as the key factor responsible for the capital flows into emerging markets. However, such flows have led to an appreciation of the local currency, denting the export competitiveness of these nations.         
	For the central banks, such large inflows present a challenge as intervention in the forex market (through buying of dollars) fuels inflationary pressures. When the central bank scoops up dollars it must release an equivalent value of rupees into the financial system.        
	Addressing a conference of economists and policy-makers here today, Subbarao said rebalancing of economies and exchange rate flexibility were the two other issues that required concerted global action to deal with the underlying threats that they pose to an incipient global economic recovery.        
	Multi-speed recovery around the world and the consequent differential exit from accommodative monetary policy has triggered speculative capital flows into EMEs (emerging market economies). The biggest problem thrown up by capital flows is currency appreciation which erodes export competitiveness.         
	Intervention in the forex market to prevent appreciation entails costs. If the resultant liquidity is left unsterilised, it fuels inflationary pressures. If the resultant liquidity is sterilised, it puts upward pressure on interest rates which, apart from hurting competitiveness, also encourages further flows, said Subbarao while articulating the problems and pressures that central bank governors like him now face.        
	The sterilisation of rupee liquidity occurs when the central bank comes out with a bond issue to mop up the rupee liquidity arising from an intervention. This leads to lower bond prices and since yields are inversely related to bond prices, there is an upward pressure on interest rates.        
	Subbarao said the assurance of advanced economies to keep interest rates exceptionally low for an extended period had also possibly triggered financialisation of commodities leading to a paradoxical situation of hardening of commodity prices even as advanced economies continue to face demand recession. Hardening of commodity prices has affected those EMEs which are net importers of commodities, he added.        
	The RBIs governors comments came amid reports that the US Federal Reserve was poised to announce its second round of quantitative easing, which may exacerbate money flows into emerging markets.        
	According to Subbarao, the post crisis global economy has thrown up the need for rebalancing. Elaborating on this aspect, he said that countries had to do two kinds of rebalancing  internal and external. First, internal rebalancing: when private demand collapsed, fiscal stimulus helped alleviate the fall in output. But fiscal stimulus has to eventually give way to fiscal consolidation, and private demand must be strong enough to take the lead and sustain growth, he said.        
	Subbarao added that in external rebalancing, nations who relied excessively on domestic demand must now focus on net exports whereas those like China who relied excessively on net exports must now depend more on domestic demand.        
	We should co-operate not only to firmly exit from the (current) crisis, but also to ensure that in resolving this crisis, we do not sow the seeds of the next crisis, the RBI governor added.        
	Rupee stable        
	The rupee pared early losses to end flat at 44.46 against the dollar today, with weakness in domestic equity markets offset by late dollar selling and heavy foreign capital inflows. The sensex fell 216 points in tandem with Asian peers.

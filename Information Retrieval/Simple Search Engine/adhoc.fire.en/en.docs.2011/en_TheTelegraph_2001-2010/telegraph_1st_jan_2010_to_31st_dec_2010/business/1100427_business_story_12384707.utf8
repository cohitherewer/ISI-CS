          SOUNAK MITRA                          Size matters                                  
	Calcutta, April 26: Reckitt Benckiser, a 7-billion company best known for its flagship brand Dettol, is making small packs of all its products to get a better share of the rural and semi-urban markets.        
	According to the company, markets with a population of between 50,000 and 100,000 are very price sensitive and experimenting by nature.        
	The rural and semi-urban markets, with consumers now having higher disposable incomes, are the future for FMCG companies in India. The consumers here look for high quality products at affordable prices and are experimenting in nature, Chander Mohan Sethi, chairman and managing director, Reckitt Benckiser India, told The Telegraph.        
	The company sees very good potential for all its products in these markets. To get a better share in these markets, we have started rolling out smaller packs and will continue with this strategy, Sethi said. With the smaller packs, consumers have the option of trying the products and then continuing with the ones they feel will fit their requirements.         
	Sethi said a sizeable portion of the companys business would come from the rural and semi-urban markets over the next few years, though he refused to put any number on the business.        
	He said a wide range of Dettol products were now available to meet a variety of tastes. Dettol soaps, for instance, come in three variants  skin care, cool and fresh. Internationally, we have sprays under the Dettol brand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Excess rain, pests take toll on tea output
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Excess rain, pests take toll on tea output
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 3 (PTI): Tea production this year will fall below last years tally of 979 million kg because of large-scale destruction of crops caused by excessive rain and pest attack in north India, a top Tea Board official said.        
	The countrys overall production will be marginally down this year. But, whether it will go down by 10 million kg or 20 million kg is difficult to say now, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said.        
	Stating that a concrete picture will emerge only later in the month, Banerjee said overall production would fall as first halfs pace of output growth could not be sustained because of rains and pest attacks in north India.        
	North India, which comprises Assam, produces almost 75 per cent of the countrys total production, and a fall in the output in that region inevitably impacts the overall production.        
	South India, which produces the remaining 25 per cent, had steady production till August, but bad weather since affected output.         
	Tea output stood at 979 million kg in 2009 against 981 million kg in the previous year.         
	Production in July fell 3.8 million kg to 123.1 million kg from 126.9 million kg in the same month last year.        
	Banerjee said exports might remain at last years level of around 200 million kg.         
	The Tea Board had earlier said that exports might go up between 5 per cent and 10 per cent during the current fiscal, though the official target was fixed at last years level of 200 million kg.         
	India exports CTCs mainly to Egypt, Pakistan and the UK and the premium orthodox variety to Iraq, Iran and Russia.

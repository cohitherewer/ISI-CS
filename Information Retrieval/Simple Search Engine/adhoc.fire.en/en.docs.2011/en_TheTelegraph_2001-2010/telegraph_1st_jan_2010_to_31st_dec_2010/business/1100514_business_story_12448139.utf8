                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bengal braces for ATM strike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Withdrawal worry                                  
	Calcutta, May 13: If you need cash early next week, better keep it ready this weekend.         
	Reason: Many bank ATM kiosks in Bengal may not dispense cash on Monday.        
	The labour commissioner has convened a meeting between bankers and representatives of the Bengal Provincial Bank Employees Association (BPBEA) on Friday, and a lot will depend on the outcome of the meeting.        
	The BPBEA, a state affiliate of the All India Bank Employees Association, has been demanding a minimum wage of Rs 212 per day to security guards who are outsourced by banks for their offsite ATMs.         
	On September 29, 2008, the central chief labour commissioner notified a minimum wage of Rs 212 a day. But the directive is not being followed by 19 banks, 13 public sector and six private sector entities, said Rajen Nagar, general secretary of the BPBEA.         
	He said notices had been sent to the banks.         
	If banks agree to pay the money, well call off the strike. If they dont, ATMs of 13 PSU and six private banks wont function on May 17, 28 and 29, Nagar said.        
	According to sources, almost all the big public sector banks, such as the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Allahabad Bank and Uco Bank, will be affected.        
	However, ATMs of private banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank are expected to function normally.        
	Nagar also threatened an indefinite strike if the demand was not met.         
	A State Bank official confirmed that they had got an intimation regarding the strike. The labour commissioner has convened a meeting tomorrow and has asked the bankers to attend it, he said.        
	Contracted employees at the ATM kiosks get between Rs 1,800 and Rs 3,000 a month in the state. Though some banks have implemented the directive issued by the labour commissioner, others havent, Nagar said, adding that they were demanding a minimum sustenance for those people whose jobs were neither secure nor were they getting their rightful wage.        
	Even in the cases where banks pay the correct amount to the contractor, the contractor doesnt pay it to its employees. But being the principal employer, banks cannot deny the responsibility of ensuring the payment to contract workers, Nagar said.        
	Under Section 21 (IV) of the Contract Labour Regulation Act, 1971, banks are responsible for ensuring a minimum wage and other statutory payments, such as provident fund, to contract workers by the contractor.

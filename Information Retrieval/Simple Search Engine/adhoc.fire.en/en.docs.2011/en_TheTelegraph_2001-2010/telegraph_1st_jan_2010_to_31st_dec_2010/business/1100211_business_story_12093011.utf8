The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI frowns on loan disparity

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Under scanner                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 10: The Reserve Bank of India has taken up the cudgels for existing home loan borrowers and asked the Indian Banks Association why they do not get the benefit of lower rates.        
	The apex bank enquired whether the discrimination against the older borrowers violated banking norms.        
	Existing floating rate borrowers keep paying relatively higher interest, while fresh applicants get loans at rates as low as 8 per cent.         
	In a letter written last month to the IBA  the apex body representing banks  the central bank wanted to know why the lower rates applicable to the new borrowers excluded the existing ones.         
	This is the first time that the central bank has raised concerns about such discrimination in home loans.         
	It came after repeated complaints by customers that the new borrowers got better interest rates, and the same reduction was not seen in the case of the existing borrowers.         
	The RBI said in the letter that banks had not reduced interest rates to the extent the reverse repo and the repo rates were lowered, and that there was no uniform rate for new and existing borrowers.         
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides funds to banks against government securities, and the reverse repo is that at which it absorbs liquidity. The central bank has brought down the repo rate by 425 basis points since October 2008, while it has reduced the reverse repo by 275 basis points.         
	However, banks have reduced the benchmark prime lending rates in the region of 125-300 basis points.         
	The communication from the central bank comes when the home loan segment has seen banks vying with each other to offer teaser loans. The State Bank of India kicked off with an aggressive scheme in February last year.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          On track                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: Mamata Banerjees dream of a greenfield railway coach factory in Bengal is set to become a reality.        
	Steel Authority of India Ltd and RITES will sign an agreement tomorrow to form a joint venture firm called Bengal Wagons, which will set up the Rs 205-crore wagon factory at Kulti, near Durgapur.        
	SAIL has an alloy steel plant in Durgapur that can supply raw material to the factory, which is expected to have an initial annual output of 1,200 wagons. The factory will also refurbish 300 wagons in a year.        
	SAIL chairman C.S. Verma had earlier promised officials close to railway minister Mamata Banerjee to expedite the project.         
	Sources close to steel minister Virbhadra Singh told The Telegraph that the deal would have been signed on September 3, but railway board chairman Vivek Sahai was away from Delhi.         
	Virbhadraji will be present tomorrow when it is finally signed to show that the Manmohan Singh government is firmly behind Mamata Banerjee in this and other railway ventures, sources said.        
	Sources said finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had been monitoring most projects in Bengal and had asked departments to speed them up.         
	SAIL alone will invest nearly Rs 20,000 crore in Bengal for its expansion and modernisation drive. It will spend Rs 14,443 crore to build a 2.3-million-tonne steel plant at Burnpur.        
	SAIL is keen on the wagon unit as it wants to increase its share of value-added products. At present, value-added products account for 37 per cent of SAILs output. The company wants to increase this to about half over a period of time.         
	The railways want to replace cast iron wagons  that are used for coal  with stainless steel coaches as they last longer, while their design makes loading, unloading easier and theft difficult.         
	Stainless steel wagons are lighter than cast iron wagons, which implies that goods trains using stainless steel wagons can run on less fuel.         
	SAIL plans        
	The steel maker is expanding capacity at three steel plants in Bengal. It is also investing in a number of projects at Kulti, the site of Indias oldest steel plant, which will manufacture value-added products.         
	SAIL will set up another wagon making unit in Bangalore in collaboration with Bharat Earth Movers Limited.        
	The unit will make stainless steel wagons for the dedicated freight corridor and source stainless steel from SAILs Salem plant.

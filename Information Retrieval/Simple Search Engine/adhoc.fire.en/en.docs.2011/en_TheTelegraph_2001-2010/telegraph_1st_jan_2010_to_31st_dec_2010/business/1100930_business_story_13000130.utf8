                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Figures bridge truth-lie gap
   Audit close to Raju claim          PIYA SINGH                                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 29: After pulling off arguably the biggest corporate fraud in Indian history, it seems Satyam Computer Services founder B. Ramalinga Raju spoke the truth for once when he finally decided to come clean.        
	Comparisons between Rajus scandalous letter on January 7, 2009, when he made a detailed confession with facts and figures as to how he cooked the companys books for several years in a row, and the results of the forensic accounting team commissioned by the companys new management  the Mahindra group  reveal that the numbers that were made public by the Satyam founder and the new accounting team are fairly close.        
	For instance, Raju had pegged the total size of the fraud at roughly Rs 7,000 crore. The freshly prepared accounts of the company by forensic accountants estimate that the fraud  along with several accounting qualifications  totalled Rs 6,763 crore.        
	A look at the fine print also throws up several such coincidences. For instance, Raju said the companys balance sheet as of September 30, 2008, showed inflated cash balances of Rs 5,040 crore. The freshly stated accounts put the overstated cash and bank balances number at Rs 5,294 crore.        
	Similarly, Raju confessed that the debtors position was inflated by Rs 490 crore while the forensic accountants have pegged this number at Rs 501 crore.         
	Accrued interest of Rs 376 crore was non-existent according to the former Satyam founder whereas the new accounts show that this number was over inflated by Rs 375.7 crore.         
	There are differences over the liabilities. However, considering the audacity and the scope of the fraud, it is interesting that Raju was fairly accurate in his confession.        
	The forensic accountants work shows that Satyam Computer Services had devised a complex accounting framework that helped the management cook its books without detection for so long primarily by inflating revenue and interest income hugely and concealing a number of real transaction from its records.        
	During April 1, 2002 to September 30, 2008, the company recorded a fictitious revenue of Rs 5,352.8 crore, an interest income of Rs 899.8 crore and an exchange gain of Rs 206.1 crore. It also posted fake payouts to employees as salary of Rs 207 crore.        
	To add to the chaos created by these imaginary numbers, the Satyam management also kept several transactions off the books, including salary costs of Rs 500 crore and interest on bank borrowings amounting to Rs 17.5 crore. These false numbers impacted the companys balance sheet, creating huge discrepancies for debtors, cash and bank and other current assets, and reserves and surplus.        
	The forensic accounting report shows that the management was even blas enough to create imaginary tax numbers. The accountants report shows that there were certain fictitious tax paymentsadvance tax and US federal tax which were recorded in the books of account aggregating Rs 306 crore.         
	Further, there were genuine tax payments/refunds (net) of Rs 50 crore that were unrecorded. Mahindra Satyam is at present tackling certain adjustments and appeals it has made to the authorities on the tax front.        
	When Mahindra Satyam CEO C.P. Gurnani was asked to comment on the astonishing convergence in the numbers between Rajus confession and the forensic audit, he said: It does (coincide) in some places and doesnt in others. But I dont know exactly.

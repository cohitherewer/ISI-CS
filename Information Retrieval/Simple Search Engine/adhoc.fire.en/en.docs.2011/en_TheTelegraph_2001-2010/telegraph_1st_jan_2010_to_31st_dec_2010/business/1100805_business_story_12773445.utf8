          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Aug. 4: The Andhra Pradesh government plans to hold a golden share in the special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the Rs 12,132- crore Hyderabad metro rail project.         
	State information minister J. Geeta Reddy said the state cabinet had awarded the project to a consortium led by Larsen and Toubro (L amp;T).         
	She said the golden share concept, first introduced in the UK by the Margaret Thatcher government, gave the government the decisive voting right in any major corporate decision.         
	L amp;T has sought Rs 1,458 crore as viability gap funding (VGF)  a one-time grant from the government for infrastructure projects undertaken through public-private partnerships. The VGF amount will be released by the Centre, while the Andhra Pradesh government will spend Rs 1,980 crore to acquire 204 acres at two places in Hyderabad as well as to provide relief and rehabilitation to the affected.        
	The state will release Rs 500 crore as the first instalment this fiscal, Reddy said.        
	L amp;T will form an SPV and enter into a concession agreement with the state government within a month of the letter of award. It will have to provide a bank guarantee for Rs 360 crore as performance security and achieve financial closure in six months.

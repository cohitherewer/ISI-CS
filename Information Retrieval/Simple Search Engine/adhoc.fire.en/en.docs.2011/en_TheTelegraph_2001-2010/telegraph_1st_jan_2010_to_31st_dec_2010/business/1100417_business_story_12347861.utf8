	Washington, April 16 (PTI): India has slashed its holdings of US debt by a little over $1 billion in February while China, which is locked in a currency row with the US, trimmed its holdings by $11.5 billion during the same period.        
	According to the US treasury department, India has reduced its holdings to $31.6 billion in February from $32.7 billion a month ago.        
	China, which is also the largest holder of US treasury bonds, has cut its holdings to $877.5 billion in February, one of the lowest levels in nearly nine months.        
	In January, Chinas holdings stood at $889 billion.        
	Both the US and China are locked in a row over the issue of revaluation of Chinese currency yuan. In recent months, the US authorities have been stepping up pressure on the latter to revalue the yuan.        
	Going by official statistics, China has been trimming its holdings continuously since October last year, when the holdings were at $938.3 billion.        
	Meanwhile, Indias holdings have come down by more than $10 billion since June last year.

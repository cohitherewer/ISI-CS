                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cairn seeks to allay fears
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: Cairn Energy today said it would comply with all contractual obligations under the production-sharing contract (PSC) on the sale of its majority stake in Cairn India to Vedanta Resources for $8.5-9.6 billion.        
	The proposed stake sale will not adversely affect the performance or obligations under the various PSCs (signed by Cairn India) nor be contrary to the interests of India, Cairn Energy CEO Bill Gammell yesterday wrote to oil secretary S. Sundareshan.        
	Some of these PSCs have specific provisions requiring the consent of the Indian government in the event of a change of control. Cairn India is committed to complying with all such contractual obligations, he wrote.        
	SC quashes move        
	The Supreme Court today refused to restrain Vedanta Resources arm Sesa Goa from launching an open offer to buy a 20 per cent stake in Cairn India, saying the application by Sesa Goa shareholder Harinarayan G. Bajaj had no merit.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Raja: Willing to talk                                  
	New Delhi, May 14: The telecom ministry has assured mobile operators of another round of discussion before finalising the allocation and pricing policy for second-generation (2G) spectrum.        
	Mobile service providers had raised a hue and cry after the telecom regulator proposed to charge a one-time fee from existing players for holding excess spectrum, which are radio waves through which voice and data travel.        
	If the suggestion is implemented, operators will have to stump up huge money. Panicked investors are rushing to dump telecom stocks following the regulators recommendations.        
	According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), operators will be charged a one-time fee for holding more than 6.2 megahertz (Mhz) of 2G spectrum. The fee will be linked to the ongoing auction of 3G radiowaves.        
	While the recommendations were made after consultations with the government and industry, the proposals could escalate into a long-drawn legal battle between the operators and the Centre.        
	The telecom ministry is already facing criticsm for selling 2G cheap to new firms.         
	At present, all private operators use 2G spectrum to provide voice and data mobile services.        
	It will be deliberated in the ministry. Thereafter, a due process will be taken up. It is necessary before taking any decision through the Telecom Commission. If necessary, a patient hearing will be given to the stakeholders, said telecom minister A. Raja.        
	Official sources said a panel was likely to be set up to study Trais proposals together with the objections raised by the industry.        
	Service providers are also expected to hold a meeting next week to arrive at a consensus over Trais proposals before launching a campaign against their implementation.        
	Trai chairman J.S. Sarma today defended the proposals. There is going to be no impact. The numbers are not going to be high. In fact, its going to be a small amount. I dont think it is going to matter in terms of their operating profits or tariffs.         
	Meanwhile, the telecom department has put a freeze on all spectrum allocations beyond the 4.4 Mhz mark till Trais recommendations are finalised.

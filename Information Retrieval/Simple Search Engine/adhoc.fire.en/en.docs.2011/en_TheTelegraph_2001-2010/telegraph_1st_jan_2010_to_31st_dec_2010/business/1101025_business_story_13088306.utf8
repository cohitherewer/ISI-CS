                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Loan payment
                                I wish to take a home loan for six years. But I want to pay the loan as early as possible. Can I prepay part of the loan every year to reduce the loan tenure? What type of interest will be suitable for me  fixed or floating?           S.K. Saha, New Alipore
                    Most banks allow prepayment of 25 per cent of an outstanding home loan every year without penalty. This prepayment is allowed after the completion of one year of taking the loan. For teaser loans, prepayment is not allowed for the first three years. Since home loans are taken for a long period, floating rate is beneficial. Besides, fixed rates are much higher than floating rates. Teaser rates, which are fixed for the first few years and then becomes variable, are better than plain vanilla floating rates. But when the teaser period is over, the EMI goes up. Keep this in mind.                                  Property matter      In 1965, I inherited a two-storied building. In 2008, the property was handed over to a developer for a G+4 apartment. Out of my quota of four flats, I sold two for Rs 45 lakh.What will be my capital gains tax liability? I am a senior citizen.        Mihir Dasgupta, Jadavpur
                    Your capital gains tax will be calculated in two phases  first for giving the property to a developer in lieu of four flats and second for the sale of the two flats. This is not a simple calculation. Seek the help of a tax practitioner since a lot will depend on the agreement with the developer.                                  Time to be a senior      My date of birth is January 1945. For which assessment year can I get tax benefits for senior citizens. What is the non-taxable gross income for 2009-10? I have not yet paid any tax for 2009-10. Can I pay the tax with fine now?        Ashim Roy Chowdhury, Madhyamgram
                    You turned 65 in January 2010. You can claim tax benefits for senior citizens for assessment year 2010-11. The exemption limit for senior citizens for 2009-10 is Rs 2.25 lakh. You shall have to pay a fine for submitting tax return after the due date, provided you have unpaid tax liability. If you have no tax liability, you can submit the return before March 2011 without a penalty.

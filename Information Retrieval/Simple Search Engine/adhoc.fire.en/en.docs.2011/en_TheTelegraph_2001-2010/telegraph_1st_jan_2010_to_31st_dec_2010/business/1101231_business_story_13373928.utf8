          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Funds Fillip                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: The cabinet committee on economic affairs today approved the much awaited equity infusion of Rs 1,200 crore in loss-laden Air India. The larger Union cabinet approved plans to turn Air Indias engineering and ground handling divisions into strategic business units.        
	This (equity infusion) will not only help restructure the airline but also shore up its finances, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.        
	The infusion of an enhanced equity fund would give a much needed impetus to Air India for its revival plan, an official statement after the cabinet meeting said.        
	The strategic business units (SBUs) will follow Air India rules but will have more flexibility in decision making. Employees have been resisting the SBUs as they fear that these SBUs may eventually be hived off and turned into joint ventures. However, the civil aviation ministry says the SBUs are essential for better management and improved financials.         
	While approving the equity infusion, the CCEA also directed the Air India management to work towards rationalisation of the wage structure.         
	With the CCEA directive aimed at cutting costs, the National Aviation Company of India Limited is now in a position to go ahead with its plans to review and renegotiate all agreements with its 14 unions.        
	At present, there are 10 wage agreements signed between the unions and management. The unions have been opposing moves to slash wages or allowances, arguing that the wage bill is only 18 per cent of the total turnover against a global average of about 22 per cent.        
	The wage restructuring plan, proposed by the management earlier, had suggested freezing of the payment of arrears for three years.         
	In a proposal several months ago, the national carrier had sought the infusion of Rs 10,000 crore. The proposal was examined by the committee of secretaries led by cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar and it was decided to provide Rs 2,000 crore to the airline.        
	Of Rs 2,000 crore planned for the airline, Rs 800 crore was granted in February, which was primarily used by the airline to meet its huge debt burden.

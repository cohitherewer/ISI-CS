	Calcutta, Sept. 11: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said price rise had been a concern for the government and necessary measures would be taken to check it. However, Mukherjee is not in favour of a steep increase in interest rates as it could affect economic growth.        
	Inflation is a concern. The finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India are watching on a daily basis the price movements of 18 essential commodities. Any measure needed to check inflation would be taken. But at the same time we cannot reverse the growth path, Mukherjee said at the 179th annual general meeting of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	The finance ministers statement comes ahead of the wholesale price inflation data to be released on Tuesday. On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India is scheduled to announce its quarterly monetary policy review.         
	While many economists expect inflation to be below 10 per cent for the second consecutive month, the July industrial output data released yesterday surpassed analysts expectation by quite a huge margin. Industrial output in July grew 13.8 per cent, the fastest since April, against analysts expectation of 7.7 per cent.        
	Since March this year, the Reserve Bank has increased its lending rate by 100 basis points and analysts expect another 50-basis-point hike before the end of the calendar year.        
	High prices of foodgrain and sugar are because of a steep increase in their procurement over the last five years, Mukherjee said.         
	The government needs to procure foodgrain for buffer stock to meet any shortfall arising out of drought-like situations in some states.         
	If we do not keep buffer foodgrain, we shall have to import. Global wheat production is lower this year. We cannot rely on imports at very high prices, Mukherjee said while stressing the need for state governments to revamp their public distribution systems.        
	The finance minister also called upon the chambers of commerce to persuade state governments and different political parties to implement the goods and service tax (GST).         
	The implementation of GST will require constitutional amendments that will have to be ratified by two-thirds majority at both houses of Parliament and by at least 15 of the 28 states in the country.

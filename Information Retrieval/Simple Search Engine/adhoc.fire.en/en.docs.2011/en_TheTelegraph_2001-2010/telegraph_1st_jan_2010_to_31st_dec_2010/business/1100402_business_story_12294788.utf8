The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wockhardt ends Abbott deal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Wockhardt ends Abbott deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bitter dose                                  
	Mumbai, April 1: Wockhardt Ltd, the Rs 1500-crore pharmaceutical and biotechnology firm, today scrapped its Rs 650-crore deal to sell its nutritional business to Abbott.        
	Debt-ridden Wockhardt didnt say why it was terminating a deal that it struck almost nine months ago.        
	However, sources said foreign lenders to Wockhardt had serious reservations about the sale of assets as the terms of a corporate debt restructuring package were tilted heavily in favour of the domestic lenders.        
	Wockhardt and Abbott have jointly decided to terminate the nutritional business agreement signed by them in July 2009, the company said.         
	However, Abbott said the decision was taken because Wockhardt was unable to resolve debt restructuring issues with some of its lenders.        
	The nutritional business of Wockhardt includes well known brands such as Farex, Dexolac and Nusobee infant formulas and Farex weaning cereal. Protinex  the adult protein supplement  is the segment leader.        
	The sale of the nutritional business was a crucial element in Wockhardts efforts to raise funds to repay its roughly Rs 3,700 crore debt.        
	Wockhardt had also announced that it was selling its German business, Esparma, to a unit of Lindopharm GmbH and the animal health division to Vetoquinol of France.        
	It may be recalled that since the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) process at Wockhardt began last year, differences emerged between the company and its overseas lenders that also comprised holders of its foreign currency convertible bonds.         
	The debt recast plan approved by domestic entities such as the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, and Punjab National Bank proposed restructuring of the companys debt and providing additional working capital.        
	While Wockhardt had offered to settle repayment of the little over $100 million FCCBs issued in 2004 at a discount, the overseas creditors that included Calyon, QVT Advisers and Barclays had opposed the plan to dispose of assets like the nutritional business, saying that proceeds should be used to repay them.        
	These lenders had also pointed out they were not told of the CDR scheme. Of them, Barclays Bank and Calyon had filed winding up petitions in November last year at Bombay High Court to liquidate the assets of Wockhardt and distribute the proceeds among the lenders.

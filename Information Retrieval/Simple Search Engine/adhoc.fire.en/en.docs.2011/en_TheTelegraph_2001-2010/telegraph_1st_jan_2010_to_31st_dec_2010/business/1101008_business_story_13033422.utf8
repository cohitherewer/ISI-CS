	Calcutta, Oct. 7: Reliance Life Insurance hopes to reach the break-even point in the current fiscal, a senior company official said.        
	We are targeting a new business premium income of Rs 5,000 crore and a similar amount of renewal premium income during this financial year. This is our fifth year of operation and well break even during this fiscal itself, Malay Ghosh, president and executive director of the company, said.         
	In 2009-10, the insurers income from new businesses stood at Rs 3,924 crore, while renewal premium income was Rs 2,702 crore. A life insurance company makes profit when renewal premium income exceeds income from new policies. A life insurer generally does not make profit on the first three premiums after selling a policy.         
	The company plans to come out with its initial public offering once the insurance regulator announces IPO guidelines.

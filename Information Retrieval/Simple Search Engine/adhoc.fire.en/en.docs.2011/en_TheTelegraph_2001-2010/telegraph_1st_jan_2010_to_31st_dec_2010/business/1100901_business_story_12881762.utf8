The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Residency rules tightened for NRIs
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Residency rules tightened for NRIs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TOUGH NORM                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 31: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has tightened residency rules for non-resident Indians (NRIs) for tax purposes.        
	Under existing rules, NRIs need to worry about only one residency condition: that they dont stay in India for more than 182 days in any single assessment year.         
	P. Chidambaram had retained this residency condition in the draft direct tax code bill 2009 that he largely supervised when he was finance minister.        
	Foreigners, however, have to worry about another rider on residency for tax purposes: that they do not stay for more than 60 days in the assessment year and no more than 365 days in the preceding four years.         
	Under the existing rules and the one proposed in the 2009 draft, the second condition was waived in the case of NRIs and those recognised as People of Indian Origin (PIOs)  individuals who have at least one grandparent from either side of the family who lived in undivided India before partition.        
	Mukherjee has now axed the waiver of the second residency condition for NRIs and PIOs.        
	Under the Clause 4 of the DTC Bill that was tabled in the Lok Sabha yesterday, the waiver of the second residency condition is being retained for only two categories of tax payers:         
	(a) A citizen of India who leaves the country in that year as a member of the crew of an Indian ship; or        
	(b) A citizen of India who leaves the country in that year for the purposes of employment overseas.        
	Persons of Indian Origin who are visiting India were covered under the concessional tax regime at present in respect of determination of residential status. Under the direct tax code, in the absence of the favourable provision, their residential status will be governed by the two basic conditions. This effectively means that if a PIO stays in India for more than 60 days and if they exceed the 365-day limit in the preceding four years, they will be considered as a resident. There may be implications of global income being taxed in India under certain specific circumstances, said KPMG executive director Vikas Vasal.        
	Plain semantics        
	There is also a subtle play of semantics when it comes to determining the residency of companies. An Indian company is considered as a resident for tax purposes  and that hasnt changed.        
	The draft tax code bill of 2009 had specified that a company would be considered as a resident for tax purposes only if its place of control and management, at any time in the year, is situated wholly, or partly, in India. This condition still remains, but Mukherjee has widened the tax net by adding that a company would be considered as a resident if its place of effective management, at any time in the year, is situated in India.        
	To avoid any legal quibble over the term place of effective management, the bill carries a detailed explanation in clause 314. Two definitions are given. The first says the term means the the place where the board of directors or its executive directors, as the case may be, make their decisions.        
	But hes then tacked on a sub proviso which can open up a minefield for legal eagles. Under this, if a companys board of directors routinely approve the commercial and strategic decisions made by the executive directors or officers of the company, its place of effective management will be the place where such executive directors or officers of the company perform their functions.        
	In effect, this clause could potentially bring a lot of foreign companies operating through branches in India into Mukherjees tax net.        
	This is definitely going to reduce the threshold for foreign companies. Firms which essentially carry on business in India are going to be hit, said PwC executive director Suresh Swamy.

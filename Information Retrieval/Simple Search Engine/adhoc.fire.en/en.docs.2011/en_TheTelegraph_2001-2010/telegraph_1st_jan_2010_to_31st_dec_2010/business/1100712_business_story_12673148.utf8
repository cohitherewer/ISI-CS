The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to control recycling of plastic waste
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bid to control recycling of plastic waste
          R. SURYAMURTHY                                              CHECK ON USE      
	New Delhi, July 11: Stringent operational rules are on the works for units recycling plastic wastes in SEZs.        
	An inter-ministerial panel is framing the policy, and the move is aimed at preventing the country from becoming a dumping ground for the waste from developed countries.         
	The panel plans to come out with strict export obligations for existing units and make it mandatory for them to comply with environmental laws.        
	The draft norms prepared by the commerce ministry will be discussed next week by the 19-member board of approval for special economic zones (SEZs) headed by commerce secretary Rahul Khullar.        
	Recently, environment and forest minister Jairam Ramesh had sought the assistance of commerce minister Anand Sharma to improve the implementation of the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008.        
	I will request you (to) issue necessary instructions so that the challenge of tackling illegal import of hazardous wastes into the country can be effectively addressed, Ramesh stated in the letter.        
	The environment ministry fears some entities to be operating without approval from the government.         
	Green activists argue that these units should not continue their operations on the grounds of environment and safety hazards. However, SEZ units maintain that besides value addition, the processing of waste provides employment to a large number of people. The finished products are sold in the domestic market after the payment of full duty.        
	The draft norms said new recycling units in SEZs would have to invest a minimum of Rs 1 crore and export 80 per cent of the turnover by the fifth year of their operations. Existing units should export 50 per cent of their turnover by the end of the fifth year starting with 25 per cent in the first year.        
	Sales in DTA (domestic tariff area) can be gradually reduced and the units should gradually increase physical exports to 50 per cent of their total turnover in the fifth year, the draft policy said.

        Life insurance helps mitigate many risks but choose a product that serves your purpose, says Malay Ghosh                                            
	Life insurance is a well known but less understood term. Even the most educated person accuses insurance professionals of using too much jargon and complicating matters beyond comprehension. So, let us try and present a laymans perspective of life insurance.        
	Life insurance, at its core, is a solution to protect you and your family from the various risks we face in life  of dying young, living too long, not having enough money to fund ones childs education or buying that dream house.         
	Life insurance is a financial solution that provides a systematic plan to mitigate these risks.         
	Like every other industry, all life insurance customers do not have identical needs and, therefore, there are different products for different needs.         
	A very recent debate doing the rounds is about Ulips whether they are good or bad, or whether mutual funds are better.         
	Traditional or unit-linked, what is important is whether the product fulfils the purpose of the customer and is aligned to his financial condition and risk appetite.        
	Though a customer knows his needs best, it is incumbent upon the agent that he too understands the customers needs and gives a proper advice.         
	Know your needs        
	To begin with, if a customer is looking for a pure investment and the time horizon of the investment is short, he/she will be better off investing in a mutual fund or other short-term fixed interest bonds or deposits, depending on the risk appetite.         
	Life insurance should be suggested only if a customer is looking at a combination of savings and protection and has a time horizon of at least 10 years.         
	Let us now try and explain the difference between a Ulip and a traditional plan.        
	Traditional products give life cover and savings benefits to customers who prefer steady returns, who value safety and guarantee more than the return. In these products, the premium is fixed according to the age and the cover amount and the corpus paid on survival is guaranteed  it is typically some multiple of the guaranteed life cover.         
	There are variants that include variable bonuses but they are over and above the guaranteed amount.         
	Ulips are a flexible and transparent version of a life insurance product which appeals to customers who want complete flexibility in premium, life cover and market-linked return. Both types of products have their own merits and appeal for different sets of customers.         
	Ulips have been in the news over the last few years because of the success of the product which coincided with the bull run in the Indian markets, and nothing succeeds like success.         
	Safety counts        
	Since the global financial turmoil started unravelling in 2008, there has been a resurgence in the need for safety and security in almost every sphere of life; why should it be any different for life insurance. This security was offered by the traditional policies. Therefore, over the last year especially, there has been some balancing of portfolios across the industry.         
	Now that we have, in the last decade, seen a boom and a bust cycle, though in India the bust cycle was thankfully short-lived, both customers and distributors have become more sensitive to different risk profiles.         
	You might say some of the traditional wisdom is coming back, but the fact remains that both Ulips and traditional products are great risk mitigation products, it just depends on what is the most suitable way for the customer to address these risks.         
	So neither is good or bad, it just has to be right for the right customer.        
	Having explained what life insurance is, let us highlight the importance of the product for an individual.         
	Lifeline logic        
	India is a highly under-insured market. While our penetration has reached a modest 4.1 per cent in terms of life insurance premium as a percentage of GDP, it is still lower than the world average of 5.2 per cent and that of some developed countries such as the UK which have a penetration of over 10 per cent.         
	In terms of per capita premium, which indicates the amount spent by people on insurance, we are way behind the world average of over Rs 1 lakh.         
	Conventionally, the joint family system has been providing protection against the risks that an individual family faces. However, with increasing urbanisation and escalating costs, this cannot be a fall back option any longer. The individual has to create his or her own reserves to protect against contingencies, to prepare for retirement, to plan for childrens education and so on. Life insurance is a comprehensive solution that can address these needs under one umbrella.         
	It is important that all of us are aware of these risks and ensure that we have adequate life cover and savings as part of our overall financial plan. You cannot avoid some risks but you can definitely have a good plan to mitigate them with life insurance solutions. The industry has a host of products to address different customers with different needs and risk profiles. It is important to choose the one most suited for you.         
	And as most life insurance advertisements say, once you have the future covered, you can live a carefree life today and enjoy the present.

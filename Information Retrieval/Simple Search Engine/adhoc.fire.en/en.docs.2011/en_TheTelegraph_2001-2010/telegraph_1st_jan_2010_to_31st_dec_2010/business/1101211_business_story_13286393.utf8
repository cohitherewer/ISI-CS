The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI on alert to check inflation
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RBI on alert to check inflation
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 10: The Reserve Bank of India today said it would intervene if inflation did not decline to the central banks targeted level by March.        
	Inflation may come down to the RBIs projections. If it does not, we will have to take steps, RBI deputy governor K.C. Chakrabarty said on the sidelines of an event organised by the CII and Suresh Neotia Centre of Excellence.        
	Inflation in October was at 8.6 per cent, much higher than the RBIs fiscal target of 5.5 per cent.         
	The RBI, which has said inflation control was a priority, has raised its repo and reverse rates six times in 2010.         
	We are already exiting from the accommodative policy. While we are exiting, inflation also has to come down. Accommodative policies continue where the growth is very low. Our growth is reasonable. If inflation does not come down, you will have to take the step, he said.        
	Chakrabarty expressed concern over meeting the government target for long-term double-digit growth.        
	At present there is no sign of overheating, but we will not be able to grow at 9 per cent (on the long term) with this kind of infrastructure or this level of investment in agriculture, he said.        
	The problem is in the long term. On a longer term, we can grow 7.75-8 per cent but not at 9-10 per cent with this kind of infrastructure unless we do something additional.        
	On liquidity, Chakrabarty did not see any problems as of now. It is partly structural and partly frictional. Plenty of money is available. The RBI has given support.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Buoyancy in direct tax mop-up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with his deputy Namo Narain Meena (right) and Sidbi chairman Rajender Mohan Malla in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 2: The government today said direct tax collection had surpassed the budget estimate of Rs 3.70 lakh crore for the 2009-10 fiscal.        
	It (direct tax collection) is well above the budget estimate, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said on the sidelines of a function to commemorate the 20th foundation day of the small and medium sector lender Sidbi.        
	Direct tax realisation, however, is likely to fall short of the enhanced target of Rs 3.87 lakh crore, mentioned in the revised estimate for 2009-10. Direct taxes include, corporate tax, personal income tax and wealth tax.        
	During the 11-month period of the 2009-10 fiscal, ending February, direct tax collection was Rs 2.78 lakh crore and nearly Rs 1 lakh crore is estimated to have been collected during March.        
	In February, direct tax collection grew by a robust 27.54 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Tax collection stood at Rs 14,675 crore against Rs 11,506 crore in February 2009. This was against a drop of 19.84 per cent in January.        
	Corporate tax collection grew by 10.89 per cent to Rs 1.80 lakh crore in the April-February period compared with Rs 1.62 lakh crore in the 11-month period of the previous fiscal, while personal income tax grew to Rs 97,692 crore during the period.        
	In February, corporate tax collection grew a healthy 16.87 per cent, while personal income tax mop up jumped a robust 37.58 per cent.        
	Growth hope        
	Mukherjee said the economy would expand 8.25-8.75 per cent in the current financial year after an impressive growth in 2009-10.        
	We expect the economy to grow 7.2 per cent in 2009-10, which is impressive by global standards. I am optimistic that the growth rate will climb back to 8.25-8.75 per cent in 2010-11, he said. Mukherjee also expressed confidence that the measures announced in the budget would revive private investment and put the economy back on a 9-per-cent growth trajectory.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had yesterday said the economy could achieve a growth rate of 9 per cent by the end of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-2012) and do better thereafter.        
	After clocking an impressive 9 per cent growth for the previous three fiscals till 2007-08, Indias GDP grew at a relatively modest rate of 6.7 per cent in 2008-09 because of the global economic slowdown.        
	Buoyancy is evident from industrial output that rose 16.7 per cent in January from a year earlier, after a 17.6 per cent growth in December.         
	Industry secretary R.P. Singh said production was expected to have expanded 16 per cent year-on-year in February.         
	Exports also rose 34.8 per cent in February from a year earlier and imports increased 66.4 per cent.         
	However, the strengthening of the economy has raised concerns over food inflation spreading to manufacturing.         
	The wholesale price-based index inflation, which was initially driven by high food prices, is now getting a push from other segments such as manufacturing.

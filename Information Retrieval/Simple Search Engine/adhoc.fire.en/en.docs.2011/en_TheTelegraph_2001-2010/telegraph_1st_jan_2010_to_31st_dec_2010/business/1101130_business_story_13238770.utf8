The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Uniform gas price panel in pipeline
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Uniform gas price panel in pipeline
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sundareshan: New proposal                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 29: The oil ministry has sought the Planning Commissions intervention to have uniform gas pricing for all users.         
	An expert group of the commission should suggest a mechanism for uniform pricing, oil secretary S. Sundareshan said.         
	We have suggested to the Planning Commission that a committee be formed on the pooled pricing of gas, Sundareshan said at a Ficci conference here.        
	A pooled price  or averaging out of multiple rates  for natural gas may be necessary in view of the limited domestic availability and increasing reliance on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet demand.        
	The price of domestic natural gas ranges between $2.71 and $5.73 per million British thermal unit (mBtu), while LNG on long-term contract is imported at $6.92 per mBtu and bought from spot market at around $8.52 per mBtu.        
	According to Sundareshan, the committee could be headed by the plan panel adviser (energy) and include the GAIL (India) chairman, managing director and CEO of Petronet LNG, secretary of Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board and director (finance) of ONGC.        
	The modalities of price pooling could then then be worked out within six to eight months, he said.        
	The oil ministry had commissioned a study by Spanish consultant Mercados International on the feasibility of pooling of over a dozen different rates at which gas is sold.        
	Mercados had suggested separate pools for fertiliser and power sectors  a proposal involving several complex inter-ministerial issues.        
	According to global consultancy firm McKinsey, the current gas demand of 166mmscmd (million standard cubic metres of gas per day)  met by supplies of around 132mmscmd from domestic fields and the rest through imports  is likely to grow to at least 230mmscmd and to a maximum of 320mmscmd by 2015.        
	Analysts said clarity on pricing was important as the share of natural gas in the countrys energy basket was expected to rise substantially from 10 per cent. A uniform gas pricing is necessary for healthy competition but it cannot be achieved without having a pipeline network.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | The cutting edge 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      The cutting edge 
        Ulips will score over mutual fund-term insurance combo under the new norms, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Last week, we discussed in this column how policyholders of unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) have little to gain from the new rules that come into effect in September.         
	The changes introduced by the IRDA is aimed at ensuring that Ulips are seen more as insurance rather than as investment products.        
	While customers may not be so keen on the cover part as they want to earn higher returns, insurers, too, wont be interested in selling Ulips as the agents commission would get substantially reduced because of the changes in various charges.         
	Tax concern        
	The next big question is whether the tax benefits for Ulips will undergo any change when the new tax regime kicks in from April 2011.         
	According to the revised draft of the direct taxes code, policies with a sum assured of more than 20 times the annualised premium will get the benefits of EEE (exempt-exempt-exempt) taxation rules. So, what about the schemes having sum assured of less that 20 times the annual premium?        
	The revised draft also doesnt change the definition of insurance plans that are eligible for EEE benefits.         
	Revenue secretary Sunil Mitra, who was recently in Calcutta, said the finance ministry had received several representations on inclusion of Ulips for EEE benefit. But we shall also have to take into account the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) when we prepare the final draft of the tax code for consideration of the Parliamentary standing committee, he said.        
	Under IFRS, an insurance contract must have significant insurance component. For Ulips, the insurance regulator defines this minimum cover at 105 per cent of the annualised premium, that is only 5 per cent will be in excess of what you pay as premium, at all times throughout the policy term.        
	Withdrawal benefit        
	Also, if withdrawals are made taxable for Ulips, they will be treated as capital gains similar to mutual funds. But does that make mutual funds a better choice over Ulips? Perhaps no. Ulips will score over mutual funds in terms of the investment return with the insurance cover providing the added benefit.         
	Earlier, we had written that a combination of mutual fund and term insurance works better than an Ulip. But the calculations have changed after the insurance regulator capped charges in Ulips from January this year.         
	Before we explain how, let us first understand that insurers deduct a mortality charge to provide the life cover. The mortality charge is deducted from your premium until your investment fund outgrows the sum assured.         
	In a traditional insurance product, the policyholder doesnt get to know these costs. In Ulips, the cost structure is so complex that it is often not easily understood by the common man. Hence, the insurance regulator made it mandatory for insurers to provide benefit illustrations on the basis of two assumed rates of investment return, 10 per cent and 6 per cent, so that the policyholder gets to know how his/her investment will grow net of all policy related charges and can compare various Ulips on the basis of these benefit illustrations.        
	There are two types of Ulips sold in the market. The most common type are those where the death benefit is higher of the sum assured or the fund value. In the second type, the death benefit is the sum assured plus the fund value.        
	While the first kind gives better investment return, the mortality benefits are higher in the second type.        
	Policyholders gain        
	Let us explain how a policyholder stands to gain by investing in either of these two types rather than choosing insurance and investment separately.        
	For illustration, we chose SBI Lifes Unit Plus Elite II plan that offers a Gold cover where higher of the sum assured or the fund value is paid on death of the policyholder, and a Platinum cover where the sum assured plus the fund value is paid as death benefit.        
	Let us also assume that a 30-year-old policyholder chooses a premium paying term for 10 years, while the policy runs till 20 years. For an annual premium of Rs 1 lakh and sum assured of Rs 10 lakh, the maturity value of the policy under the Gold cover is nearly Rs 35 lakh (see table). Under the Platinum cover, it will be Rs 34,15,032.         
	Also note that the policyholders investment fund (under the Gold cover plan) grows enough to match the sum assured after paying the premium for eight years.         
	Combo view        
	If instead he chooses an investment combination of a mutual fund growing at a similar 10 per cent gross rate (before deduction of any charges) and Aegon Religare Lifes iTerm policy  the cheapest term assurance plan available in the market  having a sum assured of Rs 10 lakh for 10 years (to make it comparable with Unit Plus Elite II Gold cover), the death benefit will be higher till the first 10 years. This is because if he dies within 10 years, his nominee will get the Rs 10 lakh insurance payment under the iTerm policy plus the investment value in mutual funds.         
	However, if he lives for 20 years, his benefit from the Elite II Gold plan will be nearly Rs 2.5 lakh more than the mutual fund plus term assurance combination. The Elite II Platinum cover, on the other hand, beats the mutual fund-term insurance combo plan (here the iTerm plan is chosen for 20 years to make it compatible with the Plantinum policy) both in terms of death as well as survival benefits since the beginning.         
	This explains why mutual funds are losing investors to life insurance companies. After the new norms come into force from September, Ulips will prove to be a more lucrative option for investors.

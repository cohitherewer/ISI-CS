	Calcutta, April 15: Scheduled commercial banks have nearly doubled their investments in PSU stocks from August last year to February, while reducing their exposure to mutual funds.        
	According to data available with the Reserve Bank of India, banks investments in shares of companies stood at Rs 30,417 crore as on February 26, 2010, up from Rs 27,302 crore as on August 28 last year.         
	Within the equity portfolio, investments in PSU stocks increased to Rs 4,143 crore from Rs 2,247 crore during the period under review.         
	At the end of January this year, they invested Rs 3,001 crore in the shares of public sector companies.         
	A large chunk of banks investment, particularly of public sector banks, went into the follow-on public offerings of NTPC and Rural Electrification Corporation, said a senior bank official.         
	Besides, PSU stocks were available cheaper than private sector companies making them a good investment bet, he added.        
	Banks had been shifting their investments from debt and bond papers to equities since October last year when the RBI started tightening its monetary policy by sucking excess liquidity out of the banking system.        
	With further monetary tightening in January this year through a hike in the cash reserve ratio followed by increases in repo and reverse repo rates in March, bond/debt investments have become a loss-making proposition.

	Consequently, and also because of an improvement in credit offtake, banks started shifting their investments out of mutual funds to equities.        
	As on August 28, banks investment in mutual funds stood at Rs 1,51,498 crore. It got reduced to Rs 1,20,512 crore at the end of January this year and further declined to Rs 1,09,453 crore as on February 26.        
	Banks also significantly reduced their investments in government securities eligible for statutory investment (SLR) to Rs 13,79,296 crore from Rs 14,01,558 crore at the end of January.         
	After reporting a significant profit from treasury operations last year, banks are expected to suffer mark-to-market losses from investments in debt/bond papers this year because of a rising interest rate regime.

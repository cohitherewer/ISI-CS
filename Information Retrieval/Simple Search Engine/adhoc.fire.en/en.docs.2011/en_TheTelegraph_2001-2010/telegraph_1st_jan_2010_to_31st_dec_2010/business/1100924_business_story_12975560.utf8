          OUR BUREAU                               
	Mumbai, Sept. 23: Kerala-based Muthoot Pappachan Group has picked up a one per cent stake in Catholic Syrian Bank (CSB) and is keen to raise its stake to 5 per cent in the private lender.         
	Muthoot acquired the stake through open market transactions, but the deal size could not be ascertained. It comes just after Edelweiss Capital raised its stake in CSB to 4.9 per cent from under one per cent by buying shares from Bangkok-based Sura Chansrichawla, the single largest shareholder in the unlisted bank.         
	Chansrichawla, who holds 24 per cent in the bank, has been looking to bring down his stake to 10 per cent to comply with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations.         
	According to the RBI norms, while the promoter holding in a private sector bank has to be 10 per cent, a non-promoter can hold up to 5 per cent.         
	The Thiruvananthapuram-based Rs 20,000-crore Muthoot Pappachan Group is into non-banking financial services such as gold, home and auto loans.         
	Muthoot Finance, its NBFC arm, has a network of over 800 branches across the country and is primarily into the gold loan business.         
	Larsen amp; Toubro holds around 2 per cent in CSB. Other shareholders include Federal Bank with a 5 per cent holding, Edelweiss Capital, a group of local investors having around 15 per cent and private equity funds that include Garfmore Private Equity, AIF Capital and Siguler Guff.         
	Federal Bank, also a Kerala-based bank, has been eyeing CSB over the past couple of years. However, the move did not fructify because of differences over valuations.         
	There were also attempts made by the Thrissur-based Catholic community to take over the bank by raising funds from non-resident Keralites.         
	CSB had a deposit portfolio of Rs 6,332 crore last fiscal and a loan book of Rs 3,683 crore. It had posted a net profit of Rs 37.18 crore on a total income of Rs 656.19 crore last fiscal.

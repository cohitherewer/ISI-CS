The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal bill to levy stamp duty on merger deals
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bengal bill to levy stamp duty on merger deals
          OUR BUREAU                          Dasgupta: Tax drive                                  
	Calcutta, July 26: Companies in Bengal may have to pay stamp duty on mergers and acquisitions.         
	State finance minister Asim Dasgupta today introduced a bill in the state assembly that proposed the duty for amalgamation, merger, reconstruction or demerger of companies under the decree or order of any civil court or tribunal.        
	Of late, we have been getting reports that many companies are merging various kinds of property and forming one company in order to avoid paying stamp duty as it is not applicable to such cases. Mostly chit funds have been doing this, Dasgupta said, while introducing the amendment to the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, in the assembly that requires the approval of the President.         
	He said the state was losing revenues between Rs 200 crore and Rs 300 crore on this count.         
	According to the proposed amendment, the transferee entity will have to pay a stamp duty of 2 per cent of the market value of the transferor companys immovable properties located in the state, or 0.5 per cent of the aggregate of market value of shares issued and consideration paid for such amalgamation, whichever is higher.        
	In addition, the bill has proposed that the duty should be applicable to long-term lease agreements.         
	There are also instances of people purchasing property on long-term lease to avoid paying stamp duty because payment of stamp duty doesnt exist in case of such transactions now. The buyer is enjoying the property but the government is being deprived of revenue, Dasgupta said.         
	According to Dasgupta, the rate of the stamp duty will be either 5 or 6 per cent of the property value in long-term leases.         
	The proposed levy on mergers and demergers of companies and long-term property lease agreements will fetch around Rs 500 crore revenue to the state. Stamp duties, annually, generate around Rs 2,000 crore now, up from Rs 300-400 crore a few years ago.        
	In 2009-10, the collections rose 27 per cent, while in the first three months of this fiscal, till June, they were up 48 per cent.        
	At present, the proposal of Srei Infrastructure Ltd to merge its subsidiary Quippo is pending before Calcutta High Court. If the enactment comes before the high court approval for the scheme, Srei will have to pay the stamp duty.        
	According to Ashvin Parekh of Ernst amp; Young, Maharashtra has the highest stamp duty of 4 per cent for mergers and amalgamations of companies, followed by Rajasthan, Delhi and Gujarat.         
	The proposed stamp duty in Bengal will work out much lower than Maharashtra. This will make mergers in Bengal more cost effective for companies, he added.        
	Parekh says when the goods and services tax (GST) takes effect, all states will have uniform duty.

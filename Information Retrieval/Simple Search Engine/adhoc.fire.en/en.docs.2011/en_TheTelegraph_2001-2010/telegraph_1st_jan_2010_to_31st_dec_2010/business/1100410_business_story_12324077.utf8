          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 9: India may soon have an official, quarterly real estate price index.        
	A committee formed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has suggested a mechanism to create a transparent real estate price index in an effort to keep a close watch on a growing asset bubble in the country, which has been fuelled by speculators out to make a fast buck.        
	It has now become contingent to monitor the price movements of the financial assets like equity and houses, lest unintended price rise leads to wasteful speculative investment, particularly by the households, that would turn out to be deleterious for growth and consumption in an economy, the committee said.        
	It said a realistic housing price index ought to be based on sale/resale property prices. It said the data could be sourced from 13 urban centres, including Calcutta.

	Calcutta, Sept. 8: NMDC plans to join hands with Tata Steel to wrest majority control of Australian firm Riversdale Mining, which is being wooed by Brazilian and Chinese firms as well.        
	Tata Steel holds a 24.21 per cent stake in the Sydney-based firm, which has large coking coal mines in Mozambique, Africa.        
	We are looking to invest in that company (Riversdale). The idea is to have a majority in the firm along with Tata Steel. It will be good for the country as it has limited coking coal resource, Rana Som, chairman of NMDC, told The Telegraph.        
	Though Som declined to comment on how much NMDC was ready to invest in Riversdale, he hinted at a 10 per cent stake acquisition. Whatever it takes to have a majority, Som said.        
	NMDC is sitting on Rs 12,854 crore in cash and cash equivalent as on March 31, 2010.         
	Brazils Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) has a 16.29 per cent stake in Riversdale.        
	Som was in Calcutta to attend a seminar organised by the CII along with Tata Steel managing director Hemant Nerurkar.        
	Nerurkar was not available for comment on the development. However, he held a brief meeting with Som just after the conclusion of the seminar.        
	Tata Steel and NMDC had signed up to work together in mining and steel projects earlier this year.        
	Meanwhile, Tata Steel has been scaling up its holding in Riversdale. The company raised its stake from 21.7 per cent to 24.21 per cent through market purchases in the last week of August, Tata Steel informed the Australian Stock Exchange.        
	Tata Steel also has a stake in one of Riversdales projects in Mozambique. It owns 35 per cent in Benga and Tete tenements, which have a coal reserve of 4 billion tonnes.        
	Tata Steel had bought 35 per cent in the Benga tenement for $86 million in 2007. Since then, the reserves have quadrupled following exploration work.        
	Tata Steel also bought 14 per cent of the holding company in 2009. It is the single largest shareholder, followed by CSN and Passport Capital.         
	Chinese firm Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Corporation has picked up a 40 per cent stake in another coal block Zambeze, adjacent to Benga. The Chinese firm is paying $800 million for the stake, valuing the Zambeze project, which has a 9-billion-tonne coal reserve, at $2 billion.

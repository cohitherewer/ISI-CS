The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | INDUSTRY SpEAK
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      INDUSTRY SPEAK
                                    
	Harsh Pati Singhania, President, Ficci        
	The finance minister has done a good balancing job. He has been able to contain the fiscal deficit at 6.9 per cent, which is very good. There is a big surprise and disappointment on MAT. The decrease in surcharge will be eaten by the increase in MAT.           
	Swati Piramal,  President, Assocham
    
	Mukherjee has sufficiently incentivised renewable energy, infrastructure, R amp;D and equipped these sectors with reasonably higher allocations. Giving tax credits on R amp;D is a major welcome step,   which will encourage innovation and reduce manufacturing cost.          
	Venu Srinivasan,   President, CII
    It is a very balanced and   responsible budget. The growth will continue with this budget.   The changes in income tax slabs   are a welcome step. The only dark   spot is increase in minimum   alternate tax.          
	Hemant Kanoria   Chairman amp; MD, Srei Infrastructure   Finance
    This year rsquo;s budget has been a well-balanced act with adequate emphasis on infrastructure, awareness on containment of fiscal deficit, implementation roadmap for Goods amp; Services Tax and Direct Tax Code, rationalisation of income tax slabs and impetus to   use of renewable energy. The increase in MAT will,   however, act as a deterrent. We were expecting   reinstatement of the benefits under Section 10-23(G) 
  of Income Tax Act, which did not happen.          
	A. Sakthivel   President, Fieo
    Exclusion of textiles, leather,   marine and gems and jewellery will add to the woes of these sectors   as some are still showing decline   while other exhibited growth on   very low base.          
	Uday Kotak,					 Vice-chairman, Kotak Mahindra Bank 
    The finance minister had played a balancing act of trying to get all the concerned actors on board for the GST. It will be credible if GST can be brought in by April 2011.          
	Shikha Sharma,   MD amp; CEO, Axis Bank
    The budget was an adroit exercise in balancing a thrust on key economic growth drivers, while focusing on fiscal consolidation. Reinforcing this increased fiscal transparency by committing to   provide subsidies in cash.          
	Harsh C. Mariwala,   CMD, Marico
    Increased outlay for rural development, agriculture and social   sector, and decrease in personal   income tax slab will help to increase   consumption, which is very good   for FMCG firms.
    
	Shivinder Mohan Singh,   MD, Fortis Healthcare  
	For healthcare, we don rsquo;t see any bold initiatives,   except for some reduction in duties on medical   equipment. However a robust economy and more   money in the hand will indirectly have a beneficial   impact on the healthcare sector.

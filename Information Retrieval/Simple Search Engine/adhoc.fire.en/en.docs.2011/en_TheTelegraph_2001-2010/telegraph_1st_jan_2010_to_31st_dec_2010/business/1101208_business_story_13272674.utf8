	Calcutta, Dec. 7: CESC Ltd plans to set up a hydro power plant  the first for the company in Arunachal Pradesh.         
	The company is planning a 90 megawatt (MW) facility at a cost of Rs 630 crore.         
	CESC vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said the company had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Arunachal Pradesh government for the construction of the Jarong Hydro Electricity project in West Siang district.         
	It is expected to be commissioned in 2015-16.        
	The company does not foresee any trouble in securing the environmental clearance within 15 months following which financial closure will be taken up.        
	The power station involves the construction of a diversion barrage. The company claims there will be no submergence of habitation.        
	The project will have a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30, and financial closure will be done within 18 months.        
	Goenka said CESC planned to create a 500MW hydel power capacity in the next six years by setting up new facilities or through acquisitions. We are looking for inorganic growth in north and the Northeast. Discussions are on, but I cannot divulge anything more now.         
	So far, CESC has relied on thermal power. It has a capacity of 1,225MW servicing the Calcutta distribution area.        
	The company aims to have 6,500MW capacity in thermal, 500MW in hydel and 200MW in solar energy within six years.        
	This will entail an investment of Rs 35,000 crore. To finance this, CESC will have to chip in Rs 8,700 crore equity.         
	In the next five years, we hope to have Rs 5,500 crore through internal accruals and Rs 2,000 crore in private equity (PE) capital, while the rest will be raised as equity, Goenka said.        
	He said global PE firms were queuing up for a stake in Haldia Energy, a CESC subsidiary. The deal will be finalised by January-end. Goenka indicated he would divest 20 per cent equity to PE firms.        
	CESC is planning new projects in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Orissa and Bengal.

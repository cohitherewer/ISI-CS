The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oberois to queue up for EIH rights issue
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Oberois to queue up for EIH rights issue
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 1: The promoters of EIH Ltd  who include the Oberoi family  have said they will subscribe to their full entitlement of shares in the luxury hotel chains forthcoming Rs 1,300-crore rights issue.        
	In its draft letter of offer, EIH said the promoter group reserved its right to subscribe to its entitlement of equity shares in the rights issue, either by itself or through a combination of entities belonging to the promoter group.         
	They will also subscribe to the rights shares that other shareholders renounce. Under Sebi rules, promoters must indicate whether they intend to subscribe to the shares or renounce them.        
	The development comes after ITC  the cigarettes-to-hotels company that has built up a formidable 14.98 per cent stake in the hotel chain  indicated recently that it would subscribe to its full entitlement of the rights shares.        
	Last month, Reliance Industries had picked up a 14.8 per cent stake in EIH and was largely seen as a white knight rushing to the aid of the Oberois to help them ward off a takeover threat from ITC. Any investor who picks up 15 per cent of the stock in a company must come out with an open offer to buy another 20 per cent from minority shareholders.        
	Ambanis entry into EIH had triggered speculation that the Oberois would renounce at least a part of their rights shares in favour of RIL. This was seen as one way that RIL could breach the 15 per cent threshold without triggering an open offer. Max India chairman Analjit Singh, who has a 4 per cent stake in EIH Ltd, may also subscribe to his entitlement if the issue is attractively priced.         
	With all the major shareholders indicating that they will subscribe to the rights shares, the spotlight has now turned to their pricing.         
	Under the rules, the company has the freedom to fix the price. RIL had paid an average of Rs 180 per EIH share  a roughly 36 per cent premium to the prevailing market share  when it acquired its 14.8 per cent holding.        
	Analysts had speculated that EIH might price the issue at a significant premium and that RIL would corner the renounced shares.        
	That theory does not seem to wash at this point as the promoters will also subscribe to the shares that others renounce.

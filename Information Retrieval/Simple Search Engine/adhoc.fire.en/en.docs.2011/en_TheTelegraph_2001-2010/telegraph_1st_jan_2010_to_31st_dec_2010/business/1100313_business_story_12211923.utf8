                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      NMDC pulls it off
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Mumbai, March 12: The public issue of National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) managed to squeak through today with active support from the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).        
	After a poor start on March 10, the follow-on public offering was fully subscribed today with the LIC bidding for around 75 per cent of the book.        
	Data available from the NSE showed that the offer was subscribed 1.23 times. Against the total issue size of 33.2 crore shares, it received bids for 40.9 crore shares.         
	Most of the bids came in at the lower end of the price band of Rs 300 per share. The upper end of the band had been fixed at Rs 350 per share.        
	The issue constitutes up to 8.38 per cent of its post offer paid-up equity capital. NMDC offered a discount of 5 per cent to the offer price to retail investors.         
	Among the investor categories, the FPO saw the highest subscription from qualified institutional buyers, particularly domestic financial institutions. While 16.52 crore shares were reserved for this category, it received bids for 25.72 crore shares.         
	It is understood that the LIC alone pumped in roughly Rs 7,500 crore, though this could not be confirmed.         
	Foreign institutional investors bid for only 31.77 lakh shares.        
	The response from retail investors was abysmal with bids received for just 33.02 lakh shares out of the 11.56 crore shares reserved for this category.         
	While the employee portion was fully subscribed, companies also put in bids for 2,22,240 shares.        
	Market circles said the reason behind most of the investors showing a poor response to the FPO was because of its steep pricing.        
	With the NMDC offering drawing to a close, the focus of attention is the governments target to raise Rs 25,958 crore in the current fiscal through divestment.         
	The Centre has already raised over Rs 13,500 crore by divesting stakes in NHPC, Oil India, NTPC and Rural Electrification Corporation.

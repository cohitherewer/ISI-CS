          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, March 3: The sensex today breached the 17000 mark to end at 17000.01 with a gain of 227 points on the back of a strong showing by Reliance Industries and after-budget buying across various counters.        
	The BSE benchmark index was not alone  the Nifty of the National Stock Exchange also mounted the 5000-mark to close to 5088.10.         
	All sectoral indices on the BSE made gains, but RIL was the highlight of the day. Broking circles said investors were relieved to know that the LyondellBasell board had rejected RILs offer of $14.5 billion for the petrochemicals firm. There was a fear that a bidding war may ensue for LyondellBasell and that RIL may have to overpay to acquire the company, an analyst said. Reliance rose 3.90 per cent to close at Rs 1,021.95.         
	Dealers said equities were strong throughout the day and there was no profit-booking at higher levels. Institutions particularly, the foreign institutional investors, bought stocks across various counters. Oil and gas, realty, power, FMCG and banking led the list of gainers among the sectoral indices.        
	The 30-share barometer opened at 16778.29 and touched a high of 17012.61 before closing with a gain 1.36 per cent.

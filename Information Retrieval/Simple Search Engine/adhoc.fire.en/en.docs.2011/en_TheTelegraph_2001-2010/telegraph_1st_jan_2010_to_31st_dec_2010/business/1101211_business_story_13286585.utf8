          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Factory output grew 10.8 per cent in October against just 4.4 per cent a month ago, aided by a strong demand for consumer durables, electronic and capital goods The good show raised hopes of a double-digit growth in industrial production this fiscal.         
	This is quite encouraging. I hope this trend will continue and double-digit growth in industry will be possible, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said.        
	However, he pegged the economic growth at 8.75 per cent for this fiscal. I am a bit conservative so I will be happy if it is 8.75 per cent. Mukherjee expressed concern over the financial crisis in Europe, which accounts for 36 per cent of Indias exports.         
	The growth in the index of industrial production (IIP) had surged to 13.8 per cent in July but fell to 5.6 per cent in August and 4.4 per cent in September.        
	The trend is encouraging. All the three important sectors  industry, agriculture and services  are evenly growing and contributing to the GDP (gross domestic product), which is a healthy sign, Mukherjee said.        
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist with Crisil, said, Combining this (IIP data) with the GDP data, I think the economy is in good shape. We have seen a lot of volatility in IIP, which is worrying, but the second half of this fiscal will see a slower growth than the first. In terms of industries, as many as 15 out of the 17 industry groups have shown positive growth in October compared with the corresponding month of the previous year.        
	Volatility in the capital goods number should be observed carefully before confirming a definite trend, we do believe the investment activity in the economy has remained buoyant, Arun Singh, an economist with Dun and Bradstreet India, said         
	The high growth registered by consumer durables, primarily backed by the robust performance in automobile, is also encouraging. However, the gradual moderation witnessed in the demand in the automobile segment, recently, might lead to some abatement in consumer durables, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stimulus exit linked to growth show
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stimulus exit linked to growth show
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Sen: Number watch                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The government could wait for the growth figures of this fiscal to be announced in May and then take a call on the rollback of stimulus measures. The latest numbers would give the true picture of demand in the system, chief statistician Pronab Sen said today.        
	Economic growth numbers for the current fiscal will be released by May. The real picture will help the government decide if stimulus packages could be rolled back, said Sen.        
	A change in the base year used to calculate the gross domestic product (GDP) may help reduce fiscal deficit for the current fiscal to 6.41 per cent from the earlier projected 6.8 per cent of GDP. India has changed the base year to 2004-05 from 1999-2000.        
	With the revision in the base year, the GDP at market prices for 2008-09 is estimated at Rs 55,74,449 crore against Rs 53,21,753 crore estimated in the earlier series and used in the fiscal deficit calculations for last years budget.         
	Indias fiscal deficit for 2008-09 was 6.2 per cent of GDP and stood at Rs 3.5 lakh crore.        
	However, some analysts said the statistical advantage of a lower fiscal deficit was unlikely to change the thinking of key policy makers in the government that India needed to curb spending.         
	This is just a statistical benefit ... the government should start tightening now and come out with a credible strategy for reducing its fiscal deficit, said D.K. Joshi, principal economist of Crisil.         
	The government was expected to announce the withdrawal of stimulus measures in the annual budget on February 26 because of a strong growth in domestic demand and output.        
	Industrial growth for November stood at 11.7 per cent against 2.5 per cent a year back. For the first eight months, industrial production grew 7.6 per cent against 4.1 per cent a year ago.        
	Earlier, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said the government would not phase out its stimulus measures till the world economy firmly recovered and signals were strong.        
	Industry captains, during their meeting with Mukherjee on January 4, had also argued that the measures were necessary to sustain growth.

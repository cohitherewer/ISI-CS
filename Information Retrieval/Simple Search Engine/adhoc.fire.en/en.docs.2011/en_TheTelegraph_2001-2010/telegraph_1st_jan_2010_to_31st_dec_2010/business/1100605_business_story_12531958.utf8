The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Orissa has faith in Mittal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Orissa has faith in Mittal
          SUBRAT DAS                      Mohanty: Optimistic                                
	Bhubaneswar, June 4: The Orissa government hopes that ArcelorMittal will not pull out from the state, a day after the steel behemoth signed a pact with Karnataka to set up a 6-million-tonne (mt) plant near Bellary at an investment of Rs 30,000 crore.        
	We are hopeful that ArcelorMittal will not pull out from Orissa, state industries, steel and mines minister Raghunath Mohanty said.         
	He said ArcelorMittal CEO Sanak Mishra had given a written commitment to them a few months back that the project would continue. The steel firm had signed an agreement with Orissa on December 21, 2006 to set up a 12mt plant at an estimated cost of Rs 40,000 crore at Patna tehsil in Keonjhar district. However, the project has made little headway.         
	The state had committed to provide 8,000 acres but has been unable to do so. Land has been identified in 15 villages under Patna tehsil to set up the facility and a civil township. Of the 8,000 acres required, 4,905 acres belong to individuals. The government owns 2,847 acres, while the remaining 754 acres are forest land.        
	Though the state government claims that the land acquisition process is at an advanced stage of completion, progress has been delayed because of agitation by the displaced families.        
	Arcelor had also inked an MoU with Jharkhand for a facility of the same size and cost in November 2006. The project has also met the same fate.        
	The projects in Jharkhand and Orissa faced land, forest and environment clearance issues and protests but the progress in Karnataka is much better, chairman Lakshmi Mittal has said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | DPSC gets a new owner
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      DPSC gets a new owner
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 28: The two-month long tussle over the sale of power generator DPSC came to an end today.        
	The three public sector shareholders  insurers LIC and GIC and Andrew Yule  transferred DPSCs shares to the Srei consortium and received a pay order in return.        
	The transaction was completed this evening in front of a special officer appointed by Calcutta High Court.        
	Following the deal, Orbis Powerventures will get a 57.17 per cent stake held earlier by the LIC, the GIC and Yule by paying Rs 171.85 crore.        
	Orbis is a special purpose vehicle set up by Indian Power Company and Srei Infrastructure Finance.        
	Kallol Datta, chairman of Yule, said he was relieved by todays development. I had a mandate. I am happy to complete that, he said.        
	Calcutta High Court had earlier directed Andrew Yule and the two insurers to transfer their combined holding to the highest bidder after Srei moved court for a speedy conclusion of the deal.        
	Yule initiated the move to sell DPSC two years back, but the exercise got entangled in a legal quagmire.        
	The company wanted to sell its shares to raise money to repay an interest-free loan to the Centre.        
	We are going to pay back Rs 73 crore to the government next week, Datta said.        
	Yule got Rs 63 crore from sale of shares to Phoenix Yule and another Rs 45 crore from the divestment in DPSC.        
	However, there are two cases pending in the Supreme Court.         
	One has been filed by Descon, the largest shareholder in DPSC, and the other by the Trinamul Congress backed DPSC union. The cases are to be heard tomorrow.        
	Srei and IPC had emerged as the highest bidder in an auction on November 20, 2009, to buy DPSC, formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Corporation, by agreeing to pay Rs 710 a share, trumping Descons offer of Rs 705 a share.        
	Orbis is supposed to come out with an open offer shortly after the deal is concluded.

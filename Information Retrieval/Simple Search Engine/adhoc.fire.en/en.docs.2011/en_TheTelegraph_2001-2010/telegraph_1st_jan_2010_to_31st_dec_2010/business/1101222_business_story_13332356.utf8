	Mumbai, Dec. 21: Shares of Mahindra Satyam shot up 9 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) as the company announced its plans to relist on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).         
	Speaking at the companys annual general meeting, chairman Vineet Nayyar said the company was expected to complete its accounts under the US accounting standards  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)  in about six to eight months. After that Mahindra Satyam would relist.         
	The move is significant as analysts expect the company will find it easier to attract US-based clients, who prefer vendors to meet GAAP requirements.         
	Shares of Mahindra Satyam closed at Rs 69.05 today, up 8.83 per cent over the previous days close of Rs 63.45.         
	Mahindra Satyam  the erstwhile Satyam Computer Services  was badly hit last year after its founder Ramalinga Raju confessed to a massive accounting fraud and said that he had been cooking the books of the company for years. Subsequently, the company was taken over by Anand Mahindra-controlled Tech Mahindra.         
	In mid-October this year, Mahindra Satyams American depository receipts were transferred to the over-the-counter market after the company missed its December 15 deadline to file its results with the US authorities.        
	Focus regions        
	Mahindra Satyam will focus more on the European and Asia-Pacific (APAC) markets as part of its derisking strategy, Nayyar said.        
	Revenues from Europe and APAC grew 46.35 per cent during 2009-10 against 38.58 per cent last year. The firm will also focus on West Asia and Africa, while retaining its foothold in the US.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ban on pesky calls
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ban on pesky calls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sachin Pilot in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The government has asked telecom operators to ban all unwanted marketing calls and text messages sent to mobile phones.        
	Telecom operators have been asked to stop the increasing menace of sending unsolicited calls and messages, said Sachin Pilot, minister of state for communications.        
	The ministers warning came a day after the Supreme Court issued notices to Airtel, COAI and ICICI Bank and American Express over unsolicited calls.        
	Recently, during a debate in Parliament, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had informed the House that he got a call on loan offers from some company. It had evoked strong reaction from him as the call came in the middle of a debate on price rise in Parliament.        
	The department of telecom and Trai have already held necessary consultations to put a complete ban, said Pilot.         
	Operators seem to be unaware of the ban. We are not aware of any blanket ban. However, we are following all norms to curb unwanted calls, said an executive of a telecom service provider.        
	At present, mobile service providers and telemarketing firms need to maintain a list of numbers which do not want to receive marketing calls and ensure that such calls are not made. Violation could lead to penalty.

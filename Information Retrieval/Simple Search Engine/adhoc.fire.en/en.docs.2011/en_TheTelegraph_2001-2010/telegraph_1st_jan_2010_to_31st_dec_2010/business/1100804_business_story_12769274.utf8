The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dreamliner local debut next year
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Dreamliner local debut next year

	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Air India will get its first Boeing 787 Dreamliner early next year along with a hefty compensation for a two-year delay in the delivery of the wide-bodied plane. The national carrier could get another four to five Dreamliners next year.         
	The Dreamliner could help Air India cut its flying costs, and the compensation money would help to trim losses. Air India has run up losses of over Rs 7,200 crore.        
	According to the state-run carrier, it should get up to $710 million, or Rs 3,000 crore, as compensation. However, Boeing has offered a mere $145 million, or about Rs 700 crore.         
	Delays entitle Air India to a compensation. We are in talks with them, Boeing India president Dinesh Keskar said.         
	Air India officials expect Boeing to eventually agree to a compensation figure of between $300 million and $400 million, or Rs 1400-Rs 1800 crore.        
	The Dreamliner, which ran into delays, was finally showcased at the Farnborough Air show in the UK last month.        
	Air India executives said the Dreamliner, which offers passengers more space while sitting and moving within the craft, will be flown on medium-haul routes to Hong Kong and Singapore as well as on long-haul ones to Australia, the UK, the US and Europe.        
	Boeing sources said Air India could hope to get 5-10 Dreamliners in the first year.         
	According to Air India, the delay in Dreamliner delivery has cost it dearly. It was left with very few wide-bodied aircraft to run on the busy medium-haul routes such as Mumbai-Singapore.         
	It was forced to fly narrow-bodied aircraft, which are costlier to run on such distances and not too comfortable.         
	Earlier this year, in a deposition before a Parliamentary panel Air Indias chairman and managing director Arvind Jadhav had said, If you ask me do you want a B787, I have to say that I want the 787 I am not able to run profitably now on Gulf areas because I am using the smaller aircraft where I can use a larger aircraft. I am not able to run the Bangkok-Shanghai, Bangkok-Tokyo and other routes where the B 787 can work beautifully.        
	According to Air India, a B787 would have given around four times as much return as a B777. The internal rate of return (on investment) for the B787 was around 12.6 per cent, while for the B777, it was 2.6 per cent.        
	Boeing has orders for 860 Dreamliners from 56 countries, including 27 from Air India. The national carrier placed its B-787 order in December 2005.

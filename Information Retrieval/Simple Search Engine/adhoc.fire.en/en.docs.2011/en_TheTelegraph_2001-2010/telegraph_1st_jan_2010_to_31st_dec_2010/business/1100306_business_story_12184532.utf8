          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Singh :Imperative task        
	New Delhi, March 5: The government has identified 20 countries with whom it would enter into agreements  in the form of information exchange and general assistance  for the return of black money stashed away by Indians abroad.         
	Twenty countries have been prioritised for entering into agreements regarding exchange of information and systems in connection with taxes. Negotiations have been completed with the governments, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the Lok Sabha today.        
	Negotiations have been completed with the Bahamas and Bermuda and steps have been taken for the signing of agreements. We have also approached Switzerland for the renegotiation of our tax treaty so that we can have access to the information, Singh told the Lok Sabha.        
	In a written reply in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for finance S.S. Palanimanickam said the 20 prioritised countries were Bahamas, Bahrain, Congo, Liberia, Liechenstein, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Panama, Seychelles, St Kitts amp; Nevis, Maldives, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, the Netherlands and Macau.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has also ordered the renegotiation of 77 double-tax avoidance pacts.         
	India has signed double tax avoidance agreements with as many as 85 countries. We have sought comprehensive revision of our tax treaties with nearly 25 countries. In some cases, the requests have been sent directly while in other cases the matter has been taken up through diplomatic channels, officials said.        
	A 2006 report of the Swiss Banking Association has alleged that Indians were among the biggest depositors of black money in Swiss banks.         
	Indias black money abroad is believed to be more than its total foreign exchange reserves, according to some calculations. Indians have stashed away no less than $1.4 trillion in black money in Swiss banks, according to reports based on the findings of the Swiss Banking Association document.        
	Revenue officials said new checks were being contemplated which could verify from where the money actually came from without scaring off genuine investors.         
	Mauritius ranks first among all countries in FDI inflows to India with cumulative investments amounting to $45 billions, or 44 per cent of total FDI flows.

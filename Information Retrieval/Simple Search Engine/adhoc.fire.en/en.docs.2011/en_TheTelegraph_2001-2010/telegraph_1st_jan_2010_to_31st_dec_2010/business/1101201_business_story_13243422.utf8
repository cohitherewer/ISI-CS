The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Growth sows seeds of hope
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Growth sows seeds of hope
  - Target of 9% looks possible        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: Near 9 per cent growth rates in the first two quarters have given the government the hope of crossing the 9-per-cent-mark for the fiscal as well.        
	I always go by conservative estimates. According to IMF estimates the GDP growth would be more than 9 per cent. The IMF may be correct this time. Normally, I dont agree with the IMF. Perhaps this time, I may agree, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said.        
	The IMF in its World Economic Outlook had projected 9.7 per cent growth for India in the current calendar year, up from 9.4 per cent estimated in July.        
	Indias GDP grew 8.9 per cent in the second quarter; in the first quarter, the growth was 8.8 per cent but was revised to 8.9 per cent. Only China  with a 9.6 per cent growth  among the large economies has fared better than India in the July-September period. A year ago, Indias growth was 8.7 per cent, when the economy was rebounding strongly from the global financial crisis.        
	Chief economic adviser Kaushik Basu said it was possible to record 9 per cent growth this fiscal. It is not impossible any more. We are very close to that.         
	Faster growth is boosting revenues for the government, making room for it to cut the fiscal deficit to a targeted 5.5 per cent of GDP from a 16-year high of 6.9 per cent last year.        
	During the second quarter, the farm sector recorded a growth rate of 4.4 per cent, up from 0.9 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago because of a good monsoon. The growth in the sector has been higher than the level of 2.5 per cent in the April-June quarter.        
	However, analysts were cautious. The revival in farm output from its drought-induced trough in 2009 has pushed up GDP in the second quarter. Farm output has grown at the fastest rate in 11 quarters. Maintaining this growth rate is almost impossible.        
	Manufacturing grew at a rate of 9.8 per cent during the second quarter compared with 8.4 per cent during the same period last year. However, the growth was slower than the 13 per cent recorded in the quarter ended June.        
	Investment in manufacturing has been slowing down which is visible from the decline in the growth rate in the sector on a quarterly basis, Deloittes principal economist Shanto Ghosh said.        
	While construction sector grew 8.8 per cent, trade, hotels, transport and communication surged 12.1 per cent; financial institutions and services grew 8.3 per cent, social services 7.3 per cent, mining 8 per cent and electricity 3.4 per cent.        
	These numbers are reassuring, especially with monetary and fiscal stimulus being withdrawn  it shows the resilience of this recovery, D.K. Joshi, chief economist at ratings agency Crisil, said.        
	Chandrajit Banerjee, director-general, CII, said the recovery in agriculture is likely to have a positive impact on rural demand in the coming quarters and maintain the positive momentum in the economy.         
	Rising car sales and expanding bank credit provide evidence of growing consumer demand.        
	Some analysts believe the strong performance may prompt the central bank to introduce further monetary tightening steps to restrict inflation, running at 8.58 per cent in October.        
	Interest rates have been raised six times since the start of the year, and the Reserve Bank has said bringing down inflation remains a priority.         
	It had increased its short-term lending (repo) and borrowing (reverse repo) rates by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent and 5.25 per cent, respectively. The RBIs next monetary policy review is on December 16.        
	The RBI will decide on monetary action depending on the behaviour of inflation in December, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Apex court accepts Vodafone request
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Apex court accepts Vodafone request
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 26 (PTI): The Supreme Court today allowed British telecom giant Vodafone to deposit Rs 2,500 crore through banking wire transfer instead of a bank draft.        
	The apex court also postponed the date of hearing to July 19 from the earlier scheduled date of February 5.        
	Wire transfer is a method of electronic funds transfer from one person or institution to another.        
	A bench headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia allowed the Vodafone plea after the company counsel and senior advocate Harish Salve submitted that the money would come through international transactions.        
	We need to transfer this amount directly from bank to the Supreme Court registry. It would save us a lot of money, Salve said. In case of a bank draft it would entail extra cost, he added.        
	Accepting it, the court said that Vodafone would deposit Rs 2,500 crore and a bank guarantee issued by any nationalised bank within three and eight weeks, respectively.        
	The bench also made it clear that the time period would start from November 15 when it had directed the company to deposit the sum.        
	The apex court had asked Vodafone to deposit Rs 2,500 crore and a bank guarantee of Rs 8,500 crore in its ongoing case in which the UK-based firm had challenged capital gains tax of Rs 11,000 crore from its acquisition of Hutchison shares.

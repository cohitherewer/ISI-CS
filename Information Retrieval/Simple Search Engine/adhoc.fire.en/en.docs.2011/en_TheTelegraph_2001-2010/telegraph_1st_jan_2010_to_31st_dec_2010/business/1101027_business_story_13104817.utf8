          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 26: Birla Corporation, an MP Birla group company, has reported a lower profit after tax in the second quarter at Rs 68.97 crore against Rs 152.05 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.         
	Turnover stood at Rs 550.34 crore compared with Rs 556.31 crore in the year-ago period.        
	The board has, however, declared an interim dividend of Rs 2.50 per share (25 per cent).        
	Birla Corp has attributed the decline in profit to a number of factors, including lower clinker production because of a shutdown of the plants for capacity expansion.        
	Harsh V. Lodha, chairman of Birla Corp, said the industry in general had seen pressure on prices as well as on demand in the second quarter. Increased supplies, on account of new capacities, compelled companies to sell at lower prices. This affected realisations in the central and eastern markets that are catered to by the companys plants at Satna and Durgapur, respectively.         
	TechM net        
	IT company Tech Mahindra has recorded a 10.13 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 186.65 crore for the quarter ended September 30 against Rs 169.47 crore in the year-ago period.

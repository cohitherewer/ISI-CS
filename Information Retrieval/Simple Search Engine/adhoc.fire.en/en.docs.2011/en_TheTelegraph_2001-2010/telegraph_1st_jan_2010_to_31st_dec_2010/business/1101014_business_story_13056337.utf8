The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | FII shopping spree propels sensex
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      FII shopping spree propels sensex
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 13: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) scooped up stocks in another buying frenzy on the bourses and sent the sensex surging by another 484 points to a 33-month high of 20687.         
	It was the biggest single-day gain in six months.        
	The FIIs, who have pumped in over $20 billion into domestic equities, showed no loss of appetite even as market pundits expressed some disquiet over the sudden and dramatic surge in recent weeks, which has made valuations look stretched and unsustainable. With the developed economies showing no signs of a firm recovery, the FIIs have turned to India and other emerging markets to protect their returns and profit margins.        
	However, there are experts who feel that current valuations are not all that expensive and expect more FII money to flow into equities.        
	The argument for this is predicated on expectation that the US Federal Reserve will pump in more money into that economy to jump-start the recovery. Some of this money will eventually flow into emerging market equities.        
	Brokers said apart from the FII interest, positive global cues and short-covering contributed to the rally.         
	After opening positive at 20223.45, the sensex was seen consistently building on its gains. With the European markets also in the green, the benchmark index hit a high of 20703.97, a gain of 500 points, and ended the day at 20687.88, a rise of 484.54 points, or 2.40 per cent. This is its best closing since January 14, 2008 and the gain was also the highest in single day since May 10 this year.         
	The NSE 50-share wide-based Nifty rose 2.31 per cent to close at 6231.50.        
	Incidentally, the rally came when Coal India is set to raise over Rs 15,000 crore from investors through Indias largest IPO. Though there have been some apprehensions that such a large IPO has the potential to drain money away from the secondary markets, current indications seem to bely that.         
	Experts feel that the offering will bring more foreign investors into the markets.        
	With only two days left for Infosys to declare its second-quarter numbers, IT stocks hogged the limelight. Expectations that the sector will report robust numbers sparked huge buying in these stocks. The BSE IT index led the list of percentage gainers, rising 3.15 per cent. Stocks such as TCS rose 4.56 per cent to Rs 992.40 and Infosys gained 2.48 per cent to Rs 3,151.20.

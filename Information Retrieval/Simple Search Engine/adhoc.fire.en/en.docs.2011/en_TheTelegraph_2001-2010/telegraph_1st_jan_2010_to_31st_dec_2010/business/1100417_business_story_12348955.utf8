          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mukherjee, Subbarao: Gauging the situation                                 
	New Delhi, April 16: Reserve Bank governor Duvvuri Subbarao today met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee just days ahead of its policy review as expectations built up of a possible rate hike by the central bank to douse inflation that was simmering around a double-digit level.        
	I have come to review the macroeconomic situation with the finance minister, Subbarao told reporters later. Officials said the meeting was part of the Reserve Banks pre-monetary policy consultation with the finance minister. They said the central bank would send out a strong signal favouring growth, while acting to control inflation. The monetary policy review is on April 20.        
	The meeting comes at a time the Opposition plans to corner the government by bringing in a cut motion against the Finance Bill over rising prices. They plan to force the government to roll back the prices of diesel and petrol. A cut motion puts the strength of the government in the Lok Sabha to test. If it is adopted, the government stands defeated on a money matter and has to resign.        
	While economists expect the RBI to tighten money supply to cool down surging prices in its policy review on April 20, the governments chief economic adviser Kaushik Basu said there were other intervention options as well that the government could take.        
	You are probably going to see a little bit of different kinds of interventions. I dont know whether its going to be monetary intervention. There are things that we are planning in terms of pulses, food release and sugar, he said.        
	Basu expects inflation, which touched 9.9 per cent in March, to start falling steeply after a few months. I believe inflation is still high. Still of concern. We do need policies for that (containing it), but probably inflation has peaked. It (inflation) is going to be on a downward trajectory slowly for 2-3 months and then rapidly thereafter.         
	However, most bankers expect the RBI to hike the key overnight lending rate by about half a per cent. Though some expect it to simply raise the cash reserve ratio, which is the proportion of money banks have to compulsorily keep with the central bank.         
	Besides, the government has also notified sale of bonds worth Rs 12,000 crore. These bonds mature in 2016, 2020 and 2027, and their auctions are also expected to check prices.         
	N. Bhanumurthy, economist with the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said, I think the RBI may well be inclined to a 50-basis-point hike but the finance ministry will be comfortable with 25 basis points. That is where I think the discussions are happening.

          DAVID JOLLY                          Dieter Zetsche in Brussels on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	Paris, April 7: Renault, Nissan Motor and Daimler unveiled a strategic partnership today under which they will share small-car technology and power trains, an agreement they said would allow them to better compete in an environment where auto makers are rapidly joining forces to cut costs.         
	With auto markets in developed nations still hobbled in the wake of the financial crisis, car manufacturers are under pressure to gain scale and reduce expenses.         
	Dieter Zetsche, the Daimler chief executive, said at a signing ceremony in Brussels that the agreement marks the beginning of a very promising relationship and that Daimler would benefit from access to Nissan and Renaults small car technology. He said the deal made sense because the companies operations were largely complementary.         
	We are strengthening our competitiveness in the small and compact car segment and are reducing our CO2 footprint, both on a long-term basis, Zetsche said.         
	The five-year agreement initially calls for joint development of the next-generation Smart ForTwo and Renault Twingo cars, including the electric versions. The Renault-Nissan alliance agreed to provide diesel and gasoline engines to Daimler for its Smart car line-up.

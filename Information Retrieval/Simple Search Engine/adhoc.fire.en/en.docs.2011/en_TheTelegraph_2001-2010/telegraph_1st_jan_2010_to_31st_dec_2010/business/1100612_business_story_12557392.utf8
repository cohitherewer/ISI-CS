          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 11: C.S. Verma, the new chairman of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), today said he would look to expand the companys product portfolio of specialised steel and forgings to improve margins.        
	Verma, who took over as the SAIL chief today, also said he would step up acquisition of coking coal mines abroad to secure long-term raw material supply. Verma was earlier director (finance) of Bhel.         
	At present, value-added products account for 37 per cent of our sales. This needs to be increased in the new scenario. We will look at making specialised steel and forgings needed by nuclear plants, power plants, defence and space organisations, Verma said in an interaction with reporters after taking charge.        
	On foreign acquisitions, Verma said, Let me study whether we will do this through joint ventures already established for this or whether we need to activate our own department.        
	The SAIL chief said he was open to picking up stakes in projects such as nuclear plants to which the PSU would supply raw material.                          
	Spanning around 29 years, Vermas career profile includes stints as director (finance) of ITI Ltd, group general manager of Indian Railway Finance Corp and general manager of Delhi Stock Exchange. He also worked in a financial institution for about nine years.        
	SAIL, which has been recently given the maharatna status, will be divesting 10 per cent equity in two tranches. The company is in the process of implementing a Rs 60,000-crore modernisation amp; expansion plan.        
	Before Verma, SAILs director (finance) Soiles Bhattacharya had taken over from S. K.Roongta as the interim chairman on June 1. Bhattacharya will continue for a few more months as director (finance) before retiring.

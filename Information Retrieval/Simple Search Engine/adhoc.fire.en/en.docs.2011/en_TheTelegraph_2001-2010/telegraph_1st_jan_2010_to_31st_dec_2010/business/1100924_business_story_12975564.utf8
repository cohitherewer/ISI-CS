The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wider bond berth for foreigners
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Wider bond berth for foreigners
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: FIIs can invest up to $10 billion in government bonds against $5 billion earlier. In corporate bonds, the government has raised the limit of FII investment to $20 billion from $15 billion.        
	The institutional handicaps that FIIs were facing have been removed, said finance minister Pranab Mukherjee after the cap was raised.         
	Finance ministry officials said the hike in cap was a smart way to address what FIIs have been clamouring for quite some time while ensuring we get a good response to the various government paper issues we come out with.        
	However, FIIs can invest the additional $5 billion for corporate bonds only in infrastructure companies (minimum five-year maturity); the additional $5 billion in government bonds can only be in papers that have a maturity of at least five years.        
	Officials said, The higher investment cap will help garner investment in the infrastructure sector. The raise in investment limits in bonds with a maturity of at least five years is a good thing as it means that money will flow into longer term bonds. We see the hand of the RBI in this. The central bank does not like too much of short-term inflows coming in, said analysts.         
	A bond trader with a transnational bank said, The government has started playing the market, increasing limits when it wants to issue paper. Its a classic for a federal authority and closely mirrors what the Chinese have been doing.         
	Borrowing less        
	The government will borrow Rs 1.63 lakh crore during the next six months, slightly less than its budgeted target for the October-March period. The original plan was to borrow some Rs 1.7 lakh crore through bond issues.        
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla said, Looking at the projected cash flows and funding requirements, it is not necessary to raise the entire amount. So we are reducing it by Rs 10,000 crore.        
	The lower borrowings are because of better-than-expected revenue earnings from the auction of 3G telecom spectrum and rising tax revenues.

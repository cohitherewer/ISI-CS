The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Next 3G auction in 2012
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Next 3G auction in 2012
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Clear signal                                   
	New Delhi, June 28: A repeat of last months blockbuster 3G spectrum auction is likely in 2012, with the government working in tandem with BSNL and the defence ministry to ensure the release of radiowaves by defence.        
	Under the agreements between the department of telecom (DoT) and the defence ministry in May last year, the armed forces will vacate 5 megahertz (Mhz) of third generation (3G) spectrum by December 2012 if Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) completes the roll-out of an alternative optic fibre network for defence.        
	The timeline for the construction of alternative communication network for the armed forces is on track. We are also in talks with the defence for timely release of radiowaves, said DoT officials.        
	The additional 5 megahertz of 3G spectrum will be put up for auction.        
	The government raised Rs 1,06,000 crore from the recent sale of 3G and broadband spectrum, against the finance ministrys budget target of just Rs 35,000 crore.        
	With the revenue generated being more than three times the ministrys target, the government is keen on selling all future radiowaves over which mobile calls travel.        
	The sale of radiowaves not only adds to the governments kitty, it also ensures that operators who have paid market rates for an asset utilise it in an efficient manner, said officials.        
	The armed forces have agreed to vacate radiowaves in stages depending on the progress of the alternative optic fibre network.        
	With BSNL ready to select optical fibre cable suppliers and place orders for equipment by next month, the DoT expects to get 10 Mhz of spectrum in August, which will be allocated to operators to start commercial high-speed services by September.        
	Defence has already given 10Mhz of 3G spectrum for use by BSNL and MTNL.        
	Equipment on the optic fibre network will be installed between November 30, 2010 and March 31, 2012, while acceptance, testing and commissioning would be undertaken by December 2012, said officials. Defence forces will be able to move to the alternative network by early 2013.

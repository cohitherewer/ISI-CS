	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Global wagon makers such as Bombardier and Mitsubishi Electric are among firms keen to participate with Konkan Railway in the commercial deployment of Skybus, an innovative urban transportation mode.        
	We have spent Rs 60 crore to develop the technology and test track for the Skybus. Now, we want a partner, who could take this forward for commercial opportunities. For that we have called a global expression of interest, Bhanu Tayal, Konkan Railways managing director, said.        
	He said there have been several queries about the EoI and some global players have responded positively.         
	While the last date for submission is January 10, 2011, the corporation expects to sign on a partner by March. Konkan Railway plans to commercially deploy the Skybus with a strategic partner on a revenue sharing basis.        
	The Skybus runs on a track like trains but unlike trains, it hangs below the track, which is laid on concrete pillars over road traffic. It comprises suspended light weight coaches that run well above the regular road traffic and can travel up to 100 km per hour. It can be built over the central road dividers.        
	Konkan Railway holds several patents for the Skybus technology and sees the growing urbanisation across the globe as an opportunity to market the product with a strategic partner.        
	The Skybus as a technology is cheaper than both the Metro and Monorail. Besides, it has better manoeuvrability as it can take sharp turns which a Metro or a Mono rake cannot, Tayal said.        
	Skybus technology is an innovative, environment-friendly and cost-effective alternative rail-based transportation system, A.K. Bharadwaj, chief electrical engineer, said.

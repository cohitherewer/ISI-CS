          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Sept. 24: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries today decided to split the face value of its shares from Rs 5 to Re 1 per share.         
	Suns board of directors approved the proposal in a meeting today.         
	The company will now take shareholders approval for the stock split.         
	News of the stock split was well received in the markets, with the Sun Pharma share rising 1.71 per cent, or Rs 32.35, to close at Rs 1,920.55 on the BSE today.         
	The move comes just two days after the company emerged victorious in the four-year battle to acquire Israels Taro Pharmaceutical Industries.         
	On Wednesday, Sun said it had completed the acquisition of a controlling stake in the Israeli unit.         
	Over the past few months, a number of companies have gone for a stock split. These include HDFC, Sterlite, Engineers India and Jayshree Tea.         
	Among pharmaceutical firms, Lupin went for a split when it brought down the face value of its shares to Rs 2 per share from Rs 10.         
	A stock split is seen as an investor friendly move as shares become more affordable, particularly among retail investors.         
	Experts feel the demand for shares also improves , leading to a higher price of the share over a period of time.

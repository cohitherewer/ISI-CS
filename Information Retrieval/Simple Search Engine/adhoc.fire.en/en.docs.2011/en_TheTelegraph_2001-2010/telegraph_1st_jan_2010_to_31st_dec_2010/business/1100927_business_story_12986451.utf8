The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | FIIs ignore cement basics
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      FIIs ignore cement basics
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 26: Cement stocks have grabbed the attention of investors, particularly FIIs, though firms are seeing muted demand and staring at an excess capacity of more than 54 million tonnes by the end of this fiscal.         
	According to analysts, the rally in cement shares may fizzle out soon as the industry lacks strong fundamentals. Cement prices are likely to remain soft over the next few months because of capacity additions. The sector is also expected to perform poorly in the second quarter.         
	Shares of cement companies touched new highs over the past few sessions with foreign institutional investors (FIIs) leading the pack of buyers on news of south-based producers hiking prices.         
	The development had its impact on share prices across the sector during this month. ACC, which hit a yearly high of Rs 1,028.95 on September 21, ended at Rs 1,012.30 on Friday compared with Rs 886.80 earlier in the month. Madras Cements gained nearly 16 per cent, while shares of India Cements and Ambuja Cements have also risen. The south-based companies have raised prices twice this month.         
	Manufacturers have cut their production and raised prices in the face of weak demand over fears of their EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation) turning negative, analysts said.        
	The rally in cement stocks is a prime example of the FII exuberance. Many of them are far expensive at current levels considering the fact that prices are likely to remain under pressure with huge capacity additions coming up and despatches being lower than expectations, said Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president of Karvy Stock Broking.        
	According to Vijay Goel, analyst at ICICI Securities, cement prices will remain under pressure in the coming two or three quarters on account of surplus capacity.

	 New Delhi, June 3: India will not open its market beyond its obligation without reciprocal gains, D.K. Mittal, the countrys chief negotiator at the World Trade Organisation, said today. No market access above the level of what is there (as incumbent on a developing country) can be given for free. If countries agree to give, they have to be paid for it. This is the language of WTO, Mittal said. The Doha round of talks, launched in 2001 under the aegis of the WTO, have missed several deadlines in the past because of differences between the developed and developing countries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cairn refuses to buy ONGC rights logic
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cairn refuses to buy ONGC rights logic
          OUR BUREAU                          Bone of contention                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: Cairn Energy Plc has told Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) that its decision to sell a majority stake in its Indian unit to Vedanta Resources does not trigger the state-owned firms pre-emption rights.        
	The proposed transaction, valued at $8.48 billion, is at shareholder level, involving the sale of (40-51 per cent) shares of Cairn India (and) there will be no change to, or assignment of, the participating interest in any of the 10 properties held by the company, Cairn Energy wrote on October 29.        
	ONGC had on October 21 written to Cairn Energy saying the change of control of Cairn India and the acquisition of a majority stake by Vedanta Resources amounts to an effective assignment/transfer of participating interest (or sale of stake in the asset such as the Rajasthan block).        
	ONGC is a partner in all the three producing fields held by Cairn India and has interests in most of its seven exploration blocks awarded under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp).        
	While the Nelp blocks have explicit provisions for seeking the approval of the government and the partner for the transfer of control in the company, the contracts for the three producing properties make that necessary only in case Cairn India sells its stake in them, individually, to a third party.        
	As previously stated, following the review of contractual documentation, we have been advised by external legal advisers and senior counsel in India that the provisions you refer to in both the pre-Nelp and Nelp joint operating agreements do not apply in respect of a proposed sale of shares in Cairn India, Cairn Energy said.        
	As requested by ONGC, Cairn Energy provided a complete copy of the sale and purchase agreement. ONGC had written to Cairn Energy, saying it had pre-emption rights and asked for the value of each of the 10 assets held by the British firms Indian unit to enable it to decide on the future course of action.        
	As you will see from the agreement, there is no value assigned to individual (assets): the asset that is the subject to the agreement is the shareholding in Cairn India, not the individual licence interests, Cairn Energy wrote.        
	Bangladesh move        
	Cairn Energy will sell its stake in the Sangu gasfield in Bangladesh along with interest in another block to Australias Santos Ltd. The firm did not state how much it will realise from the sale.

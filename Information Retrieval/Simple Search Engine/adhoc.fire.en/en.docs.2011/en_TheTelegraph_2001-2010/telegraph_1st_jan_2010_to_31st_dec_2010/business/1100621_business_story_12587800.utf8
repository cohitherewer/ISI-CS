          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 20: State-run Engineers India Ltd (EIL), a consultancy company soon to enter the capital market with a follow-on offer, has identified areas for diversification.         
	EIL is looking to foray into gas-based fertilisers, power, water and waste management and city gas distribution.        
	At present the company offers engineering, procurement, construction and integrated project management services to oil and gas and petrochemical industries in India and overseas.         
	It also caters to non-ferrous mining and infrastructure firms. The company now wants to leverage its capabilities to venture into other industries and augment its revenue streams.         
	In gas-based fertiliser, EIL hopes to capitalise on the rising demand for gas among urea, ammonia and other fertiliser firms.        
	According to the draft red herring prospectus filed by EIL with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the company plans to scout for both Indian and international projects through a consortium and at the same time look at in-house development and licensing arrangements with technology providers in ammonia and urea processing.        
	EIL is also upbeat on the prospects of city gas distribution for which it is in talks with GAIL (India) Ltd. The company is of the view that despite a huge increase in gas suppliers and a better transmission infrastructure, there is room for more players.        
	The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board plans to bring around 243 cities in the country under the city gas distribution network over the next five years. EIL is looking to pursue bids for new projects and is also open to an equity investment in a joint venture with an existing player.         
	At present, city gas distribution networks operate in Pune, Delhi, Mumbai, Indore, Vijayawada and Surat. The company may look at entering Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Kerala where city gas is expected to get a push.                                
	EIL also sniffs opportunity in the huge shortage of power in the country. The company is on the lookout for investment possibilities as an owner and operator of small and medium-sized gas-based power plants.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | US queers pitch for Goldman bank

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          India hiccup                                  
	New Delhi, April 18: Global investment banker Goldman Sachs, accused of fraud by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, may find the going tough in getting a commercial banking licence in India.        
	Officially the Reserve Bank of India is still considering its application, but top officials in the finance ministry said the new accusations would weigh on the Indian authorities.         
	Goldman, which applied for a banking licence sometime last month, already has one for an asset management business, which it is still to launch.         
	Normally the process of getting a banking licence in India is a long one and involves several layers of scrutiny. Currently, Goldmans Indian operations cover investment banking, global investment research, operations and technology.        
	Recently, Credit Suisse Group AG received approval to set up a branch in Mumbai, allowing it to use its balance sheet to offer financing and trade in domestic fixed-income products and foreign exchange. The licence will also enable the Swiss bank to take deposits.        
	Zurich-based Credit Suisse, like Goldman, currently provides brokerage, research, investment banking and wealth management services in India. However, Credit Suisse had no liabilities of the kind which Goldman might face by way of damage suits from the buyers of the toxic bond it promoted, which the US security commission alleged was designed to fail.         
	Australia amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd have also received in-principle approval for a bank licence. India has become more liberal with licences to US and European banks after an informal deal among governments that allowed the State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI to open more branches in the US.         
	According to earlier pacts signed at the World Trade Organisation, India must allow 12 branches of foreign banks in a year.         
	However, it is now willing to grant up to 20 licences a year, officials said.         
	Prior to allowing Indian banks, the US had stonewalled for several years proposals of the SBI and the Bank of Baroda to expand their networks as well as an application by ICICI Bank to set up a branch.         
	The US felt India had not done enough to stop money laundering. Their apprehensions stem from a 2001 case that saw the SBI fined $7.5 million by the US Federal Reserve for failing to put in place safeguards against laundering.         
	However, the US now accepts that the Indian act against laundering is as tough as its own, and Indian banks are following financial standards which have stalled laundering.         
	Both the US and the European Union have been lobbying the Indian government not only to allow more branches for their banks but also to allow them to buy into Indian banks.

	Toyota, the worlds largest car maker, will study the Indian market to launch a hybrid version of its proposed small car Etios, which will be commercially launched by the end of this year. We are looking at every possible alternative to launch the Etios, apart from the diesel and petrol variants. We will study the market and may consider launching the car in other fuel options (LPG and CNG) and in a hybrid mode, Mitsuhiro Sonoda, president (Asia-Pacific) of Toyota Motor, told reporters on the sidelines of a Siam summit. He declined to give any time frame to launch the car in the alternative fuel option. The company, which is present in India through a joint venture with Kirloskar Group, is investing Rs 3,200 crore to set up its second facility in Bangalore for launching the Etios in both sedan and hatchback versions by the end of this year.                        
	More from Ford stable        
	Ford will launch eight models in India by 2015. India is a key market for Ford and we have big plans for the country. The company will introduce eight vehicles in India from the global platform in segments appropriate for this market, Joe Hinrichs, president (Asia-Pacific and Africa) of Ford, said at the Siam meet today. Earlier this year, the American car maker introduced the small car Figo, which registered sales of over 30,000 units within six months of its launch.                        
	Fiat to enter new markets        
	Fiat India will start exports to neighbouring markets  Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Nepal  by the end of 2010. The company, which has started exporting the Linea, Punto and Palio to South Africa, will look to enter Bangladesh by next year, an official of Fiat India Automobiles said on the sidelines of the Siam summit today.

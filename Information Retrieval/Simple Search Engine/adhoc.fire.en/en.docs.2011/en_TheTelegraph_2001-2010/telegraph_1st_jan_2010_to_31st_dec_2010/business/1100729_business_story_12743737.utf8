                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Core growth slows in June
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 28: The core sector expanded 3.4 per cent in June  the lowest in a year  because of a sharp fall in coal, electricity and cement growth rates.        
	Production of crude oil, petroleum refinery products and steel was marginally higher or flat, according to commerce ministry data.        
	Analysts said the core sector was showing signs of normalisation as it couldnt sustain the high growth and also because the base effect was tapering off.        
	The six industries  crude, coal, petroleum refining, electricity, cement and steel  account for around 27 per cent of the factory output measured by the index of industrial production (IIP).        
	The dip will impact IIP which may come down to a single digit, Crisils principal economist D.K. Joshi said.        
	Industrial output rose 11.5 per cent in May, its slowest in seven months.        
	The data indicates a fall in demand and a rise in the cost of production. The data also suggests normalisation of industrial growth in the country, N.R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy said.        
	For the month under review, growth in coal and cement production dipped to 0.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively, from 15.2 per cent and 12.7 per cent in June last year. Electricity generation growth dropped to 3.4 per cent from 7.7 per cent a year ago. Growth in finished steel dropped to 3.5 per cent from 3.6 per cent. Crude oil production expanded 6.8 per cent from 4 per cent and petroleum refinery products grew 2.9 per cent from (-) 3.8 per cent in the year-ago period..        
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla had said nobody should expect that the manufacturing sector will continue to grow at an abnormally high number for a long time. There are capacity constraints.        
	Whatever output lag was there in the economy has been filled and the manufacturing sector is now showing the kind of average secular growth which continues to be good and will be favourable for the economy. However, Chawla said the current fiscal would continue to witness a double-digit IIP growth.        
	The last time core growth was slower than June was in July 2008, when it expanded 3.2 per cent. In May, the sector grew 5 per cent, while growth was 6.3 per cent in June last year.        
	The economy is expected to grow 8.5 per cent in the current fiscal and 9 per cent in 2011-12 . Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has indicated that the government could consider rolling back the stimulus measures further.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee at the annual conference of chief commissioners and directors-general of customs, central excise and service tax in New Delhi on Tuesday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, June 15: The revised direct tax code has proposed new rules to tax income earned by the foreign subsidiaries of Indian MNCs, even if the income is not repatriated to the country. The new norms will be called controlled foreign corporation (CFC) provisions.         
	Other major proposals include taxing the income of FIIs from the sale and purchase of securities as capital gains and offering incentives such as income tax exemption both to the developers of special economic zones as well as to units within them.        
	Besides, to plug the loopholes in the double tax avoidance pacts, that domestic laws will override the bilateral tax agreements.         
	The various DTAAs (double taxation avoidance agreements) will not have preferential status over the domestic laws in the circumstances  when the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) is invoked or when the CFC provisions are invoked or when the branch profit tax is levied, the revised draft said.        
	GAAR provisions apply when a taxpayer has entered into an agreement for tax benefits which are not normally meant for bonafide business purposes.        
	Under the provisions for taxing branches of overseas companies (branch profits tax), the Indian subsidiaries of foreign companies will be subjected to dividend distribution tax even if the country has DTAAs with those foreign countries.        
	The Central Board of Direct Taxes will issue guidelines to provide for the circumstances under which GAAR may be invoked. It would be invoked only where tax avoidance is beyond a specified threshold limit. Besides, the cases will be referred to a dispute resolution panel.        
	In a move that may impact FII inflow, the code has said that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) would pay capital gains tax. Overseas funds that have been reporting income from stock investments as business income and claiming exemptions will not be allowed to claim such benefits.        
	Units in SEZs have been allowed to claim deductions. The proposals in the first draft released last August had created confusion, as tax exemptions were restricted to the developers of SEZ and not the units in them. The fresh DTC seeks to remove this uncertainty.        
	Pranab plea        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today asked tax collectors to become technology-savvy and develop an effective intelligence system to punish evaders to prevent evasion and punish wrong-doers.         
	Tax evaders, as well as smugglers, are getting increasingly more sophisticated, using modern technology... you must also develop an effective intelligence system to not only check the evasion of taxes but also punish the wrong-doers, he said at a conference of senior tax officials.        
	He expressed hope that the goods and services tax would take effect from the next fiscal.

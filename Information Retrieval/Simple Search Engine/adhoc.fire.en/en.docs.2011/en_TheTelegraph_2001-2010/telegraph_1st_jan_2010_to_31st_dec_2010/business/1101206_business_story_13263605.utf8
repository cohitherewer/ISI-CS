                                I am contributing Rs 20,000 per month to my PPF account that will come up for maturity after two years. My PPF account has a balance of Rs 18 lakh. I am also paying Rs 20,000 per month for home loan repayment. What would be a better option for me:            (a) To increase the monthly contribution to the PPF account to Rs 30,000 to earn more interest; or            (b) To increase the home loan EMI to Rs 30,000 and foreclose the repayment?            S. Saha, Calcutta
                    PPF has a maximum investment limit of Rs 70,000 per annum. I fail to understand how you can deposit Rs 20,000 per month because this amounts to an investment of Rs 2,40,000 per annum. You as an individual cannot contribute more than Rs 5,834 per month in a PPF account. However, each member of your family can have a PPF account and the total contribution in that case can be more than Rs 20,000 per month. Assuming that this is your case, an increase in monthly contribution will entitle you not only to an annually compounded interest rate of 8 per cent, but also tax deduction on contribution and tax-free withdrawal on maturity. The effective interest rate, thus, works out to 8.5 per cent. By increasing your EMI, you can save on the interest outgo. If the interest saved on home loan is greater than the additional interest earned from increased contribution to PPF, go for prepaying the loan.                                  Modify account status      I am 45 years old. I am the second holder of joint savings bank and fixed deposit accounts with my father-in-law who was a senior citizen and died recently. I want to continue those deposit accounts. But the bank has told me the accounts could not be continued. Is the bank right?        Sanjib Kumar Bose, Regent Park
                    Yes, the bank is right. When you made your senior citizen father-in-law as the first holder of joint accounts, you wanted to get the higher interest rates that banks give to senior citizens. Now, when he has died the survivor account holder being a non-senior citizen, the accounts cannot be continued. The savings bank account, however, can be modified by submitting the death certificate of your with the bank and thereby deleting his name from the account.

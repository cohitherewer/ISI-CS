	Calcutta, March 5: The government may consider the French auction route for future selloffs even as it scrapped the model for NMDCs follow-on public offer.        
	An official of the department of divestment (DoD) said the Centre would decide whether to adopt the book-building or French auction route on a case-to-case basis.        
	The French auction model introduced for NTPC Ltd and Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd (REC) was not successful, forcing the government to return to traditional book-building for NMDC.        
	We tried something (French auction) new. May be it will take time before more investors appreciate it, the DoD official said.        
	On plans to use the French method in the future, the official said, It will depend on the particular company. The feedback from investors and merchant bankers will also be important.        
	Under the French auction route, there is no upper limit in price. Institutional bidders can bid at any price above the floor price fixed for retail investors.        
	In the book-building method, a price band is fixed, and both retail and institutional investors can bid at any price within the band.        
	The floor price for the NTPC issue was Rs 201, while the highest bid was at Rs 209.        
	For REC, the floor price was Rs 203 for retail investors and Rs 206 for institutions.        
	Given the lukewarm response to both offers, the government got cold feet about the French auction method. Moreover, many felt that the NMDC stock was overpriced.         
	According to investors, the government should try to find a way to stop the bear hammering of a stock ahead of a follow-on offer. An option is to halt trading during the auction and ahead of the bidding.                           
	The NTPC stock quoted over Rs 230 in the first half of January 2010 but fell below Rs 210 just ahead of the FPO.        
	The REC stock remained subdued during the FPO but sprang to Rs 230 levels after the issue closed. The NMDC stock is also sliding ahead of the FPO on March 10.

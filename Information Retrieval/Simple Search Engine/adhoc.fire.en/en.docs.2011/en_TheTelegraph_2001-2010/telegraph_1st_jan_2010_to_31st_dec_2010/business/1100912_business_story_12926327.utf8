	Washington, Sept. 11 (PTI): Major emerging Asian economies such as India, China and Indonesia are leading the global economic recovery, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.        
	Activity in emerging economies has been sustained by strong domestic demand and the recovery of global trade. Major economies in emerging Asia  China, India, and Indonesia  remain in the lead, followed by Brazil in Latin America, the IMF said in a report to the G20 countries on global economic prospects.        
	In both regions, fixed investment has begun accelerating beyond its 2009 momentum despite less stimulative policies, suggesting an increasingly self-sustaining recovery, it said.        
	More recently, retail sales and manufacturing have begun to moderate from the very elevated levels earlier in the year, the IMF said.        
	The recovery remains notably subdued in parts of emerging Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.        
	On inflation, the report said it would remain generally subdued, except in some emerging economies.        
	In advanced economies, continued excess capacity and high unemployment will keep inflationary pressures muted. With core inflation slowing to less than 1 per cent and considerable economic slack, deflation will be the more pertinent risk.        
	In emerging economies, inflation in 2010 is projected at nearly 6 per cent. With commodity prices expected to stabilise, headline inflation is expected to subside to 5 per cent in 2011.         
	However, inflationary pressures will be more elevated in economies that have had less stable inflation in the past or, countries such as India, which are operating closer to capacity, the IMF said.         
	According to the report, monetary policy has remained highly accommodative in many economies.

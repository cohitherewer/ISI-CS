	Mumbai, July 26: A day before its policy mandarins hunker down to review the monetary policy, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) painted the backdrop for the deliberations by suggesting that there were no downside risks to growth.        
	It said the economy would grow faster this fiscal than its April forecast of 8 per cent.        
	The RBIs robust growth forecast  which resonates well with the Prime Ministers economic advisory panels recent forecast of 8.5 per cent GDP growth for the year ended March 31 next year  signals once again that inflation remains the biggest enemy that must be vanquished.        
	But for the first time, the central bank seemed to warn that monetary policy alone wasnt the most effective instrument to deal with supply side pressures on inflation. In the absence of a strong supply side response, anti-inflationary monetary action had become a necessity to anchor inflation expectations.        
	Food price inflation has been running at 12.47 per cent, while the overall inflation has just nudged above 10 per cent, sparking politically-orchestrated protests and growing public disenchantment with the UPA government.        
	Economists expect the RBI to tweak the benchmark policy rates by 25 basis points even as the apex bank slowly calibrates its withdrawal from an expansionist monetary policy that it put in place in October 2008 to cope with the effects of global recession.        
	In its report titled Macro-Economic and Monetary Developments, which serves as the backdrop to the monetary policy, the central bank gave an indication that it would go in only for a small hike in key rates to tame inflation.        
	Receding concerns relating to recovery and the emerging risks of generalised inflation, monetary policy measures have to continue the calibrated normalisation process, the report said.         
	Observers said this was an indication that it might raise key rates  the repo and the reverse repo rates  only by 25 basis points and not by an aggressive 50 basis points as feared by a few.        
	According to the RBI, while external conditions had turned more uncertain after the sovereign debt related stress in the euro area, the outlook in India pointed to consolidation in growth during the course of the year. This will be driven largely by a pick-up in private consumption and investment demand, which it said, would be the two major drivers of growth in 2010-11.        
	The RBI here revealed that the Professional Forecasters Survey conducted by it in June places overall (median) GDP growth rate for 2010-11 at 8.4 per cent, higher than 8.2 per cent reported in the previous round of the survey.

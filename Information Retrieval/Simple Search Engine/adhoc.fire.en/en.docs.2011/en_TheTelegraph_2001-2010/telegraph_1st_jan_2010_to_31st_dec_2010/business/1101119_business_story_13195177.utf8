          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The telecom regulator today recommended that 69 licences, allocated to six firms in 2008, should be cancelled as the operators failed to roll out services.        
	For another 53 licences, the regulator proposed a penalty for partially meeting rollout obligations. In all, the regulator probed 127 licences given by the telecom department.         
	Moreover, operators that have not yet started operations vis--vis the 69 licences should be asked to surrender spectrum along with the licence.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has asked the DoT to cancel five licences of Aircel, eight permits of Uninor, 10 of Videocon, 11 of Russias Sistema (brand name MTS), 15 mobile licences of Etisalat DB (formerly Swan Telecom, which has been linked to Reliance) and 20 telecom permits given to Loop Telecom.        
	There are provisions in the licence that allow the government to impose penalty and even cancel licences of operators who do not fulfil roll-out obligations, said a Trai official. He added that some operators had installed insufficient networks and that would be considered as missing rollout obligations.        
	The telecom ministry will study Trais recommendations before taking any action.         
	Based on Trais recommendations, the issue of showcause notices for termination of mobile licences to all the erring companies is being contemplated, said DoT officials. A showcause is the first step towards the termination of a licence, said industry experts.        
	Under the licensing conditions, licensees were required to roll out services in 90 per cent of service areas in metros and 10 per cent in district headquarters within 12 months from the date of award of the permit.        
	The DoT can impose a fine of Rs 5 lakh a week for the first 13 weeks of delay, Rs 10 lakh for the next 13, and thereafter at the rate of Rs 20 lakh for delays up to 26 weeks. If any operator fails to fulfil the obligation even after 52 weeks, the DoT has the power to cancel the licence.        
	While Uninor, Aircel, Sistema and Videocon have rolled out services in most circles, Loop Telecom has services only in Mumbai (out of its 21 licences) and Etisalat DB does not have any commercial operations in any circle, according to industry data. However, all the operators maintain that they have met all rollout norms.        
	Sistema Shyam TeleServices has complied with all its rollout obligations in all the 22 telecom circles and has secured over 7 million voice subscribers and over 3,00,000 data customers, said a Sistema Shyam spokesperson.        
	Uninor has launched its services across India. We have 13.7 million customers, said Uninors spokesperson.

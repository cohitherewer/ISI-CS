          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CALL CONNECT                                  
	Mumbai, May 6: Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com) is offering unlimited talktime to its pre-paid CDMA customers for a one-time monthly charge.        
	Under the Simply Unlimited CDMA offer, R-Com will launch two packs  one for local and the other for STD calls. The plans will be available in most places from this weekend.         
	The local pack will allow Reliance users to make unlimited local calls to any Reliance customer at a monthly recharge of Rs 299. Under this plan, all long-distance calls to Reliance as well as to other networks will be charged at 50 paise per minute.        
	The national pack will allow Reliance customers to make unlimited calls for a monthly recharge of Rs 599. This scheme offers unlimited calls to any Reliance phone in India (GSM, CDMA or fixed line), local or national.        
	For networks other than Reliance, a customer can make unlimited calls up to 30 minutes per day (900 minutes per month). Beyond 30 minutes per day, these calls will be charged at 50 paise per minute.         
	Mahesh Prasad, president (marketing-wireless business) of R-Com, said the latest offer extended the per second, per minute plans to a per month basis without worries over use, balance and recharge for CDMA prepaid customers. The company is targeting the mid (300-400 minutes per month) and high user (over 500 minutes) segment, apart from GSM customers of other networks who are interested in such a monthly package, Prasad said.        
	Syed Safawi, CEO (wireless business) of R-Com, said the new package would not affect the companys margins.        
	We aim to address the needs of a large group who do not wish to be bogged down by concerns related to balance, recharges, he added.

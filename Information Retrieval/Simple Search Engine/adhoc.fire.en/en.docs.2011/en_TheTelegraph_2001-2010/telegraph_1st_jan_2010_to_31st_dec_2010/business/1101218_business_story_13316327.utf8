                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Third-party motor cover review 
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 17 (PTI): The insurance regulator today set up a committee to look into issues related to third-party cover for motor vehicles.        
	The panel set up by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) will be headed by M. Ramaprasad, member (non-life), and will have 12 other members, including representatives from non-life business.        
	A third-party insurance is a policy under which the insurance firm provides cover for vehicles for injuries or damage done to a third party.        
	Offering third-party liability cover to commercial vehicles has been a challenge for non-life insurers in view of the prevailing tariff controls and non-availability of credible data and statutory provisions, the IRDA said.        
	It further said since 2006 many issues relating to the adequacy of the premium charged for the cover and various alternatives to address the issue were brought to the notice of the insurance regulator.        
	The terms of reference of the committee are to review the present arrangement and to ensure the availability of third-party liability cover to all commercial vehicles.        
	It will also examine the possibility of providing third-party liability cover to the driver, in addition to the vehicle.         
	The time frame for submission of the recommendations by the committee is three months, the IRDA said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pru buys AIG arm
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Pru buys AIG arm
                            
	London, March 1 (Reuters): Britains Prudential said it would buy AIGs Asian life insurance arm for $35.5 billion, in a deal set to make the insurer the leader in one of the financial services markets.        
	The acquisition will be financed in part by a $20 billion equity capital raising, one of the biggest cash calls ever, and by a $5 billion debt issue, Prudential said.        
	Investors and analysts said they needed to know more about the finances of the AIGs Asian unit  AIA  before they could judge whether the deal could justify a capital-raising on that scale. At $20 billion, the rights issue would rank as one of the largest cash calls in the world to date, nearly equalling Prus current market value of $23 billion.

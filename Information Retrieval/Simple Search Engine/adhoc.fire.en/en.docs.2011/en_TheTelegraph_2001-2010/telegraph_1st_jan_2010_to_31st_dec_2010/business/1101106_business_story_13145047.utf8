The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ministry charts merger route for Bengal units 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ministry charts merger route for Bengal units 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          In the works                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 5: The government is considering merging Calcutta-based Bridge and Roof with two more state-run construction firms  Engineering Projects (India) Ltd (EPI) and BBJ Construction Ltd  to form one consolidated construction firm.         
	The Centre may also merge the 190-year-old boat builder Hooghly Dock amp; Port Engineers Limited with Garden Reach Works to infuse better management practices and revive the Bengal-based firm.         
	Bridge amp; Roof Cos management is apprehensive of a merger with the two loss-making PSUs, but the heavy industries ministry under Vilas Rao Deshmukh is keen on the merger.        
	All the three construction firms are doing well and are in related sectors. They can derive strength from each other, which is why I have suggested their merger, said Nitish Sengupta, chairman of the Board for the Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE).         
	The ministry supports both the merger moves. Garden Reach is under the ministry of defence and it has to agree, said Sengupta.         
	The government had two months back conferred the mini-ratna status on Bridge and Roof, which allows it to incur capital expenditure on new projects, modernisation and the purchase of equipment without government approval up to Rs 500 crore.        
	The 90-year-old engineering and construction firm Bridge and Roof posted a net profit of Rs 65 crore in fiscal 2009-10. The company rode the success path from a net profit of Rs 8 crore in 2002-03 and a turnover of Rs 396 crore.        
	BBJ (Braithewaite, Burn amp; Jessop) Construction is a well-known bridge maker and has to its credit the Howrah Bridge, Ganga Bridge at Mokameh, Yamuna Bridge at Delhi, Godavari Bridge at Rajahmundry, Krishna Bridge at Vijayawada and the Brahmaputra Bridge at Pandu.         
	EPI, too, is a mini-ratna company and has successfully executed 30 odd projects valued over $782 million in Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yugoslavia, Maldives, Bhutan and Thailand.        
	The BRPSE feels the merger will do a world of good to the clutch of construction firms as it will expose them to broader horizons and bring those not listed to the stock market. The EPI stock has been doing well for quite sometime.         
	EPIs net profit grew 13.8 per cent over the year-ago period and 4.6 per cent over the previous sequential quarter to Rs 119.9 crore. Its order book of Rs 8,000 crore is nearly three times its estimated fiscal revenue.        
	Officers protest         
	Officers of Bridge and Roof have shot off several representations to the heavy industry ministry against the proposed merger, which they feel may not allow the company the space to perform in the manner it seeks.         
	The Bridge and Roofs executives association is also up in arms against the ministrys decision to ignore existing top executives in selecting a new director.         
	The Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) and the heavy industry ministry have favoured M.K. Singh, the chairman-cum-managing director of Richardson and Cruddas.        
	We are disappointed with the PESB move to select an outsider for the post as it demoralises employees, who have toiled hard to turn around the firm, said Arun Kumar Guha Thakurta, president of the Bridge and Roof executives association.        
	The association has petitioned Deshmukh to reconsider the selection.

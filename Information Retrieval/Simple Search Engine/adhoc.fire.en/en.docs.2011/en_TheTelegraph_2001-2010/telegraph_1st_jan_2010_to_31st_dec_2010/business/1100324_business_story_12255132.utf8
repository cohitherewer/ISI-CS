                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Piramal gets a piece of i-pill
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Drug deal                                  
	Mumbai, March 23: Piramal Healthcare Ltd is acquiring the India rights to make and market i-pill  the emergency contraceptive pill owned by Cipla Ltd  for Rs 95 crore.        
	The pill ranks among the top 300 pharmaceutical products in the country with sales estimated at Rs 30.92 crore over the past 12 months, according to ORG IMS data. Cipla will, however, retain the export marketing rights of i-pill.         
	The acquisition will widen the Ajay Piramal companys portfolio of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that include the Lacto Calamine skin care range, Supractiv Complete, Saridon and Polycrol antacid. OTC drugs can be bought without a doctors prescription.        
	Piramal Healthcare informed the stock exchanges today that it had signed a definitive agreement for the purchase of intellectual property rights in India relating to i-pill.        
	i-pill is used to prevent unplanned pregnancies. The company said it should not be regarded as an abortion pill.        
	i-pill contains levonorgestrel, which helps prevent unwanted pregnancies if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. According to Piramal, i-pill has no long-term or serious side effects and is safe to use except in the case of those who are allergic to levonorgestrel.        
	The OTC market in India is estimated to be around $1.8 billion and is growing annually at 18 per cent. Piramal Healthcare has been an active player in the OTC space over the last few years.        
	We believe the OTC segment is still in its nascent state in India and presents us with high growth opportunities. In particular, the emergency contraceptive pill segment, which is approximately Rs 100 crore, has grown by 250 per cent in the last two years, said Ajay Piramal, chairman of Piramal Healthcare.        
	Cipla said it sold the i-pill brand as it wanted to focus more on prescription drugs that drove its domestic sales.        
	Our decision to divest the brand is driven by our current domestic product portfolio focused on prescription drugs. We are pleased that Piramal Healthcare, with a strong OTC portfolio, has bought the brand and are confident that they will successfully accelerate the future growth of this brand, Cipla joint managing director Amar Lulla said.        
	The stocks of both companies surged after the announcement. On the BSE, Piramal Healthcare rose 3.38 per cent to Rs 425.65 while Cipla rose 2.46 per cent to close at Rs 341.70.

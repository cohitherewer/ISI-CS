	New Delhi, Aug. 14: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today expressed hope that lenders would not raise their interest rates in response to the RBIs monetary tightening measures, but his optimism seemed at variance with the stance taken by banks so far.        
	I dont think so (there is any need to increase interest rates). There is enough liquidity in the system. The banks are fully aware of it and have taken note of it and adjusted their plans (on raising interest rates), said the minister when asked if the central banks tight monetary policy would affect interest rates.         
	The Reserve Bank of India, in its monetary review on July 27, raised the short-term borrowing (reverse repo) rate by 50 basis points and lending (repo) rate by 25 basis points.         
	However, a number of PSU banks have already raised their deposit rates and lending rates for existing borrowers.         
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said, I think there is an upward bias (on interest rates). He added that most of the banks had so far raised interest rates in the range of 25-50 basis points.        
	A further increase in rates will depend on the liquidity position in the system and how advances pick up after September, said Allen Pereira, CMD of Bank of Maharashtra.        
	Speaking to chiefs of PSU banks, Mukherjee said, Financial deepening has to be accelerated, else it could constrain the full potential of the Indian economy. This is essential if we are to maintain Indias high GDP growth trajectory.        
	The minister directed all PSU banks to focus on financial inclusion and to reach out to those who were still outside the banking network by using new technologies and business correspondents.        
	He added that in order to meet the needs of one of the fastest growing economies of the world, banks would have to constantly augment their capital base. The minister also expressed his concern over rising prices as food inflation, after a gap of two weeks, had again entered double digits, driven mainly by higher prices of essential items.        
	Of course it (food inflation) is a concern, he told reporters, adding that high food inflation was also on account of base effect, which is the statistical impact of the level of prices in the corresponding period last year on the current inflation rate.         
	With a low base even the small rise in inflation appears large. After remaining in single digit for two weeks, food inflation again shot up to double digits to 11.4 per cent for the week ended July 31.        
	Experts, however, said food prices would calm down after the impact of the monsoon became visible with the advent of the kharif (summer) crop in the market.         
	Food inflation had neared the 20 per cent mark towards the end of 2009.

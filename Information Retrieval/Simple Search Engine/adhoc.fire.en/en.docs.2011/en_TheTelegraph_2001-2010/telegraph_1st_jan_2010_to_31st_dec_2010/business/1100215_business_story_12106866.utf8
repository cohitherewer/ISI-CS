        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay has a word of caution for those buying a car on loan                                            
	Mumbai-resident Tarulata Kanadias experience with a car loan that she took from a leading private bank could be a lesson for others who want to take a bank loan.         
	An employee of a private-sector company, Kanadia borrowed Rs 3,18,410 in June 2005 to purchase a Tata Indica from a dealer in Mumbai.         
	The bank approved and disbursed the loan in the name of the car dealer (as it is the common practice) the next month.         
	While the dealer drew down the payment, it didnt deliver the car to Kanadia till January 2006.         
	In March 2006, the bank sent a letter to Kanadia asking her to pay interest on the loan amount for the July-December period.        
	Kanadia declined to pay the installments for the period during which the car was not in her possession.        
	The bank took away the car, auctioned it for a fraction of its cost and filed a loan recovery suit against Tarulata Kanadia before the Prothonotary of Bombay High Court. The hearing of the case is still going on.        
	Is this legal?        
	Can a bank do this, you may wonder. The answer is yes  the banks act maybe immoral but not illegal.        
	While signing for a car loan you give an undertaking that you shall provide the bank with the vehicle details, including a copy of the RC book, as and when you get the delivery of the car from the dealer.         
	But your obligation to repay the loan through equated monthly installments starts immediately after the bank disburses the full amount of the loan.         
	In case of a car loan or a home loan, the bank disburses the amount in favour of the car dealer or the builder of the house to ascertain the end use of the borrowed fund.        
	Home loans differ        
	But there is a difference in the disbursal process between a car loan and a home loan. In case of a home loan, a bank does not disburse the full amount unless the title of the property is registered in the name of the borrower such that the lender bank can establish its lien on the property in case of a failure in loan repayment by the borrower.        
	So, for a home loan borrower the actual EMI payment starts after the completion of the construction and registration of the property in the name of the borrower. For part finances advanced by a bank to an under-construction property, you pay what is called the pre-EMI interest.         
	Being a long-term and large value loan, banks wont allow you to give an undertaking to create a lien on the property in favour of the bank after getting the possession and the property title transferred.        
	In a car loan, a bank generally disburses the full amount of the loan in the name of the car dealer and takes an undertaking from you to create the banks lien and hypothecation on the asset (purchased with the borrowed fund) at a later date whenever the possession and transfer of title of the asset happens.         
	In other words, the lender bank distances itself from taking the responsibility of ensuring timely delivery of the car by the dealer and it does this by obtaining an undertaking from the borrower.        
	Car dealers often take this opportunity and take car buyers (who finance their purchases through an institutional loan either from a bank or a finance company) for a ride.         
	Borrowers who have no knowledge of this detail often land themselves into a financial mess as Kanadia has.         
	What Kanadia would have done had she purchased the car with her own money? Would she ever pay the dealer the full amount six months before getting the actual delivery of the car? The answer is a simple no.        
	Our lesson         
	If you really want to get a bank loan to purchase your dream car, get the bank loan approved but dont get it disbursed unless you are sure that the car you want to buy is ready for delivery at the dealers showroom.        
	Remember, once the bank disburses the full amount of the loan you had applied for, your liability to repay the loan through EMIs starts immediately and on no ground can you shrug off this liability whether the car dealer has delivered or not.         
	If you want to book a car the delivery of which is expected few months down the line, get a bridge loan and later on convert the bridge loan into a regular car loan. You shall have to pay a simple interest on the bridge loan amount, like a pre-EMI in case of a home loan.         
	Loan seekers often get flooded with tempting offers, such as zero interest loans and advanced EMI loans. Borrowers must read the fine print carefully because more often than not these offers entail a higher interest payment.         
	For example, you may be offered a lower interest but the financier may ask you to pay three or four months EMIs in advance. When you pay up front, why should you pay interest on it? In short, read carefully before you sign for a loan and unless you comprehend the terms well, dont sign up.                          
	If you do so, youll commit a breach of contract. Even the bank can legally charge a penal interest on the unpaid amount.

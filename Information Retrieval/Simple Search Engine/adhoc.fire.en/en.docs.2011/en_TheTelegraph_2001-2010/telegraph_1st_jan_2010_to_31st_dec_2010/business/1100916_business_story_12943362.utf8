          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 15: Administrators appointed by Calcutta High Court to oversee the late Priyamvada Birlas estate can exercise their voting rights in key investment entities of the MP Birla group that effectively control manufacturing companies such as Birla Corporation.        
	Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta in his August 27 judgment, which was made public today, said administrators would take all lawful steps as shareholders, dealing a blow to Harsh Vardhan Lodha, who is currently in charge.        
	Lodha is seeking a probate of the will of Priyamvada Birla  wife of the late Madhav Prasad Birla who had passed away earlier  that effectively puts him in command of her estate and the entire MP Birla empire.        
	However, the saving grace for Lodha is that the administrators voting rights are not unfettered.        
	Prodosh Kumar Mullick, senior advocate and bar-at-law of Calcutta High Court, Asish Kumar Bhattacharyya, chartered accountant and faculty member of the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, and Sukumal Chandra Basu, former chairman and managing director of Bank of Maharashtra  the three administrators named by Justice Sengupta today  will have to seek the courts approval in exercising their voting rights on key issues such as the appointment of directors or reconstitution of the board.        
	Priyamvada held majority stakes in two key investment companies  East India Investment and Gwalior Webbing. These companies hold majority stakes in Birla Corp, Vindhya Telelinks, Universal Cables and Birla Ericsson Optical through a maze of some more investment companies.        
	Lodha has challenged Justice Senguptas judgment in high court. The court is waiting for a division bench to be assigned to hear the matter. Once the hearing starts, the administrators functioning could be restrained till the matter is resolved.        
	The Birla and the Lodha families are locked in a vicious legal battle since the death of Priyamvada in 2004. Priyamvadas registered will of 1999 bequeathing the entire MP Birla empire to the Lodhas was placed for probate by Harshs father, the late Rajendra Singh Lodha. Lodha senior was both the executor and beneficiary of the will.        
	Incidentally, Harsh Lodha had also sought to become the administrator after R.S. Lodhas death in 2008.         
	However, the court chose independent administrators. They decided that independent people should be appointed to look after the estate as the executor of the 1999 will, R.S. Lodha, was no more and it was yet to be decided who would get the MP Birla empire.        
	The administrators will make an inventory of the estate and take possession of the same and submit a report to the court within four weeks from the date of taking charge.        
	They will take custody of all original share certificates and other documents such as bonds and fixed deposit receipts. They shall operate the bank accounts, collect dividends and meet all outgoings, the judgment said.        
	While the appointment of independent administrators will be an irritant for Lodha, the administrators have not been put on companies such as Birla Corporation, providing some breathing space to him.

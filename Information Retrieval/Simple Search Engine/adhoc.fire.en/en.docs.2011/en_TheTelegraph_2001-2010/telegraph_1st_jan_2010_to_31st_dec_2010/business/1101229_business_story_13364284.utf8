The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hint of hope for Doha round 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Hint of hope for Doha round 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Trade winds                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: Trade ministers of key member countries of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), including India, Brazil, Russia, China and the US, will meet in Davos, Switzerland next month to kick-start the stalled Doha round of talks.        
	The ministers will meet on the sidelines of the annual World Economic Forum in the last week of January.        
	In the informal meeting, trade ministers will review the progress of the Doha round and what can be achieved in the backdrop of G20 (Group of 20) resolution, which is keen to see the conclusion of the round in 2011. However, the basic stand of different groups are unlikely to undergo major changes, a senior commerce ministry official said.        
	The Doha round of talks, launched in 2001 under the aegis of the WTO, has missed several deadlines because of differences between developed and developing countries over issues such as agricultural subsidies and market access.        
	India has been pressing for an effective safeguard mechanism to protect the interests of its farmers and small-scale sectors from any possible surge in imports following the liberalisation of world trade.         
	Food and livelihood security of the poor are critical to the developing countries and cannot be compromised under any circumstances, the official said.        
	Developed nations, in particular the US, has been arguing that emerging economies such as India, China and Brazil should be treated as advanced developing countries and be asked to take bigger responsibilities in terms of market access for reaching a global trade deal.        
	Our strong commitment is to direct our negotiators to engage in across-the-board negotiations to promptly bring the Doha round to a successful, comprehensive and balanced conclusion. We recognise that 2011 is a critical window of opportunity, albeit narrow, and that engagement among our representatives must intensify and expand, the G20 leaders had said last month in Seoul.        
	Analysts said the last mile was the crucial phase. In the past rounds, there has been a broad consensus on 80 per cent of the issues, but the remaining 20 per cent need political push, which is contentious.        
	According to a WTO estimate, the successful conclusion of the Doha round can boost world trade by up to $200 billion a year.

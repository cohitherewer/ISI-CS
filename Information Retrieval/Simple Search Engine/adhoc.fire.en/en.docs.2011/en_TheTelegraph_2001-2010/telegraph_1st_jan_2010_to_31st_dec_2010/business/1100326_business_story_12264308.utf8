          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 25: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today warned that inflationary pressures, management of the governments borrowing programme and capital flows might impact the financial stability of the economy. It, however, said the recovery was increasingly taking hold and banks remained healthy.        
	These observations by the central bank come as part of its first financial stability report, which was released today.         
	The aim of these reports is to assess the risks that have a bearing on the operations of the economy and its financial institutions, and thwart them through pre-emptive policies.         
	In its 110-page report, the apex bank said though food prices were showing signs of moderation, they remained high.         
	Besides, the rate of increase in the prices of non-food manufactured goods has accelerated, while increasing capacity utilisation and rising commodity and energy prices are exerting pressure on overall inflation. Taken together, these factors heighten the risks of supply-side pressures translating into a generalised inflationary process. Therefore, anchoring inflation expectations and containing overall inflation have become imperative, the report said.         
	It went on to add that the management of the government borrowing programme would be a challenge in 2010-11, though net borrowings were projected to be lower. In 2009-10, the net supply of fresh paper was significantly lower than the net borrowings, which might not happen in the next fiscal.         
	Analysts were worried that a higher market borrowing by the government might lead to banks failing to meet the demand for credit from the private sector.         
	The report said that uncertainty was much more with regard to capital flows, which were likely be driven more by the global developments. While currently there is little evidence to show that the quantum of inflows has exceeded the absorptive capacity of the economy, the RBI feared that the trend could change significantly.        
	On the positive side, the central bank said that banks remained broadly healthy and they were well capitalised in terms of capital adequacy ratios.        
	However, bank assets may come under pressure if there are significant slippages in some of the restructured accounts.        
	Banks may also need to make provisions towards depreciation in the value of investments depending on the duration of their portfolio. This may impact the banks net interest margin (NIM) and their profitability, the central bank said.

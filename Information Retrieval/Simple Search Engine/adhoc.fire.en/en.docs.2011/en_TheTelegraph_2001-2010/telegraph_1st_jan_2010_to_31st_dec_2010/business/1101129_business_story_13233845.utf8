The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Long-distance call disconnect
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Long-distance call disconnect
          JAYATI GHOSE                          WRONG NUMBER                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: A directive of the telecom regulator that would have allowed mobile users to access long-distance calling cards of operators other than their own, and thereby reduce calling costs, have met with a muted response from the operators.         
	Mobile operators have opposed the directive to enter into mutual agreements to allow customers use long-distance calling cards of other service providers.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had earlier this month amended the intelligent network (IN) regulations and said all long-distance operators should sign agreements within three months of the notification of the amendment. The move was designed to bring down long-distance tariffs. Globally, calling cards are offered by a large number of long-distance operators, which has resulted in tariff reduction by over 20-53 per cent.        
	Intelligent network services allow a Vodafone mobile subscriber to buy a calling card from another operator, say Verizon, who offers cheaper STD or ISD rates.         
	However, the two operators need to have an agreement to provide technical connectivity to allow the call.        
	While the department of telecom (DoT) had in 2009 allowed all long-distance service providers to sell prepaid calling cards for STD and ISD directly to customers, not all operators have signed mutual agreements to offer the service.        
	GSM group lobby Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has asked the regulator to keep the proposed amendment in abeyance, since it does not serve to remedy any deficiency in the market as of now.        
	Competition in the long-distance segment has increased significantly with more players entering it. This has resulted in a significant decline in long-distance tariffs. There is sufficient and adequate competition in the market and customers have ample choice, said Rajan Mathews, director-general of the COAI.         
	Considering that the industry already provides enough competition, choice and low tariffs no further directive or amendment in IN regulation is required or necessary.        
	State-run telecom operator Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has even questioned Trais powers to frame regulations for IN services. Citing a high court judgment dated December 23, 2005, BSNL said the court held that the authority has power to frame regulations for only those subject matters which are specified under Section 36. The present matter is not a part of Section 36.        
	Till the matter regarding the regulation making powers of Trai is decided by the Supreme Court, no new amendments to existing regulations should be made, said P.C. Sharma, deputy general manager of BSNL.

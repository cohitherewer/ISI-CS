          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: The empowered committee on goods and services tax (GST) today decided to ask the Centre to cough up 68 per cent of the Rs 20,000-crore estimated loss, which states say they have run up because of gradual lowering of the central sales tax.         
	We unanimously decided to ask the finance minister when we meet him after this session to give this amount which is due to us, said Asim Dasgupta, Bengal finance minister and chairman of the empowered committee.        
	Many state governments, including Bengal, are in financial disarray. Bengal had a revenue deficit of Rs 17,940 crore, Maharashtra, Rs 7,123 crore and Punjab, Rs 6,234 crore in 2009-10, according to an RBI study on state finances.        
	Last month, Dasgupta had asked for central assistance to bail out his government. The Centre agreed to pay relief and compensation amounting to Rs 2,900 crore, stopping short of agreeing to Dasguptas demand of Rs 4,883 crore as arrears from coal royalty. The Centre maintains that it cannot be given to Bengal as it charges a cess, which is illegal.        
	Boost to GST        
	Dasgupta said data collected by the GST committee showed states had seen a rise of 29.4 per cent in revenues from value-added tax in this fiscal.         
	Analysts see this as a boost to the Centres attempts to introduce GST. Bengal alone saw a VAT revenue growth of around 30 per cent. In comparison, last year VAT revenues grew 15 per cent on an all-India basis and 18 per cent in Bengal.

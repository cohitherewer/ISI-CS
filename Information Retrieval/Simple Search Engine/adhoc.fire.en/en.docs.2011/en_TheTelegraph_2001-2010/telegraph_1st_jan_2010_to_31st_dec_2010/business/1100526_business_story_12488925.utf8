          OUR BUREAU                          Manwani: Upbeat                                  
	Mumbai, May 25: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) recorded a 47 per cent rise in net profit in the fourth quarter of 2009-10 as the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company made a large one-time exceptional gain during the period.        
	HULs net profit for the period ended March 31, 2010 at Rs 581 crore included an exceptional income of Rs 91.10 crore from profit on sale of long term trade investment, Rs 5.47 crore from gains on sale of property, and Rs 53.36 crore from a reduction in provision for retirement benefits.         
	The company posted a net profit of Rs 395 crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2009.         
	Net sales amounted to Rs 4315.75 crore, an increase of 8 per cent over Rs 3,988.33 crore in the year-ago period. A statement by the company said domestic consumer and FMCG business grew 8 per cent in the quarter, driven by a strong 11 per cent volume growth. HUL implemented price cuts during the quarter across categories as consumers down-traded and competition intensified. This may impact the companys profitability in the short term.         
	HUL chairman Harish Manwani said, In an environment of heightened competitive intensity we have accelerated volume growth, ahead of the market. Broad-based actions have been taken to enhance competitiveness of our brands, build new segments, expand offerings in foods and improve the overall quality of our innovations and speed to market. These initiatives have started to yield positive results.        
	The HUL board proposed a final dividend of Rs 3.50 per share for the fiscal.         
	Shares of HUL fell a little less than a per cent on BSE to close at Rs 230.10.

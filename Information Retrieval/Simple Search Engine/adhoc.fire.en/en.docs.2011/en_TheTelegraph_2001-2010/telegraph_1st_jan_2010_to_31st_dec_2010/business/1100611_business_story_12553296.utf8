The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BSNL priority to security
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      BSNL priority to security
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RULE BOOK                                  
	New Delhi, June 10: State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) plans to continue to float tenders for purchasing mobile equipment on grounds of national security.         
	The telecom firm, which has issued a fresh Rs 2,000- crore tender for 55-lakh GSM lines for its northern and eastern zones, will complete the purchase of the equipment soon, company officials said.         
	Earlier, BSNL had decided to adopt the managed capacity model followed by private operators such as Bharti Airtel and proposed by the Sam Pitroda committee.        
	However, the telecom ministry objected to the proposal on the ground that outsourcing the building, management and maintenance of BSNLs networks to global equipment firms might pose a threat to national security.         
	Sam Pitroda, the Prime Ministers adviser on infrastructure, was appointed the head of a panel to suggest proposals on restructuring the PSU.         
	Under the managed capacity model, a firm places equipment orders with vendors for network expansion based on the estimated traffic and use. If the projected target is lower than what the company committed, it has to pay the vendor a higher rate. But the vendor has to reduce the rates if the operator gets a larger traffic.         
	Since the government relies on BSNLs network during external aggression and internal disturbances, the PSU should not compromise on security, the telecom ministry has told BSNL.         
	The ministry said the telecom PSU could approve a new procurement model only after it had considered the security issues.        
	Last year, the government had directed the company not to procure equipment from Chinese companies in 15 border provinces.        
	In March, the BSNL board decided to cancel its $10-billion tender for 93-million GSM lines, the largest telecom equipment contract globally.

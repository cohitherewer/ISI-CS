          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: A strong demand for cars helped Maruti Suzuki India beat rising input costs and post a 5 per cent rise in second-quarter net profit.         
	The countrys biggest car maker reported a net profit of Rs 598 crore in the second quarter ended September 30, up from Rs 570 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Sales in the July-September quarter climbed 27 per cent to Rs 8,937 crore from Rs 7,050 crore a year earlier. Maruti has lined up an investment of Rs 1,700 crore in new plants to maintain its share in the auto market.         
	Domestic car sales in the country increased by more than a third in the September quarter, fuelled by robust economic growth. Sales are likely to remain strong in the third quarter on the back of festive season demand that peaks in November, said analysts.        
	However, in recent months auto makers had been forced to cut back on production because of the slow growth in component supplies.         
	Rising interest rates, higher raw material costs and the inability to raise prices are putting pressure on their margins.         
	Maruti offset higher raw material prices by selling more cars, said Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava.         
	Century Ply        
	Century Plyboards (I) Ltd has posted a 20.58 per cent rise in consolidated turnover at Rs 392.60 crore in the second quarter against Rs 325.60 crore in the year-ago period. Consolidated net profit (including its subsidiaries), after minority interest, stood at Rs 52.75 crore. Standalone turnover grew 39.50 per cent to Rs 271.61 crore from Rs 194.70 crore last year.

	Calcutta, Nov. 23: The Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN), an association of 44 microfinance companies registered with the RBI, today held a discussion with the International Finance Corporation to form a credit information system.         
	The MFIN has also prepared a code of conduct, which includes limiting loans to borrower groups to less than Rs 50,000 along with a whistle- blower policy.        
	Shubhankar Sengupta, managing director of Arohan, a member of the MFIN, said: The setting up of a credit bureau for exchange of information on borrowers and their repayment habits will promote responsible lending.         
	The bureau will promote calibrated growth in the sector. The credit bureau will capture data of all MFI customers, and this database will help to avoid multiple lending and over-leveraging of customers.         
	According to the MFIN, The main objective is to help create an effective and efficient microfinance credit reporting system for MFIs to better serve customers.

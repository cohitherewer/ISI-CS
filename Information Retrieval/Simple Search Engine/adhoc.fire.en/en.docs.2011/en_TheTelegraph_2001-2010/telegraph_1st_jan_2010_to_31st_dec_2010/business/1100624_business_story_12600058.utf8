          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          C.B. Bhave (left) with U. K. Sinha, chairman and MD of UTI Asset Management, in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, June 23: C.B. Bhave, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), today said the mutual fund industry should get the distributors incentive structure right to protect the interests of not only the industry but also that of the individual investor.        
	Addressing the 6th edition of the Mutual Fund Summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here today, the Sebi chief also urged the industry to streamline their offerings as there are now 3,000 schemes available in the market. He hinted that these schemes, which were a little different from each other, only compounded the investors confusion.        
	Bhave was responding to concerns voiced by industry over the regulators decision last year to scrap the entry load on mutual fund schemes. That decision prompted distributors to push competitive products such as unit-linked insurance products (Ulips) as insurance companies continued to dole out handsome incentives.        
	Although Bhave did not elaborate on how the industry should get the incentive structure right, he ruled out a re-think on its decision to abolish entry load in mutual fund schemes last year. The regulator had said then that the investors could negotiate a payment for advisory services directly with the funds. The investors can decide how much they wish to pay for the advisory services, he told the fund bosses again.         
	Bhave said while the MF industry analysed the reasons why it had been unable to attract a large number of retail investors into its fold, it would also examine the issue of short-term money flowing into the sector.         
	The Sebi chief was referring to concerns expressed by the industry that it had become a shock absorber as banks parked their surplus funds in mutual funds when liquidity was abundant and withdrew the money when the system was tight.        
	Bhave told reporters later that Sebi would review all aspects pertaining to the menace of front-running and determine whether there were any loopholes in the regulation that needed to be plugged.         
	Front-running is the practice of trading in securities ahead of a large order by a customer. For example, an individual or an entity working for a large customer who knows that the latter is set to purchase a particular share, buys that scrip and then offloads it when the customer actually buys it.                          
	Recently, Sebi barred an equities dealer of HDFC Asset Management from stock market transactions for allegedly passing information of its trades to other market participants in advance. We will look at whether there is a lacunae in the system itself or if this was an individual case. We will also look at whether we were able to catch him because the system was good or whether we caught just by chance. We will see whether the system needs to be revamped in any way, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Steel on profit track
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata Steel on profit track
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Feb. 16: Tata Steel, which owns Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus, clawed back into the black in the third quarter but the recovery was marred by its decision to shut down the Teesside plant in the UK later this week with the loss of 1,600 jobs.         
	The company posted a 42 per cent drop in profit after minority interest and associates share at Rs 472.65 crore in the quarter ended December 31 compared with Rs 813.89 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.         
	However, it marked a sharp recovery after posting a loss of Rs 2,707 crore in the second quarter ended September 30.         
	Net sales during the period stood at Rs 26,068 crore against Rs 32,514.69 crore in the year-ago period.         
	The decision to mothball the Teesside Cast Products  a Corus unit that racked up a loss of over $200 million in the first half of the current fiscal after four key customers reneged last April on contracts to lift 80 per cent of its production  took some of the attention away from the turnaround story at Tata Steel Europe.         
	We cant go on. We are mothballing the Teesside plant at the end of the week; 1,600 long-serving employees will be sadly out of work next week at this time, Tata Steel Europe (formerly Corus) managing director and CEO Kirby Adams said at a press conference here today.         
	He said the Teesside had run out of raw material and there were no external orders. However, he hoped that they would be able to revive the plant at some point in the future.         
	If the economic circumstance should change, then Teesside can be unmothballed, he said.         
	Teesside employees will receive redundancy packages under the UK law and retirement benefits. However, the British unions are expected to resist the move.         
	Highlighting the companys turnaround in the third quarter, Tata Steel group chief financial officer Koushik Chatterjee said, The EBITDA margin is the big story this quarter.         
	The group posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $731 million (Rs 3,401 crore) in the three months ended December.         
	Tata Steel Europe recorded an EBITDA of $142 million (Rs 660 crore), while Tata Steel posted an EBITDA of $520 million, Nat Steel of $15 million and Tata Steel Thailand earned $8 million. The groups net debt stood at Rs 50,921 crore ($10.94 billion).         
	Adams attributed the turnaround at Tata Steel Europe to the companys efforts to drive down costs, secure higher prices and ensure a better mix in dispatches.         
	While the managing director and CEO emphasised that China and India were the high growth markets, he painted a slightly more optimistic picture of Europe saying, We are finally coming out of a serious and lengthy recession.         
	He was bullish about the prospects of the automotive sector  a key customer but cautious on how the construction industry would fare in Europe.

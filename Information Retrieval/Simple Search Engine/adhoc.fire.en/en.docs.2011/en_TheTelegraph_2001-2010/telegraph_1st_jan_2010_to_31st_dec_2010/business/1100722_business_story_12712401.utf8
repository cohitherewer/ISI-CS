          OUR BUREAU                          Reaping profit                                  
	July 21: Yes Bank today reported a net profit of Rs 156.4 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 against Rs 100.1 crore in the year-ago period on the back of a strong rise in advances.         
	Analysts had expected the bank to post profits of around Rs 140 crore.         
	The strong growth was reflected in the banks net interest income (NII), which surged to Rs 262.1 crore from Rs 156.8 crore a year ago. NII is the difference between interest earned and interest paid.         
	Total advances rose 107 per cent to Rs 26,256.8 crore from Rs 12,670.5 crore a year ago. The sequential growth in advances was over 18 per cent. Total deposits nearly doubled to Rs 30,238.7 crore from Rs 15,342.3 crore. Current and savings account deposits grew 119 per cent to Rs 3,179.9 crore.        
	The Yes Bank scrip today closed at Rs 297.70 on the BSE, up 0.13 per cent from the previous close.         
	Telenor growth        
	Norway-based Telenors revenue from Indian operations has increased to 103 million Norwegian Kroner (NOK) (Rs 78 crore) during the second quarter ended June 30 from 56 million NOK (Rs 42 crore) in the previous quarter, helped by the growth in subscriber base and higher average revenue per user.         
	In June, we launched services in five additional circles in India, increasing our footprint to 13 circles. We are working to develop Uninors position, Telenor CEO Jon Fredrik Baksaas said.         
	Uninor is a joint venture between real estate major Unitech and the Norway firm.

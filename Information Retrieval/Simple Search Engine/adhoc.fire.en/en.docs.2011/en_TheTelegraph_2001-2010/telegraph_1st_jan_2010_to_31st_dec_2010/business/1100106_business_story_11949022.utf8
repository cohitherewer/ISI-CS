	Calcutta, Jan. 5: TCG Lifesciences, a city-based contract research organisation, today announced an agreement with global pharmaceutical leader Pfizer to develop compounds required for drug discoveries .        
	Swapan Bhattacharya, managing director of TCG Lifesciences, said the contract from Pfizer  its first outsourcing research programme outside the US  was an endorsement of the capability of the company and of India as well.        
	TCG Lifesciences, a subsidiary of Purnendu Chatterjee-led The Chatterjee Group (TCG), is working with more than 50 pharmaceutical firms in the US, Europe and Asia.        
	Declining to disclose the duration and financial details of the deal, Bhattacharya said the US firm would bear the cost of the research.        
	After almost doubling its research strength till 2007, TCG went slow on recruitment following the recession.         
	The company is now planning to recruit more researchers and expects to double their numbers in 2-3 years. Bhattacharya, however, is not sure about the companys proposed plans for an initial public offering.         
	The company had submitted a draft prospectus to the Securities and Exchange Board of India for the float in 2007 but held it back because of the recession.         
	Bhattacharya said the equity market might have recovered, but not many IPOs were being floated.

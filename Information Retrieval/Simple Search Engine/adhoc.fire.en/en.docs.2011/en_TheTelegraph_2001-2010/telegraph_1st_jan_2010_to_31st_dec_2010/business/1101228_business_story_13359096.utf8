The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sugar futures trade resumes 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sugar futures trade resumes 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Back in action                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 27: Futures trading in sugar resumed today after a gap of 19 months with the contract for the January delivery trading at a premium to the spot price.         
	Experts are, however, divided in their outlook with some of the belief that a deficit in global production should keep the prices firm and others saying that robust production in India will keep prices under check.        
	On the National Commodity amp; Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), the January contract opened at Rs 3,049 per quintal and touched a days high of Rs 3,079 per quintal.         
	Short-selling, however, saw the sweetener declining to a days low of Rs 3,000 per quintal and it was last traded at around Rs 3,044 per quintal. This price is higher than the spot price of the commodity. For instance, the M grade sugar from Kolhapur was traded at Rs 2,937.50 at the spot market.        
	Kishore Narne, head of commodities and currency at Anand Rathi Commodities, said futures trading in sugar initially met with a good response with huge open interest built up. It, however, subdued towards the latter half of the day. Narne, who hints that prices of the commodity will remain soft as domestic production is likely to be higher in this sugar year, says that mills should sell at higher levels of around Rs 3,150 per quintal.         
	Retail investors should not be participating at this point of time. I see the prices (January contract) hovering between Rs 2,900 and Rs 3,100 per quintal for a week or so, he added.

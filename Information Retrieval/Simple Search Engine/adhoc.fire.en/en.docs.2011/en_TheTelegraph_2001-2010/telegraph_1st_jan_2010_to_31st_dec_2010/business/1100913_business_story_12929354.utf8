                          Aulbur: Exit mode                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 12 (PTI): Luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz Indias managing director and CEO Wilfried Aulbur has put in his papers to pursue a new career within the country, the company said today.        
	Sources said Aulbur, who will complete five years as the India head of the German car maker by the end of this year, was likely to move out of the automobile sector.        
	With the construction of the new factory and several projects close to approval, Aulbur has decided to accept a new challenge outside the Daimler group within India, the company said. Aulbur will remain with Mercedes-Benz India till a successor is identified to ensure a smooth transition.         
	The company started assembling its vehicles within the country at a facility in Chakan (Maharashtra), in January, 2009. The unit has the capacity to produce 5,000 cars and 1,200 commercial vehicles, mainly the Actros range of trucks, every year.         
	During his tenure, Mercedes-Benz established its presence in the truck and bus businesses and expanded its research and sourcing operations in India, the statement said. A German by birth, Aulbur did his doctoral and post-doctoral studies in physics in the US.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 25: India Resources Limited (IRL), a firm listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, has entered into an agreement with a Bengal company to develop a virgin coal mine.        
	IRL plans to open, develop and operate the Biharinath coal mine near Ranigunj on behalf of six sponge iron manufacturers who own the coal block.        
	Arvind Misra, managing director of IRL, said his company would invest more than Rs 100 crore in the project. The deal is valid for 30 years. The block has 95-million-tonne reserves, Misra said on the sidelines of a mining seminar organised by the Australian Trade Mission.        
	IRL plans to start the ground work in 2-3 months and begin production in three years.         
	From 30,000 tonnes initially, the company will reach a peak production of 500,000 tonnes in seven years. IRL will sell the coal to Bankura DRI, the special purpose vehicle set up by the six sponge iron manufacturers.        
	According to IRLs statement, the entire contract is valued at Aus $500 million for a period of 30 years.        
	Misra said IRL was looking for similar opportunities in other coal blocks.         
	We will do both contract job for others and exploration and mining ourselves, he said. It is operating the Surda copper mine for PSU Hindustan Copper in eastern India and producing 300 tonnes of copper a day.

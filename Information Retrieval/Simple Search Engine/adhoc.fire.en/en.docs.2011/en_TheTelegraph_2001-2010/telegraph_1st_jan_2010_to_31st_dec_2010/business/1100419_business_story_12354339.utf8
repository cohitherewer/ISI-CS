          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 18: Bankers believe RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao is likely to raise short-term key interest rates in Tuesdays monetary policy review.         
	However, there are disagreements among them over the amount of hike and the possibility of the RBI lacing it with an increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR).        
	One group of bankers is of the view that the central bank will raise both the reverse repo and repo rates by 50 basis points each and maintain the status quo on CRR. Others reckon that the RBI will take a more measured move and increase all three key rates by 25 basis points.        
	CRR is that portion of bank deposits which must be maintained with the apex bank. The reverse repo is the rate at which the central bank borrows from banks, and repo the rate at which it lends to banks.        
	After lowering its rates many times since the global financial crisis in September 2008, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began rate normalisation in January when it raised CRR by 75 basis points to 5.75 per cent.         
	Subsequently, it hiked the repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points each to 5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively. These measures were taken to contain inflation, which has already breached the central banks forecast of 8.5 per cent to reach 9.9 per cent by March-end.        
	Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist with the Bank of Baroda, said, Although the recent number came in at 9.9 per cent, inflation is getting broader now and non-food price inflation is picking up. Apart from rising crude prices, various sectors are witnessing better demand. Therefore the RBI will take a stronger interest rate action.        
	Nitsure feels that the apex bank will raise both the reverse repo and the repo rates by 50 basis points each. She, however, does not expect any changes in CRR in view of the borrowing programme of the government in the first half of this year.        
	Vikram Kotak, chief investment officer of Birla Sun Life Insurance, said, We expect the RBI to hike the repo and reverse repo rates by 50 basis points either in its scheduled policy meet on April 20 or soon thereafter. On an average, Rs 12,000 crore of government securities auction are planned every week. So, the RBI is unlikely to aggressively absorb excess liquidity from the system which currently amounts to Rs 50,000 crore.        
	However, HDFC Bank chief economist Abheek Barua has forecast a 25 basis points hike in all the three rates. According to him, though food prices have moderated, core inflation measured by manufactured goods inflation minus food and fuel inflation has moved up since the last policy action on March 19, strengthening the case for further monetary policy tightening.        
	Bankers also feel that the RBI may raise the risk weightage on loans to commercial real estate to prevent asset bubbles.

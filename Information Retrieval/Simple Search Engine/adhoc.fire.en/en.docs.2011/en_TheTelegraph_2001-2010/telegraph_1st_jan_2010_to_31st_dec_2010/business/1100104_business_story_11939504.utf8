The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Meet to address BSNL woes
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Meet to address BSNL woes
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 3 (PTI): The Prime Ministers Office has convened a meeting with the telecom ministry on Wednesday to discuss the problems of state-run BSNL, including its declining revenues and market share.        
	The meeting comes amid the ongoing controversy over the PSUs Rs 35,000-crore tender to add 93 million GSM lines, which may also come up for discussion.        
	The January 6 meeting was fixed long ago by the PMO. It will discuss a number of issues concerning BSNL to improve its performance. But it is not exactly to discuss the tender and the Central Vigilance Commissions probe. It may discuss expansion plans as a whole, BSNL chairman and managing director Kuldeep Goyal said.        
	It could not be ascertained whether Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would chair the meeting or the PMO officials will meet the top brass of the telecom firm.        
	Concerned over BSNLs falling revenues, the PMO had asked the company and telecom minister A. Raja to look into the causes and find ways to improve performance.         
	The company had reported the lowest net profit among telecom firms  a paltry Rs 575 crore  on a revenue of about Rs 36,000 crore last fiscal.        
	Besides, BSNL has been consistently losing market share in the mobile business because of stiff competition from private players and its inability to expand network on time.

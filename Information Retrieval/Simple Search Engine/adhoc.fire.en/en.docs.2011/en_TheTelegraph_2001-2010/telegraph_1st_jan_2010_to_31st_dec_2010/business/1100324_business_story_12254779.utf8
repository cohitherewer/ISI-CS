The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Motors share bait for global bond holders
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata Motors share bait for global bond holders
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 23: Tata Motors has made an offer to convert global bonds worth $431 million into equity in an effort to pare its roughly $5.1-billion debt.        
	The debt-trimming exercise involves an early conversion of yen- and dollar-denominated notes into equity that will be conducted through an auction.        
	The company has invited holders of its $130.2-million yen-denominated notes and $300 million denominated notes that are due to be redeemed in March and April 2011 to submit applications for the conversion.        
	A statement issued by the company said, The invitation is aimed at further optimising the capital structure of the company. Conversion by the note holders will strengthen the companys capital and reserves and will help de-leverage its balance sheet.        
	The applications by the note holders will have to choose the price options and conversion ratios offered by the company.         
	Credit Suisse Group, Standard Chartered Plc, Citigroup Inc and JP Morgan Securities will manage the conversion.        
	Analysts said the company may have chosen to convert debt into equity at this juncture as they would be spared from paying out cash in 2011. This could also be an indication that they are comfortable with their stock price at this point.        
	Tata Motors finalised the deal to buy out Jaguar Land Rover in June 2008 for $2.3 billion. A substantial part of the deal was financed by debt and the auto maker has been trying to bring down the debt on its books.        
	Last year, it sold $750 million of global depositary shares and convertible bonds to bring down debt incurred on account of buying Jaguar Land Rover. The offering fared well and Tata Motors upsized the sale from $600 million to $750 million.        
	The British brands that faced rough weather in the economic downturn have turned around since and posted a net profit after tax of Rs 416.95 crore in the third quarter of this year.        
	The Tata Motors scrip did not react favourably to the development and fell 2.76 per cent to close at Rs 739.05 on Tuesday.

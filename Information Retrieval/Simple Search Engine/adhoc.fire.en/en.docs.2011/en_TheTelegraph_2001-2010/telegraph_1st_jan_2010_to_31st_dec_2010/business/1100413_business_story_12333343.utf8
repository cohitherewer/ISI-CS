          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave (left) and minister of state for corporate affairs Salman Khursheed in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	New Delhi, April 12: Ulip investors and sellers can breathe easy for now.        
	The government today ensured that the business of selling equity-linked insurance plans (Ulips) would carry on as before, even as the two warring regulators, Sebi and the IRDA, decided to move court.         
	The finance ministrys intervention comes after Sebi and the IRDA clashed over regulating Ulips.         
	Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave and IRDA boss J. Hari Narayan rushed to Delhi and held discussions with senior officials and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, before the two sides agreed to seek a binding legal mandate.         
	The chiefs of Sebi and the IRDA held discussions on the jurisdiction of unit linked insurance plans. To resolve any ambiguity and to ensure smooth functioning in the markets, the regulators have agreed to jointly seek a binding legal mandate from an appropriate court. Meanwhile, status quo is being restored, Mukherjee told reporters after the two regulators met him.         
	When asked what could be the appropriate court, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said, I believe the high court.         
	Sources say the finance ministry is planning to set up a quasi-judicial body, which may look into the Ulip issue. A retired Supreme Court judge is likely to head the panel.         
	Life Insurance Council secretary-general S.B. Mathur said, Policyholders have got a reassurance that a way out has been found to meet uncertainties and differences of opinions and their interests will be protected so they should be reassured.        
	Minister steps in         
	Bhave and Hari Narayan met Chawla and other finance ministry officials, before Mukherjees intervention was sought.         
	Finance ministry officials said the very nature of the spat was so legalistic that we need to have a legal opinion to define who can do what in this case.        
	We need to look at both the orders internally and discuss it, Chawla said.        
	Sources said the finance minister personally intervened after both the regulators refused to climb down from their respective stands.         
	Earlier in the day, Hari Narayan told reporters that while the IRDA did not have the power to quash Sebis order, it certainly had powers to give directions to insurance firms.        
	He said the IRDA had two rounds of discussions with Sebi, but the market regulator did not move from its position.        
	He questioned the authority of Sebi to ban 14 insurers from raising money via Ulips, but added that the market regulator had a different perspective.        
	The Sebi chairman refused to comment.        
	The centre of the controversy is whether Ulips are like mutual funds and hence should come under Sebi or are insurance products under the IRDAs regulation.         
	On Friday, Sebi banned 14 life insurance companies from selling Ulips till they obtained registration from the market regulator. Within 24 hours, the IRDA asked the companies to ignore the Sebi ban and continue with their businesses.         
	The problem for the finance ministry was that one of its arms, the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), had issued a circular as late as February this year, saying Ulips were akin to mutual funds, which were regulated by Sebi.         
	Ulips are broadly similar to mutual funds, except that they are required to segregate a certain part of the premium towards the life insurance of the plan holder, the CBEC had said. This is in line with previous rulings by the tax board which sought to justify service tax on the asset management of Ulips.        
	Spats between regulators in developed markets are not totally uncommon though they are rare in India. In the UK, there have been disputes between sectoral regulators and the office of fair trade at times. Within the European Union, differences between European Union regulators and national regulators have also cropped up.

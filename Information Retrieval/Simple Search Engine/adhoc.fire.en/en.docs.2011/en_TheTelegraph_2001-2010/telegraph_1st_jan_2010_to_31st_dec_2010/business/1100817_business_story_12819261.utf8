          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Selloff mode                                  
	Hyderabad, Aug. 16: Hyderabads Ybrant Digital has bought web portal Lycos  an Internet giant during the dotcom boom of the last millennium  for $36 million, a far cry from the whopping $5.4 billion that it fetched while changing hands in May 2000.        
	Ybrant, an online marketing consultant, bought Lycos, which was at the top of the search-engine heap in the pre-Google days competing with Yahoo, Altavista and Dogpile, in a stock deal from Korean online firm Daum.        
	Lycos began as a search engine out of Americas Carnegie Mellon University in 1994. It went public in 1996 and was bought by Terra Networks, the Internet arm of Spanish telecom giant Telefonica, for $5.4 billion in 2000 at the height of the dotcom boom.         
	The Google onslaught affected the company, which failed to match the California-based firms search and advertising features.         
	In 2004, Lycos again changed hands. Terra Networks sold off the portal to Daum for just $95 million, a pittance compared with the princely sum it paid just four years ago.        
	Though Lycos is little heard now, it is still among the top 1,500 sites in popularity, according to ranking firm Alexa. The Lycos network of sites also include Tripod, Angelfire, Gamesville and Hotbot.        
	For Ybrant, the acquisition means it will serve consumers besides just meeting the marketing needs of business. Ybrant chairman and CEO Suresh Reddy said the acquisition will help bring people together to interact, to find new friends, and to express themselves in positive, powerful ways.        
	Reddy hopes to leverage Ybrants access to the worlds top 120 advertising agencies to create a marketing platform for many global companies through Lycos.        
	Our goal is to combine the benefits of Ybrants global network with what Lycos has to offer in creating a compelling global destination for our advertising clients worldwide, Reddy said.        
	Ybrant is the absolute perfect partner for us, said Jung-wook Lim, CEO of Lycos.        
	Combining Ybrants cutting edge digital solutions for both media buyers and sellers with Lycoss innovative resources and media will bring tremendous value to both our consumers and clients.

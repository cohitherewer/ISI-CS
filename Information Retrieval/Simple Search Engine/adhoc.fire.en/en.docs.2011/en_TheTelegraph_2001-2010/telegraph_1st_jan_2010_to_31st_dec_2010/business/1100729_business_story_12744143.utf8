	New Delhi, July 28: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his UK counterpart David Cameron will soon announce an Indo-British CEOs forum  on the lines of the Indo-US forum  which will offer advice to improve business links.        
	On the Indian side, Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata, Mahindra amp; Mahindra chairman Anand Mahindra and Bharti chief Sunil Mittal may be in the panel.         
	From the UK, Rolls Royce chief John Rose, Barclays Banks John Varley, BAE Systems chairman Dick Olver and Standard Chartereds Peter Sands are tipped to join the group, sources said.         
	Indias trade with the UK is valued at about 11.5 billion. But Britain, which was the fifth largest exporter five years back, has fallen to the 18th spot, while trade grew at about 14 per cent annually.         
	The CEOs forum will look to increasing trade and investment flows and lobbying governments for policy and environmental changes.        
	Cameron will try to use the CEOs forum to prise open the Indian market  especially financial services, including banking and insurance.         
	The visiting British delegation may also prod India into easing the terms for foreign direct investment in insurance, banking and defence, including allowing Lloyds of London to set up shop here.         
	Britain is keen to forge closer trade and investment ties with India to help create jobs back home.         
	Officials said the Indo-US CEOs forum had been helpful in not only improving business relations but also explaining to American legislators the importance of partnering India in other areas such as civilian nuclear co-operation.        
	We expect the Indo-British forum to be of similar help, said the officials.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel seeks relief from coal auction 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Steel seeks relief from coal auction 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Singh: Concession logic                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: Steel minister Virbhadra Singh will demand concessions for PSUs under him on mandatory competitive bidding for coal mines.         
	A group of ministers (GoM) is scheduled to take up the issue later this month.        
	I will be asking for concessions. We cannot treat state-run steel companies on a par with others. These companies have spent huge amounts in developing the areas where others are now venturing into. They have built roads and done welfare work. We cannot now ask them to participate in bidding, Singh told The Telegraph.        
	The current consensus is for mines to be allocated through open bidding.         
	The system of reserving some mines for PSUs should be allowed to continue. I will raise this issue at the GoM, he said. The coal ministry is opposed to giving any concessions to steel PSUs and believes bidding will promote transparency and a level-playing field.         
	However, the power ministry has sought an exception for those firms who had been allotted mines in forested areas but later were asked not to mine them after a new environment policy that barred entry in densely forested areas.         
	Power wants 50 per cent of all new coal bearing lands cleared for mining by the environment ministry to be allotted to those who were barred from entering the densely forested areas.        
	The steel ministry supports the power ministrys stand and wants some of this 50-per-cent reserved land exclusively for its steel PSUs. The ministry even believes open bidding does not promote a level-playing field as it supports bidders with money power and can actually push up costs. Private players have money power. PSUs cannot compete with them. Its an unequal field, said Singh.        
	The GoM is headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. His ministry has in the past supported the principle of bidding for scarce resources such as spectrum to discover the right price. However, the finance ministry has also backed concessions to PSUs, who have spent huge sums in national interest. It has infused Rs 800 crore into Air India and plans to pump another Rs 1,200 crore.        
	Steel ministry officials said it was Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) who bailed out Burnpurs Indian Iron and Steel Company (now IISCO Steel Plant) when there were no takers for the ailing firm.        
	Yet now that the price of iron ore has shot up, SAIL is asked to risk its raw material base and give up nearly half of Chiria mines so that it can be allotted to private players, officials said. Many of the iron ore areas which were kept aside for steel PSUs have been allotted to private players for a song.         
	Chiria is in Jharkhand with reserves of 1.6 billion tonnes of iron ore; SAIL and the state government are disputing the mining rights over a part of Chiria.

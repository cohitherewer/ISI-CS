	Calcutta, July 24: City-based United Bank of India (UBI) today reported a 53.5 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit at Rs 107.86 crore for the quarter ended June 30. Operating profit during the period more than doubled to Rs 340.70 crore from Rs 162.43 crore a year ago.         
	A higher provisioning for bad loans truncated the banks net profit growth. Provisioning for bad loans and other contingencies went up by a hefty 152.7 per cent to Rs 232.84 crore during the quarter compared with the same period last year.         
	Our provisioning coverage ratio at the end of June stands at 66 per cent, said Bhaskar Sen, chairman and managing director of UBI. We need to provide for another Rs 50 crore to comply with the Reserve Banks stipulation of 70 per cent provisioning coverage ratio by September this year.        
	This means if the bank can control fresh slippage in loans in the following quarters, it will not have to dig deep into its profits to provide for bad loans. So, the bank can plough back a higher proportion of its profits to increase its capital adequacy, which at the end of June stood at 12.99 per cent with tier I capital at 8.59 per cent.        
	But given a target of more than 20 per cent growth in advances, well need to raise both tier-I and tier-II capital in the current financial year, Sen said.

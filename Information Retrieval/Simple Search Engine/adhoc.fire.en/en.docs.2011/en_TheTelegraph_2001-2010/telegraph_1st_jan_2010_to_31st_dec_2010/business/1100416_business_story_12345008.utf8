                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Godrej weighs third facility in south
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Broader picture                                  
	Calcutta, April 15: Home appliances manufacturer Godrej amp; Boyce, which is planning to foray into cooking appliances and water purifiers in a big way, plans to set up its third manufacturing facility in south India this year.         
	Though the company is yet to finalise the location for the third plant in the south, it has shortlisted a few.        
	A final call on the site will be taken soon, George Menezes, chief operating officer of Godrej Appliances, said here today.         
	The companys fourth plant will be in the east. Plans for the eastern region will take 4-5 years to shape up, he said.        
	Over the past 3-4 years, the company has doubled capacity by restructuring its manufacturing and supply chain. It has closed its facilities in Greater Mumbai, and has added capacity at its plant in Mohali, Punjab.        
	We have identified other areas where we can get into, such as cooking appliances and water products, Menezes said at the launch of Godrejs Eon range of LED television sets in Calcutta.         
	He said the company was already into water products in a small way.        
	The water purifier market is still in its nascent stage. But it has high growth potential. The total market size is around Rs 1,500 crore, Kamal Nandi, vice-president (sales and marketing) of Godrej Appliances, said.

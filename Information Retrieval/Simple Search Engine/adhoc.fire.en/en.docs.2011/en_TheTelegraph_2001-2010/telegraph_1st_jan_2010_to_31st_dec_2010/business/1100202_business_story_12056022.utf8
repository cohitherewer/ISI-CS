          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 1: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) doesnt plan to raise interest rates in between the designated dates for its quarterly reviews of monetary policy if inflation stays under its forecast for the year.        
	At its third quarter review of monetary policy on January 29, the central bank raised its inflation forecast for the year ended march 31 to 8.5 per cent from 6.5 per cent earlier.        
	The next policy review is on April 20.        
	This is the first time that the RBI has come out with such an unequivocal statement on policy formulation. It is expected to send out signals to volatile bond markets that have been trying to second-guess the central bank on interest rate changes.        
	A mid-policy action is really in response to a completely unanticipated event. We will watch how inflation moves in the next few months. We see inflation at 8.5 per cent by March and that may start to moderate The scenario we are working on is that inflation will rise till March, plateau after that and then start to come down. In that sense, there is no case for a mid-policy action, RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn said at a conference call with analysts, which was another ground-breaking event for the RBI.        
	Reserve Bank governor Duvvuri Subbarao and the three other deputy governors were also present at the conference call.        
	Last week, the central bank struck a fairly hawkish stance when it decided to suck out Rs 36,000 crore of excess cash within the financial system by raising the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks by 75 basis points. The CRR is that portion of bank deposits that must be maintained with the RBI.        
	Even as the central bank raised its inflation forecast by two percentage points, there was a sharp buzz of speculation within the banking industry that an increase in short-term interest rates  especially the reverse repo  was just round the corner.        
	Subbarao said yields on government bonds could rise if the Centres borrowings exceeded the RBIs expectations. He added that the central bank had tried to estimate the actual level of government borrowing on the basis of the fiscal deficit estimated by the finance minister.        
	The government will borrow Rs 4.51 trillion this fiscal year. According to the RBIs recent review, the government has already borrowed 98 per cent of its requirement. Only one auction of government bonds worth Rs 8000 crore is scheduled on February 5 on the basis of the calendar that the Centre and the RBI have drawn up earlier in the year. The Centre has the option of borrowing more in the event of an unanticipated need.        
	Subbarao said government borrowings in the next fiscal would pose a challenge as the demand for credit from the private sector was expected to surge.        
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year government security rose to 7.63 per cent after Subbaraos comment that the governments gross borrowings would be higher next fiscal and that bond yields might rise as a result.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Joining forces                                  
	New Delhi, July 6: Players in the soft drinks and fruit juice businesses, including Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Dabur, have formed a lobby group called Indian Beverage Association.        
	Non-alcoholic and fruit beverages are among the fastest growing sector within the beverage industry. But theres no comprehensive industry association representing the companies. Hence, the decision to float this organisation, Sunil Duggal, CEO of Dabur India, told The Telegraph.         
	Industry players said the association was likely to take up issues revolving around double taxation, high value-added taxes and the goods and services tax (GST).         
	GST, which will replace excise duty and service tax at the central level and value-added tax at the state level as well as cess, surcharges and local taxes, is expected to be implemented from the next fiscal.        
	Earlier this year, the Delhi government had increased VAT on soft drinks to 20 per cent from 12.5 per cent, but companies had not been able to hike prices for fear of impacting demand.         
	The new association will also assist firms to comply with food safety guidelines and deal with state-level controversies such as allegations of water depletion (as is the case with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo), said an industry executive.        
	Packaging company Tetra Pak, bottling firms Pearl Drinks and Bengal Beverages, energy drink maker Red Bull, and drip and sprinkler systems firm Jain Irrigation Systems are also part of the association. Another 30-40 bottlers, vendors and suppliers, including Bisleri International, Parle Agro, Amul and Godrej, are expected to join the association.         
	The association aims to be the national voice for the non-alcoholic beverage industry and to represent the interests of the members. It will serve as an interface among the industry, government and the public, secretary-general Arvind Varma said.         
	According to industry estimates, the size of the non-alcoholic drinks market was at Rs 21,600 crore in 2008. It is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 15 per cent during 2010-2012.        
	The key objective of the association is to address the members common concerns pertaining to the central and state governments, various regulatory agencies, trade associations and other stakeholders.         
	The Indian Soft Drinks Manufacturers Association, represented by the two cola companies  Coca-Cola and Pepsi  is being merged with the Indian Beverage Association.         
	Analysts said the association was being set up on the lines of global organisations such as American Beverage Association and British Soft Drinks Association.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      PM holds out hope for Air India, BSNL
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manmohan Singh in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Prime minister Manmohan Singh today hinted at injecting cash into national carrier Air India and state-run telecom firm BSNL to improve their balance sheets.        
	Enterprises, which are facing difficulties, such as Air India and BSNL, are receiving the due attention of the government, Singh said at an industry event.        
	Saddled with a loss of Rs 5,551 crore in 2009-10, Air India is seeking fresh equity. If the proposal is approved, it will be the second cash infusion since February, when the beleaguered carrier received Rs 800 crore.        
	BSNL has lost market share to private operators and suffered its first loss of Rs 1,822.65 crore in 2009-10.        
	Acting on behalf of the Prime Minister, a committee headed by Sam Pitroda has come up with suggestions, which include outsourcing BSNLs networks to global equipment firms.         
	The government is also looking at a new policy to support PSUs planning to buy global assets. The government is committed to a strong public sector in many areas of our economy. In some sectors, there is a need for PSU enterprises to explore global opportunities. The government is working on a policy to support these enterprises in this effort, the Prime Minister said.        
	Singh said 20 out of the 39 PSUs revived by the Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises, were making profits. We must ensure that these improvements are sustained in the long run, and these firms do not need to come back to the government for fresh revival packages.         
	Accountability focus        
	Singh today asked the public sector to ensure the highest standard of corporate accountability. He said the government had encouraged PSUs to adopt a robust and transparent performance management system.         
	The remarks come at a time questions are being raised on the practice followed by some large industrial houses in influencing government policies.         
	Meanwhile, corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed said in Chennai that he would discuss the issue of regulating corporate lobbying with other ministries following the storm over the Niira Radia tapes. He said there was no law to ban or regulate corporate lobbying at present.         
	Today we do not have anything in the draft (company bill) that is before Parliament. But we may have to find some other way of regulating it, he said.

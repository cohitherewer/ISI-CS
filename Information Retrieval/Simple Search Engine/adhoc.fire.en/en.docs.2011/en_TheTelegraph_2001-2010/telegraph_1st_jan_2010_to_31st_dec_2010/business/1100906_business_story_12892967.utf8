                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Pension query
                                In 2001, I purchased a Jeevan Suraksha annuity policy from LIC for receiving pension. The premium for this 5-year policy was Rs 11,039. The annual premium was deductible under Section 80CCC. I enjoyed the tax benefit between 2000-02 and 2004-05. I retired from service in March 2005. I am receiving a pension of Rs 587 per month from the policy and showing the pension income in my annual income tax return. Does the Income Tax Act provide any relief to the above pension amount and is the amount taxable?          D. Sen, Chuchura
                      Pension income is taxable while an assessee can claim deduction up to Rs 1 lakh on the annual premium paid for purchasing a pension plan. However, the new direct taxes code proposed exemption on the annuity income. But till now, the annuity income is taxable as normal income.                                      Senior worry      I have come to know that tax at the rate of 10 per cent will be deducted at source from the interest income of the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme from this financial year, that is 2010-11, despite submitting Form 15H. Is this correct?        Shubhendu Sengupta, Behala
                    TDS is applicable on interest income from SCSS since the time the scheme was launched. PAN has been made mandatory from April this year. Even if you are submitting Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source, tax will be deducted without the submission of PAN along with it. If you submit your PAN and Form 15H together, tax will not be deducted.                                  Age matters      I have a monthly income of Rs 7,000 from pension. My total income for the financial year will be Rs 1,70,336, including interest income from deposits in monthly income schemes. Shall I have to pay tax and submit Form 16?        S. Sen Sharma, Calcutta
                    If you are more than 65-years-old, you shall not have to pay any tax because in that case your annual income will be less than the basic exemption limit. If you are below 65 years, you shall have to pay tax. The exemption limit for annual income is Rs 1,60,000 and you shall have to pay tax at the rate of 10.3 per cent on the income exceeding the threshold limit.

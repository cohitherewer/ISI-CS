	Calcutta, July 10: The government will enact a legislation to ensure subsidised wheat and rice to the poor, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said at a seminar titled Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern States.        
	We are committed to enacting a legislation on food security (called National Food Security Act). But to make it successful, we need to produce more, procure more and strengthen the delivery mechanism for making foodgrain accessible to the poor at affordable cost, Mukherjee said.         
	The UPA government has promised to enact a National Food Security Act, under which families below the poverty line will get 25 kg of foodgrain every month at Rs 3 per kg.        
	According to the finance minister, the National Advisory Council, headed by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, is looking into the various aspects of the draft food security bill.         
	The government will also set up a central task force for the promotion of hybrid rice varieties to augment the production of the grain, said Sharad Pawar, the Union agriculture and food minister.        
	The task force will be headed by an additional secretary and it will hold periodic meetings with the eastern states.         
	The task force will work out a blue print for increasing the area under hybrid rice cultivation, besides formulating strategies to create clusters of villages adopting hybrid rice. Procurement centres will be opened in those areas to provide marketing support to farmers, Pawar said.         
	Notably, China has increased its rice productivity using hybrid seed cultivation and promoting it through the creation of a central task force.         
	The agriculture ministry had already sent a team, led by minister of state K.V. Thomas, to China. The team has submitted its report with recommendations.         
	Rice productivity is 3.3 tonnes per hectare in India, while it is almost double at 6.6 mt in China. Chinas annual rice production is 200 million tonnes compared with 150mt in India.         
	The ministry has also noticed that while almost 63 per cent of Chinese land under rice cultivation uses hybrid variety, it is a mere 3 per cent in India.         
	The government has decided to promote hybrid rice seeds following a sharp decline in production last year due to draught like situation.

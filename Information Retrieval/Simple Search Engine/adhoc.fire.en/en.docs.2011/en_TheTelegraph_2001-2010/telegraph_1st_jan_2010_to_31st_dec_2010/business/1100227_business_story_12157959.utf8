The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengals port dream comes true
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bengals port dream comes true
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Harbouring hope                          
	Calcutta, Feb. 26: Bengals clarion call for a new deepwater port in the state was heard by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today when he announced the construction of a port at Sagar Island.        
	Mukherjee said necessary funds would be provided in due course to build the port.         
	Mukherjees promise comes as a blessing for trade and industry in the state as well as the entire eastern region, which looks up to Calcutta and Haldia as the shipping gateway to the world.        
	The announcement came at a time both the ports were going through a difficult phase because of heavy siltation in the Hooghly, choking movement of ships.        
	Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), which oversees port operations at Haldia and Calcutta, had long been proposing to build a port at Sagar to alleviate the problems of shipping trade.        
	Last year, it had initiated the process to set up a port afresh by calling expressions of interest from private developers as the CPT wanted it to be on public-private partnership mode.        
	Around 15 companies had shown interest in the project while seven were keen on it.        
	According to the proposal mooted by the port, 8-10 berths can be built on the island near the mouth of the Hooghly, especially to handle bulk cargoes such as coal, iron ore, fertiliser and pulses. Container handling facility is to be taken up later.        
	The project cost is envisaged to be Rs 3,500 crore. It can handle close to 40-50 lakh tonnes of cargo.        
	However, interested private parties sought two clarifications from the CPT.         
	They wanted a techno-commercial feasibility study to be done.         
	They also wanted a road connecting the port to the mainland to aggregate and evacuate the cargo.        
	A port official said the Sundarban Development Board had already written to the Centre seeking Rs 550 crore to build a 4-km bridge connecting Harwood Point on the island to Lot no. 8 near Kakdweep in the main land.        
	We can handle Panamax vessel with 60,000 tonnes cargo since 10 metre natural draft is available. The draft can be increased to 12 meter by capital dredging, he added.        
	In contrast, Haldias average draft is 6.5 metre handling 18,000-20,000 tonne ships at best.        
	However, the CPT also needs to find ways to save Haldia port by opening Eden channel facilitating greater ship movement.

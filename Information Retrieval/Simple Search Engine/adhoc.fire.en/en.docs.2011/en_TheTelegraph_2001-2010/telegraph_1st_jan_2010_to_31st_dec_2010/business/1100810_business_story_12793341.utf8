          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kidwai: New responsibility                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 9: Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd (HSBC) has inducted Naina Lal Kidwai into its Asia-Pacific board.        
	Kidwai, who is now the country head of HSBC in India, will join the board with effect from October 1. A press statement from HSBC today said her appointment would be subject to regulatory approval from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.        
	Her appointment as a director on HSBCs Asia-Pacific board comes a month after the bank agreed to buy the Indian retail and commercial banking business of Royal Bank of Scotland. Kidwai has been with HSBC since 2002. She will, however, not be the first Indian to be on its Asia-Pacific board. While Zia Mody is now on this board, N.R. Narayana Murthy is on the board of HSBC Holdings, the holding company of the group.        
	The Asia-Pacific region is crucial for HSBC. Comprising nearly 21 countries, it contributes around 50 per cent to the banks profit before tax.        
	On Kidwais appointment, Michael Geoghegan, chairman of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd and group chief executive of HSBC Holdings Plc, said, Nainas appointment to the board is a reflection of the growing importance of India in our emerging markets strategy. We recently announced our third major investment in the country in the last two years and see a range of growth opportunities in areas of strength for HSBC, including insurance and serving businesses that trade internationally.        
	Kidwai now heads HSBC India, which employs 35,000 people comprising banking services, insurance, asset management, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets, HSBC Software Development (India) Pvt Ltd and the global service centres, which manage its operations in the UK, the US and European Union.         
	Earlier, she was the deputy chief executive officer of HSBC in India and the managing director and vice-chairman of HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India Pvt Ltd.         
	From 1994 to 2002, Kidwai was at Morgan Stanley as vice-chairman of JM Morgan Stanley and head of the investment bank in India.         
	From 1982 to1994, she was at ANZ Grindlays, with assignments comprising head of the investment bank, head of global NRI services and head of retail banking in the western region. She is also the non-executive director on the board of Nestle SA and member of the audit committee.

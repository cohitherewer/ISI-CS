The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Committee to review small savings rate
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Committee to review small savings rate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Money matters                                  
	New Delhi, July 13: The government today formed a committee to review the structure of the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) and suggest how the schemes could be made more flexible and market-linked.        
	The panel will be headed by Reserve Bank deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath.        
	While making its recommendations, the committee is expected to consider the importance of small savings within the overall savings in the economy, especially its contribution in promoting savings amongst small investors and the need of NSSF to be a viable fund, the finance ministry said in a release.         
	The committee was mooted by the 13th Finance Commission, which wanted the 9.5-10.5 per cent rates at which states borrowed from the NSSF to be reduced in line with market rates.        
	At present, the base lending rate of State Bank, the countrys largest commercial bank, stands at 7.5 per cent, while for other nationalised banks it is around 8 per cent.         
	However, to bring down the lending rate on NSSF funds, which come from post office term deposits, National Savings Certificates and Kisan Vikas Patras, officials said, the deposit rates would have to be brought down too.         
	At present, post office term deposit rates vary between 6.25 per cent and 7.5 per cent depending on the number of years they have to be locked in, while NSC and KVP, which are locked in for 6-9 years, offer 8 per cent rates of return.         
	The Centre gives each state a part of the amount raised through small savings as a 25-year loan carrying 9.5-10.5 per cent interest.         
	However, there is a moratorium of five years on the principal amount.        
	According to former finance secretary Vijay Kelkar, who headed the 13th Finance Commission, when deposit rates on small savings schemes are higher than market rates, these schemes fetch higher subscriptions.         
	To service high deposit rates, the lending rate has to be high, too, which in turn jacks up the borrowing costs of states who source funds from the small savings corpus.        
	With overall borrowings capped by fiscal responsibility act targets, states cannot borrow from the open market.

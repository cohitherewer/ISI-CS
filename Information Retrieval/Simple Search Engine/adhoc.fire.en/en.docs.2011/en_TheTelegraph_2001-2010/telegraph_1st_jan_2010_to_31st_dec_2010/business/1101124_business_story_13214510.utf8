                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      PM vows more action to check price rise
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manmohan Singh in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today hinted at more steps to contain inflation as food prices remained high.        
	Our government is making serious efforts to moderate inflation rates. There are difficulties to check the price rise, but the government shall overcome them, he said at the Indian Labour conference here today.        
	He was responding to a request from a trade union leader to tame inflation as it was hurting workers.        
	Though food and general inflation rates have been declining for the past few weeks, they still remain above the comfort level.        
	Singh said some labour laws had not yielded the desired results, and there was a need to revisit those laws that hurt the growth of employment.        
	We have enacted several progressive labour laws since Independence and some even before that. But it appears that not all these laws have had the intended good effects that we would like to see on the ground, he said.        
	Singh said there was a need to consider the possible role of some of the labour laws in contributing to rigidities in the labour market which hurt the growth of employment. Is it possible that our best intentions for labour are not actually met by laws that sound progressive on paper but end up hurting the very workers they are meant to protect.        
	Stating that the government was committed to economic reforms with a human face, he said the Centres ability to devote more resources for social welfare activities depended on the ability of the economy to grow at 9-10 per cent per annum.

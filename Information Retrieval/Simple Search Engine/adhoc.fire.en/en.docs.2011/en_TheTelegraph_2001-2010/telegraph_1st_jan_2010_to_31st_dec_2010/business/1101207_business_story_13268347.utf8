          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Growth drive                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 6: Volvo Buses will buy out the 30 per cent stake held by its Indian partner in Volvo Buses India Private Limited, giving the Swedish company full control of its Indian operations.         
	Volvo will acquire the stake of Azad Group, its joint venture partner since 2008. The move will provide Volvo with greater flexibility to expand in the coming years.         
	The buyout was through a mutual agreement with Azad Group keeping in mind its plans to ramp up production for the Indian market and exports, Akash Passey, managing director of Volvo Buses India Private Limited, said.        
	He, however, refused to divulge the financial details of the buyout.        
	Volvos growth plans include a 100 per cent increase in production in the next two years. It will cater to more export markets and introduce more products in different segments. This will see its investments in India doubling during this period.         
	Volvo will increase capacity at its Hoskote facility near Bangalore by 100 per cent.         
	It is drawing up a strategy to boost exports. Volvo aims to increase the share of exports in its total production to 25-30 per cent over the next few years from 5 per cent now.         
	The company has over 75 per cent market share in the luxury inter-city AC coach segment and over 50 per cent market share in the AC diesel low-floor city bus segment.         
	We have seen robust growth in 2010 in terms of orders and production. Key concepts that will drive future progress of long-haul luxury travel are now getting segmented with higher demand. We at Volvo have built a strong base via a partnership with almost every private, public and institutional customer, Passey said.

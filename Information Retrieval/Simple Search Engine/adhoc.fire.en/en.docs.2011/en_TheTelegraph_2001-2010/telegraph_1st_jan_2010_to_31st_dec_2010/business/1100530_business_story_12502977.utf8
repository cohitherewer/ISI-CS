	Total income rose to Rs 5,304.63 crore from Rs 3,646.57 crore in the same period a year ago.         
	The outstanding financial results for the quarter comes on the back of strong sales registered by the automobile and farm equipment sector.        
	For the full year, the company reported a profit after tax of Rs 2,087.8 crore, an over two-fold rise compared with Rs 836.8 crore a year ago.

	Emami growth        
	Emami has reported a 19.7 per cent growth in net sales at Rs 280.27 crore in the fourth quarter compared with Rs 234.06 crore a year ago. Net profit grew 44 per cent, backed by strong margin expansion, to Rs 39.41 crore from Rs 27.29 crore.

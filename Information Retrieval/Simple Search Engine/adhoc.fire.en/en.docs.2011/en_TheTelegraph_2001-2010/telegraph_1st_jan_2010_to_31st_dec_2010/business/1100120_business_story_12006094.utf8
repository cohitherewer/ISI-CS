The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Price formula tweak to help fuel retailers
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Price formula tweak to help fuel retailers
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Pandey: Mulling measures                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: The government is moving away from a discretionary method of sharing the burden of selling fuel below cost to a more systematic approach that can lower the burden on oil PSUs but is likely to fall short of linking petrol and diesel prices to global crude prices.        
	Wait for the (financial) year to end. All along it has been on an ad hoc basis, R.S. Pandey, petroleum secretary, said on the sidelines of an industry conference.        
	Sources said the government might automatically raise fuel prices if the crude price went beyond a sustainable level.         
	It is not clear whether the government will spell out the sustainable level or leave it undefined as fuel prices are a politically sensitive issue.        
	Officials said the formula is being discussed by the expert group on fuel pricing headed by Kirit Parikh, former Planning Commission member. The expert group is expected to submit its report by the end of this month.        
	Another option is to consider each fuel separately and assess the extent to which consumers will bear the burden.         
	Fuel prices should go up the most for petrol and the least for kerosene. In diesel and LPG cylinder, the degree of burden on the consumer should be stated explicitly, officials said.        
	The panel is also trying to drop the ad hoc discounts that upstream oil firms such as ONGC Ltd, Oil India Limited and GAIL (India) Limited give to the public sector refiners.        
	Instead, a special tax would be levied on the upstream firms whenever crude prices moved beyond a level, and the corpus distributed among the refiners.        
	However, it is not yet clear whether the new formula will result in a level-playing field for private refiners.        
	Oil ministry officials said the finance ministry had given Rs 12,000 crore as cash compensation to the state-run refiners.        
	We have got it and we have disbursed it, S. Sundareshan, special secretary in the ministry of petroleum, said.        
	Pandey, however, said the compensation was inadequate. He said the trio of IOC, HPCL and BPCL had suffered a loss of around Rs 21,000 crore on just LPG and kerosene during April-December.        
	ONGC burden        
	Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited will give Rs 3,947 crore as subsidy to the PSU refiners for selling fuel below costs.

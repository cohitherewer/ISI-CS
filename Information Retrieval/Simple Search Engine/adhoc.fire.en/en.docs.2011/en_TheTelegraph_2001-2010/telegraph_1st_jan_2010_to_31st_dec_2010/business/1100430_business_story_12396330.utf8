                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Uninor to roll out services in city by June
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 29: Unitech Wireless, which offers mobile connections under the Uninor brand, will roll out services in Calcutta and the rest of Bengal by June.        
	The company, which debuted in December 2009, currently operates in nine of the 22 circles. Besides the two circles in Bengal, we will roll out services in Mumbai, Gujarat and Rajasthan within this quarter, Akash Das, executive vice-president (Calcutta), said.        
	Uninor is present in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh (east and west), Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa. The company has achieved a subscriber base of 3.6 million within three months.        
	According to industry experts, rolling out services in each circle requires an investment of $40-50 million. However, Uninor has adopted the outsourcing model.         
	It holds a pan-India licence and targets an 8 per cent market share by 2018.         
	We aim to complete the rollout in all the circles by year-end, Das said.        
	The company today shifted to its new office, spread over 27,500 square feet, at Salt Lakes Sector V.         
	The company will also introduce data services soon and plans to bring bundled offers in due course, Das said. Talks are on, but things are yet to be finalised.        
	Uninor is a joint venture between Delhi-based real estate giant Unitech and Norways Telenor. While Telenor holds a 67.25 per cent stake in Uninor, the remaining 32.75 per cent is with Unitech.

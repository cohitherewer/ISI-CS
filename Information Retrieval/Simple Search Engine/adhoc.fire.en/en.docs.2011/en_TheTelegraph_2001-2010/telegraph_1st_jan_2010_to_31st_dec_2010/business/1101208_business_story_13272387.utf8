The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crisil raises forecast
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Crisil raises forecast
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 7: Credit rating agency Crisil has revised Indias growth forecast upwards to 8.6 per cent for this fiscal from its earlier projection of 8.2 per cent on account of the economys good performance in the first two quarters of 2010-11.         
	While the agency expects agriculture to grow 5 per cent, industry and services sectors are expected to grow 8.6 and 9.4 per cent, respectively. According to Crisil, robust farm production is aiding the growth recovery and also checking inflation.         
	We have upgraded our GDP (gross domestic product) growth forecast to 8.6 per cent for 2010-11, based on our expectations of 8.4 per cent growth in private consumption. The internal rebalancing of growth in India now seems to be complete, with resurgence in private consumption, complementing investment demand, even as the fiscal and monetary stimulus is being unwound, D.K. Joshi, chief economist at Crisil, said.         
	According to its estimates, industrial growth is expected to decelerate to 7.3 per cent in the second half from 10.1 per cent in the first half of this fiscal. However, the average industrial growth for the year at 8.6 per cent, will remain above the long-term trend.         
	The current account deficit forecast, which has been raised to 3.3 per cent of GDP, is expected to cushion the rupee from a sharp appreciation because of the surge in capital inflows.

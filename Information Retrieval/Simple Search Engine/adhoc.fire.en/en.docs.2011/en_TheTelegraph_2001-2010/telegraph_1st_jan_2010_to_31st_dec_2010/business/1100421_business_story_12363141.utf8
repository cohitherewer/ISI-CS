  - RBI focus on growth, price check        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, April 20: The Reserve Bank of India today took a measured step in meeting the twin objectives of growth and price stability when it raised key short-term rates (repo, reverse repo) and the cash reserve ratio only by 25 basis points each.        
	Governor Duvvuri Subbarao considered the measures as baby steps to take the economy back to the levels prior to the global financial crisis. With the recovery now firmly in place, we need to move in a calibrated manner in the direction of normalising our policy instruments, he said.        
	The central bank today raised the repo rate to 5.25 per cent and the reverse repo rate to 3.75 per cent, while the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was up at 7 per cent.         
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI lends to banks and reverse repo the rate at which it borrows from them.         
	The hike in CRR  the portion of bank deposits that must be with the RBI  is expected to suck Rs 12,500 crore out of the system.         
	Bankers, however, said rate hikes on retail loans, such as housing and cars, were unlikely as there was sufficient liquidity in the system. The excess liquidity is put at Rs 50,000 crore.         
	Subbarao, however, did not rule out the possibility of a further tightening of monetary policy before the next review on July 27. He said this depended on monsoon, crude prices and demand pressures.        
	He said the policy action would result in restricting inflation, sustaining the recovery process apart from meeting private and government demands for credit.        
	The RBI was positive in its outlook for the economy, estimating the growth in the gross domestic product for 2010-11 at 8 per cent. This is based on the assumption of a normal monsoon and industrial and services sectors sustaining its performance.         
	The inflation projection for March 2011 was a more benign 5.5 per cent. Analysts said that this could be on account of the base effect reversing soon and also on the assumption of a normal monsoon.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, however, expected inflation to be closer to 4 per cent by the end of the year.         
	Long-run inflation is very difficult to predict and is based not only on some statistical analysis but also on intuition, said the minister, adding that if nothing untoward happens on the weather front, overall inflation should be on a downward trajectory from now on.         
	He said RBIs actions complement well the policies of the ministry of finance aimed at controlling inflation and promoting sustainable growth these policies should have a gentle impact in tightening money in the economy and should dampen further inflationary pressures.        
	Some observers may worry that tightening of credit can dampen growth, especially in the durable goods sector. But our analysis of industrial growth and credit offtake suggests that there is no reason for such apprehension. In fact, these policies will aid sustainable growth, the finance minister added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 1: Anil Ambani has raised his stake in Reliance Infrastructure.         
	The company today said it had allotted 1.96 crore shares to AAA Project Ventures Pvt Ltd, a promoter group company, against convertible warrants issued to them.        
	As a result, the promoter holding in Reliance Infrastructure will jump to 42.73 per cent from 37.74 per cent.        
	Last July, the board of Reliance Infrastructure had decided to allot 4.29 crore convertible warrants to AAA Project Ventures entitling them to one equity share per warrant at an issue price of Rs 929 a share. The issue price was calculated according to applicable guidelines laid down by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.        
	In a statement today, Reliance Infrastructure said the effective purchase cost to the promoter group was Rs 1,112 a share after taking into consideration the upfront payment of Rs 783 crore already received on warrants issued earlier, which were cancelled.         
	Last year, the company had approved a new preferential offer, cancelling an offer of a similar size at a higher conversion price of Rs 1,822 per share. The revised offer came as share prices of Reliance Infrastructure had then taken a massive beating in line with then market conditions, making it unlikely that the promoters would exercise them. The upfront money was then moved to the companys reserves.        
	Reliance Infrastructure said if the promoter group company converted the remaining warrants, Anil Ambanis stake in the firm would rise further to 48 per cent.         
	This equity capital infusion will substantially enhance Reliance Infrastructures net worth to Rs 160,000 crore and further augment its capabilities to Rs 32,000 crore at even a debt:equity of 2:1, thereby enabling greater participation in mega growth opportunities in high growth infrastructure areas and generating superior returns for its over 1.5 million shareholders, the company said.        
	Reliance Infrastructure is involved in generation, transmission, distribution and trading of electricity and constructing power plants as EPC partners.         
	It is also involved in roads, urban infrastructure, which includes sealink projects and airports, specialty real estate of business districts, trade towers, convention centre and SEZ.        
	The Reliance Infrastructure share rose 1.73 per cent to close at Rs 1,015.65 on the BSE. Analysts said the market always reads any increase in the promoters stake as a positive sign for the stock.

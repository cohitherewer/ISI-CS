The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dual policy to govern China entry
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Dual policy to govern China entry
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, May 11: The government is considering a proposal to make it easier for Chinese companies to invest in areas such as consumer durables, while setting stringent norms for sensitive sectors where foreign investment will not be allowed or vetted for security reasons.         
	The government will not issue any fresh guidelines but rather circulate internal notes, taking into account constant protests by Chinese diplomats on what they consider discrimination. Indian industry also feels a quid pro quo may be needed as China has made it easy to set up shop or buy out firms there.        
	FDI proposals in soft sectors such as consumer durables and pharma products should not be cleared by security agencies at all. Proposals for ports, airports, cargo or courier handling, airlines and telecom should be governed by security norms but not investments in other areas, said top government officials.        
	Restrictions will continue to apply to firms from countries such as China and Pakistan in sensitive border areas such as the Northeast, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Andaman amp; Nicobar Islands. This will mean an informal barrier to not only investment from countries with which India has a security issue in these border areas but also restrictions on operations such as contracts to set up dams and power plants.         
	According to officials, the employment of expats will continue to be governed by security regulations. They are working out ways to monitor the award of work contracts to Chinese engineering vendors by steel firms and mines in the Maoist areas in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh as in the past Chinese vendors have arrived with large teams of workers.         
	The result may actually lead to more protests by Chinese firms. Chinese telecom companies such as Huawei and ZTE as well as infrastructure builders such as Hutchison Ports have faced problems in the country.         
	Although India-China relations are now going through a cordial phase, the security agencies do not want to take any chances. The home ministry had refused to clear the exploration plans for some blocks in Assam where Oil India wanted to hire drilling rigs from a Chinese company. In the past, the defence ministry has indicated that it favours completely barring companies from Malaysia, China, and Pakistan from oil exploration in border or island areas.         
	However, the commerce ministry said Indian companies had committed a total investment of $235 million in China in sectors such as pharma, auto components, software and machine tools. Investment flows from China have, however, not picked up yet. The ministry feels India should show greater flexibility in handling investment proposals.

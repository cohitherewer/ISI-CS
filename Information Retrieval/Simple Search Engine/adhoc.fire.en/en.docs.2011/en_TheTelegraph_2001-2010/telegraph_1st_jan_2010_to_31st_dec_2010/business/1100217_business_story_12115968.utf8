          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 16: The Damodar Valley Corporation is planning to raise Rs 640 crore through the private placement of secured, non-convertible, redeemable debentures.         
	The size of the bond issue is Rs 500 crore, and it has a greenshoe option of another Rs 140 crore, said T.K. Gupta, director (accounts), DVC.         
	The tenure of the bonds will be seven years.        
	According to Gupta, the proceeds will be utilised for the projects going on stream by March next year.         
	Chandrapura VII amp; VIII (250x2mw) is expected to be completed in March. By October, five more projects will commence production  the 500mw thermal project at Kodarma; the seventh and eighth units (2x500mw) of Mejia thermal power station; Raghunathpur unit I (600mw); a 500mw thermal power station at Andal; and the 525mw Maithon Right Bank project, in a joint venture with Tata Power.        
	The second unit at the Maithon Right Bank project will come up by February-March 2011; Raghunathpur unit II (600mw) is expected to be completed by January next year.        
	The bond issue has already got encouraging response from 18 leading merchant bankers who have evinced their interest in underwriting the issue with a letter of commitment, Gupta said. He said the commitment letters indicated oversubscription of the issue.        
	However, Gupta declined to divulge further details on the amount. The issue will be allotted through the book-building process.         
	However, unlike the last bond issue in 2002, the DVC will only have a ceiling rate of interest for the bonds.         
	In the 2002 issue, there was a floor and a ceiling rate.         
	Besides, the bonds will be listed on the National Stock Exchange, providing greater liquidity to investors.         
	The ceiling rate of interest will be announced on February 19 when the issue opens, based on the prevailing yield on government securities of same maturity, Gupta said.

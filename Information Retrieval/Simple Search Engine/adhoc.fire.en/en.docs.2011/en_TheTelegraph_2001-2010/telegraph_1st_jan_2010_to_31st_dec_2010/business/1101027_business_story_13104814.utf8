	Our special correspondent  
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the economy could grow 8.75 per cent during this fiscal, helped by moderating inflation.  
	The IMF has projected a higher 9.7 per cent growth in 2010.  
	The Congress-led government has been concerned over rising prices, which were threatening to choke economic growth and hitting the party politically.   
	With both consumer and wholesale indices coming down to single digits, inflation is likely to fall to 6 per cent on an annualised basis, Mukherjee said. He was speaking at the annual Economic Editors Conference here today.   
	High inflation had affected family budgets. Prices of food items such as vegetables, rice, wheat and pulses remain a big concern, he said, adding that all inflation indices were on their way down.   
	Mukherjee said Indias growth story remained intact despite the global downturn. It is reasonable to expect that the economy will go back to robust growth path of around 9 per cent on an average, the way it was before the global crisis slowed it down.   
	Economic growth had averaged 9 per cent for three consecutive years from 2005-06 to 2007-08 but dipped to 6.7 per cent in 2008-09. It clawed up to 7.4 per cent in 2009-10 and to 8.8 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal.

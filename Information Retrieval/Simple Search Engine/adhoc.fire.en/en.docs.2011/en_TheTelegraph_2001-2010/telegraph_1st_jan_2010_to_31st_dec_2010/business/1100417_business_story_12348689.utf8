          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Price pinch                          
	New Delhi, April 16: The government has convened a meeting of steel producers in the wake of rising prices of the product.        
	We have convened a meeting on April 22 of all the steel producers. We want to understand whats happening on the prices front, steel secretary Atul Chaturvedi said.        
	Prices are moving upwards on the back of a rise in the cost of vital raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal as well as high demand from consuming sectors such as automobile and infrastructure. Steel demand is expected to grow at 9-10 per cent this financial year (over the last fiscal), he said. Domestic demand in 2009-10 rose 7.6 per cent to 56.32 million tonnes.        
	Commodities like steel have cyclical demand movement. At present it is moving in the upward territory, he added.        
	Chaturvedi said steel was a deregulated sector. We cant legally intervene and ask firms to freeze prices.        
	Steel firms such as Tata Steel and SAIL have increased prices by around Rs 6,000 a tonne since February. At present, prices in the domestic market are hovering in the range of Rs 29,000-50,000 a tonne.

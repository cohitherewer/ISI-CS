The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Scope for Tatas to reap gains   Riversdale stake value soars 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Scope for Tatas to reap gains   Riversdale stake value soars 
          SAMBIT SAHA                                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 24: Tata Steel can make a cool gain of 117 per cent on its investment in Riversdale Mining if it chooses to exit the Africa-focused Australian company.        
	The Indian company has so far invested around Aus$422 million to corner a 24.21 per cent stake in Riversdale. Going by the takeover bid mounted by global mining giant Rio Tinto, the Tata stake is now valued at Aus$914 million.        
	Rio has offered Aus$16 a share to buy Riversdale, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. The board of Riversdale has accepted the offer and recommended the bid to its shareholders, including Tata Steel.        
	So far the Tatas have kept their strategy close to their chest. Tata Steel notes the takeover bid for Riversdale Mining announced by Rio Tinto. Tata Steel will evaluate the takeover bid in the context of other alternatives available to Tata Steel, the statement said. No further explanation was forthcoming from the worlds eighth largest steel maker, but experts believed chances of the Tatas making a counter-bid over Rios Aus$3.9-billion bid was unlikely.        
	Two-phase strategy        
	Tata Steels association with Riversdale goes back to August 2007, eight months after it bought European steel maker Corus Group Plc for $12 billion. Soon after the Corus buy, it realised the need to acquire captive raw material sources such as iron ore and coking coal.        
	Tata Steels India operations get all their iron ore and 80 per cent of their coking coal from captive sources, ensuring a good profit. However, Corus has no such raw material linkages, making it vulnerable to fluctuating raw material prices.        
	The Tatas bought a 35 per cent stake in two tenements (Benga and Tete) in Mozambique for Aus$100 million from Riversdale. It also secured a right to take at least 40 per cent of the coking coal produced from the tenements to Corus.        
	The investment made by Tata Steel turned out to be very successful. The projected coal resource is estimated to be 4 billion tonnes, significantly higher than the 1.2 billion tonnes when Tata invested in Tete and Benga.        
	The Tatas bought 7.29 per cent of ASX-listed Riversdale in August 2008, a year after buying into one of the projects. The Australian company has other projects in Mozambique such as Zambeze.        
	Through its wholly owned subsidiary Tata Steel Global Minerals Holdings Pte, the Indian company scooped up a further 17 per cent in several tranches till August.        
	The Tatas also subscribed to a rights offer made by Riversdale in August for Aus$71 million to maintain its shareholding.        
	Even if Tata Steel decides to sell its direct holding in the parent company, it still gets the ore from Mozambique for Corus, starting next year.        
	In the past, Tata Tea, now called Tata Global Beverages, had bought a stake in Glacau, the US-based vitamin water company, only to sell it to Coca-Cola within a year, making a profit of $523 million.

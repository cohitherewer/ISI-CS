The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Go-ahead for SAIL share sale 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Go-ahead for SAIL share sale 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 8: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) today approved a plan to divest 20 per cent stake in state-run Steel Authority of India in two phases to raise around Rs 16,000 crore.        
	The government will sell 10 per cent of its holding, while the company will issue additional shares worth 10 per cent of the expanded equity base, in two phases. The issue will bring down the governments holding in the company to around 69 per cent from 85.82 per cent, home minister P. Chidambaram told reporters after the cabinet meeting.         
	Both the phases of the divestment will be similarly structured, with the government and SAIL selling 5 per cent each in every stage.         
	At current prices, both SAIL and the government are likely to mop up Rs 8,000 crore each, Chidambaram said.        
	The SAIL stock, however, reacted negatively to the news. The share closed at Rs 236.75 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, a sharp loss of over 7 per cent. The government didnt give any timeline for the issue. A panel headed by the finance minister will take a decision on the time of the float.         
	The proceeds from the share sale will be divided equally between the government and the company.         
	SAIL will use the money to part-finance its Rs 70,000-crore expansion plan that will raise its annual hot metal capacity to 23.5 million tonnes by 2012 from 13.8 million tonnes. The PSU and its local peers are ramping up capacity by building new plants and expanding existing ones as the demand for the alloy is projected to grow 10 per cent annually over the next decade.         
	The countrys largest steelmaker is among the several state-run companies in which the government plans to sell small portions of its stake to fund social and infrastructure projects.         
	Besides SAIL, Coal India, Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam and Engineers India Limited are on the government radar.         
	In the budget for 2010-11, the government has set a target of raising Rs 40,000 crore from divestment in state-run companies to keep the fiscal deficit within 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product.        
	The government was not able to meet its divestment target of Rs 25,000 crore for 2009-10 because of lukewarm responses to the selloffs in NHPC, Oil India, Rural Electrification Corporation, NTPC and NMDC.

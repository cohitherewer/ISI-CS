          SOUNAK MITRA                                        Close watch      
	Calcutta, July 25: Security services provider Topsgrup is looking for acquisitions worth up to Rs 1,000 crore in India and the US to be partially funded by an initial public offering (IPO).        
	The company has firmed up plans for the IPO to raise around Rs 300 crore in 2011-12.         
	The money raised through the IPO will be used to part fund the possible acquisitions, predominantly in India and the US. The additional money required for the buyouts will come from internal accruals, Ramesh Iyer, managing director of Topsgrup India, told The Telegraph.         
	The company will submit the draft red herring prospectus to Sebi within the next three months. It is yet to appoint any merchant banker for the proposed IPO. However, it has engaged two audit firms as advisers to look for the buyouts, Iyer said.        
	We are in talks with a few big companies in the US. However, it is too early to say anything beyond, since the acquisition is likely to be completed in 2011-12, Iyer said, adding that Topsgrup would pick up a majority stake in such a firm. At present, the company has 90,000 employees in India and the UK.        
	Previous buys        
	In 2008, Topsgrup acquired a 51 per cent stake in a UK security service provider  The Shield Guarding Company  for about Rs 125 crore. In the same year, it had bought Bangalore-based Guardwell Detective Services Pvt Ltd for an undisclosed amount. Topsgrup had also acquired a 14.69 per cent stake in Chennai-based security systems integrator firm Adtech Systems.        
	TopsSecurity Limited, the flagship company of Topsgrup, is the first security firm in India to get private equity funding in 2007. ICICI Venture invested Rs 115 crore for a 13.69 per cent equity stake, while Indivision (the investment arm of Future Group) increased its stake in the company to 7.08 per cent from 4.94 per cent with an additional investment of Rs 25 crore. Stock investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala owns a 10.8 per cent stake and is a director on the board.         
	Group4Securitas is the No. 1 player in the domestic security market, estimated at around Rs 5,000 crore. Topsgrup holds the second spot with around 24 per cent share of the Rs 2,000-crore organised segment.

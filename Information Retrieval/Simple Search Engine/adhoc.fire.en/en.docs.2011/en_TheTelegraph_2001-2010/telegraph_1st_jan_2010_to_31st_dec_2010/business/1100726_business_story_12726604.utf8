          JAYATI GHOSE                          Exciting option                                   
	New Delhi, July 25: Telecom operators are betting on Wi-Fi technology as a cheaper alternative to 3G for accessing the Internet through mobile phones.        
	Operators expect a huge demand for 3G, which allow transfer of data at very fast speeds, and fear their networks will get clogged. In such a scenario, customers wanting to use the Net can switch to other high-speed options such as Wi-Fi, which will free 3G networks.        
	Wi-Fi allows Internet connectivity within a specified area called hotspots from where one can log on to websites without using cables.         
	Any 3G-enabled mobile device is Wi-Fi-compatible, allowing seamless movement between the two technologies.        
	Wi-Fi is a reasonably inexpensive way of retaining high revenue earning data customers. The surplus 3G capacity can then be utilised by telecom service providers to offer better voice services, Sanjeev Sarin, CEO and founder of -Zone Networks, a wireless mobility solutions provider, told The Telegraph.        
	He said customers preferred Wi-Fi to 3G in enclosed spaces such as office buildings and coffee shops.        
	Wi-Fi networks are 40 times cheaper to build and operate than 3G networks. For customers, too, Wi-Fi is a low-cost option for data downloads, with a monthly subscription costing roughly half of 3G.        
	3G services are bound to be expensive with telecom firms stumping up huge amounts to buy spectrum and roll out networks. Bharti Airtel promoter Sunil Mittal has said 3G services will not be cheap, especially in metros.        
	However, the sector is facing falling voice revenues and going forward, the strategy to increase average revenue per user will lie in data services. Under these circumstances, it would be imperative to rely on Wi-Fi in certain areas to provide uninterrupted data connectivity, Sarin said.         
	Bharti Airtel has tied up with -Zone to provide Wi-Fi Internet connectivity through its 1,000-plus hotspots.        
	Aircel and Idea are also in talks with us for exclusive contracts to provide Wi-Fi services, he said.         
	-Zone targets to roll out 1,000 additional hotspots in the country by year-end, which will include all major airports, hotels, coffee shops and shopping malls.         
	The $450-million Wi-Fi market in the country is expected to touch $1 billion by 2012, according to the Wi-Fi Alliance.

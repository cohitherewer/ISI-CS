          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 30: The government is exploring the possibility of bringing the new chairman of state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) from the private sector with a salary of up to Rs 10 crore per annum.         
	The move is in accordance with the Sam Pitroda panels recommendations.        
	The current chairman and managing director of BSNL, Kuldeep Goyal, will retire by the end of July. According to industry sources, he earns around Rs 24 lakh per year.         
	The Sam Pitroda panel, set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to improve the financial health of the PSU, had recommended the appointment of professionals from the private sector, and pay them market-linked salaries.        
	Two other director positions in BSNL  enterprise and finance  which have been vacant for a few months may also attract candidates from the private sector.        
	The government is working on certain policy changes, including eligibility criteria, that will enable it to hire from the private sector and pay salaries accordingly.         
	It is also in the process of setting up a separate committee, according to directions from the Prime Ministers Office, to handle the entire process of headhunting.         
	At present, the process of appointing executives at senior levels is governed by Public Enterprises Selection Board guidelines.        
	The Pitroda panel had also suggested the separation of the post of the managing director and the chief executive officer from that of the chairman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tech park sop leaves gaping hole in books
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tech park sop leaves gaping hole in books
          SOUNAK MITRA                                            
	Calcutta, March 1: Revenues foregone from tax concessions to the software technology parks are estimated at Rs 14,736 crore in 2009-10 against Rs 12,399 crore in 2008-09.        
	Confronted by a staggering fiscal deficit of Rs 400,000 crore in this fiscal, the government is set to discontinue the Software Technology Parks of India scheme from 2011-12.        
	Software parks make up for the bulk of the revenue losses from sops on export profits of companies located in tax-free zones. The total loss is estimated at Rs 26,976 crore in this fiscal, 18.5 per cent higher than Rs 22,759 crore in 2008-09.        
	Tax-free zones are the special economic zones, software and electronic hardware technology parks of India, export processing and free-trade zones as well as export-oriented units.        
	These special zones account for one-third of the total revenue foregone by the Centre (Rs 84,297 crore in 2009-10 and Rs 71,255 crore in 2008-09) for providing concessions on the profits of corporate and non-corporate taxpayers.         
	Information technology firms are disappointed that the software park scheme was not extended in this years budget. The tax increase after the expiry of the STPI relief will put pressure on their cash flow. No extension in STPI benefits after March 31, 2011, will mean that companies may have to pay full tax from 2011-12, Infosys CEO S. Gopalakrishnan told The Telegraph.         
	According to industry analysts, most of the units in these zones will now try to shift to SEZs for which the tax holiday extends beyond March 2011.        
	Waivers for EoUs led to a revenue loss of Rs 8,437 crore in 2009-10, a rise of 18.3 per cent over Rs 7,130 crore in 2008-09. Small and medium software companies will suffer the most from the withdrawal of tax holidays as most of them cannot afford to shift to SEZs.         
	Countries such as China are offering huge tax sops to attract investments in the IT space. Large companies will be able to mitigate the tax pressures arising from the expiry of tax holiday by moving to SEZs, Lakshmi Narayanan, vice-chairman of Cognizant, said.

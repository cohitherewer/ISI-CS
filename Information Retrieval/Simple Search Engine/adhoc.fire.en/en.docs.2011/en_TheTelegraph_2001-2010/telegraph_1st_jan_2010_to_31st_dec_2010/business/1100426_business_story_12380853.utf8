          A STAFF REPORTER                          Nepal connection                                  
	Calcutta, April 25: The Tea Board of India wants to completely stop import from Nepal so that buyers get genuine Darjeeling tea.         
	The apex body of the industry, in consultation with the Darjeeling Tea Association, has decided to appoint a private agency to take stock of the situation.         
	Tea Board statistics reveal the annual production of the Darjeeling varieties is about 10 million kg, but the sales figure is much more.         
	According to industry insiders, a few Nepalese varieties, which can pass for the coarser grades of Darjeeling tea, are mixed with Darjeeling tea and sold in the domestic market.         
	Smuggled Illam (Nepal tea), both orthodox and CTC, enters North Bengal through the porous border on mules.         
	We will appoint an agency soon. Though imports from Nepal have almost been stopped, there could be a few cases where tea from the neighbouring country is entering India. We will take stock of the situation and take a few measures accordingly to completely stop imports from Nepal, the Tea Board spokesperson said.         
	The insiders feel import from Nepal is directly linked with the price of Darjeeling tea.         
	There has been an increase of Rs 40-50 per kg of the Darjeeling crop in the domestic market in the last couple of months. As a result, small retailers have turned to Nepalese and the Himalayan crop to cater to the mass market.         
	Sources said the Nepal crop cost half of the Darjeeling variety and was a favourite with retailers as it helped them to sell at a much lower price.

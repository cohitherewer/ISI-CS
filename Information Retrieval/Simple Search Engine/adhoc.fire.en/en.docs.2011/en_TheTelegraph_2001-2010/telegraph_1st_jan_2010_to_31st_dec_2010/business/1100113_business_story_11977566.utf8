The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dunlop scrip back with a bang 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Dunlop scrip back with a bang 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 12: Tyre maker Dunlop came roaring out of the cold as the scrip vaulted to Rs 50 per share on the Bombay Stock Exchange today after an almost eight-year suspension.        
	The stock had last traded on April 15, 2002 when it closed at Rs 6.60. The Dunlop scrip today opened at Rs 50 and stayed at that level throughout the trading session.         
	There were only buyers at the counter and no seller. Only 5,400 shares were traded, though at one point of time there were bids for close to 10 lakh shares.        
	There are nearly 35,000 small shareholders who hold around 14 per cent of the companys equity.         
	Many of them had never expected the Dunlop scrip to resume trading.         
	A company official said the share department remained busy throughout the day as investors sought clarifications on how to dematerialise the shares  a prerequisite for trading.        
	It is a big show. I never expected such a response. It is a great new beginning for Dunlop, Pawan K. Ruia, chairman of the company, told The Telegraph.        
	The resumption of trade comes at a time the company is trying to consolidate its facilities at Ambattur in Chennai and Sahagunj in Bengal.        
	Ruia bought the ailing tyre maker from the Jumbo group of the Chhabria family in late 2005 and cleaned up the balance sheet. However, the new management is yet to consolidate operations.        
	The company posted a turnover of Rs 58.43 crore and a profit of Rs 20 lakh in the third quarter of the current fiscal. The revenues came from trading operations and third-party contract manufacturing.        
	Ruia said the fourth quarter would be similar to the previous one but the company should register a topline of Rs 450-500 crore in the next fiscal and a modest profit.        
	The facilities, which are now operating at a capacity of 30 tonnes a day, need to step up production to make the company sustainable.        
	Ruia, who also owns Falcon Tyres, said he expected margins to be under pressure in the fourth quarter because the price of rubber had gone up to Rs 142 per kg from Rs 80 in the third quarter.

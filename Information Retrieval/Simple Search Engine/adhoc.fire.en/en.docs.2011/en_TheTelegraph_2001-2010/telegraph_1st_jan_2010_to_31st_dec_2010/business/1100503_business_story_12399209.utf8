                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Ward change
                                I was employed in Jamshedpur. I had been filing my tax returns there. After retirement, I came back to Calcutta. I am a senior citizen and have a PAN card. At present, my annual income from interest is more than the basic exemption limit. How can I change my income tax ward to Calcutta?          Balai Chandra Banerjee, Calcutta
                    You can change your income tax ward for filing returns from Jamshedpur to Calcutta. Find out by searching the site www.incometaxindia.gov.in which will be your IT jurisdiction now. Go to jurisdiction of officers tag under the about us section. Once you identify the income tax ward/circle, contact the assessment officer there.                                  Wrong form      I had invested Rs 6 lakh in a post office monthly saving scheme. One such account amounting to Rs 43,000 came up for maturity and I invested the sum in a bank FD. However, I was late in submitting Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source. The bank deducted Rs 1,426 from my interest income. In June last year I had filed income tax return in ITR4. I have not yet got refund of Rs 1,426. How can I get it back?        Amol Kumar Basak, Bankura
                    You have chosen the wrong return form. ITR4 is for individuals having income from business or profession. You should have submitted ITR2. You can contact your income tax assessment officer and rectify the mistake. The tax department takes some time for refund. You will have to wait.                                  Get a PAN      I am a housewife. I have interest income from post office monthly income scheme, Senior Citizen Savings Scheme and bank FDs. The total annual interest income is less than Rs 1,80,000. Do I need to submit returns?        Sheila Kundu, South 24-Parganas
                    The basic exemption limit for women has been increased to Rs 1,90,000 for 2009-10. Since your annual income is below the threshold limit, you dont have to pay tax or file return. However, for non-deduction of tax at source on interest income, you have to submit Form 15H and your PAN. Without PAN, the TDS will be 20 per cent. Get a PAN and submit it to the post office and the bank.

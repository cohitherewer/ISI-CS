The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mad rush to dump stocks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mad rush to dump stocks
                                                
	Mumbai, Jan 21: The sensex plunged over 400 points today as investors pounded stocks following a string of companies reporting weak third quarter earnings and fears of runaway inflation.        
	The slump deepened amid growing concerns that China  the worlds fastest growing economy  had decided to slam the brakes on further lending by large banks in January to prevent its economy from overheating.        
	China reported that its economy had surged 10.7 per cent in the fourth quarter  the fastest its grown since 2007  sparking talk that its central bank would start raising its benchmark interest rate and tighten restrictions on lenders.        
	The 30-scrip bellwether index of the Bombay Stock Exchange tumbled 423.35 points, or 2.42 per cent, to 17,051.14.         
	The gloom deepened after the World Bank came out with a report that said the global economy was likely to grow at a modest 2.7 per cent in 2010. The bank added that the economic recovery continued to be fragile.        
	The China factor had its impact on most of the markets in Asia with Hong Kongs Hang Seng index ending lower by 2 per cent. Though some of the indices like Japans Nikkei bucked the trend, the domestic bourses felt the China heat as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) stayed away.        
	There have been fresh concerns relating to the Chinese economy over-heating and that this can lead to a potential asset-price bubble even as the threat of higher inflation lurks in that country.         
	Just last week, the Peoples Bank of China raised the proportion of reserves that banks must set aside. Recently, there have been reports China has asked some of its banks to sharply reduce lending for the rest of the month.        
	With inflation inching up in India and liquidity remaining high, the worry is that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may also start raising key rates, beginning with the cash reserve ratio (CRR).         
	CRR is that portion of deposits which must be maintained with the central bank. Concerns in this regard were further validated today when data showed food inflation to be at higher levels at 16.81 per cent, though it softened from 17.28 per cent for the week ended January 2.         
	Investor sentiment was clouded by concerns over India Incs third quarter performance after heavyweights like Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) and BHEL posted profit numbers that were way below expectations.        
	The steady downslide during the day was witnessed in the movement of the benchmark index which opened steady at 17474.49 and remained under pressure throughout the trading session. It touched an intra-day low of 17,025.26.        
	The National Stock Exchange 50-issue Nifty also tumbled by 127.55 points or 2.44 per cent breaking two key levels of 5,200 and 5,100 points to a hit low of 5094.15.        
	All the sectoral indices at the BSE ended in the red reflecting across-the board selling. The BSE Capital Goods index was the worst hit and chalked up a loss of 5.15 per cent as the poor performance of L amp;T impacted its peers like BHEL which fell 4.12 per cent at Rs 2297.40 and Siemens which sank almost 6 per cent to Rs 629.25.         
	L amp;T itself plunged 6.85 per cent after the results.        
	An analyst from a local brokerage said that the markets would remain under pressure over the immediate term due to worries over a possible monetary policy tightening.        
	The RBIs monetary policy on January 29 will certainly be watched out for. But the market is hoping that Reliance Industries will come out with strong results tomorrow, he added.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Castrol makes 1:1 bonus issue
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Feb. 18: The board of directors of Castrol India at its meeting held today has announced a bonus issue to all shareholders in the ratio of 1:1. The company also recommended a final dividend of Rs 5 per share and a special dividend of Rs 10 per share for the year ended December 31, 2009.         
	Castrol said the total dividend would go up to Rs 25 per share as it had earlier declared an interim dividend of Rs 10 per share. The company had declared a final dividend of Rs 9 per share last year.         
	However, the Castrol scrip today ended nearly 8 per cent lower as investors booked profits after the announcement. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, it ended at Rs 654, a drop of Rs 57.50 from its last close. The counter has been attracting buyers since the company announced its bonus plans.         
	The company also announced its fourth quarter results for the period ended December 31. Net profit rose nearly 72 per cent to Rs 80.8 crore from Rs 47 crore in the same period last year. Net sales rose nearly 14 per cent to Rs 609.5 crore from Rs 535.9 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	Castrol said volume growth was likely to continue this year because of a demand revival. However, the company sounded a note of caution when it said a rise in input costs could impact margins.         
	This performance has been achieved because of the rigorous execution of our long-term strategy and is underpinned by our focus on defending margins, attacking cost inefficiencies and reducing working capital, Naveen Kshatriya, vice-chairman of Castrol India, said. There has been a specific focus on creating sustainable competitive advantage through a robust cost strategy and a significant number of cost-saving projects. All this has helped deliver strong bottom line and cash flow, he said.

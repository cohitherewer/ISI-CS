          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ruia: Ambitious plans                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 1: Falcon Tyres has decided to raise up to Rs 4,000 crore in equity and debt to finance its ambitious expansion plans.        
	The Falcon board has cleared an increase in borrowing limit to Rs 3,000 crore and an equity issue of Rs 1,000 crore. Chairman Pawan K. Ruia said the equity would be raised in phases and begin with a rights issue.        
	The money will be spent on financing the ongoing expansion of the Mysore plant and the construction of a new unit in Uttarakhand for two- and three-wheeler tyres, entailing an investment of Rs 750 crore.        
	The company is contemplating another bigger unit in the south that will even make four-wheeler tyres.        
	Falcon makes two- and three-wheeler tyres that are sold under the Dunlop brand. Ruia owns both Falcon and Dunlop in India.        
	Dunlop, with its two plants at Ambattur near Chennai and Sahagunj near Calcutta, now makes four-wheeler and off-the-road tyres. It does not make two-wheeler tyres.        
	If Ruias plan materialises, Falcon will make all that Dunlop possibly can, but outside the premises of the two factories he acquired.        
	We are actively looking for a new unit that will make everything, including small tyres that go into cars such as the Nano. It may be in south India and entail an investment of Rs 2,000 crore, Ruia told The Telegraph.        
	The new unit may help Ruia reduce the dependence on Sahagunj and Ambattur.        
	Dunlop has not been able to scale up operations after Ruia acquired it four years back. However, he said the two plants had stabilised now.        
	Falcon stocks closed up 9.24 per cent on the BSE at Rs 166.

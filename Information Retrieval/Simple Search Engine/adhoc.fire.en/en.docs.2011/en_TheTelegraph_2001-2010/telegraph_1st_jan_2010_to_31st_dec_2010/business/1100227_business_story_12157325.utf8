The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Duty hike to push up car price
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Duty hike to push up car price
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Pricey proposition                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: Car makers are set to hike prices after the excise duty on large cars and multi-utility vehicles was raised by two percentage points to 22 per cent.         
	However, the industrys demand for the withdrawal of specific excise duty of Rs 15,000 on passenger cars, other than small cars, has not been met.        
	But an industry maven said the move was not a game-changer and would not crimp rising demand in Asias third-largest automobile market.        
	The rollback was very much along the expected lines, said R. Seshasayee, managing director of Ashok Leyland.        
	While Maruti Suzuki India  the countrys largest car maker  said prices of its cars would rise 2 per cent, Hyundai Motor India said the hike would be in the range of Rs 6,500-25,000 on an average.        
	Car prices will go up about 2 per cent. This is essential to offset the increase in central excise duty announced by the finance minister today, said R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki.         
	Prices across all our models will go up by Rs 3,000-13,000, the company spokesperson said.         
	Homegrown Tata Motors will raise prices of its passenger cars by 2 per cent.        
	Honda Siel Cars India and Toyota Kirloskar Motors and two-wheeler makers Hero Honda Motors and Bajaj Auto said they were also considering price revisions.        
	Karl Slym, president of General Motors India, said the industry would be forced to pass on the extra duty to consumers.        
	We are disappointed with the increase in duty. The 2 per cent increase in duty will have to be passed on to the consumers, he said.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today increased the central excise duty by 2-10 per cent, partially rolling back the cut made earlier.        
	However, small cars will continue to get excise duty relief of 4 per cent, which was offered on all car segments as a part of the stimulus package to the industry in 2008, when sales had dropped following a slowdown in the global economy.         
	The UPA government had spurred the automobile sector by slashing excise duty on two-wheelers from 10 per cent to 8 per cent, small cars from 12 per cent to 8 per cent and big cars from 24 per cent to 20 per cent.         
	India is now seen as a hub for small cars and many global majors have ventured into the country in the last four years.         
	Nearly 1.22 million cars were sold in the country during the April-January period, a 25 per cent growth over the year-ago period.         
	Meanwhile, sales of utility vehicles gained 22 per cent to 219,250 units and a total of 7.61 million two-wheelers were sold in India over the same period, a 24 per cent rise from a year earlier.        
	The excise duty on cars up to four meters in length and with a gasoline engine capacity of 1.2 litres, or a diesel capacity of up to 1.5 litres, will be raised to 10 per cent from 8 per cent.

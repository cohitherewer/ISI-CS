The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Core sector puts up good show in October
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Core sector puts up good show in October
          OUR BUREAU                          Healthy symptom                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: The economy has more reason to cheer  the core sector grew 7 per cent in October against 3.9 per cent in the same month last year.        
	The October data for six core infrastructure industries  crude, petroleum refinery products, coal, electricity, cement and finished steel  reflected a bounce-back from September when growth had plunged to 2.7 per cent against 4.3 per cent in the year-ago period.        
	Core industries, which have a weightage of 26.7 per cent in the index of industrial production (IIP), are expected to have a positive impact on the October IIP numbers, likely to be released next month.        
	The revival in the core sector comes on top of an 8.9 per cent growth in the countrys gross domestic product for the first half of the current fiscal.        
	Expansion of the economy, helped by impressive performance by industries, including those in infrastructure, is expected to help the investment climate, HSBC Group country head Naina Lal Kidwai said.        
	We will see more investments by industry next year because in lots of companies capacity utilisation is over 90 per cent, she said.        
	However, amid the overall good performance in infrastructure activity, coal and petroleum refinery output remained areas of concern. While growth in refinery products fell to 4.8 per cent, coal could barely grow 0.8 per cent in October.        
	Cement with 16.8 per cent and crude with 13.7 per cent growth emerged as the top performers. The April-October cumulative performance remained unchanged at 4.5 per cent from the previous year.        
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist with credit rating agency Crisil, said the slowdown in coal output was a cause for concern as it would have an impact on electricity generation.         
	He said the six infrastructure industries were likely to register a 6-7 per cent growth in the coming months.

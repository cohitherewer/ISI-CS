	New Delhi, March 7: The Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India (FHRAI) has asked the finance and tourism ministries to revisit the demands of the hospitality industry that felt neglected by the Union budget.        
	We were expecting much more than what has been granted. The main demand of the industry was the grant of infrastructure status. We have been demanding this year after year, Rajinder Kumar, the president of the FHRAI, told The Telegraph.         
	We have written to both the ministries to once again look into the needs of our industry. Lets see what happens, we are waiting to hear from them, he said.        
	The budget failed to restore the depreciation rate to 20 per cent as demanded by the sector. The depreciation rate was 20 per cent till March 2007 and was later lowered to 10 per cent.        
	Hotels have been seeking an inclusion in the list of infrastructure projects under Section 80 of the Income Tax Act. This would have given them deductions on profits and gains for 10 years.         
	If hotels are granted the infrastructure status, it will be an incentive for the huge investment of about Rs 50,000 crore that the industry needs to build 1,50,000 rooms required at present, said Kumar.        
	Hoteliers feel the new status will encourage companies to reinvest their profits and pave the way for more rooms. This will help to lower tariffs and make India a more affordable destination such as Malaysia and Indonesia.        
	The governments policies and tax structures must be attractive enough to encourage investments in the hotel sector, said Vivek Nair, secretary of the FHRAI and managing director of Hotel Leela Venture.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rejig mode                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 30: The Nairs of Hotel Leelaventure Ltd are raising the promoters stake in the company to almost 55 per cent through a preferential allotment of 1 crore shares at a cost of Rs 48.5 crore.        
	Observers say the stake increase has been prompted by fears of a hostile takeover bid by cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate ITC Ltd, which has built up a 10.74 per cent holding in Hotel Leelaventure.        
	The promoters have decided to allot 1 crore shares to Leela Lace Software Solutions Pvt Ltd, a promoter group company, at a price of Rs 48.50 per share.        
	During the quarter ended June 30, the promoters of Hotel Leelaventure held a 53.37 per cent stake in the company. They had raised the stake from 52.67 per cent last December through open market purchases.        
	ITC holds an 8.48 per cent stake in Hotel Leelaventure, while group company Russel Credit has 2.26 per cent.        
	Last year, ITC had raised its holding in the hotel chain from a little over 4 per cent.         
	The Nairs have decided to raise their stake now to offset the change in the shareholding structure next year when Hotel Leelaventure converts foreign currency convertible bonds into equity shares. The bond conversion would have brought the promoters stake below 50 per cent if it hadnt made a preferential share allotment.        
	Last month, the board of Hotel Leelaventure had approved plans to issue 1 crore preferential shares. A board-sponsored resolution was passed by shareholders earlier this month.        
	In a communication issued to the stock exchanges today, Hotel Leelaventure said the preferential allotment would raise its share capital to Rs 77.56 crore from Rs 75.56 crore.        
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange today, the Hotel Leelaventure share rose nearly 3 per cent to Rs 51.70.

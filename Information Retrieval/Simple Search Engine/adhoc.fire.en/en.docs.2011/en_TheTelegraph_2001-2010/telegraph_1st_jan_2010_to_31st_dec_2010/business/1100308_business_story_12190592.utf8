          SOUNAK MITRA                                            
	Calcutta, March 7: Vijay Mallya-led United Spirits Ltd (USL) is eyeing at least a 15 per cent share in the Indian energy drink market within a year.        
	Though its too early to comment on the consumer response, we are seeing a very good demand in the market for our non-alcoholic energy drinks. We are optimistic about the drinks appeal to consumers given the growing demand, both from non-alcohol users and those wanting to mix it with beverage alcohols such as vodka, Debashish Shyam, business head of USL, told The Telegraph.         
	USL recently forayed into the segment with Romanov Red energy drink.         
	The market for energy drinks is around 1.5-2 million cases per annum and has been growing more than 60 per cent over the last two years.         
	We hope that the market will double in the next one year, Shyam said.        
	The domestic market is dominated by Red Bull and Cloud 9. Multinationals such as PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have also joined the fray with Sorbet and Burn, respectively.         
	According to USL, Romanov Red is a natural product made of a Brazilian herb Guarana and is priced at Rs 75 a can (250 ml).         
	The company plans to use its distribution channels and increase tie-ups with modern retailers to sell the product. The product is available in six metros.         
	Before, the Indian Premier League starts, we intend to launch the product in all the towns where the matches will be played, Shyam said.         
	The company will expand to smaller towns, gradually.        
	The company has launched the energy drink as a sub-brand of Romanov, a popular vodka brand.         
	USL leads the vodka market in India with a combined share (Romanov and White Mischief) of 89 per cent.         
	More than 1 million cases of Romanov are sold every year.         
	Romanov Red sold more than 1,00,000 cases in the first year of its launch.         
	The company plans to promote Romanov Red through consumer engagement events.

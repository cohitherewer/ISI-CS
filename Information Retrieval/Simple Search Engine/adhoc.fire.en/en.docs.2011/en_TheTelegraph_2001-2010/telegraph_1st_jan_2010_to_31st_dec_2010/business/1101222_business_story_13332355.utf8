The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL weighs plant in Africa
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SAIL weighs plant in Africa

	New Delhi, Dec. 21: State-run steel maker SAIL will explore the feasibility of a joint venture plant in South Africa.        
	Senior government sources said the steel ministry had asked SAIL to look into the possibility of such a facility, following the visit of a high-level ministry delegation to South Africa.        
	While the purpose of the visit was to obtain coal and iron ore from the mineral-rich country, the proposal for the joint venture plant along with assured coal and iron ore supplies cropped up during the discussions.         
	SAIL has been hunting for high-grade coking coal mines abroad for almost 10 years without much success. It has seen or conducted due diligence in Australia, Siberia, Canada and Indonesia, but a deal proved elusive as the mines were either too small or expensive.         
	Prices of coking coal, a key ingredient in steel making, rose 74 per cent in the August-September quarter from a year earlier, which has dented SAILs net profit by as much as 34 per cent. SAIL imports about 70 per cent of its coking coal requirement, much of it from Australia.         
	Sources said SAIL could look at setting up a port-based plant with a capacity of up to 5 million tonnes, if South Africa allotted it coking coal and iron ore mines.        
	When contacted, SAIL officials refused to comment.         
	The venture, sources said, could be a joint one with equity from a nominated South African firm. ArcelorMittal and the Tatas are already present in the fast growing South African market.         
	SAIL has only looked at buying raw material assets abroad but never considered a facility, possibly prompted by the fact that its market was mainly within India and there was no necessity to fritter away its resources abroad.         
	The PSU exports a small percentage  about 3-4 per cent  of its production, but it works out to around Rs 3,000 crore in revenues.         
	If SAIL sets up a plant in South Africa, finished steel can be easily shipped to India as well as to key markets in Europe and West Asia.        
	SAIL is currently going ahead with its plans to set up joint venture specialised steel plants in India in collaborations with Japans Kobe Steel and Nippon Steel, and Koreas Posco.

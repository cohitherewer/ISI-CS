          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 21: The government plans to offer around 50 oil and gas blocks in the ninth round of bidding under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy (Nelp) in the last quarter of this year.         
	However, clarity on the seven-year tax holiday could be crucial for the success of the round. About 50 blocks will be on offer, including those which did not attract any bid during the last round, a senior petroleum ministry official said.        
	Of the 70 blocks offered under Nelp-VIII, only 36 attracted bids. The government finally awarded 33 blocks, half of which went to state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.        
	Officials are, however, optimistic about investor response this time. The improvement in the global economic situation and investor sentiments are likely to evoke a good response.         
	Crude prices in the range of $70-80 per barrel should encourage firms to invest in the new blocks, they said. Analysts said the government should extend the tax holiday to both oil and gas as the risks on investment were huge.        
	In the budget, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had announced a seven-year income tax holiday for the production and sale of natural gas from the blocks awarded under Nelp-VIII.        
	The finance ministry officials, however, have ruled out the extension of the benefit to other rounds of bidding. According to them, companies, which strike gas make profits after recouping the entire cost and should not be reluctant to pay tax.         
	Tax need not be paid if there is no profit. Industries exploiting scarce natural resources do not enjoy tax incentives in most countries.

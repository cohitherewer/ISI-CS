The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Monsoon holds fuel price clue
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Monsoon holds fuel price clue
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Close watch                                  
	New Delhi, June 16: The progress of the monsoon will be keenly watched by the empowered group of ministers (eGoM) if they meet next week to consider the free market pricing of petrol and diesel.        
	If the monsoon is normal, as expected, it will bolster farm output and give a respite from high food price inflation. Food inflation is around 17 per cent, while the wholesale price index-based inflation for May is 10.16 per cent.        
	The government can leverage the rains to explore ways of decontrolling petrol and diesel prices. Any rise in fuel prices can be neutralised by diminishing food inflation, keeping overall inflation under check, while thwarting any political opposition to costlier fuels.        
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, however, has a word of caution. It is quite possible when data comes out tomorrow, you may see a little increase in food inflation. That is not the reason to worry. As you see the weeks go by, food inflation will come down again.        
	Officials said the eGoM could wait for a few more days, if that would help to better assess the monsoon.         
	However, the government finds the global crude oil prices at this juncture just right to allow the free market pricing of petrol and diesel.        
	I was trying for the eGoM meeting on Thursday (June 17) after the usual meeting of the cabinet. But the meeting could not be fixed for tomorrow because of prior commitments (on the part of certain ministers in the group). We are trying for a meeting next week, oil minister Murli Deora said.        
	Faced with an opposition from Congresss allies  the Trinamul Congress, NCP and DMK, officials said, the Centre could allow conditional free market pricing of petrol, the rich mans fuel, and opt for a hike in the price of diesel, which is the fuel for transportation.         
	The state-owned oil firms are currently selling petrol and diesel at a loss of Rs 3.73 a litre and Rs 3.80 per litre, respectively. The loss on kerosene is Rs 18.82 per litre and domestic LPG, Rs 261.90 per cylinder.        
	Chief economic adviser to the government Kaushik Basu said, I feel a certain amount of decontrol ought to be done. If you do that, inflation may increase in the short term, but six months down the line, inflation will come down.

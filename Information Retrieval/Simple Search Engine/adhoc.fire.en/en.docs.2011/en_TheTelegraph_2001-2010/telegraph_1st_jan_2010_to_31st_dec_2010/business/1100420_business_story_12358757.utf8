          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, April 19: Bankers and the markets are bracing for a sharp increase in key policy rates after Reserve Bank of India governor Duvvuri Subbarao and his advisers complete their review of the monetary policy tomorrow.         
	The bankers feared the worst after the RBI today said inflation-busting was its top priority as prices had started rising across a wide range of products unlike sometime ago when the phenomenon was more or less confined to food products.         
	It blamed the generalised inflation on a variety of factors: a slow pick-up in demand growth in some areas, the continued play of supply factors, revival in import growth, turnaround in corporate sales, rise in fuel prices, and the reversal in excise and customs duties on a wide range of products.         
	Banking and bond market circles averred that RBIs comments on inflation in the report was hawkish and they felt that a hike in reverse repo, repo rate and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) might well be on the cards.         
	In its Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments in 2009-10 released today, the RBI said since the second half of 2009-10, all major groups contributed to the inflationary pressure compared with primarily food inflation in the first half. This trend showed that inflation was getting generalised.         
	The supply constraints on account of the shortfall in agricultural production and increasing international crude prices were the major drivers of inflation in India till November last year. The emergence of inflationary pressures, thus, was led by increases in prices of a few commodities and inflation remained concentrated in a few commodities, the bank noted.         
	Since then, the inflation has become increasingly generalised as more number of commodities have started to exhibit significant pick-up in inflation, it added.        
	The RBI said there were several upside risks as well. While international commodity prices, particularly that of crude oil are rising again, in several commodities, the import option for India to contain domestic inflation is limited due to high international prices.         
	The revival in private consumption demand and the bridging of the output gap will add to inflationary pressure, it noted.        
	The report adds that when the inflation process tends to get generalised, the transmission from pressures in certain items to general inflation takes place with a lag. During this period, containing inflation expectations becomes critical.        
	Given inflation persistence, high generalised inflation, if not contained, could aggravate inflation expectations and impede the ongoing recovery, the central bank said, adding that the already elevated headline inflation suggested that the weight of policy balance might have to shift to containing inflation.        
	The central bank was gung-ho on the economys growth prospects. It said that growth outlook remained positive on account of, among other factors, expectations of satisfactory rabi output and expectations that the industrial sector would remain buoyant. It, however, warned of certain downside risks in this regard.         
	The RBI explained that while the revival in agriculture growth hinged on the assumption of normal monsoon, though investment demand was picking up, it was still much below the rate of growth in the pre-global crisis period.         
	There was also an indication that the central bank might make lending to commercial real estate costlier tomorrow.         
	Shares dip        
	Stock markets plummeted today with the benchmark sensex losing a sizeable 190 points to close at a one month-low amid fears of RBI signalling a rate hike tomorrow. The Goldman issue also played a part. After tanking over 314 points on aggressive selling by funds, the sensex recovered some of the losses to settle at 17400.68 points.

	New Delhi, Feb. 10: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today estimated growth for the current fiscal at 7.75 per cent  higher than the Central Statistical Organisations forecast  and pitched for infrastructure spending to sustain the growth momentum.        
	When the final figures come, particularly for the third quarter, I think there may be an improvement (over the CSOs estimate of 7.2 per cent). Anyway, 7.2 per cent in the current situation is not bad, Mukherjee said.        
	He said, Economic Survey 2008-09 had indicated that the upper band of growth in real GDP for 2009-10 could be around 7.75 per cent. The growth outlook for the whole year is expected to be in the upper range of most predictions.        
	Economists said the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India seemed to be betting on a better-than-expected growth rate in the final two quarters of this fiscal.         
	The stronger growth will give the government the leeway to start rolling back stimulus measures, which were offered when the global economic crisis erupted in 2008.         
	The government could provide a road map for exiting the fiscal stimulus in the budget. The exit should be a gradual transition, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council, said.        
	Mukherjee said, the economic growth vindicates the timely policy measures taken by the government to mitigate the adverse impact of the financial crisis on India and the positive response of all stakeholders and partners in development.        
	He said rising domestic savings and investments and an emphasis on skill upgradation gave him the confidence that growth could be pushed up even higher.        
	However, he said infrastructure had to be upgraded in sustaining growth. It is estimated that infrastructure requires a investments worth $514 billion between 2007 and 2012. He stressed on the removal of policy constraints and regulatory gaps.

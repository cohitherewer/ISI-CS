The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gift for daughter
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Gift for daughter
                                My wife and me are a working couple. How much money can we individually give our 19-year-old daughter as gift without attracting any tax either for us or for our daughter?          Beeneet G. Nair, Parnasree Palli
                    Your daughter is an adult. As parents you can gift any amount to your daughter without attracting any tax liability. To be on the safe side, make a gift deed in a plain paper and get it witnessed by two non-relatives.                                  Tax count      I am 79-years-old. My total income in 2007-08 was Rs 3,29,379.92. I had paid medical insurance of Rs 12,292. My total savings in NSC and PPF were Rs 1,45,000. I paid income tax at the rate of 10 per cent. But the income tax officer has charged tax at the rate of 20 per cent through an assessment order. What will be the tax figure?        K.L. Pal, Calcutta
                    Your taxable income will be Rs 2,17,088 which falls in the 20 per cent tax bracket. So, you were wrong by paying taxes at the rate of 10 per cent. Your taxable income works out at Rs 22,088. You will have to pay tax on this amount at the rate of 20 per cent plus a 3 per cent education cess.                                  Income from property sale      I have received a sum from sale of my sons property. Now, I wish to save capital gain tax and, hence, propose to invest the sum in a government scheme. Where can I invest the sum and how can I show this in my IT return?         R. Mukherjee, Jadavpur
                    If the property is in your sons name, the capital gains tax liability will be his and not yours. If your son gifts the money to you, there will be no tax liability on you. If the property is jointly owned by you and your son, the liability of capital gains tax will be in proportion to your investments in the property. To save capital gains tax, you can buy a house within one year, or construct a house within three years, or invest in specified capital gains tax saving bonds of the National Highway Authority of India and Rural Electrification Corporation. To show this capital gains, you shall have to file your tax return in ITR II.

	Calcutta, March 24: Coal India Ltd, GAIL and Rashtriya Chemicals amp; Fertilizers (RCF) have agreed to form a joint venture to revive the closed unit of Fertilizer Corporation of India at Talcher in Orissa.         
	According to Coal India chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya, an MoU for the joint venture has been signed by the three PSUs. Though the ownership pattern of the joint venture company has not yet been finalised, I believe it will be 33 per cent each for the firms, Bhattacharyya said.        
	The revived unit will produce urea and ammonium nitrate  an explosive material  from coal gas.         
	The Orissa unit will help Coal India to meet 25 to 30 per cent of its annual requirement of ammonium nitrate.         
	Coal India spends about Rs 1,500 crore per annum for buying 3.5 lakh tonnes of the explosive. Coal India will supply 5.5 million tonnes of raw coal to the Orissa project. The raw coal, when washed, will get reduced to 3.7 million tonnes. It will be gassified and urea and ammonium nitrate will be produced from the gas. This is the broad outline of the proposed project, Bhattacharyya said.        
	GAIL will gasify the washed coal, and RCF will produce urea and ammonium nitrate from the coal gas.         
	The technology for the project is being studied. The investment is estimated at a few thousand crores of rupees. It could not be arrived at because a decision has not been taken on the technology that would be used, Bhattacharyya said.        
	Last year, the Union cabinet had decided that five closed units of Fertiliser Corporation of India (FCI) would be revived. Once the revival package for each one of them was decided, global tenders would be invited.         
	Meanwhile, RCF is looking to tap the capital markets again to raise about Rs 10,000 crore. Apart from Talcher, RCF is also eyeing FCIs closed unit at Durgapur in Bengal.         
	FCI had set up the Talcher unit in 1969 at an investment of Rs 71.18 crore to produce urea from coal gas. Technimont of Italy supplied the technology. When the plant was closed down in 1998-99, it had a production capacity of 18 lakh tonnes of urea and 12.5 lakh tonnes of ammonia.

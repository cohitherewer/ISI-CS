                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Audit report bares all on Raja     Minister ignored PM advice
          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	New Delhi, Nov 16: Andimuthu Raja  the disgraced telecom minister who was forced to resign earlier this week  had broken every rule in the book, ignored advice from the Prime Minister and his colleagues, and devised his own set of unfair rules while farming out an unprecedented 122 licences in January 2008.         
	The 77-page audit report on the sordid spectrum saga, which was placed before the Lok Sabha today, revealed 85 of those licences were doled out to firms that werent eligible for them in the first place.        
	Raja also took advantage of a terrible oversight  whether deliberate or plain negligent, one cant say which  to make sure that the spectrum allottees had to pay a price that had been discovered in 2001, causing a presumptive loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer.        
	In 2003, the telecom regulator had set out a road map to create a level-playing field among telecom players that professed to be technology neutral. Under the plan, the existing operators  all GSM mobile service providers were supposed to get their unified access service licences (UASL) without having to pay an entry fee.         
	In the second stage, other players  all basic service operators  would get their UAS licences. These players were supposed to pay an entry fee (since they had never participated in an auction like the GSM players) and would have to pay a separate price for spectrum.         
	Earlier, spectrum used to come bundled with the licence. But this second stage was never implemented in full  allowing Raja to allot the spectrum at 2001 prices.        
	The report indicts Raja for ignoring the advice of Prime Minister, finance and law ministers while allocating 2G spectrum to the new players. All three had advised Raja to use the auction process.         
	However, Raja chose to side-step the suggestion and independently went ahead with the allocation of licences, buttressing his argument for adopting such a course of action by selectively quoting from a cabinet decision taken in 2003 when a BJP-led alliance was in power.         
	The report said the telecom department managed to keep the issue of spectrum pricing outside the purview of the group of ministers (headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee)... the terms of reference (for the GoM) left out the issues of efficient allocation and pricing ... the department of telecom maintained that spectrum pricing was within the normal work carried out by them.         
	Terming the audit institution an important watchdog of democracy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the government was taking measures to ensure quick and timely action on CAG reports.         
	Although the Prime Minister did not specifically name the CAG report on the allotment of 2G telecom licences, his comments at a function for auditors seemed to indicate the governments views on the report.         
	The report said the department of telecom did not follow its own guidelines on eligibility conditions, arbitrarily changed the cutoff date for receipt of applications post facto and altered the conditions of the first come first served procedure at crucial junctures without valid and cogent reasons, which gave unfair advantage to certain companies over others.

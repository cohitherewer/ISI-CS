The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sops to keep revenues intact
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sops to keep revenues intact
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Seeking balance                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The government is not worried about the loss of revenue from the sops indicated in the direct tax code because it expects the losses to be more than offset by greater compliance brought by the code.        
	Any loss on account of concessions granted through lower taxation will be made up through better compliance, finance ministry officials said.        
	Besides, the higher minimum alternate tax should help in increasing revenues. The tax code, cleared by the Cabinet yesterday, will take effect from April. The relevant bill will be presented in Parliament next week.        
	Officials said the new tax code is expected to widen the tax base, end unnecessary exemptions, moderate rates and add to the governments coffers. We are trying to ensure strict compliance and once its done the revenue graph will automatically go up despite the fall in rates.        
	The bill seeks to impose a minimum alternate tax (MAT) of 20 per cent of the book profit compared with 18 per cent now.        
	The government has removed the concept of gross asset tax and has rounded off the MAT rate to 20 per cent to factor in surcharge and cess, Ernst amp; Youngs tax partner Vishal Malhotra said.         
	The DTC proposal also suggests a lowering of corporate tax rate to 30 per cent. At present, companies pay an effective rate of around 34 per cent on account of the surcharge and the cess. Experts said this would provide much needed relief to industry and bring the levy on a par with global standards.

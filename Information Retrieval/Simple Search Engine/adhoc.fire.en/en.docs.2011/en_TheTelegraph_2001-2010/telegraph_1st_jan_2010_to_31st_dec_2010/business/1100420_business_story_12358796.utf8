The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | $4.4bn Citi profit beats estimates

	New York, April 19 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc posted a $4.43 billion first-quarter profit as losses from bad loans declined, beating analyst expectations and turning in its best results since 2007.        
	Citigroup, long seen as the weakest of the major US banks, seems to be recovering now. But in a statement on Monday, CEO Vikram Pandit cautioned that its road to recovery could remain rocky.        
	Realistically, we do not expect our performance to follow an invariable trend-line upward, he said, but added that the banks long-term prospects were bright. Citigroup shares rose 30 cents, or 6.6 per cent, to $4.86 in early trading.        
	Citigroups chief financial officer John Gerspach said a key variable for the banks future profitability was the performance of corporate and investment banking, which could fluctuate over time. Values in the banks Citi Holdings unit, which houses businesses and assets that the bank is looking to shed, are also an important factor.         
	In March, Pandit said the bank was on track to return to sustained profitability and that losses from its bad assets should be manageable if the economy did not tank.        
	The third-largest US bank posted first-quarter net income to shareholders of 15 cents a share compared with a shareholder loss of 18 cents a share, or $966 million, a year earlier.         
	Analysts on average expected the bank to break even. Citigroup raised $20 billion of equity in December 2009 to buy back debt it sold to the US government. That equity-raise was painful  the common shares sold at $3.15 apiece, far below their price before the sale was announced, and below the $3.25 price at which the government bought in.        
	The government, which had planned to sell up to $5 billion of shares, was forced to instead agree to not sell shares for 90 days.        
	Since then, the outlook for Citigroup has improved.         
	In January, it said its loan losses were showing signs of stabilising.        
	It has been a rough ride for Pandit, who took the reins at Citigroup in December 2007 as the bank was taking big writedowns linked to subprime mortgages.         
	Citigroup has suffered more than $100 billion of credit losses and writedowns since the financial crisis began.

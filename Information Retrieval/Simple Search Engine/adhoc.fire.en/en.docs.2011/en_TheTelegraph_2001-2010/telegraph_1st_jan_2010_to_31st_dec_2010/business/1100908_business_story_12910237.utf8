The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to end menace of crony directors
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bid to end menace of crony directors
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: Rogue industrialists such as B. Ramalinga Raju may no longer be able to pack their boards with hand-picked independent directors who merely rubber stamp board resolutions.         
	The parliamentary standing committee on finance has recommended that company managements right to appoint independent directors of their choice should be curtailed in the new Companies Bill 2009, which is now before Parliament.        
	The panel, headed by senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, has suggested that the ministry of corporate affairs ought to maintain a registry of independent directors whose credentials are scrupulously checked to weed out undesirable elements. Company management will be able to dip into this registry to pick the ones most suited for the job.        
	The revised companies bill is expected to be tabled in Parliament in the winter session, or latest by the budget session, according to corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed.        
	Industry disagrees        
	Industry chiefs are, however, not too keen on being forced to select independent directors from a panel selected by a government body.        
	If some selection criteria for independent directors is set for companies, it is acceptable. However, the selection should not be made mandatory from a specific list of members, said the chief of an automobile company.        
	Some industry experts are also of the view that the selection, verification, validation and management of independent directors for the panel will not be a simple process and can lead to complications.        
	Who would create the panel and validate the credentials of the professionals selected in the panel? Prithivi Haldea, chairman and managing director of Prime Database, told The Telegraph.         
	Prime has a database of directors of all listed companies, which is embedded in the BSE website.        
	While Haldea is not opposed to the creation of a database from where companies can select a name, he says any specific list of people from where companies are forced to select will kill the entire concept of independent directors.        
	Companies would not want to appoint an outsider as a director, who is not known to the promoters. Second, there would be rampant corruption in the selection process of the panel members itself, defeating the whole concept, said Haldea.        
	Independent directors are appointed on company boards to ensure fair play in corporate affairs as they do not have any vested interest in the company.        
	In its report tabled on August 31, the standing committee said, There is a need to circumscribe and limit the liabilities of independent directors, so that they are able to act freely and objectively and are able to share their expertise with the rest of the board.        
	A provision may be made for the rotation of independent directors by restricting their tenure in a company to say, five years, the report said.

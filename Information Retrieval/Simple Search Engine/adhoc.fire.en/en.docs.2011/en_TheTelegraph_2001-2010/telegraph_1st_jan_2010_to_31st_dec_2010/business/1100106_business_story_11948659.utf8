          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 5: Godrej Properties  the real estate arm of the Godrej group  surged 20 per cent on listing in intra-day trade before closing at Rs 534.55, a premium of 9 per cent to the issue price of Rs 490 a share, on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	The strong showing by Godrej Properties  which came just a day after JSW Energy listed at a premium  appeared to signal that the IPO market may start buzzing once again after a subdued phase in 2009.        
	Godrej Properties is the first realty IPO to list this year. It had opened at Rs 510, a premium of 16 per cent over the issue price, and rose to an intra-day peak of Rs 586.70.        
	Market circles expect that the strong debut of Godrej Properties would encourage others such as Emaar MGF to tap the equity markets.        
	Godrej Properties had entered the capital markets last year with its IPO of 9,429,750 shares and fixed a price band of Rs 490-530 a share to raise Rs 500 crore.        
	The company received good response from institutions and was oversubscribed four times in this segment. However, the response from retail investors was lukewarm and the portion was under-subscribed.        
	Godrej group chairman Adi Godrej said the company was looking to focus on the affordable housing segment. The company has started several projects in 10 cities across the country. Godrej Properties will offer housing units in the range of Rs 25-30 lakh.        
	In the period ahead, we will see affordable housing picking up strongly in the country. We are committed to play a significant role in this segment, he said.        
	Godrej Properties is planning to raise another Rs 2,000-3,000 crore through debt or equity to fund expansion over the next two to three years, he said.        
	The company was looking at various options to raise money, including the qualified institutional placement route.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 15: Global personal computer shipments jumped 27.4 per cent during the first quarter of 2010 on the back of a robust recovery in Europe, West Asia and Africa, Gartner said today.         
	The first-quarter results exceeded the earlier market outlook of Gartner, which had been expecting a 22 per cent growth.         
	The stronger-than-expected growth was led by a robust recovery in Europe, West Asia and Africa, where the combined PC demand grew 24.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2010, said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner. The US and Latin America growth rates were slightly lower than what we had expected, he added.        
	Kitagawa said the results indicated that the professional PC market was gradually picking up, driven by replacements in mature markets. Demand in the second half of the year and in early 2011 will be driven by Microsofts Windows 7 operating system, he said.         
	Hewlett-Packard reported a 20 per cent growth in shipments. However, its market share slid to 18.2 per cent from 19.3 per cent a year earlier.         
	Acers market share rose as its shipments grew 54 per cent.

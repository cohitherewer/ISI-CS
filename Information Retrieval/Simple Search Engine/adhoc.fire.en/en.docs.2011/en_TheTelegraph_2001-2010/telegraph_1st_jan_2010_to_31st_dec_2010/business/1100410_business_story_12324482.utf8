          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 9: Reliance Industries  Indias largest private conglomerate  has picked up a 40 per cent interest in a shale gas acreage in the US under a deal valued at $1.7 billion.        
	On Friday, RIL announced that its subsidiary, Reliance Marcellus, had signed a joint venture with Pennsylvania-based Atlas Energy.         
	The deal will give RIL access to approximately 1,20,000 acres, or 40 per cent out of 3,00,000 acres of underdeveloped leasehold in the core area of the Marcellus Shale in southwest Pennsylvania.        
	The Mukesh Ambani-run company has built a roughly $5.5-billion (Rs 25,000 crore) war chest after selling treasury stock late last year and has been looking to make a big acquisition.        
	It had aggressively bid for bankrupt Dutch chemical company LyondellBasell but had been stymied by its creditors in February. It also lost out in a bidding war for Canadian oil sands player Value Creation Inc.        
	Shale is a clastic sedimentary rock composed of layers of clay-like, fine-grained sediments.        
	The interest of global oil giants in shale gas acreages has been piqued in recent years with the emergence of breakthrough technology that has made it possible to tap this unconventional source for natural gas.        
	RIL expects that the acreage it has acquired control over will support drilling for over 3,000 wells.         
	This joint venture will materially increase Reliances resource base and provide it with an entirely new platform from which to grow its exploration and production business while simultaneously enhancing its ability to operate unconventional projects in the future, said RIL executive director P.M.S. Prasad.        
	The $1.7-billion payout by RIL includes an acquisition cost of $339 million and an additional $1.36 billion capital costs.        
	Additionally, RIL will invest an estimated $3.4 billion for its share of the development costs over the next 10 years, said RIL CFO Alok Agarwal in a statement.        
	The RIL scrip closed at Rs 1,123.95 on Friday on the Bombay Stock Exchange, an increase of 1.8 per cent over the previous days close.         
	The transaction is expected to close by the end of this month.

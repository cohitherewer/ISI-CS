          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: State-run BSNL has announced a flat rate of 80 paise to Rs 1.20 for a three-minute STD call to landlines anywhere in the country to arrest the fall in fixed-line connections.         
	From tomorrow, BSNL fixed-line users can call any landline of any operator and talk for three minutes in one call unit charge, which varies from 80 paise to Rs 1.20 depending on the tariff plan, without having to shell out any additional charge.         
	Calls to mobile numbers of other operators will be charged at Re 1 per minute. The facility will be automatically available to the fixed-line customers across all tariff plans.         
	Private mobile operators, including Vodafone, Airtel, Tata Teleservices, provide STD calls for less than around 50 paise to Re 1 per minute depending on the tariff plan.         
	In 2006, BSNL had started the One-India plan whereby a customer had to pay Rs 299 as monthly rental and could make calls to any landline at Re 1 for three minutes.         
	This is a continuation of that plan and is an attempt by the failing telecom firm to gain market share in the fixed-line category, said Sudipto Basu, an independent telecom analyst.         
	In August, more than 2 lakh BSNL landline subscribers had disconnected.         
	BSNLs performance has been touching new lows every year since 2007. The firms losses for the year-ended March stood at Rs 5,955 crore, which was offset by an income of Rs 4,132 crore from non-telecom activities.

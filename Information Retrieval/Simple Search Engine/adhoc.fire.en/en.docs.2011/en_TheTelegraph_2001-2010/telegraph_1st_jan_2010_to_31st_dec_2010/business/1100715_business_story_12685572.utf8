                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Parent gives cash support to Tata Steel
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Booster dose                                  
	Calcutta, July 14: Tata Sons, the main promoter of the Tata group, will inject Rs 1,600 crore ($342 million) into flagship Tata Steel over the next 18 months.        
	It will get preferential allotment of 1.5 crore ordinary shares at Rs 594 apiece and also subscribe to 1.2 crore warrants convertible to equity after 18 months.        
	Upon conversion, the promoters holding will go up by around 2 per cent from the present level of 31.46 per cent to 33.34 per cent, assuming there is no further dilution of equity.        
	Tata Sons directly holds 29.13 per cent in Tata Steel.        
	In the immediate future, the company will get Rs 891 crore from the preferential allotment and another Rs 178.2 crore from the warrants, totalling Rs 1,069 crore.        
	Going by Sebis regulation, Tata Sons will have to stump up 25 per cent of the warrant price, or Rs 148.50 a share, now. The rest will have to be paid over the next 18 months.        
	The share/warrant is priced at a significant premium (17.6 per cent) to the closing price of Tata Steels stock. It closed at Rs 505.85, or Rs 2.40 down, on the BSE.        
	Incidentally, Tata Steel has been an under performer in the stock market over the last 3-4 months. While the benchmark BSE has remained almost flat over the last four months, the Tata Steel stock tumbled almost 27 per cent.        
	The preference issue price is close to what ordinary shareholders had paid for cumulative convertible preference shares, or CCPS, in 2007. CCPS, offered on a rights basis along with ordinary shares, were converted to equity at Rs 600 apiece after 18 months.        
	The equity raising is expected to help the company to reduce its net debt that stood at $9.88 billion for the end of March 31, 2010. The year before, the net debt was at $11.21 billion.        
	This year, Tata Steel intends to repay debt of $250 million and prepay debt of around $162 million.        
	It also proposes to raise further long-term loans (20 years maturity) during the year.

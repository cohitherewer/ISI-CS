          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 29: Aegon Religare Life Insurance Company is targeting a three-fold increase in premium income from new businesses in 2010-11 from Rs 166 crore last year and is planning to spend Rs 450-470 crore on expansion.        
	We are targeting a premium income of Rs 500 crore from new businesses in the current financial year, said Rajiv Jamkhedkar, managing director and chief executive officer of Aegon Religare Life Insurance.        
	The company, which started operations in mid-2008, hopes to break even in eight years, that is by 2016-17.         
	According to Jamkhedkar, growth will be affected if the dispute between the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) over Ulips is not resolved soon.        
	The debate over Ulips started last month when Sebi banned 14 private insurers from selling these plans launched after April 9 without obtaining a certificate of registration from it.         
	The market regulator, however, allowed them to sell Ulips launched before April 9 till further notice.        
	The insurance regulator made things more difficult for life insurers after it barred them from selling Ulips with a lock-in of less than five years and put a cap on the surrender charges.        
	Life insurers will have to change a few terms and conditions of their existing Ulips to sell them to new customers from July 1.

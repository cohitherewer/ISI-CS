                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Abbott snaps up Piramal unit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 21: Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories will buy Piramal Healthcares domestic generics business for $3.72 billion. The big-ticket transaction will make the American company the largest player in Indias pharmaceutical sector with a share of 7 per cent.        
	The transaction involves a one-time payment of $2.12 billion, which will be followed by payments of $400 million annually for four years from 2011 for Piramals healthcare solutions unit that sells generic drugs in India.        
	The acquisition is the second largest takeover in the Indian pharmaceutical sector after Japans Daiichi Sankyo bought a controlling stake in Ranbaxy Laboratories for $5 billion in 2008.        
	Pharmaceutical companies abroad are keen on the Indian market as they face increasing competition in generic drugs at home. Besides, as big drugs go off patent, pharma companies have to invest heavily in research and development.         
	In India, the $8-billion pharmaceutical market that is dominated by branded generics is expected to more than double by 2015.         
	Emerging markets represent one of the greatest opportunities for healthcare  not only in pharmaceuticals  but also across all our business segments. Today, emerging markets represent more that 20 per cent of Abbotts total business, said Abbott chairman and CEO Miles D. White. Abbott will fund the Piramal deal through internal accruals.        
	The Abbott buyout of Piramals generics unit will lead to the transfer of rights and trademarks for 350 branded drugs and a manufacturing unit located in Baddi (Himachal Pradesh). The deal will also involve the transfer of over 5,000 employees who are engaged in Piramals domestic formulations business.         
	Addressing reporters in Mumbai on Friday, Piramal group chairman Ajay Piramal said funds from the transaction would flow into Piramal Healthcare.         
	The company would use some of these funds to retire debt of almost Rs 1,300 crore and would consider issuing a one-time dividend to shareholders. A substantial portion of the funds from the sale will be used to explore new business opportunities for Piramal Healthcare.         
	Piramal also clarified there would not be an open offer for shareholders as the deal involved a transfer of business and not that of shareholding in the company.         
	After the transaction  expected to close in the second half of the year  Piramal Healthcare will sell OTC (over-the-counter) consumer products and offer custom manufacturing for third parties, along with critical care and diagnostic and clinical research services.         
	The stock market gave a thumbs down to the deal as the Piramal Healthcare scrip plummeted nearly 12 per cent to close at Rs 502.35 on the BSE on Friday. However, Abbott India jumped nearly 4 per cent to Rs 1,096.90.        
	Analysts in several Mumbai-based brokerages were impressed by the valuation of the deal and said Piramal Healthcare had secured an impressive price for its generic drugs unit.         
	As part of the transaction, Piramal Healthcare has entered into a non-compete agreement for eight years for which the group will get Rs 350 crore as fees.         
	Piramal Healthcares branded generics business expects to cross an annual sales figure of $500 million next year. Sales were up 23 per cent for the year ended March 31, 2010.         
	Marketmen said the Abbott deal had set a benchmark for global pharmaceuticals companies looking for buy-outs in the sub-continent that not only offer potential for significant growth but also access to a low-cost production base.         
	Abbott has recently expanded its reach in emerging markets with the acquisition of the drug unit of Belgiums Solvay for 4.5 billion euros and a collaboration with Zydus Cadila.         
	The company has recently created a division to focus on products, markets and commercial opportunities for branded generic pharmaceuticals outside the US.

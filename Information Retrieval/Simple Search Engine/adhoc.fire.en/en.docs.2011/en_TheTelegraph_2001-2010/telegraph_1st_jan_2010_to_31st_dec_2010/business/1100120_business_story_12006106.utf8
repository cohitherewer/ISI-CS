          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Telecom minister A. Raja in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: The auction for spectrum to offer third-generation mobile services will be completed by March, telecom minister A. Raja said today.        
	However, sources told The Telegraph that finance minister Pranab Mukherjee wanted the auctions to be over by February so that revenues could be reflected in the budget.        
	The government had earmarked Rs 30,000-35,000 crore as revenues to plug part of its fiscal deficit for this fiscal, estimated at Rs 400,000 crore.         
	The government is very keen to complete the 3G auction process well within the financial year (March 31, 2010) and most likely will issue a notice inviting applications this week, Raja told reporters.        
	Mukherjee, who is the chairman of the empowered group of ministers on 3G, has also asked the department of telecom to auction three or four slots in each circle, depending on the availability of spectrum. The government also wants the winners of the auction to pay the entire bid amount upfront.         
	The base price has been set at Rs 3,500 crore for pan-India 3G spectrum. The commercial launch of the high-speed service is expected in September.        
	DoT officials said there was a possibility of having four operators in the metros and three for the other circles.        
	Final details of the policy, including 3G slots, payment procedures and spectrum availability, will become public later this week when the DoT formally seeks the requests for proposals.        
	The defence ministry has already vacated 10 megahertz (Mhz) of 3G spectrum and has agreed to release another 5Mhz by the middle of this year. Spectrum will be allotted to all the winners in September.

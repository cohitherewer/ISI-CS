The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Portugal jolt
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Portugal jolt
                            
	Lisbon, March 24 (Reuters): Fitch Ratings has lowered Portugals sovereign credit rating by one notch to AA-, citing budgetary underperformance in 2009. The rating agency also warned that further underperformance this year and the next could cause another downgrade.        
	The change underlined concerns that the debt troubles that have afflicted Greece will move to other economies in the euro zone, and it drove European stocks and an already battered single currency lower. The premium Portugal has to pay on its bonds compared with German bunds fell after the announcement. Analysts said the move had been well flagged by Fitch and still left the rating comparable with other agencies.         
	Fitch also said the governments long-term budget austerity plan was broadly credible and it did not expect political instability to upset the passage of the necessary legislation.

	Calcutta, Dec. 16: Corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed today hinted at bringing private sector players under the right to information act to check the misuse of corporate lobbying.         
	The leaked tape of the conversations between Niira Radia  the promoter of Vaishnavi Corporate Communications  and various industrialists, politicians and reporters has stirred a hornets nest and forced the government to take a relook at the issue of corporate lobbying.         
	I think we have to have a transparency model, Khursheed said on the sidelines of a Ficci seminar here.        
	Today we have introduced an RTI act that brings in transparency on how we take decisions in the government. Perhaps that transparency model also needs to include areas such as lobbying. Citizens have a right to know who are doing public relations and who are lobbying for which corporate houses, and also about those who have special influence. It must be known to the public who is doing it, why is he doing it and to what effect.         
	The minister said corporate lobbying was a concern for all ministries, including law and telecom.         
	We (different ministries) need to consult among ourselves. It is a democratic right to lobby, to argue, to defend and to promote, Khursheed said.         
	Corporate lobbying, which leads to an illegal act is unacceptable and should be kept within legitimate limits, he said.         
	But what are the legitimate limits and whether lobbyists need to be regulated is something we need to discuss. We have to see what other ministries and the public feel.         
	On the way to define the limits of legitimacy, the minister said, In a democracy, you have the right to vote, you have the right to ask for votes but you dont have the right to buy votes. That is how the limit is drawn.         
	Corporate lobbying has no formal legal status in India unlike in many developed countries such as the US.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Survey sees 10% salary rise
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 4: Hewitt Associates, an HR consultant, has forecast an average 10.6 per cent hike in Indian salaries in 2010, on the basis of a survey.        
	Firms are enjoying strong sales because of good domestic demand, which should lead to higher hikes than the 6.6 per cent rise seen a year ago.        
	Telecom, engineering, pharma and energy firms are expected to pay well, the US-based human resources adviser said in a report released today.        
	The economy has shown faster recovery in sectors that rely on domestic growth and consumption, while recovery in sectors that have global dependence is expected to gain speed by mid-2010, said Sandeep Chaudhary, leader of Hewitts performance and rewards consulting practice in India.         
	Pay packets grew 13.3 per cent and 15.1 per cent in 2008 and 2007, respectively.         
	The Indian government expects the economy to expand 8.2 per cent in 2010-11, from an estimated 7.2 per cent in the current fiscal.        
	This growth and the fact that 2009 saw a lot of salary freeze and cuts are providing an impetus for healthy increase in compensation, Chaudhary said.        
	Infosys, the countrys second-largest software exporter, recently said that it might offer increments next month.        
	Energy, telecom, pharma and automotive sectors are expected to offer the most hikes, ranging from 11.6 per cent to 12.8 per cent.         
	Projections for banking and financial services are of a 10.5 per cent increase.        
	Indian companies are expected to outperform multi-nationals with an average increase of 11.4 per cent in salaries against 10.2 per cent by the latter.         
	The survey covered 465 companies across 20 primary industries in the country. Other Asia Pacific countries, including China, Japan, Singapore, Australia and Thailand, are projected to see single digit hikes in the range of 2.1 per cent to 6.7 per cent.

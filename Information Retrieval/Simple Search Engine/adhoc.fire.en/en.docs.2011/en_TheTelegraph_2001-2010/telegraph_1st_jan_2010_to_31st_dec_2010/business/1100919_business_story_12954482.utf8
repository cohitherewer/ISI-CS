          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: Steel Authority of India Ltd is not in favour of sharing 26 per cent of miners profit with the locals as proposed in the draft mining bill that was approved by the group of ministers (GoM) yesterday.        
	The public sector entity under the Union ministry of steel said the government should increase the royalty on mines rather than asking companies to share the profit.        
	There are a lot of practical problems to implement this. It is better that the government hikes royalty rates and uses the fund for development, SAIL chairman C.S. Verma said.        
	Integrated players such as SAIL and Tata Steel own iron ore and coal mines for captive use. The mines are not separate business units with separate accounting.         
	The bauxite mines owned by aluminium producers are also not treated as separate ventures as also the coal mines given by the government to power companies for captive use.        
	Tata Steel vice-chairman B. Muthuraman welcomed the idea of profit sharing. As a principle, it is good. We have to see how this can be implemented, he said.         
	Steel minister Virbhadra Singh concurred even as he wondered how the new rule would be implemented.        
	It may be 26 per cent or 20 per cent. But some sort of levy should be paid (by the miners), Singh, who is also part of the GoM, said.        
	The steel minister said the mining proposal would go to the GoM again and then to the Union cabinet for approval. Subsequently, it would be placed in Parliament.        
	Singh agreed with Verma that it was important to see how companies such as SAIL which mine for captive use and did not sell in the market could be taxed.

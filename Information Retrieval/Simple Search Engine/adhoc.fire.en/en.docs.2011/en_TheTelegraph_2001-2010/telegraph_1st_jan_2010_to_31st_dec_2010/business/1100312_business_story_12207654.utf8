          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Calcutta, March 11: Hospital chain Fortis Healthcare Ltd today said it would buy a 23.9 per cent strategic stake in Singapore-based healthcare provider  Parkway Holdings Ltd  for $685.3 million (about Rs 3,100 crore).        
	In a statement to the stock exchanges, Fortis said it would buy the stake from TPG Capital (formerly Texas Pacific Group), which holds the 23.9 per cent in Parkway.         
	The deal values Parkway shares at S$3.56 each, 14 per cent higher than todays closing price of S$3.12 on the Singapore Stock Exchange.        
	After the deal, Fortis chairman Malvinder Mohan Singh will become the chairman of Parkway Holdings. Fortis has sought four seats on Parkways board.        
	Fortis, through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, signed a definitive agreement with TPG Capital in Singapore today.         
	Religare Capital Markets Plc, the global investment banking arm of Religare Enterprises Ltd, was the adviser to Fortis.        
	The acquisition will significantly expand our footprint across the region and place us strategically for geographical and clinical leadership in Asia, a step closer to our vision of establishing a global healthcare delivery network, Singh said in a statement.         
	In August last year, Fortis acquired 10 hospitals from unlisted Wockhardt Hospitals for about Rs 900 crore ($187 million).        
	The latest deal will increase Fortis hospital network to 62  the biggest in Asia with more than 10,000 beds. Fortis runs 46 hospitals in India, a few of which are under construction.        
	Parkway, which has a market capitalisation of $2.4 billion, has 16 hospitals having 3,400 beds across six nations. Its hospitals are in Singapore, India, Malaysia, Brunei, China and the UAE.        
	In India, Parkways presence is through the 425-bed Apollo Gleneagles Hospital in Calcutta.         
	Fortis has two units in the city and is in process of setting up another 400-bed hospital.        
	Last month, Fortis had raised Rs 125 crore through preference shares and an overseas fund-raising exercise.         
	The money, it said, would be used for acquiring hospitals.         
	Its better to keep the war chest ready for any opportunity rather than start scouting for money when we need it, Singh had said then.        
	The Indian healthcare industry is estimated to touch $14.2 billion by 2012, propelled by rising income levels, changing demographics and a shift in illness patterns, consultancy firm KPMG had said in a report last year.        
	Fortis targets a revenue of $1 billion by 2015 from about $350 million at present.        
	Parkway Life REIT (real estate investment trust) is Asias largest healthcare REIT and is also part of Parkway Holdings.        
	We are pleased to welcome Fortis as the new major shareholder of Parkway, Parkways executive vice-chairman and CEO Lim Cheok Peng said.        
	Shares of Fortis Healthcare rose more than 5 per cent to a 52-week high of Rs 179.20 ($3.94) after the news today.        
	Meanwhile, Fortis is re-branding the 10 hospitals it had acquired from Wockhardt in August last year.        
	We hope to complete the exercise by April, Fortis Hospitals CEO Vishal Bali told The Telegraph. All the new properties will come under the Fortis brand and will adopt the latters business practices, Bali said.        
	The re-branding exercise involves huge marketing and advertisement campaigns in places where the acquired properties are located.

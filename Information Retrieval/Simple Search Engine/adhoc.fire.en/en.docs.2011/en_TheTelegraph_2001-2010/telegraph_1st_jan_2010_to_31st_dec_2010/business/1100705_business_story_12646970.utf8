The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Plan for metal SEZ in Haldia
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Plan for metal SEZ in Haldia
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Growth mode                                  
	New Delhi, July 4: A subsidiary of Nagpur-based Abhijeet Group has proposed a special economic zone for metal-based industries in Haldia.         
	It is among the three firms that have sought approval to set up tax-free enclaves at a time uncertainty looms over tax benefits after the implementation of the direct tax code from April 2011.        
	Coastal Ferrotech  an Abhijeet Group firm  has sought the permission of the board of approval (BoA) for special economic zones to set up an SEZ in Haldia. It plans to acquire 111.28 hectares for the project.        
	Videocon Industries has sought permission to set up an electronics SEZ in Navi Mumbai, and Infoparks seeks to set up an IT/ITeS zone at Ernakulam in Kerala.        
	These three proposals, along with the request of 26 developers seeking additional time to implement their projects, will be considered by the BoA at its meeting later this month.        
	Abhijeet Group officials said land acquisition problems had delayed the Haldia SEZ by more than a year. In the meantime, the group has set up a Rs-800-crore ferro-alloy plant at Atchutapuram SEZ near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.        
	The Andhra Pradesh project, which the company says is the biggest ferro-manganese and silico-manganese manufacturing facility in Asia, is likely to commence operations in January-February, officials said.        
	On whether the firm will go ahead with its SEZ plans despite having set up the facility in Andhra Pradesh, they said, If we are able to acquire the land, then this could be considered. However, we will have to wait for the final decision on the incentives in the tax-free zones to take a call.        
	Commerce ministry officials, who have taken up industrys concerns on the scrapping of SEZ tax benefits with the finance ministry, said, We have impressed upon the need to see to the best extent possible the interests of the investors in SEZs are protected.        
	The revised discussion paper on the direct tax code makes available profit-linked deductions only to existing SEZ units, which implies that units that come up after April 1, 2011 will not get tax exemptions.

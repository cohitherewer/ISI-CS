          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Verma: Expansion mode                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: State-run Steel Authority of India Ltd will add around 1,725MW power generation capacity to fuel expansion.        
	SAILs power requirement is expected to grow to around 1,900MW by 2012-13 from the current level of about 1,180MW. By 2020, the average load of steel plants, including the requirement of mines, is likely to grow to about 4,600MW, SAIL chairman C.S. Verma today said at the companys annual general meeting.         
	Verma indicated that the generation capacity could be raised by another 1600MW in the second phase.         
	On the joint venture with Posco, the SAIL chairman said, A detailed feasibility study is being conducted to explore the upstream and downstream opportunities based on the Finex technology which utilises iron ore fines for steel making and the manufacturing and commercialisation of CRNO (cold-rolled non-oriented) steel.        
	For the joint venture with Kobe Steel, the company is exploring the feasibility of using the Japanese firms ITmk3 technology for producing premium grade iron in the form of nuggets.         
	SAIL wants to sell the first tranche of shares  comprising 5 per cent of its equity, or 20.65 crore shares  this fiscal. The government will make a similar share offer along with SAIL. A second tranche of another 5 per cent sale will follow later.         
	Asset watch        
	The state-run steel entity will push for an early renewal of leases of the Chiria and Gua mines by the Jharkhand government, besides increasing production from its existing mines.         
	The company is exploring asset buys, either on its own and through JVs. This will help it to meet its increased iron ore requirement of about 43 million tonnes for hot metal production of 23.5 million tonnes after the first phase of expansion is completed in 2012-13.        
	SAIL is looking to increase the share of value-added items to around 50-55 per cent from around 37 per cent now.        
	Meanwhile, shareholders today unanimously approved the merger of Maharashtra Elektrosmelt Ltd with SAIL. They also cleared a final dividend payment of 17 per cent on paid-up equity, taking the total dividend for 2009-10 to 33 per cent.

	New Delhi, Feb. 22: The State Bank of India (SBI) is planning to peg its base rate at around 8 per cent.         
	Base rate at this point seems to be around 8 per cent for the bank, .P. Bhatt, chairman of the SBI, told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event.         
	The Reserve Bank of India, earlier this month, proposed to replace the existing system of the prime lending rate (PLR) with a new base rate regime, which will be fixed on the basis of the cost of funds.        
	The move is aimed to make the credit market more transparent and ensure that banks pass on the lower cost of fund automatically to the existing customers. The new system will be effective from April 1, 2010.        
	In its circular, the RBI said, The actual lending rates charged to borrowers would be the base rate plus borrower-specific charges, which will include product-specific operating costs, credit risk premium and tenor premium.         
	The base rate is the lowest rate that the bank can charge from a customer.         
	In the existing system, banks are free to fix their PLRs. Most of the variable rate loans, such as home loan and some of the term loans, are pegged against PLR. This means, if PLR is not changed, the loan rates remain the same.         
	The SBI is, at present, looking into all the aspects of the base rate system proposed by the RBI and will take a final call based on the asset liability situation, said Bhatt.         
	Asked if the SBI has approached the Reserve Bank for more time to migrate to the base rate regime, he said, We do not intend to approach the RBI but possibly other banks may seek some relaxation for compliance.         
	Further, he said the base rate would not translate into higher interest rate.

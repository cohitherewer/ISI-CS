The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel post for Sudip in the works
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Steel post for Sudip in the works
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Bandopadhyay: Busy time                                  
	New Delhi, July 12: Sudip Bandopadhyay of the Trinamul Congress is tipped to be made a junior minister for steel in a minor ministerial reshuffle scheduled later this month.        
	Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee is believed to have sought the appointment ahead of the Assembly elections in Bengal so that Bandopadhyay can monitor and speed up the steel projects in Bengal, especially the 2.9-million-tonne plant of IISCO, Burnpur, being built at an investment of Rs 14,443 crore.        
	Bandopadhyay had earlier fallen out of favour with Mamata when he hobnobbed with BJP leaders at a time the Trinamul leader was trying to distance herself from them. He has since made up for the lost time and will be rewarded with a ministerial berth.        
	Public sector SAIL is expected to spend over Rs 20,000 crore in Bengal on various projects, including the expansion of Durgapur Steel Plant and a joint venture wagon factory at Kulti.        
	A metal-based industrial hub is expected to come up in the Burnpur-Durgapur region, which will process downstream products as well as supplies from the new IISCO plant and the Durgapur unit, attracting another Rs 10,000-15,000 crore.         
	Sources said though the progress of the projects would depend on steel minister Vir Bhadra Singh, Bandopadhyay would be asked to monitor the Bengal projects.        
	Trinamul Congress wants to claim credit for the metal hub and wants the cornerstone of this hub, the new IISCO plant, to be ready before the polls in 2011.         
	However, the Congress and the CPM are likely to stake claim for the revival of IISCO.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is believed to have given a push to SAILs Bengal projects.         
	The CPM says it has lobbied with the UPA government for these projects.        
	The months ahead are likely to see the three parties jostling for credit for the steel plants in Burnpur and Durgapur.         
	The takeover of Burn Standard and Braithwaite by the Indian Railways is already being showcased by Trinamul Congress as a sign of better times for a state that has seen its position shrink steadily in the industrial map of the country.        
	Bengal has not been able to attract fresh investments because of labour unrest in industrial belts such as Haldia.         
	The state got just Rs 7,000 crore of industrial investments last year and Rs 4,000 crore the year before. A small state such as Haryana received Rs 3,000 crore in just six months of 2009.

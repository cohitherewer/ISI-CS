          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 18: General Motors Company  the phoenix that arose last July from the ashes of GM Corp after a bailout by the US government -- stands to receive $ 200 million (about Rs 900 crore) from the sale of its Indian operations. The payment will be realized in 2013.        
	The stake has been sold to a Hong Kong-based venture in which GM has an equal stake with Chinese automaker SAIC Motor Corp.        
	The sale was finalized last December and came into effect from February 1. But it is only now that the full details of the transaction have come out.        
	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, GM said: We sold certain of our operations in India in exchange for a promissory note due in 2013.        
	GM said it recorded a net consideration of $ 194 million  the unexplained $ 6 million probably accounting for taxes related to the transaction  and an insignificant gain.        
	The US automaker said the amount due under the promissory note issued by the Hong Kong venture  SAIC GM Investment Ltd  may be partially reduced, or increased, based on the India operations cumulative earnings before interest and taxes for the three-year period ending December 31, 2012.        
	The sale transaction resulted in a loss of control and the de-consolidation of the India Operations on February 1, 2010, GM said in a 10-K filing which provided details of its financial performance in the quarter ended March 31.        
	The US automaker  which recorded revenues of $ 31.48 billion in the three months ended March 31  said it had removed the assets and liabilities of its Indian operations from its consolidated financial statements.        
	SAIC Motor Hong Kong Investment Limited  a subsidiary of the Chinese carmaker  is the other partner in SAIC GM Investment Ltd.        
	GM has invested $ 50 million in the equity of SAIC GM Investment Ltd and has made a commitment to provide an additional capital of $ 123 million to the Hong Kong venture that was established to invest in automotive projects outside of markets in China, initially focusing on markets in India.        
	The Chinese Link        
	The sale of the Indian operations is closely linked with the restructuring of SAICs operations which is currently underway and whose details are not fully known.        
	SAIC and GM are 50-50 partners in Shanghai General Motors Co., Ltd, the maker of Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet models.        
	There is also a three-way tieup called SAIC-GM-Wuling among SAIC, GM and Liuzhou Wuling Automobile, which makes popular mini vans and mini trucks.        
	GM has a 34 per cent stake in SAIC-GM-Wuling, while SAIC owns 50.1 per cent and Liuzhou Wuling holds 15.9 per cent. GM is seeking to raise its stake in this venture.        
	GM India has plans to make trucks and minivans by SAIC-GM-Wuling at its plants in Halol in Gujarat and Talegaon in Maharashtra, thereby breaking into a market for 1-tonne trucks that is dominated by Tata Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra.        
	GM India has already indicated that it plans to introduce light trucks developed in China by the end of 2011.        
	The carmaker will also start building engines in Talegaon from November and open a stamping plant in January. The engine plant will have an initial capacity of 160,000 units a year.        
	GM is also planning to expand the number of car dealerships in India to about 300 this year from around 200, as it looks to grab market share in the small car segment after the January launch of the Chevrolet Beat.        
	The SEC filing said the 2400 employees of GM India had been transferred to the Hong Kong joint venture. It added that the Indian venture had sold 32,000 units  accounting for about 4.2 per cent of the industrys sales  in the first three months of 2010.              
	China restructuring        
	At the same time that it sold its stake in the Indian operations, GM sold a 1 per cent stake in its Chinese car-making venture Shanghai GM reducing our ownership interest to 49 per cent, GM said in its latest filing.        
	The 1 per cent stake sale in the Shanghai venture was linked to a $ 400 million commercial bank loan that GM obtained and SAIC stood guarantor. The 1 per cent stake has been put up as collateral for the loan that GM sorely needed to deal with a crisis at its Daewoo subsidiary which had placed bets on a Korean won-based derivative that went sour.        
	As part of the loan arrangement, SAIC provided a commitment whereby, in the event of default, SAIC will purchase the ownership interest in Shanghai GM that we pledged as collateral for the loan, GM said in its latest filing.        
	GM also holds a call option to buy back the 1 per cent stake sold to SAIC at a premium. The option is exercisable based on events which we do not unilaterally control. GM added.

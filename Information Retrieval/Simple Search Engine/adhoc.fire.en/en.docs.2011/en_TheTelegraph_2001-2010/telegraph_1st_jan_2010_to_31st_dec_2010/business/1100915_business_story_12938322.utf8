          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 14: Tata Steel and CESC have signed agreements for iron ore from Canada and coal from South Africa, respectively.         
	The Tata firm will acquire an 80 per cent stake in an iron ore project of New Millennium Capital Corp for a maximum of Rs 1,355 crore. It hopes to supply 4 million tonnes (mt) to its European operations (Corus) from 2012.         
	For city-based CESC, investment in Sydney-based Resource Generation, with a coal mine in South Africa, is a maiden one. The company, which supplies power to Calcutta and Howrah, will buy 10 per cent in the company for Rs 45.5 crore.        
	Integrated Coal Mining, a CESC affiliate, will buy coal from Resource Gens Boikarabelo mine for the next 20 years. It will buy 1mt of coal from 2013 for three years and 2mt for the next 17 years at a price linked to the global benchmark.         
	CESC is likely to import the coal to feed its upcoming facilities in Haldia in Bengal and Chandrapura in Maharashtra.        
	Tata Steel is also negotiating with New Millennium on a taconite (low-quality iron ore) project.         
	The agreement with New Millennium is a clear demonstration of our strategy and we continue to analyse opportunities to increase raw material security, Tata Steel managing director H.M. Nerurkar said.

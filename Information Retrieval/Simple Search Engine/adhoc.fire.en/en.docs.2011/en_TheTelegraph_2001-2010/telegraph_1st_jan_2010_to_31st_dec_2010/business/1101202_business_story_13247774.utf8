          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: The Union cabinet today agreed to split the shares of oil explorer ONGC Ltd into two, making the stock attractive to retail buyers.        
	State-run ONGC had suggested the split to the government ahead of its planned follow-on public offering through which the government plans to sell 5 per cent of its shares to garner over Rs 10,000 crore.        
	After the stake sale, the governments shareholding in ONGC will come down to 69.14 per cent from 74.14 per cent.        
	ONGC had appointed two international auditors  DeGolyer amp; MacNaughton and Gaffney, Cline amp; Associates  to certify its oil and gas reserves. The Indian oil explorer, which normally has its reserves audited every five years, is getting a certification in the third year because of the public offer.        
	The ONGC scrip soared today to Rs 1,288.50, up Rs 40 over yesterdays close on the news that the cabinet was likely to clear the split.         
	The split will effectively halve the price of the stock that has a face value Rs 10.        
	The government, which earned Rs 15,200 crore from a successful Coal India public issue, is planning to take more PSUs to the market this fiscal, including SAIL, ONGC, PowerGrid, Shipping Corporation and IOC. The MOIL flotation, which closed today, got a huge response.        
	Analysts said the government could end up earning over Rs 58,000 crore from these initial and follow-up public offerings.        
	Over a five-year period, during which the government has to fulfil listing requirements in all listed PSUs, it could actually earn at least Rs 1,50,000 crore from divestments.        
	IOC offer price        
	Indian Oil Corporation expects to sell shares at Rs 450 apiece, well above the current market levels, in the follow-on public offer (FPO) planned for late January, chairman B. M. Bansal said today.        
	We expect the pricing to be around Rs 450 (per share), he told reporters here.        
	Bansal said the FPO in which the government would divest its 10 per cent share along with the company selling an equal number of fresh shares was likely in the third or fourth week of January.        
	Indian Oil has hired six banks to handle the public offer. They are Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, ICICI Securities, Morgan Stanley, SBI Capital and UBS.        
	Bansal said the FPO would raise about Rs 20,000 crore  Rs 10,000 crore each for the government and the company.

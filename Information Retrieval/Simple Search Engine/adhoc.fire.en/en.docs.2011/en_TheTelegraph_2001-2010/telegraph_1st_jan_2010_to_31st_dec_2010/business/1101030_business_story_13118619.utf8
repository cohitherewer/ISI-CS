          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mitra: Steady progress                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: Revenue secretary Sunil Mitra is confident that the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) bill will be approved by Parliament in the next fiscal so that it can be implemented from April 1, 2012.        
	The draft DTC is with the Parliamentary Standing Committee. It is likely that by February-March, we should receive their comment and by the middle of next year, in the monsoon session, it should be voted and made law, he said.        
	In August, the government decided to delay DTC by a year to April 1, 2012.         
	In the event of the standing committee giving its report, our efforts will be to do it (get the bill passed) at the earliest. Until it is passed, we cannot bring the subordinate legislation, said Mitra.        
	GST meet        
	He also hoped that state finance ministers would be able to reach a consensus at their Goa meeting and pave the way for the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).        
	The empowered state finance ministers are meeting today in Goa. I am hopeful there will be a consensus which we can accept and bring in the GST some time in the next financial year, Mitra told reporters on the sidelines of a Ficci tax conference.        
	[In Goa, however, some states today suggested a new model for the GST council, which will be empowered to make changes in the fresh regime. Panel chairman Asim Dasgupta floated a proposal that the current committee be enlarged with Union finance minister as its chairman and one of the state finance ministers as vice-chairman, reports PTI]        
	The roll out of GST has already missed a deadline of April 1, 2010.

                              US President Barack Obama in Lisbon on Saturday. (AP)                            
	Lisbon, Nov. 21 (Reuters): The US and the European Union promised on Saturday to use their considerable economic weight to try to secure a successful conclusion to the Doha round of global trade negotiations in 2011.        
	US President Barack Obama held two hours of talks with Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, and Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, on the sidelines of a Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) summit in Lisbon, with both sides emphasising the importance of their economic relationship.        
	They reaffirmed a commitment made at the G20 summit in Seoul this month to promote balanced growth and avoid competitive currency devaluations that can lead to global imbalances, and underlined the critical importance of bolstering trade.        
	We highlighted our commitment to reject protectionism as a response to the challenges our economies face, read a joint statement released after their first summit in a year.        
	We reiterated our strong commitment to direct our negotiators to engage in across-the-board negotiations to promptly bring the Doha Development Agenda to a successful, ambitious, comprehensive and balanced conclusion.         
	We recognised that 2011 is a critical window of opportunity and that engagement among all negotiators must intensify and expand to complete an agreement that will expand trade and open markets.        
	The EUs chief trade negotiator has said he expects Doha, which is aimed at lowering global trade barriers to stimulate economic activity, will be successfully completed in 2011.        
	The EU and US, with a combined population of more than 800 million people, are the two largest trading powers in the world. The combined value of goods and services commerce between them is more than $4 trillion a year.        
	Saturdays summit, which was originally scheduled to take place in May but was postponed after US officials said there was no point in meeting if there was nothing to talk about, was billed by the EU as a high-level meeting of equals.

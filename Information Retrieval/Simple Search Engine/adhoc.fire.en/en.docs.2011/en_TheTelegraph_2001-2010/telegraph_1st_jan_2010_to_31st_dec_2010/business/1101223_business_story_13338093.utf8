	Calcutta, Dec. 22: Reliance Industries wants an increase in the price of gas produced from the Krishna Godavari basin as global crude rates have soared and investment costs in exploration and production have risen.        
	The government had fixed the current rate of $4.2 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) in 2007 after much deliberation, rejecting demands for $2.34 mmBtu by Anil Ambanis ADAG and public sector NTPC Ltd.        
	An RIL executive said the company believed the current gas prices could cripple aggressive expansion in this sector because the risks involved in such investments were very high.         
	I think gas from deep water has to be priced higher. You get liquefied natural gas between $8-12 per mmBtu in India. So there is a lot of scope, Atul Chandra, RIL president (operations), told reporters at a CII event here today.        
	Earlier this year, the government had raised the price of gas sold by ONGC Ltd, from fields it had received from the Centre on a nomination basis without bidding, to Reliances level of $4.2 per mmBtu from $1.79 per mmBtu.        
	However, gas produced from fields such as Panna-Mukta-Tapti, which were procured through auction, is sold at $5.73 per mmBtu.        
	Chandra said the cost of drilling a well was about $30 million five to six years ago, but now it had reached anywhere between $100 million and $125 million.        
	RILs deepwater gas production is now at 55 million cubic metres per day. Exploration activity of RIL is going on in 15-20 blocks, and the progress is in line with the schedule laid down by the government.         
	On the latest round of New Exploration Licensing Policy IX, Chandra said, I am not very bullish because of the volatility in the oil industry. Moreover, India is not among the best places for hydrocarbon investment.        
	Reliance has been investing heavily in alternative sources of energy such as shale gas as it wants to have a foothold overseas and seeks to expand the business beyond petrochemicals, refining, oil and gas exploration and retail.         
	The company is ready for shale gas auction, for which the government will launch bids next year.         
	On the drop in gas production in Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields (also known as D-1 and D-3) in the KG-D6 block, Chandra said, About 70 to 80 per cent of all oil basins are showing a declining trend worldwide. In order to increase output by 10 per cent, there is a need to add 9 to 10 million barrels to stop the level of reserves from going down.

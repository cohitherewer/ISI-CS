	SBI plan        
	The State Bank of India plans to come out with another retail bond issue worth Rs 1,000 crore in the next two months.        
	We are planning for (retail bond issue) January. It will be in the range of Rs 500-1,000 crore, SBI chief financial of officer S.S. Rajan said.        
	The first retail bond issue of Rs 1,000 crore last month was subscribed over 17 times on the opening day itself. The bank had to curtail the subscription period as the response to the bonds was beyond expectation.        
	The offering comprised issue of bonds worth Rs 500 crore with an option to raise it further up to Rs 500 crore by issuing additional bonds.        
	The bonds were issued in two variants  Series 1 and Series 2 having maturity of 10 years and 15 years, respectively, with a face value of Rs 10,000 each. The bonds offer an interest of 9.25 per cent for 10 years and 9.5 per cent for 15 years and are listed on the National Stock Exchange.         
	The proceeds will be utilised to augment the banks capital base in line with its growth strategy.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had said the bank was likely to come out with many more retail bond issues every quarter.        
	Going forward, we intend to do more bond issues. We want to create a secondary market for them, so that exit becomes easy and price discovery takes place, Bhatt had said.         
	Over a period of time this will help us build a bigger corpus of long-term resources. We believe that investment opportunities are very limited and needs to be increased. This bond issue will fulfil the need to a considerable extent, he had said.

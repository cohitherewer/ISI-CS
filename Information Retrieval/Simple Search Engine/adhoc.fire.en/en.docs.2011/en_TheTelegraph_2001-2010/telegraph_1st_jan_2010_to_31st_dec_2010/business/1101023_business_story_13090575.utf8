	New Delhi, Oct. 22: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is likely to overshoot his divestment target for the year by nearly 50 per cent. According to latest estimates, the government is likely to raise a massive Rs 58,000 crore against a divestment target of Rs 40,000 crore for the fiscal.        
	Buoyed by the runaway success of the Coal India IPO, bookrunners and divestment ministry officials are analysing what the government can earn from its proposed share sale programme in the current fiscal.        
	Coal Indias maiden public offer received bids worth Rs 2.35 lakh crore from investors. This is the highest ever that any primary issue has garnered in India. The mega issue, which closed yesterday, was subscribed over 15 times.         
	Top officials said seven more issues are set to come up this fiscal  these are of SAIL, ONGC, MOIL (formerly Manganese Ore India), PowerGrid, Hind Copper, Shipping Corporation and Indian Oil.         
	This will take us to 10 issues this fiscal. Two are done with and Coal India is ending, the officials said.        
	According to analysts estimates based on the current market price, the governments earnings from the divestment offers will be over Rs 58,000 crore, and can be even more if the stock market continues to surge, which they say is very likely.        
	Finance ministry officials said in all we agree with analysts that we can earn over Rs 58,000 crore.         
	Before the Coal India IPO, the divestment target of Rs 40,000 crore seemed a little challenging, say analysts. However, with the success of the Coal India issue, bookrunners and analysts have told divestment ministry officials that the government will be able to surpass its target for the year easily.        
	The government has already mopped up Rs 17,500 crore from the public issues of Satluj Jal (Rs 1,063 crore), Engineers India (Rs 960 crore) and Coal India (Rs 15,475 crore).        
	Of the six companies in which the government had sold stakes last fiscal, investors could make money in only three. Issues such as NMDC and NHPC were expensively priced and struggled to sail through, and state-owned financial institutions had to bail them out.        
	Last fiscal, the government raised Rs 25,000 crore through stake sales in PSUs such as Oil India, NMDC, REC and NTPC.         
	Over a five-year period during which the government has to fulfil the listing requirements of all listed PSUs, it can earn at least Rs 1,50,000 crore.        
	The government will also look to take the countrys largest metals trading company MMTC, National Fertilisers and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers to the market later this year.         
	We will not stop trying to list unlisted PSUs. However, any coalition government has to keep in mind what the partners have to say in the decision-making process, said sources.        
	Officials pointed out that in addition to divestment, the huge success of the 3G spectrum and broadband auctions will help Pranab Mukherjee to balance his budget better.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 15: Recruitment is back to the pre-downturn level in Calcutta.        
	The Naukri Job Speak index for the city moved up to 1055 in March from 990 in February this year. A similar sentiment is echoed in the national Job Speak index, which has been continuously moving in a positive direction in the past three months.         
	The key sectors in Calcutta such as IT, ITeS, insurance and construction seem to be on a positive path, a Naukri statement said.        
	The hiring intentions of companies in most industry sectors seem to be moving in a positive direction as reflected by the consecutively upward moving job index in the first quarter of 2010. It seems, cautious optimism among employers has given way to definite optimism, Sumeet Singh, national head (marketing and communication) of Info Edge, said.        
	A sectoral analysis, both at the national and state level, shows an improving hiring environment in the majority of industry sectors as reflected by the rising three-month moving average index.         
	In March, the ITeS and the insurance sectors have seen maximum movement in the recruitment front with the index moving up 13 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively, over February. Although the IT and the construction sectors have seen an 8 per cent and 1.5 per cent dip in March over February, the three-month moving average index climbed up 6.5 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively.

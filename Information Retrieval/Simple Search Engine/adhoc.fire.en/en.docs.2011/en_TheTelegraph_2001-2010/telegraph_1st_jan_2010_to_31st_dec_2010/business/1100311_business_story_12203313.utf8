          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, March 10: Corporate honchos are making good use of the post-budget rebound in the stock markets.        
	Leading the pack is Sajjan Jindal, promoter of JSW Group, and his wife Sangita, who have sold part of their holdings in their own company JSW Steel.        
	ITC chairman Yogesh C. Deveshwar, Infosys director T.V. Mohandas Pai and Tech Mahindra MD Vineet Nayyar are the other prominent names to sell stocks over the past three weeks.        
	The bellwether BSE sensex today closed at 17098, up 5.19 per cent, or 844 points, from its close on February 25, a day before Pranab Mukherjee presented his second budget as finance minister of the Congress-led UPA government.        
	The markets closely followed the global rally in equities during January, touching a high of 17790 on January 5 before crashing to 15790 within a month. Shares have rebounded from these lows, but the big fillip came from the budget that promised a growth rate of over 8 per cent.        
	The top executives were quick to spot the opportunity.        
	Sajjan Jindal offloaded part of his direct holding in JSW Steel, the flagship of JSW Group having interest in power, infrastructure, cement and aluminium.        
	Jindal earned around Rs 158 crore from the share sale in four tranches, starting February 26, the day the budget was presented. His personal stake in the steel company has come down to 1.24 per cent from 1.98 per cent.        
	His wife Sangita earned Rs 9.7 crore by offloading 80,000 shares of JSW Steel in the market. However, the sale will not jeopardise the familys control over the company. The promoters, which include Jindals personal stake and various family-run companies, held a comfortable 45.01 per cent as on December 31, 2009.         
	Next in line is Sanjay Kalra, CEO of IT giant Tech Mahindra. His personal holding in the company came down to 0.11 per cent from 0.49 per cent after he sold 480,000 shares for around Rs 44.33 crore. Tech Mahindra MD Vineet Nayyar also transferred 350,000 shares to a charitable institution run by his wife. The value of the shares is around Rs 30 crore.         
	ITC chairman Y.C. Deveshwar and director K. Vaidyanath sold stocks worth Rs 5.8 crore and Rs 1.3 crore. respectively.         
	T.V. Mohandas Pai of Infosys sold around 15,000 shares to earn Rs 3.9 crore.        
	Top bosses of PSUs are also following in the footsteps of their private sector peers. Prosad Dasgupta, MD and CEO of Petronet LNG, sold shares worth Rs 49.83 lakh.        
	Market experts say the sensex can find it tough to cross the highs reached in January. The possibility of a 20-25 per cent correction from the top cannot be ruled out either.         
	There is nothing negative about it. These individuals have taken the companies to greater heights. It is fair that they reap the fruits of hard labour, said a market observer.

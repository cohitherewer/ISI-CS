The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | HP to hit deal street
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      HP to hit deal street
                            
	New York, Oct. 2 (Reuters): Hewlett-Packards choice of CEO may spur a flurry of deals in the software industry, as it shores up one of the weakest parts of its business to do battle with Oracle and IBM.        
	Leo Apotheker, former head of German business software giant SAP and now newly installed chief executive at the worlds largest technology company, stressed that software was the glue tying its business together.        
	Some analysts foresee HP thus striding out on an acquisition path. Software yields only 3 per cent of HPs revenue, compared with over 20 per cent at IBM, and Gleacher amp; Co analyst Brian Marshall called it HPs Achilles heel.        
	Now, the growing popularity of cloud computing  which enables users to access software over the Internet  means businesses will almost surely buy fewer servers and other computers in future  a threat to hardware-centric HP.        
	Considering that servers, desktops, and notebooks represented roughly 40 per cent of HPs total revenue in 2009, it is fair to assume the company will have some issues on its hands in the not too distant future, Marshall said.        
	But the pool of available targets is shrinking as cash-rich technology players chase low valuations.         
	In past months, HP bought security software specialist ArcSight for $1.5 billion, Intel Corp shelled out $7.7 billion for McAfee Inc, IBM picked up Netezza Corp for $1.7 billion, and Symantec Corp bought Verisign Incs payment authentication unit for about $1.3 billion.

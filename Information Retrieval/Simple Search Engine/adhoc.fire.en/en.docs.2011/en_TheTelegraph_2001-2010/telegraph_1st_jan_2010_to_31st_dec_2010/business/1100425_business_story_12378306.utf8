          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Rajiv Bajaj in Mumbai on Saturday. (PTI)                          
	Mumbai, April 24: Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd today announced the launch of its subsidiary  India Kawasaki Motors Pvt Ltd.        
	Kawasaki, which has a technical assistance agreement with Bajaj Auto, is looking to introduce bikes in the 250cc and higher segments through the subsidiary.         
	Last year, local bike sales stood at around 7 million units, making India the second largest motorcycle market in the world after China.         
	With economic growth picking up, the demand for sports and cruiser bikes is expected to jump further.        
	The Japanese firm will leverage the distribution network of Bajaj, its partner in India since 1984.         
	The new unit will assemble, import and sell Kawasakis bikes in India. The knocked down units from Japan will be assembled at Bajajs Chakan plant in Maharashtra. The bikes will then be sold through Bajajs Probiking showrooms.         
	Under the existing agreement, Bajaj produces and sells motorcycles in collaboration with Kawasaki. The Japanese firm expects the new subsidiary to achieve sales of around 1,000 units in the current calendar year.         
	Rajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, said the Probiking outlets had already been selling the Kawasaki Ninja 250R since October last year. Around 100 Ninjas are now sold every month.         
	The plan is to increase the number of Probiking outlets to over 40 by the end of this fiscal year, Bajaj added.        
	Bajaj Auto will continue to focus on the value space or the executive segment where some of its brands such as Discover and Pulsar are among the top. Our focus has been on motorcycles and so far it has been paying off, he added.

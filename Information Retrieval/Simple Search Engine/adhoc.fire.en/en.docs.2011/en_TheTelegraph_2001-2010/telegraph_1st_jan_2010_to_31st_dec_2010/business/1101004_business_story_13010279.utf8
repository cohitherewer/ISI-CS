        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay shows how to include infrastructure bonds in your scheme of tax planning                                            
	Benjamin Franklin had once said: In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.        
	Nearly 150 years later, Margaret Mitchell in her famous novel Gone With the Wind concluded: Death, taxes and childbirth! There is never any convenient time for any of them.        
	Social thinkers have drawn upon the inevitability of death to highlight the difficulty in avoiding taxes. This also explains why tax shelters are most sought after by the common man.        
	The management of IDFC, a company set up in 1997 by the Indian government to finance infrastructure development, knows this well. The company has come out with the public issue of 10-year infrastructure bonds, an investment instrument eligible for tax deduction up to Rs 20,000 under a new section of the income tax act for the current financial year. The management expects to raise the entire eligible amount, that is Rs 3,400 crore during the first issue itself (open till October 18, 2010).

	Saving tax should be one of the objectives of your overall investment planning. If you make it the sole objective, you are bound to lose out on investment return and deviate grossly from your financial goals.        
	Paying taxes on time may be more prudent than parting with a larger sum of money to save a much small tax liability.        
	Consider the new section 80CCF of the income tax act that allows a deduction of up to Rs 20,000 if invested in an approved infrastructure bond. If you are in the highest income tax bracket (30 per cent), you can save a maximum Rs 6,000 towards income tax liability by investing Rs 20,000 or more in one of the 10-year infrastructure bonds of IDFC. However, you cannot redeem your investment for the initial five years if you want the tax benefit.        
	The bond issue has four investment options  Options I and II offer an annual interest rate of 8 per cent, while Options III and IV will give an interest rate of 7.5 per cent.         
	The interest rates payable under the four bond options are different because the options to redeem the bonds are different. While Options III and IV offer a buyback facility at the end of five years, investors in Option I and II have to hold on to their bonds through the entire tenure of 10 years or sell them on stock exchanges if they want an early exit  all bonds will be listed on the bourses.        
	Mood meter        
	When a bond is traded on a stock exchange, the price of the bond at any point of time rules higher or lower than its face value (the price at which it was issued), depending on a number of factors such as the market rate of interest, the inflation rate, the governments borrowing programme and so on.        
	So, if you want to redeem your bonds under Options I or II after five years, you may suffer capital loss or make a gain. For Options III and IV, there wont be any capital loss because IDFC would buy back the bonds at the face value.        
	If you dont want to take any risk, you shall get an interest rate of 7.5 per cent per annum. If you are ready to accept interest rate related risks, inflation and fiscal deficit and make capital gain or loss, your choice should be Options I and II where you will get a slightly higher interest rate of 8 per cent.        
	Should you invest in these bonds? There are two primary considerations: You cannot redeem your investment at least for the first five years and you get an interest rate of 7.5-8 per cent while the annual inflation rate is close to 10 per cent.         
	IDFC made its first equity offering to the public in 2005 at a price of Rs 34 a share. After five years, the shares are now trading at Rs 207 apiece. In other words, had you bought IDFCs shares in 2005 for Rs 1 lakh, you would now be sitting on a corpus of Rs 6,08,823.53.         
	Against this, an investment of Rs 1 lakh in IDFC bonds will yield you Rs 2,15,892.50 after 10 years at an annually compounded interest rate of 8 per cent. If you add to it the savings of Rs 6,000 on tax liability, the accumulation grows to 2,21,892.50, still much less than what you get from equities.        
	One may argue that bond investments are more secure than equities. But over a long period of five years, risks and volatilities are ironed out  between 2005 and 2010 we have seen the two extremes of bullishness (2007-08) and bearishness (2008-09) despite which IDFC shares have given a compounded annual return of 43.5 per cent.        
	There is another argument in favour of investment in equities. IDFC plans to disburse Rs 1,00,000 crore in the next three to four years compared with Rs 35,000 crore at present, translating into a growth rate of above 30 per cent per year.        
	Profit watch        
	Now, the cost of borrowing (from banks and other institutional sources) for IDFC is above 10 per cent. The companys cost of borrowing through infrastructure bonds will be lower at a little above 8 per cent, including the expenditure for the bond issue. Besides, the company will be eligible for external commercial borrowing up to Rs 3,000 crore at a much cheaper rate than domestic market. The infrastructure finance company status will enable IDFC to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. This will translate into a higher net interest margin (yield on lending to infrastructure projects minus its own cost of borrowing) and, hence, higher profitability. Higher profits mean higher earnings per share and higher price for the stock.         
	If you are still not comfortable with equity investment, follow this strategy to beef up your returns from bond investment. Invest Rs 1 lakh in bonds under Option I.         
	You can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 20,000 and save Rs 6,000 on tax liability. Under this option, you receive an annual interest of Rs 8,000. With this interest payment open a monthly systematic investment plan (diversified equity scheme) with a mutual fund.         
	In the last 10 years, diversified equity mutual funds have given a compounded annual return of 17-30 per cent. Assuming a conservative return rate of 10 per cent, your SIP can accumulate to Rs 2,37,382.49, or Rs 21,490 more than what you get by simply investing in the cumulative option of the bond issue (See chart).        
	In this way, you can get best of both worlds, getting a decent return while saving tax at the same time.

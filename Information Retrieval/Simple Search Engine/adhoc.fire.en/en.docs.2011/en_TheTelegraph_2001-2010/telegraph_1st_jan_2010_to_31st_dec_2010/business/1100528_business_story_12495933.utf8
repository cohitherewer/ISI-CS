          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, May 27: Telecom operators are competing with Internet service providers and mobile chip makers for wireless broadband spectrum in circles where they had failed to get the 3G radio waves.        
	Both wireless broadband and 3G radio waves can be used to provide high-speed Internet and real time data services such as video-on-demand and mobile TV. So, operators plan to leverage both the technologies to offer seamless service to consumers.        
	Operators who have not got 3G spectrum in some circles will go for wireless broadband as it is compatible with the existing mobile connectivity. This way, when a subscriber calls, he will be using the GSM network and the broadband when he uses the Internet. This makes for spectrum optimisation as well, said telecom analyst Sudipto Basu.        
	Competition will be tough as unlike 3G where an operator got just two slots of 5Mhz each, a wireless broadband winner will get one block of 20Mhz.        
	Companies are planning collaborative business strategies to develop innovative data applications with a high revenue potential to arrest the decline in earnings from voice services.        
	Operators will look at leveraging mobile advertising as a viable source to increase their revenues, said Anuj Kumar, executive director (South Asia) of UK-based Affle, a mobile marketing solutions provider.

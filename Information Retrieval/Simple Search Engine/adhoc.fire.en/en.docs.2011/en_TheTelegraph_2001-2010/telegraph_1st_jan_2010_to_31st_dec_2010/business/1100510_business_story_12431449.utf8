The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil hunt policy faces overhaul   Gas row an added trigger

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                                   
	New Delhi, May 9: India plans to overhaul its policy for awarding oil and gas blocks, with different norms for proven and unproven reserves.        
	Competitive bidding will occur for the proven reserves, for which the government will seek a hefty profit share. The unproven blocks will be given on the principle of open acreage licence  bidders have the right to survey for a couple of years and then decide on taking up exploration work, without having to pay any share as profit to the government during the survey period.        
	Last Fridays Supreme Court judgment on the ownership of gasfields in the Ambani brothers case has given an added impetus to the moves to go in for a twin track bidding policy. The fact that government can set prices and decide on buyers  vindicated by the Supreme Court verdict  coupled with the lack of data on many fields make India an even more unattractive destination for oil and gas investment, say officials.         
	As evidence, they cited the weak response from foreigners to the last round of bidding for oil and gas fields, and the Supreme Court verdict may make them even more wary of investing in India.        
	The Supreme Court had decreed that all oil and gas acreages essentially belonged to the Indian state, and operators merely had the right to sell oil and gas only to those whom the Indian government chose and at prices fixed by the government.        
	Officials said the new policy should be more flexible and, hence, more attractive to foreign investors.         
	We need foreign investment in the sector not only to raise the bidding amounts but also infuse the domestic sector with new technology and best practices.         
	New strategy        
	Under the twin-track approach, competitive bidding for proven reserves will be conducted in a manner similar to the current bidding process.         
	Unproven areas, on the other hand, will be given to any firm interested for a few years of initial survey without any profit-share commitments.         
	If the acreage is found to have proven reserves, bidding will follow. The entity which invested initially will have the first right of refusal of matching the top bidder. Other formats such as giving the acreage at a bid price similar to another acreage would also be considered.         
	The government also wants to set up a database of oil reserves, comprising new data as well as data from the blocks that have been awarded previously.        
	As part of this exercise, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons will conduct studies of sedimentary basins to categorise them under twin criteria: the depth of the basin and how prospective the basin is.        
	Investors will not only be able to assess the extent of reserves but also have an idea of drilling costs from the depth of a block. This data repository should have sufficient safeguards to protect proprietary information provided by operators.        
	Price issue        
	Officials said besides overhauling the bidding policy, they would recommend that the government gave up gas pricing altogether.         
	This job was assumed by the government on fears that the operators may underprice the gas and transfer it to related parties who would make a profit, without giving the government its rightful share, officials said. In reality, global gas prices are often higher than government prices.

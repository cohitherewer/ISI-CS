	New Delhi, Sept. 22: New telecom operators have witnessed an average growth of 23 per cent in subscriber base in August even as the government is considering a bailout for them.        
	STel, Videocon Telecom, Uninor, Loop Mobile, Etisalat DB and Sistema-Shyam are the new players who got licences in 2008.

	The new players have lined up huge investments. Uninor has planned a capex of Rs 12,000 crore over three years for pan-India operations; Videocon will spend Rs 14,000 crore in three years. We want to emerge as a third category of companies who are serious players with a long-term vision and staying capacity, said a senior executive of one of the new entities.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja had recently said the department of telecom was discussing a bailout for new operators that received the 2G licences in 2008 as some of them wanted to return the start-up spectrum.

	Bid to retain share        
	The operators are introducing innovative plans to retain their foothold in the highly competitive market.         
	Uninor is betting big on its pricing plan  it gives up to 60 per cent discount on calls. Uninors target is to secure an 8 per cent market share by 2018, said Glenn Mandelid, communications director with Telenor Group.        
	CDMA player Sistema-Shyam, which has launched the MTS brand, is keen on the mobile data segment to generate higher revenues.

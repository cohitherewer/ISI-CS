The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Calcutta ahead of others in job prospects
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Calcutta ahead of others in job prospects
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 14: Calcutta is projected to offer better job opportunities than most other cities.        
	In its latest study, international HR service provider Ma Foi Randstad said job potential in Calcutta would be moderately up in the coming months.        
	Prospects will be moderately down in Mumbai and significantly down in Delhi. Though Bangalore was moderately up, Hyderabad was given a strongly down tag.         
	A survey by global staffing firm TeamLease also placed Calcutta over Delhi and Mumbai in its employment outlook.        
	The net employment outlook index for Calcutta in January-March has increased 13 points from the October-December quarter last year. Delhi and Mumbai slipped by 24 and 10 points, respectively, for January-March 2010. Hyderabad, too, showed a decline of 22 points.        
	There are signs of revival in manufacturing and IT in Calcutta. However, business services remain down and media continues to remain adversely affected because of the slowdown, Ma Foi said in the study.         
	The overall projections for India are positive, in terms of hiring and salary hikes.        
	India will see nearly a million new jobs in 2010-11, says the Ma Foi study.        
	Hewitt Associates has forecast an average 10.6 per cent hike in Indian salaries in 2010. Pay packets grew 13.3 per cent and 15.1 per cent in 2008 and 2007, respectively. This comes at a time the Indian government expects the economy to expand 8.2 per cent in 2010-11 from an estimated 7.2 per cent in the current fiscal.        
	Infosys, the countrys second-largest software exporter, recently said it might offer increments next month. Energy, telecom, pharma and automotive are expected to offer the maximum hikes, in the range of 11.6 per cent to 12.8 per cent. Banking and financial services are expected to give a 10.5 per cent hike.        
	Indian companies are expected to outperform multi-nationals with an average increase of 11.4 per cent in salaries against 10.2 per cent by the foreigners.         
	The temporary job market is also likely to see an 18 per cent rise in hiring this year, while average hikes may stay in single digits, says a TeamLease study.        
	The TeamLease Annual Temp Salary Primer 2010 suggests that growth in hiring in most industries may impact increments with companies likely to give modest single-digit hikes.        
	Hiring numbers will be stepped up from the current 11-14 per cent to about 18 per cent over the first quarter of 2010 as new practices to gauge capabilities mature, it stated.         
	The Indian temp staffing market is fast maturing and employers are giving valuable skills due recognition and rewarding them as well. There is evidence that people retention and longevity was positively impacted by a fair distribution of salary increments in tandem with skill levels, TeamLease Services vice-president (temporary staffing) Rajesh A.R. said.        
	The Ma Foi study shows Indian workforce to be the most mobile across the globe. Mexico ranks second followed by China and Turkey in the third and fourth places, respectively.         
	According to the Ma Foi Randstand Work Monitor, the mobility index of Indian employees is the highest at 140. This means Indians are most open to switching their jobs over the next six months.

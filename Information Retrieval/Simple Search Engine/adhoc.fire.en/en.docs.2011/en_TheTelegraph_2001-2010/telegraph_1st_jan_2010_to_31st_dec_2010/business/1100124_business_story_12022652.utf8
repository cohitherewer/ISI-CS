The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Case for wider GST ambit
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Case for wider GST ambit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 23: Even as the Centre and the states wrestle over the contours and the timing of the contentious goods and services tax, an industry professional  Timir Baran Chatterjee  has suggested that the ambit of GST ought to be extended to cover real estate deals and works contracts.        
	Chatterjee, who has come out with a book on the subject  First discussion paper on goods and services tax in India with commentary, concept, issues, model and road map, reckons the architects of the GST plan are way too cautious about treading on toes while ushering in a new tax regime that seeks to eliminate price distortions across the country. These distortions arise because of the leeway given to the states to apply multifarious levies.        
	The draft paper setting out the roadmap for GST, says Chatterjee, has left out three key sectors: real estate, power and insurance. The discussion paper is also silent on important issues like works contract and stamp duty.        
	Chatterjee, senior executive vice-president (corporate affairs and legal) at DIC India Ltd, feels that the empowered committee of state finance ministers seems to have intentionally left out discussions on real estate, insurance, power, works contracts and stamp duty while drafting the first discussion paper on GST.        
	Stamp duty is a state subject and its rate varies from one state to another. For a long time, the Centre has been pushing for a uniform stamp duty to bring about transparency and proper reporting of real estate deals. At present, state value-added tax applies to supplies of real estate and rental of commercial properties is subjected to service tax.         
	Real estate industry, like all other sectors, will benefit immensely from the implementation of the proposed GST if real estate transactions are brought within the ambit of GST by subsuming stamp duty.         
	Similarly, levies such as taxes on vehicles, goods and passengers and duties on electricity should also be subsumed under the state GST, Chatterjee noted.

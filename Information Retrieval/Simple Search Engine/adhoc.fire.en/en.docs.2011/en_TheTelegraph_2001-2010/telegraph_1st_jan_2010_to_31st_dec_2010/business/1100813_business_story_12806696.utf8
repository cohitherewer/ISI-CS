The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SsangYong picks M amp;M
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SsangYong picks M amp;M
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anand Mahindra (right) with Pawan Goenka in Mumbai on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 12: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) has been chosen as the preferred bidder to acquire a majority stake in troubled South Korean auto maker SsangYong Motor Company (SYMC).         
	The Calcutta-based Pawan Ruia group  which was also in the race  may still have an outside chance as SsangYong named Raghav Industries, an investment company of the Ruias, as the second preferred bidder.        
	M amp;M is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in the next two weeks. It will then commence a due diligence process that is likely to be completed by October.        
	By November or December, we should start running the company (SYMC) and we do not expect any obstacles to complete the transaction, Pawan Goenka, president (automotive and farm Equipment), said here today.        
	Neither side disclosed the terms of the deal or the stake that was on offer. However, M amp;Ms senior management team led by vice-chairman and managing director Anand Mahindra said a part of the bid amount would be used to retire SYMCs long-term debt.        
	M amp;M will, thus, inherit a debt-free company. SsangYong had debts of around $640 million as of December 31 last year.        
	However, this does not mean that M amp;M will pay $640 million. Some of SsangYongs large debtors may have to settle for a haircut  which means they will recover only a portion of the debt.        
	While senior M amp;M officials did not comment on this aspect, reports say the Mahindras can offer between $400 million and $450 million to acquire a majority stake in SYMC.        
	M amp;M has surplus cash of over Rs 2,500 crore in its books with a low debt-equity ratio of 0.31:1. The company is confident of raising funds to finance the transaction even as it dips into its cash trove.        
	The announcement of the deal had a favourable impact on the M amp;M scrip, which closed Rs 5 higher at Rs 632.65 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Bharat Doshi, group CFO at M amp;M, did not rule out the possibility of the company even divesting a part of its stake in some of the subsidiaries at a later stage.         
	SsangYong brings with it a rich legacy of R amp;D and innovation. Mahindra and SsangYong will create synergy, which will make us significant global players, said Anand Mahindra.        
	The biggest gain for M amp;M is the strong complementarity in the products of the two companies. SsangYong also has a strong distribution network of 1,300 dealers across the world that will give M amp;M presence in emerging and growing markets.        
	M amp;M officials said once they took over the Korean auto maker, they would focus on product and brand development at SYMC. The Korean auto maker once had a 25 per cent market share in the SUV segment in that country which has since dwindled to about 15 per cent.         
	M amp;M also plans to launch some of SsangYongs models in India at a later stage.

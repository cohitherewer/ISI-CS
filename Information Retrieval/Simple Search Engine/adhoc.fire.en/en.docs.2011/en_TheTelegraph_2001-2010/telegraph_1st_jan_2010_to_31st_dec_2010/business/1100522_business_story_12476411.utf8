          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, May 21: Cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate ITC is planning to come out with a bonus issue after a gap of five years.         
	The Calcutta-based companys board will meet on June 18 to consider the offer. The company had last issued bonus shares in the ratio of 1:2 in September 2005.         
	Besides the bonus offer, the ITC management has proposed a dividend of Rs 10 per share of Re 1 each for 2009-10. The Rs 10 payout includes a special centenary dividend of Rs 5.50 per share.        
	The news perked up investor mood today and the ITC stock scaled a new 52-week high of Rs 274.30 before closing at Rs 270 on the NSE. The stock had opened a tad lower than the previous days close of Rs 262.40 and fell to Rs 257.35 during intra-day trade. However, the stock bounced back after the fourth-quarter financial results were declared. On the BSE, ITC was a top gainer with the share rising 3.41 per cent to close at Rs 271.50.        
	The company reported net sales of Rs 5,053.79 crore for the quarter ended March 2010 compared with Rs 3,950.32 crore in the same quarter last year. The reported sales figure was higher than the street estimate of Rs 4,500 crore, said an equity analyst with a leading brokerage.        
	The net profit of Rs 1,028.22 crore for the January-March quarter against Rs 808.99 crore in the year-ago period also beat market estimates.         
	The gross income increased despite a steep rise in excise duty on cigarettes. The excise duty liability for the company was Rs 2,105 crore in the fourth quarter of 2009-10, up from Rs 1,920 crore in the same period a year ago.        
	Net revenue from cigarettes grew to Rs 2,452.95 crore from Rs 2,070.06 crore in the year-ago quarter. Revenue from the FMCG segment, excluding cigarettes, increased to Rs 1,122.70 crore from Rs 836.79 crore on account of new brands such as Fiama Di Wills, Vivel Di Wills, Vivel and Superia in the personal care segment. Profit before tax from the FMCG business, including cigarettes, rose to Rs 1,172.53 crore from Rs 964.07 crore a year ago.        
	The hotels business remained sluggish. Profit declined to Rs 216.64 crore from Rs 316.10 crore in 2008-09. The agri and paper board businesses showed improvement both in revenue and profitability. The company has announced a book closure between June 11 and June 18 for the purpose of dividend.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rio Tinto, BHP scrap iron ore deal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Rio Tinto, BHP scrap iron ore deal
                              Albanese: Setback                            
	Melbourne, Oct. 18 (Reuters): BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have ditched plans to form the worlds biggest iron ore joint venture, in a victory for steel makers that could prompt both miners to step up competing expansions.        
	The announcement marked the second failed attempt in three years by BHP chief executive Marius Kloppers to buy into Rios superior iron ore assets and strengthens the hand of steel mills which feared the pair would gain too much pricing control.        
	Mondays news also left BHP focusing squarely on a $39-billion hostile bid for fertiliser group Potash Corp, no longer distracted by the $116-billion marriage of the two miners mammoth Australian iron ore operations.        
	The failure of the joint venture will be slightly more positive for Rio than BHP, but its important to remember its actually a negative for both companies, said Ben Lyons, an analyst at ATI Asset Management.        
	A venture between Rio and BHP, the worlds second and third largest iron ore miners, would have eclipsed Brazils Vale, the worlds largest supplier. The venture would have reaped more than $10 billion in savings from combining rail and port operations.                  Kloppers: Failed attempt      
	BHP and Rio Tinto had a fall-back option to share some iron ore infrastructure if the full joint venture failed, but this Plan Bis also in doubt, given the opposition that has emerged among competition regulators to the venture.        
	Analysts had estimated Plan B could yield at least half of the savings envisaged in the joint venture plan.        
	BHP and Rio Tinto will now have to review regulators objections to their venture to gauge whether even a more modest collaboration would be allowed, a source said.        
	The failure of the deal was widely expected after European regulators indicated they would block the deal, so the share price reaction was muted: BHP shares in London fell 1.4 per cent and Rio Tinto lost 1.9 per cent, compared with a 1.6 per cent loss in the British mining index on weak metals prices.         
	Goldman Sachs, Gresham Partners and Lazard will miss out on advisory fees from BHP, while Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Macquarie will miss out on fees from Rio Tinto.        
	Rio Tinto, led by CEO Tom Albanese, and BHP were recently advised that their proposal would not be approved by competition watchdogs in the European Union, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Germany.

	Calcutta, May 15: Ispat Industries today received shareholders nod to raise about Rs 700 crore through simultaneous but unlinked issues of a qualified institutional placement (QIP) and a preferential allotment to the promoters.        
	The preferential issue is likely to be priced at Rs 20.50, at a premium to the market price of around Rs 18. It will fetch Rs 230 crore.        
	The QIP issue, likely to be launched within a month, will raise up to Rs 500 crore.        
	The proceeds will be used to take up four projects to reduce cost of steel production that were on the drawing boards for years.         
	The company wants to set up a power plant, an iron ore pellet plant, a coke oven and develop an iron ore mine at a combined investment of Rs 1,700 crore.         
	Ispat chairman Pramod Mittal said the projects would improve the companys profitability margin once they were completed in two years.        
	The downturn had affected our cash flow, forcing a delay in executing the projects. But the situation has improved now, he said at an extraordinary general meeting in Calcutta today.        
	All the projects are being taken up through separate firms where Ispat will hold a minimum 26 per cent stake.        
	This arrangement will help the company cap its own equity contribution.         
	Moreover, Ispat can raise debt without further stretching the balance sheet. Owned by Pramod and brother Vinod, the company paid around Rs 1,000 crore interest in the last fiscal on a debt of Rs 7,000 crore.        
	The power plant will use waste gas. The coke oven and the pellet plants will help in reducing input cost on account of coking coal and iron ore, respectively.        
	Pramod Mittal, younger brother of Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, said Ispat had been granted iron ore, coking coal, dolomite and limestone mining rights.        
	Once production starts, the companys profitability will increase. Anil Sureka, finance director of Ispat, said the EBIDTA margin (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) would go up to 30 per cent from the present level of 20 per cent once all the projects were executed.        
	Production of limestone and dolomite should start in the next six months, while iron ore output should start by the middle of next year. Coal would take some time, he said.        
	Ispat hopes to get 40 per cent of captive power, 50 per cent of iron ore and 100 per cent of coke from captive sources.        
	Sureka said Ispat had decided to reduce the debt burden progressively. We want to return at least Rs 700 crore debt every year, he said.        
	Ispat has an accumulated loss of about Rs 1,800 crore. But it hopes to erase it the next two to three years.

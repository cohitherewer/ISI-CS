          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rao: Big plans                                  
	Calcutta, May 3: Sajjan Jindal plans to infuse nearly Rs 2,150 crore in flagship JSW Steel to cut debt and fund expansion, including a new plant in Bengal.        
	The companys board today approved the issue of 1.75 crore warrants to promoter group entity Sapphire Technologies Ltd, raising its holding in Indias largest private steel maker in capacity to 49.71 per cent from 45 per cent.        
	The development comes ahead of a possible stake sale to Japans JFE Steel, which may pick up to 14 per cent in the company.         
	The preferential allotment will limit the dilution of promoters holding if such a stake sale takes place.        
	The JSW Steel stock closed at Rs 1,221 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.        
	The company plans to undertake a Rs 7,000-crore expansion programme this fiscal.         
	The fund infusion will help to finance the capex and also cut debt, which stood at Rs 16,000 crore on a consolidated basis at the end of last fiscal.        
	Coking coal buy        
	JSW today announced that it would acquire a group of mines in West Virginia, US.         
	One of the mines is already operational, while the remaining two will be ready in 24 months, joint managing director Seshagiri Rao said in Mumbai.         
	The company plans to produce 1 million tonne of coking coal in the first year of operation and will ramp production up to 3 million tonnes by the third year. Coal prices are now at $95 a tonne, up 48 per cent from a year ago.        
	Profit show        
	The Sajjan Jindal company beat street expectations with a consolidated net profit of Rs 611 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2010 compared with a loss of Rs 39.9 crore in the same quarter a year ago.        
	Total income rose to Rs 5,577 crore for the quarter ended March 31 from Rs 3,719 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal.         
	The board has proposed a dividend of Rs 9.50 per share, or 95 per cent.

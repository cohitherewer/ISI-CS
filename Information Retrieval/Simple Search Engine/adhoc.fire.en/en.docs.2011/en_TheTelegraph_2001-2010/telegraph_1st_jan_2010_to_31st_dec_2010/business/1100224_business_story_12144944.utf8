          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Scotching fears                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: The government today said a decision on the rollback of stimulus measures would be taken only after a thorough review of the economic situation, and it would carry the fight against inflation into the next fiscal.        
	The decision on the rollback of fiscal stimulus measures, including the nature, space and sequence, would be based on the emerging economic situation and after careful consideration of the impact of the same on the recovery process, Namo Narain Meena, junior finance minister, said in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha.         
	Economists are speculating a partial withdrawal of the fiscal incentives  in the form of an increase in excise and service tax rates  in Fridays budget. Industry, too, is fearing the withdrawal of the stimulus measures.        
	The Indian situation has improved considerably since global recession brought down growth to 6.7 per cent in 2008-09. The growth rate, on the back of the stimulus measure, is forecast at 7.2 per cent for the fiscal and is expected to go up in the coming years.        
	However, the industry wants the stimulus package to continue. Commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma, too, said it would be a mistake to withdraw the fiscal stimulus to the labour-intensive sectors.        
	The stimulus measures have created a huge fiscal deficit, estimated at Rs 400,000 crore for this fiscal. Rating agency Moodys said it might upgrade India if the government came up with a road map for stimulus withdrawal and reduce the fiscal gap. On inflation, Meena said, the government is seized of the matter and has taken both fiscal and administrative measures to moderate price rise.         
	Steps taken include cutting import duties on rice, wheat, pulses, edible oils, maize, butter and ghee to zero; allowing import of raw sugar at zero duty up to 2010 end; banning export of non-basmati rice; and suspending futures trade in rice, urad and tur.         
	Several anti-inflationary measures will continue during 2010-11, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said in reply to another query in the Rajya Sabha.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Only for son
                                My son has taken a mediclaim policy covering our entire family, including myself, for which he pays about Rs 14,500 premium. Against his insurance policies, he pays about Rs 31,000 as premium. Can I take the benefit under Section 80C or under any other section of the Income Tax Act against the above premiums paid by my son for my income tax relief?          Anil Kumar Biswas, Calcutta
                    No, you cannot claim tax deduction for the premium paid by your son. Since your son is paying the premium, he can claim the tax deduction.                                  Scheme for seniors       I would like to know if an individual attaining the age of 60 years or more and spouse can separately open Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) accounts up to Rs 15 lakh each? Can they open joint accounts?        Dhruba Roy, Calcutta
                    If both are above 60 years, each one can open separate accounts in SCSS. Also, they can open separate joint accounts with the husband as the first holder in one account and the wife as the first holder in the other account. In each account, the maximum investment limit will be Rs 15 lakh.                                  Land logic      I purchased a piece of land in 1986 for Rs 7,999. In my balance sheet for 2009-10, it was valued at Rs 30,000. I sold the property for Rs 8,00,000 on March 10. What will be my long-term capital gains tax? How can I get exemption from long-term capital gains tax?        N. Choudhury, Chinsurah
                    To calculate your capital gains, first find out the cost inflation indices corresponding to the year of purchase and the year of sale of the property. The income tax department releases this index every financial year. The cost inflation multiplier for you will be determined by the index of the financial year in which the property was sold divided by the index of financial year in which it was bought. Multiply your cost of acquisition by this cost inflation multiplier. The difference between the sale price of the property and the inflation-adjusted cost price will be your long-term capital gains. By investing the amount in bonds of NHAI and REC, you can claim exemption from capital gains tax.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The country needs to take a fresh look at its export strategy as the process of global economic recovery is uncertain, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.         
	There are some concerns regarding the extent to which the recovery seen in November and December can be sustained in the coming months, given the uncertainty in the developed economies. We need to rethink our strategy and diversify our export markets to recover some of the growth momentum, Mukherjee said at Ficcis annual general meeting here.        
	The finance minister said the fall in exports during the slowdown might affect employment growth in the country.        
	In the budget, he proposed to extend the 2 per cent interest subvention for select exporters for one year till March 31, 2011.        
	I propose to extend the interest subvention of 2 per cent for one more year for exports covering handicrafts, carpets, handloom and small and medium enterprises, he said yesterday. The scheme was to expire on March 31 this year.        
	To insulate employment-oriented sectors such as handloom, handicrafts, carpets and leather from the impact of a demand slowdown, the government had extended the scheme for concessional export finance in the last budget till March 31 this year.        
	Though exports recovered in November 2009, consignments for the April-December 2009-10 period dropped 20.3 per cent to $117.58 billion over the year-ago period.         
	After falling for 13 straight months, exports grew 18.2 per cent in November 2009. Growth was 9.3 per cent in December 2009 and 11.5 per cent in January.        
	New Ficci chief        
	Rajan Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises, today took over as the president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.        
	Mittal, 50, succeeds Harsh Pati Singhania, managing director of JK Paper. An alumnus of Harvard Business School, Mittal oversees Bharti Enterprises at the corporate level. He is also involved in the groups new business ventures such as retail.

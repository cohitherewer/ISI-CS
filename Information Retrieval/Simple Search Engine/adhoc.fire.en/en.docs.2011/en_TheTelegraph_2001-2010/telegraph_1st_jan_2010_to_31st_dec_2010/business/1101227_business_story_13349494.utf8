The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | No tax for you
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      No tax for you
                                I am 70-years-old and my annual income from pension and other sources will be Rs 2.18 lakh in the financial year 2010-11. I shall get another Rs 2 lakh (approximately) from redemption of Ulip units. What will be my tax liability for assessment year 2011-12?          Tamal Kar, Hooghly
                    There will be no tax liability on your annual income of Rs 2.18 lakh as you are a senior citizen under the Income Tax rules. The basic exemption limit on the annual income of senior citizens is Rs 2.40 lakh for 2010-11 financial year. You shall not have to pay any tax on the maturity proceeds of the life insurance plan provided the sum assured in the plan is five times the annual premium you have paid. If you satisfy this condition, your income from Ulip redemption will also be tax-free.                                  Penalty pain      If any income tax assessee fails to submit his/her income tax return within the due date, does he/she have to pay any penalty? If any, how much?         Samar Choudhury, Behala
                    der Section 271F of the Income Tax Act, a penalty of Rs 5,000 can be levied in the case of non-filing of income return within the due date. However, if the assessee has to do tax audit, penalty can be levied under Section 271B at the rate of 0.5 per cent of total sales, or Rs 1,50,000, whichever is less, with effect from April 1, 2011.                                    Flat sale       I had purchased a two-bedroom flat in January 2007 for Rs 20 lakh. Now I want to sell it. I can get Rs 52 lakh from the sale of the flat, according to the present market rate. How much tax do I have to pay? I am a salaried person having an annual income of Rs 2,40,000.        Ranadiv Majumdar, Calcutta
                    The sale of the flat will attract long-term capital gains tax at a rate of 20 per cent. However, you may get the indexation benefit while calculating the gain.

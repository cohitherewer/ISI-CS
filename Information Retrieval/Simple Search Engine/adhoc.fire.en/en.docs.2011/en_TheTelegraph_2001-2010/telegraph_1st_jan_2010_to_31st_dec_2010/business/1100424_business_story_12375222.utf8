                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      R-Com weighs US tie-up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 23: Reliance Communications (R-Com) is set to form an alliance with US-based GetJar to create a mobile applications store offering over 50,000 choices.        
	The R-Com move is aimed at joining the likes of Airtel, Vodafone and handset makers Nokia, RIM (makers of BlackBerry) and Samsung to get a share of the mobile applications market in India.         
	R-Com will offer the GetJar apps store across GSM and CDMA networks through its R-World platform. Apps is the short form for applications.        
	Earlier this year, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Essar also launched their apps stores in a bid to replicate the highly successful business model of Apple, the pioneer in this space.         
	Aircel has also announced a tie-up with Infosys for its applications platform, an indicator that more operators are set to explore this market.         
	A spokesperson for R-Com has confirmed the companys alliance talks with GetJar.        
	GetJar is the worlds largest cross-platform apps store, which provides more than 50,000 applications across all major handsets and platforms to consumers in more than 200 countries.         
	Besides offering content directly to consumers, GetJar works with Sony Ericsson, Sprint, Opera, Vodafone, 3UK and Virgin Mobile. According to analysts, GetJar averages over one million downloads per day globally, posting over 300 per cent growth year-on-year.        
	For R-Com, the application store strategy is directly linked to an increase in data traffic and data plan adoption, and sale of other services through the use of free applications, an analyst said.        
	Mobile applications have been a rage globally ever since Apple launched its app store in 2008.         
	Apps are different from a traditional Web browser in that they allow users to access information without opening a site. For instance, if you want to get the latest news on sports, you need to just click on the icon and see them, rather than opening an Internet browser, typing in the site address and then getting the scores.

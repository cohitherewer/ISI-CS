The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | S Tel gets ready to roll out 3G
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      S Tel gets ready to roll out 3G
          SOUNAK MITRA                          Das: Planning ahead                                  
	Calcutta, July 18: S Tel, a joint venture between C. Sivasankarans Siva Group and Bahrain Telecom Company (Batelco), plans to launch 3G services during the second quarter of the next financial year.        
	We need not develop additional infrastructure for rolling out 3G. Our existing infrastructure for 2G can easily be used to provide 3G services. We are waiting for the spectrum to be allocated, S Tel CEO Shamik Das told The Telegraph.         
	The department of telecommunications is expected to allocate spectrum by the end of this year.        
	S Tel has bagged 3G spectrum in three states  Bihar, Orissa and Himachal Pradesh. The company is arranging an outlay of Rs 700 crore to roll out the services. The debt equity ratio for the capital expenditure lined up is 1:1, Das said. For the existing 2G operations, the company has announced an investment of Rs 2,000 crore.         
	S Tel is targeting the C circles, unlike other players who are focused on metros and tier-I cities.        
	According to Das, S Tel sees very good potential for 3G in India.         
	Data is going to be the key application in the Indian telecom arena in the next few years. Moreover, following the nature of the industry, the price war will remain in the 3G space as well. We believe 3G will be affordable in India from the first day, he said.        
	S Tel, which rolled out GSM services in Assam recently, plans to launch services in the Northeast next month. It is now present in Bihar, Orissa and Himachal Pradesh.         
	The company will start offering data services in the 2G and 2.5G platforms in a couple of months.        
	S Tel has tied up with various service providers, including R-Com, Bharti and Vodafone, for infrastructure.         
	The company claims to have over 1.5 million subscribers within 90 days of starting services in the three states. Affordable tariffs, quality service and efficient customer care has enabled S Tel to get the good response, Das said.

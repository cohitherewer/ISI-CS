	New Delhi, April 15: General Electrics (GE) energy arm and Indian engineering firm Triveni today announced a joint venture to design and manufacture steam turbines in India.        
	GE Triveni will design steam turbines in the 30-100 megawatts (mw) range. They will be sold in India and exported to overseas markets under the GE brand name.        
	There is a huge potential in the sub-100mw category and there are not many players. With the country emerging as a major manufacturing base, the growth potential is enormous, GE India president and CEO John Flannery said.         
	Our strategic alliance reflects GEs continued commitment to India and strengthens our local presence through technology transfer, he said.        
	Fernando Bertoni, general manager for business development (mergers and acquisitions), GE Oil amp; Gas, said the joint venture expected to clock an annual revenue of between $30 million and $50 million within the next two to three years.         
	It is a contract manufacturing agreement. The JV will source manufactured turbines from Trivenis Bangalore factory, Bertoni said.        
	GE will transfer technology and provide research and development support to the Bangalore unit.         
	Dhruv Sawhney, chairman of Triveni Engineering and Industries, said, The joint venture will be quite potent.         
	The firms did not disclose the financial terms, but Triveni said it would hold one extra share in the venture and both the partners would have equal board representation.        
	The deal is expected to be completed in the next few months subject to legal and regulatory approvals.

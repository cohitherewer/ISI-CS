                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Five more get bail, Raju still in jail
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rama Raju: Temporary relief                                  
	Hyderabad, July 20: Andhra Pradesh High Court today granted bail to B. Rama Raju, Vadlamani Srinivas and three other accused in the multi-crore Satyam accounting scam.        
	Rama Raju is the brother of Satyam Computer founder B. Ramalinga Raju, while Srinivas was the CFO of the company.         
	With todays development, only the prime accused, B. Ramalinga Raju, continues to be in jail in the scam that broke out in 2009.        
	The other three who got the bail are former employees G. Ramakrishna, Venkatapathi Raju and Srisailam.        
	Justice Raja Elango, who heard the bail petitions, observed that there was no prospect of the trial commencing in the near future and the accused need not languish in jail until then.         
	The high court, while granting bail, ordered the accused to report to the CBI investigation officer every day.        
	The special court set up for the case is yet to begin trial as Ramalinga Raju has been avoiding court proceedings citing health reasons.        
	Solicitor-general of India Gopal Subrahmaniam yesterday urged the court not to grant bail to any of the key accused as efforts were on to ensure that the trial was completed in the next six months.        
	However, the counsel for the accused, N. Natarajan, told the court that since the Supreme Court had granted bail to an auditor on the ground that more than one year had elapsed since the accused was jailed, the same privilege should be extended to his clients.        
	CBI DIG Lakshmi Narayana said they had contested the bail petition as the accused could tamper with evidence if set free.        
	Last month, the Andhra high court had granted bail to former Pricewaterhouse auditor S. Gopalakrishnan and former internal auditor Prabhakar Gupta.        
	In February, the Supreme Court had granted bail to another Pricewaterhouse auditor Srinivas Talluri. A city court, in March last year, granted anticipatory bail to B. Suryanarayana Raju, brother of Ramalinga Raju.        
	In January last year, Ramalinga Raju and nine others were arrested after Raju admitted to fudging the accounting books of the IT company.

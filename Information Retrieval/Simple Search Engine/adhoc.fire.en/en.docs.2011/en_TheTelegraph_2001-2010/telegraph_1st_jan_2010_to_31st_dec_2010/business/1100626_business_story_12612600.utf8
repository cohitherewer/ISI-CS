          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Close watch                                        
	Mumbai, June 25: Borrowers will have to brace for an increase in interest rates on loans with speculation mounting that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will shortly take some inflation-busting measures to quell the impact of the decision to raise the prices of petrol and other fuels.        
	The pundits expect a policy response from the central bank in the near term  and the only quibble is over its timing.        
	Some bankers and bond market mavens said they expected the RBI to raise short-term rates by 25 basis points in the next few days and follow that up with a similar rate hike on July 27 when it formally reviews the monetary policy.        
	Others expect the RBI to wait until next month before raising short-term rates by 50 basis points. The rate action is expected to nudge up the reverse repo  the policy rate that the central bank uses to suck liquidity out of the system against government securities. The reverse repo currently stands at 3.75 per cent.        
	Many expect the RBI to also raise the repo rate which now stands at 5.25 per cent. The repo is the window through which the RBI injects liquidity into the system. If the two policy rates rise, banks will raise the rates on their home and consumer loans.        
	Inflation is now hovering at 10.16 per cent. Observers say the fuel price hikes will see inflation staying close to the 11-per-cent-mark for the month of June and possibly breach this level in July.        
	The governments chief economic adviser Kaushik Basu said he expected inflation to go up by 0.9 percentage points in the short term. However, the hikes will result in lower fiscal and revenue deficits that will lower inflation in the next 6-9 months, he added.        
	Rohini Malkani, economist at Citi India, said in a note issued soon after the governments announcement: Given that the impacted fuels have a weight of 5.44 per cent in the wholesale price index (WPI), measures would impact inflation by around 100 basis points. This could result in inflation averaging around 8 per cent levels in 2010-11 from 7.4 per cent estimated earlier.         
	Malkani added that with the economy on the road to recovery, as reflected in industrial production gathering steam, non oil imports and bank credit posting a recovery coupled with inflation remaining sticky, a 75 basis points tightening in 2010 is expected. We expect the RBI to raise rates in the coming weeks, she added.        
	The banking system is now witnessing a tightness in liquidity because of advance tax outflows, and 3G and broadband wireless auctions payments. It is estimated that close to Rs 100,000 crore went out of the banking system during this month.        
	It is this tightness that has led to a contra view that the central bank is unlikely to raise policy rates in a hurry.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 16: Ispat Industries has brought in UK-based international steel trading group Stemcor as a strategic partner by offering up to a 10 per cent stake.        
	The Pramod and Vinod Mittal-owned Ispat will make a preferential allotment to the foreign partner at a deal valued at around Rs 250 crore.        
	The arrangement will bring in much needed cash into the company, which has underperformed vis--vis its peers Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Essar  the private integrated steel makers.        
	Stemcor has also firmed up investment in a million-tonne coke oven plant. It is talking to the Mittals to invest in pellet and power plants too.        
	Ispat informed the stock exchanges that Stemcor could also extend working capital of $75 million under an export securitisation programme.         
	Matthew G. Stock, director (Middle East and South Asia) of Stemcor, said it would take some more time to decide on how much stake it would pick up in Ispat.        
	The investment in coke oven is finalised. For the rest, discussions are on, Stock said, adding Stemcors participation would strengthen Ispats balance sheet.        
	Ispat has about Rs 7,000 crore debt; it paid around Rs 1,000 crore as interest last fiscal.        
	The company has also been unable to meet its interest payment obligations on time.        
	Ispat had been exploring the possibility of setting up coke oven, pellet and power plants for a few years, involving an investment of Rs 1,700 crore. All the projects are part of a backward integration exercise in terms of raw material and designed to improve profitability.        
	Stemcor itself is building a pellet plant in India and the project is nearing completion. Stock said his company could lend its expertise to Ispat in this regard.        
	Ispats 3-million-tonne pellet plant is slated to come up at their existing steel complex in Dolvi. The captive power plant, with 100-mega-watt capacity, is also going to come up there.        
	The Stemcor announcement came after market hours. The Ispat stock closed 2.87 per cent lower at Rs 20.30 a share on the BSE.        
	Ispat will be Stemcors second investment in an integrated steel project. It has picked up minority equity in Calcutta-based Electrosteel Steel Ltd, promoted by the Kejriwal family. Electrosteel is coming up with an initial public offer soon.

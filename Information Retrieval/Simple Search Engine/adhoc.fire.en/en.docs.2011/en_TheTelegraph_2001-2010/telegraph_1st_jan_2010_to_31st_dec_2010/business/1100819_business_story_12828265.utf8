The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | States seek more time to study GST draft
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      States seek more time to study GST draft
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dasgupta: Awaiting consensus                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax today hit a roadblock with the BJP-ruled states demanding one more month to study the draft constitutional amendment bill.         
	Some states have demanded more time to study the bill. Others are ready, said Asim Dasgupta, Bengal finance minister and chairman of the empowered committee of state finance ministers.         
	It was expected that diluting the veto power of the Centre, proposed in the earlier draft, would satisfy the BJP-ruled states and they would come on board.         
	The revised draft proposes that any decision on GST can be taken only if there is a complete consensus between the Centre and states.         
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee tried to allay fears and stressed that the GST council, which would take decisions by consensus, would not alter or disturb the primacy of state legislatures.         
	No tax can be levied except by the authority of law. The primacy of legislature in the area of taxation is supreme and the proposed draft did not seek to disturb or alter this. The decisions of the GST council would be recommendations to the Union and states. These decisions would be taken by consensus (between the states and the Centre), the minister said.         
	However, the BJP, which is co-operating with the Congress on another crucial legislation  Nuclear Liability Bill  is dragging its feet on the nation-wide tax regime.         
	The states got hardly two working days to examine the revised draft and take a decision, Madhya Pradesh finance minister Raghavji said at the meeting of the committee held here today.         
	I have been wondering about the rush to implement GST as if the country was passing through a severe financial crisis and GST was the panacea for all ills, Raghavji said.         
	Other finance ministers said this was merely a delaying tactic by the BJP-ruled states; they would eventually have to agree as the trader associations controlled by the BJP were in favour of GST.        
	The government had planned to introduce the bill in the last week of the monsoon session of Parliament to meet the deadline of April 1, 2011.        
	GST is a two-tier tax  a central rate and a uniform state rate  and will eliminate local indirect taxes such as central excise duty and state levies such as VAT, entertainment and luxury taxes.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kapil Sibal in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Communications minister Kapil Sibal today held talks with the Big 3 of the Indian telecom industry  Tata Tele promoter Ratan Tata, Reliance Communications owner Anil Ambani and Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal  to create a consensus on spectrum allocation and the action against firms that have failed to roll out services.         
	Sources said Sibal would hold similar talks with other telecom players to get their views on a wide range of issues concerning the sector. Its his way of building a consensus for his plans and getting feedbacks, officials said.         
	The three tycoons refused to divulge their talks with Sibal, who took charge of the ministry after the 2G spectrum scam forced A. Raja to resign. At stake now is a policy on the allocation of additional spectrum to operators. The government is considering moving away from subscriber-based criteria to decide on the allocation of extra spectrum.         
	The Centre also has to take a decision on cancelling the licences of firms that have not yet rolled out services and charging money for excess spectrum allotted to a few firms.         
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has asked the government to charge additional spectrum beyond 6.2MHz at the rate at which 3G radio waves were auctioned.        
	These issues have divided the telecom industry with firms lobbying for and against such an action. Officials said Sibal wanted to take an even-handed action and, therefore, was keen on consultation before arriving at a decision.         
	The minister also wanted inputs for drafting a comprehensive telecom policy, an official said, adding that the ministry believed that the previous policy set out in 1999 by the BJP-led government was flawed and had led to the current mess.        
	The meetings come in the wake of the telecom ministry issuing notices to firms that have failed to comply with rollout norms. The firms have 60 days to respond.

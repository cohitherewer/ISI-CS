          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Mamata Banerjee has decided to take on road-transport operators. Didis budget today proposed investments in high-capacity wagons to wean away traffic from roads, details of which will be notified shortly. Roads currently handle 80 per cent of goods traffic.        
	Mamata today kept freight rates intact in her budget and lowered them by Rs 100 per wagon for foodgrain and kerosene.        
	Though the rates are unchanged, the railways expects to earn 6.42 per cent more from the transport of goods in the next fiscal on the back of higher volumes.        
	Indian Railways had freight to thank for in this fiscal  had freight earnings not grown more than last years estimates, the railways surplus would have fallen short of its target by a greater amount than the current estimate of Rs 60 crore.        
	Freight earnings for 2010-11 are seen at Rs 62,489 crore, while volumes are expected to go up to 944 million tonnes (mt) from 890mt in this fiscal.        
	Earnings from coal, the biggest revenue generator of freight traffic, are projected to be Rs 24,319.56 crore in the next fiscal, up from Rs 22,577.69 crore expected over this fiscal.         
	Iron ore export and pig iron and finished steel will generate Rs 8,911.29 crore and Rs 3,645.19 crore during 2010-11, up from Rs 8,425.52 crore and Rs 3,349.37 crore, respectively, in the current fiscal. Banerjee said a policy to permit private operators to invest in infrastructure, on the lines of the container train operators, would be made soon.         
	The policy would allow private operators to run special trains for goods such as automobiles, vegetable oil and petro-chemicals, and bulk traffic such as fly-ash.        
	As part of her strategy of having large logistics hubs, Mamata said she would set up automobile and ancillary hubs at 10 locations. One such hub was set up last year at Shalimar near Howrah.        
	More than 20 lakh vehicles are manufactured in India every year; most of these are transported from production sites to cities by road. Only two per cent of vehicle transportation is carried out by the railways.

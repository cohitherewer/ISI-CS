          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 2: The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister wants the government to raise taxes or cut spending to correct the high level of fiscal deficit.        
	Fiscal deficit will remain a challenge in the coming years. Debt today is taxes tomorrow, Govinda Rao, a member of the council, said.        
	The deficit, which was projected to fall below 3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008-09, according to the fiscal responsibility and budget management act, grew to 6.2 per cent on high government expenditure and tax cuts undertaken to soften the impact of the global financial crisis.        
	The budget for 2010-11 has projected a fiscal deficit of 6.7 per cent of GDP for 2009-10 and 5.5 per cent for the next fiscal.         
	The government has set a target to bring down the deficit to 4.8 per cent in 2011-12 and 4.1 per cent in 2012-13.         
	So, you will have to work it back. You need to either increase revenues or cut down expenditure. Then you will have to decide which expenditure to cut and which taxes to raise. Now, isnt that a challenge? Rao said.        
	According to the 13th Finance Commission, the overall debt to GDP ratio should be reduced to 68 per cent. It has also suggested separate targets for the Centre and states.        
	Rao said the low level of infrastructure spending continued to be a cause for concern. The growth prospect of the Indian economy depends on infrastructure spending, which is possible only when the unproductive component of revenue expenditures is reduced.        
	According to official data, fiscal deficit for April-January 2010 soared 34 per cent to Rs 3.5 lakh crore against Rs 2.62 lakh crore a year ago mainly on account of the stimulus measures by the government to prop up the economy hit by the global financial crisis.        
	Therefore, for the first nine months of the current financial year, the deficit stands at 87.2 per cent of the budgeted estimate of Rs 4.01 lakh crore for this fiscal.         
	The government had initiated massive spending programmes and slashed duties from December 2008 in three stages following the global financial crisis to spur economic activities.

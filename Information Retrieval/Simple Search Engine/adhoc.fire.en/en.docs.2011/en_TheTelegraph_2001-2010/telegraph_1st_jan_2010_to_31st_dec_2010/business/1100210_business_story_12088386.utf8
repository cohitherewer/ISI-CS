The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Paucity of rakes hits Coal India
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Paucity of rakes hits Coal India
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Partha Bhattacharyya in Calcutta on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 9: Three of Coal Indias subsidiaries are saddled with 33 million tonnes of stocks at the pit-heads because of the shortage of rail rakes, Coal India chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya said.         
	CILs three subsidiaries  Bharat Coking Coal, Mahanadi Coalfields and Central Coalfields  are the worst hit as they have stockpiled 33mt of coal that cannot be despatched because of the non-availability of enough rail rakes, Bhattacharyya said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	The three subsidiaries need 210 rakes a day for despatch. Instead, we are getting 165-170 rakes a day, Bhattacharyya said.        
	Coal India Limited (CIL) has already revised its production target for 2010-11, the penultimate year of the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12), to 486mt from 520mt because of delays in getting forest and environment clearances for as many as 17 projects that are estimated to produce 101mt.        
	There is already a production shortfall of 54mt and we can at best make up for 20mt by improving production at some of our existing mines. This will leave us with a shortfall of 34mt, the CIL chairman said.        
	He also said the problem of coal evacuation from the mines could affect the production target for the current fiscal. CIL has set a target to produce 435mt of coal in 2009-10.        
	The CIL top brass would meet market regulator Sebi on February 19 for its proposed initial public offering of equity shares.         
	Well get to have a clear road map for the proposed IPO only after the meeting, Bhattacharyya said.         
	However, he said, CIL would like to complete the process within this calendar year itself.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 14: Any rate hike by the RBI in its forthcoming policy review is likely to increase the flow of foreign funds, which will raise the rupee value vis--vis the dollar and hurt exporters, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).        
	If the RBI tightens monetary policy, there is a risk of a further surge in these (foreign) flows, which will be attracted to higher yields. Indian equity and debt markets have been particularly susceptible to such surges even in the past, when the exchange rate has appreciated substantially in the face of such inflows, CIIs director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said.        
	He said the rupee appreciation had affected the competitiveness of Indian products, especially when the Chinese currency remains pegged to the dollar. The RBI should intervene in the currency markets to stem any further appreciation in the rupee.         
	The rupee has gained 12.2 per cent in the past year against the dollar and climbed to a 19-month high last week. The Indian currency closed at 44.49 to the dollar, 60.46 to the euro and 47.82 to 100 yen yesterday.        
	The RBI is estimated to have bought $300-500 million last week. The central banks intervention, analysts said, was aimed at smoothing the rupee-dollar volatility and not pegging the rupee to any specific level.         
	However, exporters are looking at a more stable exchange rate as volatility erodes their profit margins and enhances their risks.        
	The FIIs are making short-term profits. There is a need to regulate their investment. The government can contemplate providing a fixed rate of exchange for exports on an optional basis, A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Exports Organisations, said.        
	Banerjee said the current environment of easy liquidity in global markets, resulting from exceptionally low interest rates being maintained by major central banks, had led to large inflows into emerging markets such as India.        
	Dollar depreciation results in lower margins for exporters because they realise less value for the foreign exchange in terms of the rupee. Almost 70 per cent of Indias foreign trade are dollar denominated.        
	After a 13-month decline since October 2008, exporters managed to return to growth from November 2009 as the world economy started recovering from the worst recession of the last six decades.

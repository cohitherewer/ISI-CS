The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | DoT to cross-check rollout
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      DoT to cross-check rollout
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 21 (PTI): The telecom ministry has asked its internal wing to conduct field survey on each operator before issuing showcause notices to them for failing to meet the rollout deadline.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has recommended that 69 licences, allocated in 2008, should be cancelled as the operators failed to roll out services.        
	According to official sources, the department of telecom (DoT) has asked its telecom enforcement resource monitoring cell to collect data after conducting field surveys on each operator and submit the report.        
	This, the officials said, is done by the DoT on its own from time to time to ensure that the rollout of services takes place according to licence terms and conditions for effective utilisation of spectrum.        
	Trai had last week submitted suo moto recommendations, asking the government to cancel 69 licences of six operators, including Etisalat, Uninor and Videocon, as they had failed to meet the rollout norms. The licences were issued in January 2008 by former telecom minister A. Raja.        
	For another 53 licences, the regulator proposed a penalty for partially meeting rollout obligations. In all, the regulator probed 127 licences given by the telecom department.         
	On whether the DoT may initiate action to cancel the licences, officials said cancellation may not be a viable solution as this would cause hardship to customers. New telecom minister Kapil Sibal might decide on the matter soon.        
	The regulator had recommended that licences be cancelled in at least 15 circles given to Etisalat, a company earlier known as Swan Telecom that the CAG had dubbed as a front company of the Anil Ambani group, and 10 circles given to Sistema-Shyam.        
	Sistema-Shyam, a joint venture between the Shyam group and Russias Sistema, has claimed that they have rolled out services in all the 22 circles with seven million subscribers in its fold.        
	Uninor, a joint venture between Unitech and Telenor of Norway, has rolled out services in 12 circles and was in the process of starting services in others.        
	Trai, which had recommended penalty for non-compliance, said the amount could be huge.         
	So, we had suggested that these licences should be cancelled. This will vacate an enormous amount of spectrum and this can be given to companies that are serious about meeting the schedule, the Trai report has said.        
	According to the licence conditions, the licensees are required to roll out services in 90 per cent service areas in metros and 10 per cent district headquarters in other service areas within 12 months from the date of award of the permit.

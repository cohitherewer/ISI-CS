          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 13: Tata Metaliks Ltd has reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 0.41 crore for the second quarter on account of losses suffered by subsidiary Tata Metaliks Kubota Pipes Ltd (TMKPL).        
	The company, which makes pig iron, had earned a profit of Rs 10.65 crore in the same period last year.        
	Net sales stood at Rs 325.73 crore in the second quarter compared with Rs 268.85 crore a year ago.        
	However, on a standalone basis, Tata Metaliks recorded a profit of Rs 5.29 crore compared with Rs 15.97 crore in the same period last year.        
	Turnover on a standalone basis was at Rs 324.14 crore against Rs 269.74 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Company officials attributed the second-quarter loss to TMKPL, which almost remained non-functional in the absence of a licence from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).        
	According to a notification by the department of industrial policy and promotion, a BIS certification is mandatory for making ductile iron pipes, used mostly by civic bodies for water distribution.        
	TMKPL received the certification a couple of weeks back.         
	It will compete with Electrosteel and Jindal Saw in the domestic market.        
	The ductile iron pipe plant, built in collaboration with Kubota of Japan, is located in Kharagpur along with a pig iron plant.        
	Castrol show        
	Lubricant maker Castrol India Ltd recorded a 13.4 per cent increase in net sales at Rs 640.9 crore, while profit after tax grew 22.3 per cent to Rs 116.9 crore.         
	Naveen Kshatriya, vice-chairman of Castrol India, said, The company has seen a sharp increase in its raw material prices driven by rising base oil and other input costs. Despite this, the company has continued to grow margins through a combination of premium product mix and strategic pricing actions.        
	Castrol said it expected the economy to maintain the growth momentum with a good monsoon. However, growth could be impacted by high inflation and a hike in interest rates.         
	With crude at around $85 a barrel, the company expects raw material prices to remain high.        
	Castrol said Sujit Vaidya would be directorfinance from November 16.         
	At present, he is additional director.

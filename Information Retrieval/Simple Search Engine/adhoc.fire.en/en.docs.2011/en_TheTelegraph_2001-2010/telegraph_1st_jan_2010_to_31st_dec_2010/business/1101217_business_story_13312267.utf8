The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Apex bank injects liquidity
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Apex bank injects liquidity
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 16: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today left key policy rates unchanged and pumped Rs 48,000 crore into the financial system to overcome a worsening liquidity crunch through bond buybacks.         
	At the same time, the central bank trimmed the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) by 1 percentage point to 24 per cent. The SLR is a ratio of deposits that the banks must hold in the form of government securities.        
	The RBI, however, struck a hawkish tone on inflation when it said that there was an upward risk to its inflation estimate of 5.5 per cent by March 2011, an indication that interest rates could be raised in January when the central bank announces its quarterly review of monetary policy.        
	In its mid-quarter monetary policy review, the central bank left the repo rate and the reverse repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent and 5.25 per cent, respectively.        
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides liquidity to banks against securities. The reverse repo is the rate at which it mops up cash from banks.        
	Since the status quo on the key rates was widely anticipated, bankers had focused their attention on the measures that the apex bank would announce to ease the severe liquidity strain that the banking system now faces.        
	The move to bring down the SLR to 24 per cent will release some cash (as banks will not have to invest this portion in buying securities). Banks see this as a positive measure since it is being flagged as a permanent measure.         
	The RBI also announced that it would conduct open market operation (OMO) auctions to purchase government securities for an aggregate amount of Rs 48,000 crore in the next one month.        
	In an open market operation auction, the central bank purchases government securities from banks, thereby releasing liquidity into the system.        
	The RBI explained that the current liquidity deficit had been because of the persistence of large government cash balances that had averaged Rs 84,000 crore since its second quarter review in November and also because of certain structural factors such as the relatively sluggish growth in bank deposits.        
	On inflation, the mid-quarter monetary policy review said that though it had moderated, it remained significantly above the comfort level. There were also risks to inflation on the upside both from domestic demand and higher global commodity prices.         
	Banking industry experts felt that the RBIs comments on inflation pointed towards a rate hike in January.         
	The hawkish language on inflation suggests that the RBI remains concerned about the level of inflation. We think the central bank will hike policy rates in the January policy meeting by 25 basis points and overall hike policy rates by 100 basis points in 2011, Tushar Poddar, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a note.        
	Abhijit Majumder, senior research analyst at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher, said liquidity measures were likely to be marginally positive for banks.        
	The RBIs announcements were well received by the stock markets as well with the benchmark sensex rising 217 points even as bank stocks gained in the hope that they would be able to retain their margins.

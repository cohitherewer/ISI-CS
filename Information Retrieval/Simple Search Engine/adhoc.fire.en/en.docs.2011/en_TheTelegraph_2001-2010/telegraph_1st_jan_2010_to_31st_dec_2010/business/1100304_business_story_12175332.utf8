          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Power punch                                  
	New Delhi, March 3: State-owned Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) will allot shares in its follow-on public offer at Rs 206 apiece to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), which include foreign institutional investors and mutual funds.        
	The power financing firm has fixed the clearing price for qualified institutional investors at Rs 206 a share and for the companys employees at Rs 193 apiece.        
	REC had hit the market with its public issue of 17.17 crore shares at a floor price of Rs 203. The company will allot shares to non-institutional and retail individual buyers at the floor price.        
	The Rs 3,529-crore follow-on offer was open for subscription between February 19 and February 23.        
	The float was subscribed 3.12 times on good demand from institutional investors, though retail investors were not very enthusiastic.        
	The public issue constitutes a 17.39 per cent stake in the company.        
	Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, ICICI Securities, JM Financial and RBS Equities (India) are the book running lead managers to the issue.        
	NMDC float        
	The government today said the follow-on public offer of state-owned NMDC would open on March 10, and the issue price would be decided by an empowered group of ministers next week.        
	The NMDC issue (is) to open on March 10. We are going through a book-building process now. A final decision on the issue price is to be taken on March 8, steel secretary Atul Chaturvedi said on the sidelines of an All India Induction Furnace Association meet.        
	The countrys largest iron ore producer is entering the capital market with an FPO of over 33 crore equity shares with a face value of Re 1 each.        
	Sources said the government could fix a price band of Rs 415-430 a share and not opt for the auction route adopted in the case of NTPC and REC.        
	At the prevailing market price, the NMDC issue could fetch around Rs 15,000 crore, and the price band could be around Rs 415-430 to attract more investors.

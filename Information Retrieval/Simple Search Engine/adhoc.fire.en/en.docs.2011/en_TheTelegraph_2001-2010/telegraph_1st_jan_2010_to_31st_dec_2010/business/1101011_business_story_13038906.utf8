                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Penalty count
                                If a personal income taxpayer fails to file his/her income return within the due date as prescribed under Section 139(1) of the Income Tax Act, what will be the penalty?           Samir Chakraborty, Hooghly
                      Under Section 271F of the Income Tax Act, a penalty of Rs 5,000 can be levied in case of non-filing of income return within the due date. However, if the assessee is covered under section 44AB, that is, if the assessee has to do tax audit, penalty can be levied under Section 271B, which is 0.5 per cent of total sales, or Rs 1,50,000 with effect from April 2011, whichever is less.                                      Car on sale      I have a car worth Rs 10 lakh. I want to transfer the same for Rs 8 lakh to my company. Can I claim the loss on sale of the car in my personal income account?         Tanmoy Das, Calcutta
                    A vehicle used for personal purpose does not qualify as capital asset. Hence, neither the gain on sale is taxed nor the loss can be claimed as deduction or carried forward.                                  Money matters      I had purchased a two-bedroom flat in January 2007 for Rs 20 lakh. Now I want to sell it. I can get Rs 52 lakh from the sale of the flat according to the present market rate. I want to use the full amount received from the sale of my flat for my business. How much income tax do I have to pay to use this full amount for my business? I am a salaried person having an annual income of Rs 2,40,000.        Rajiv Agarwal, Calcutta
                    The sale of the flat will attract long-term capital gains tax at a flat rate of 20 per cent. However, you may get the indexation benefit while calculating the gain. But you will not be eligible to get tax exemption on the capital gains because you are going to invest the money in business.

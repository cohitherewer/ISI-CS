                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cocoberry to expand menu
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, May 29: Flavoured yoghurt maker Cocoberry plans to include salads, soups, smoothies and tofu burgers on its menu to get a better taste of the Rs 10,000-crore health food market.        
	The Delhi-based dessert brand will open 40 more outlets by March next year to cover major metros and tier 1 cities, including Ludhiana, Bangalore, Jaipur, Pune, and Chennai. Cocoberry also has plans to go to Calcutta in the next phase of expansion.         
	The company, which currently has over 11 outlets in Delhi-NCR and Mumbai, is keen to establish itself as a healthy fast-food brand.        
	There is an increased demand for health food among the young working professionals and college students. Our expanded food menu is expected to offer them a quick-yet-healthy all day dining experience, G.S. Bhalla, managing director of Cocoberry, told The Telegraph.        
	He expects the new food menu to contribute around 15-20 per cent to the overall revenues next year. For the young busy professional, yoghurt sometimes acts as a substitute for lunch. We want to provide a wider and healthier choice for those discerning customers, added Bhalla.

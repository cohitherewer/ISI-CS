          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The industry ministry has proposed scrapping the requirement of a no objection certificate from the local partner of a foreign company for joint ventures prior to January 12, 2005 when the foreign firm wants to set up a separate subsidiary in the same line of business.        
	The discussion paper of the ministry has also suggested two alternatives: the government could consider scrapping this rule for ventures which were more than 10 years old or for fresh ventures by foreign investors which were demonstrably different from activity of existing tie-up.        
	Officials said the alternative proposals had been put up as they expected the main proposal to be blocked by Indian business chambers. Press Note 1 issued in 2005, a modified version of an earlier press note, had made no-objection certificate mandatory for joint ventures prior to January 12, 2005.         
	However, the clause is not for joint ventures set up after January 12, 2005. The ministry has invited comments from stakeholders by October 15.        
	Indian firms have long been arguing the necessity of the no-objection certificate; otherwise foreign partners will simply walk out of tie-ups and set up their own units possessing greater technological capabilities. Not only will the new units give unfair competition but also technology dry up for the old joint venture.        
	Hero Honda is often cited as a case. Japans Honda first set up a rival scooter and motorcycle unit, after getting a no-objection certificate from the Munjals, and then restricted technology to Hero Honda.        
	Officials pointed out that strict interpretation of Press Note 1 creates investment hurdles. Competition today is not only between domestic players inter-se but also between international and domestic players. If an industry is discouraged from being set up in India, it could be set up in a neighbouring country, with whom a trade agreement exists or is being negotiated, the discussion paper said.        
	The concept paper said that the existing measure discriminated between investors who had shown confidence in India, by investing in the country prior to 2005, and those who invested later.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel ministry against expensive acquisition
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Steel ministry against expensive acquisition

	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The steel ministry is not in favour of ICVL splurging cash to buy Riversdale Mining Ltd.        
	International Coal Ventures Ltd (ICVL) is a consortium of five Indian state-run companies  Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), Coal India, NTPC, RINL and NMDC.        
	Top sources said an offer of over Rs 17,500 crore needed to match Rio Tintos Aus $3.9-billion bid could perhaps not be supported.         
	The steel ministry controls two of the four firms which are promoters of ICVL.         
	Riversdales assets include Benga and Zambeze projects in Mozambique, which have high-quality coking coal reserves and can provide raw material to SAIL.        
	The government has cleared an investment of Rs 6,000 crore for mine purchases by ICVL, and the company can leverage more debt.         
	However, the government feels the joint venture should explore cheaper buys instead of spending a huge amount in buying one company.         
	Once you buy stake at such a huge price in a mining firm, you are expected to be a big spender whenever you bid again. We do not have that deep pockets. We need to be more strategic and choosy about our spending plans, officials said.        
	The Tatas, who hold a strategic stake in Riversdale, yesterday abstained from voting on Rio Tintos bid for a 14.9 per cent equity stake in the Sydney-based firm, indicating that they might act in the interests of ICVL.        
	However, this may not be enough to comfort ICVL, which yesterday appointed Citigroup to do a due diligence of Riversdale.         
	An expensive acquisition will not only make ICVL highly leveraged but also increase the debt stock of the promoter firms, which have lined up their own capacity expansion plans.         
	SAIL, for instance, will spend around Rs 70,000 crore over a five-year period to ratchet up its capacity to 23 million tonnes, besides setting up plants in Indonesia and South Africa. The firm can be moving towards a debt trap, like it had faced in the 1990s, if it stretches its finances beyond a limit.         
	Indian companies have been seeking stakes or full control in coal mines overseas to ensure raw material supplies for producing steel and electricity.         
	The coal in India has high ash content that generates less heat than high-grade coal available in China, Indonesia, Australia and Africa.        
	SAIL, for instance, buys around 70 per cent of its coal from abroad. NTPC also buys high-grade thermal coal and mixes it with local coal.         
	ICVL is believed to be close to buying other mines in Mozambique and in Indonesia for which it has appointed RITES as a consultant to prepare the feasibility report on setting up the necessary infrastructure for transporting coal mined by ICVL.        
	Rio, which wants access to Riversdales coking coal deposits in Mozambique, raised its offer to Aus $16 per share cash on Thursday from an earlier indicative bid of Aus $15.

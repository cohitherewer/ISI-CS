The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mobile broadband tech set for big leap 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mobile broadband tech set for big leap 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Speeding ahead                                  
	New Delhi, July 4: Mobile broadband service providers are veering towards fourth generation long-term evolution (LTE) technology that allows more data to be transferred compared with 3G and at higher speeds.         
	Sweden-based Ericsson has successfully conducted the first trial of LTE in India in the 2.3 GHz band.         
	Ericsson said LTE would revolutionise Indian wireless broadband access, providing a wider audience for the Internet.         
	This (LTE) trial gives a glimpse of what the future can offer our customers in the mobile broadband space. LTE will transform the mobile-broadband user experience, providing high data speed needed for services such as Internet TV, mobile video-blogging, online video games and the mobile office-environment, said Gowton Achaibar, head of Ericsson India.        
	Reliance Industries-backed Infotel, the only operator to get a pan-India wireless broadband licence, has announced it was banking on LTE.         
	US-based chip maker Qualcomm, which has won broadband spectrum in Mumbai and Delhi, is also rolling out an LTE-based network.         
	According to analysts, Bharti and Aircel are also likely to move to LTE.         
	Compared with a speed of 3 megabits per second (Mbps) in 3G services, LTE can offer speeds up to 10Mbps. It will help service providers to transfer more data and lower the cost of running their network. LTE allows operators to introduce services such as HD (high definition) video, media mobility and online gaming.        
	According to industry data, of the estimated 3.4 billion who will have broadband by 2014, about 80 per cent will be mobile broadband subscribers and the majority will be served by high speed packet access and LTE networks.        
	The government has recently earned Rs 38,543 crore from the sale of 20 megahertz of broadband airwaves for 2 slots in each of the 22 telecom circles in the country.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, has also started a consultation process for 4G and is expected to send its recommendations to the department of telecom soon.

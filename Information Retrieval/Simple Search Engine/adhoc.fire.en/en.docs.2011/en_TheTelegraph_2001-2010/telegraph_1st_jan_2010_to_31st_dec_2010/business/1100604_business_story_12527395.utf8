          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 3: The government plans to set up an independent safety body to probe major accidents, including air mishaps.        
	The government is considering establishing an independent safety board on the lines of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.         
	The NTSB investigates all major accidents in the US, including air crashes as well as accidents at sea and on highways. It also assists other countries. After the Mangalore air crash on May 22, the NTSB had sent a team to India.         
	Patel said the government would try to bring suitable legislation to empower the directorate-general of civil aviation (DGCA).         
	The government will definitely consider granting full autonomy to the DGCA and empower it to independently carry out its work as a regulator of Indian aviation.         
	Several ministries as well as the Planning Commission are keen on a regulator with more powers covering all aspects of aviation.        
	We have had a tragic accident. We should not be found lacking on any front. We will do everything necessary to ensure an orderly growth of aviation in the country. The expectations are very high as the sector is growing, Patel said after the first meeting of the Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Council.         
	The 28-member body, which is headed by director- general of civil aviation S.N.A. Zaidi, was set up by the government a week after the Mangalore tragedy to recommend best regulatory practices in operations and other measures to beef up safety.         
	However, the council, which can only give suggestions to the DGCA, will not have the right to take decisions or implement changes.

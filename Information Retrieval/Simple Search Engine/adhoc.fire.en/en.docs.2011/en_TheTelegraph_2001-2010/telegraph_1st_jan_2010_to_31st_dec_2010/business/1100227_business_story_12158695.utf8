	New star hotels get funds-linked sop        
	NEW DELHI: The hotel industry today got a booster from the budget, which proposed to allow companies setting up hotels of two-star category and above to claim investment-linked deduction under income tax from April 1, 2010. However, the industry did not appear very satisfied. It is only a small relief for the industry; more could have been done. The industry has been reeling under the pressure of the global economic slowdown. I am afraid most of our demands have not been met, Rajinder Kumar, president of the Federation of Hotels amp; Restaurants Association of India, told The Telegraph.   
	Durables to cost more  
	NEW DELHI: Customers will have to brace for a sharp rise in the prices of consumer durable items such as television, refrigerator, air-conditioner and washing machine as a result of the 2 per cent across-the-board rise in excise duties. However, prices of microwaves may come down since the duty on them has been halved to 5 per cent from 10 per cent. 
    Limited prop for tea
    
	CALCUTTA: The budget has not offered any direct aid to the tea sector but has 
  offered indirect sops to the industry at large. The extension of concessional import duty on imported plantation machinery such as tea bagging machines will help the industry in value adding and hiking exports. The relief has been extended till March 31, 2011 from July 31, 2010. ldquo;There is no mention of tea in the budget speech this year. But the import duty extension is certainly good for the tea industry at large. This will help tea companies upgrade and improve the overall tea quality. He also mentioned that modernisation of this labour-intensive sector is yet to reach the expected level, which is why he has taken the step, rdquo; Aditya Khaitan, managing director of Mcleod Russel India, and chairman of the Indian Tea Association (ITA), told The Telegraph.
    
	Tirupur treat
    
	NEW DELHI: The government today   proposed a one-time grant of Rs 200 crore for setting up an effluent treatment plant to check environmental pollution at textile export hub, Tirupur. The Centre has also proposed to marginally hike the allocation of the textile ministry to Rs 4,527 crore for the next fiscal from Rs 4,500 crore. The allocation for the handicraft industry has been proposed at Rs 319.25 crore against Rs 273.95 crore.

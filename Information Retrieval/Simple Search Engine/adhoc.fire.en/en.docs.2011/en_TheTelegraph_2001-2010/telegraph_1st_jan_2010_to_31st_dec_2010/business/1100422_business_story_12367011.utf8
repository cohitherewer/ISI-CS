          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 21: HCL Technologies third-quarter net profit rose 72 per cent to Rs 262.57 crore from Rs 152.57 crore in the same period last year.        
	Total income rose to Rs 1,287.11 crore from Rs 1,048.90 crore in the year-ago period under Indian accounting norms.         
	New outsourcing orders and a narrower foreign exchange loss have contributed to the good performance.        
	The new post-recession era will be marked by transformational changes in the world of business. I believe HCL is uniquely positioned to be at the forefront and succeed in the emergent era, Shiv Nadar, chairman and chief strategy officer of HCL Technologies, said.         
	During the quarter, HCL Technologies added 7,136 employees, taking its total headcount to 58,129.         
	Infotech Enterprises        
	Hyderabad-based Infotech Enterprises hopes to acquire at least one overseas firm during the current quarter. The company is looking for buyouts in Europe and the US.         
	We are at various stages of discussions with possible target firms, chairman B.V.R. Mohan Reddy told The Telegraph.         
	The acquisitions will be in the engineering and geospatial information services only, he said. The company has reported a cash reserve of Rs 383.6 crore at the end of 2009-10. The cash balance in books needs to be deployed to tap right opportunities at the right moment, Reddy said. The firm may opt for bank debts to fund acquisitions.         
	Reddy said the company would hire about 1,400 professionals across its five facilities in India.

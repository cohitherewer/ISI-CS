	Calcutta, April 10: State-run Corporation Bank plans to reduce government holding by around 6 per cent to about 51 per cent from 57.17 per cent during 2011-12 as part of its capital-raising plan.        
	We may go for a rights issue. We can also plan a follow-on public offer, depending on the market. The fine print is yet to be finalised, Corporation Bank chairman and managing director J.M. Garg said here today.        
	Corporation Bank, which had said last month that it would require Rs 6,000 crore in the next three years to meet credit growth, will raise Rs 2,000 crore via a combination of Tier-I and Tier-II capital this year.        
	My capital adequacy is sufficient for this year and the first quarter of the next year. But we will have to plan for the rest of the year. Credit growth is picking up. By the first quarter of next year it would be better, he said. According to Garg, growth is expected to come from infrastructure and related sectors such as cement, steel and capital goods.         
	The bank today announced the opening of 250 branches nationwide.        
	Insurance foray        
	Corporation Bank plans to foray into general insurance and is looking for a foreign partner to start the business soon. We have appointed a consultant and hope to finalise everything by the end of this financial year, Garg said here today. However, he declined to reveal the details.

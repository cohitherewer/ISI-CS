                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Pranab feels ties key to funds flow
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the US was an important trading partner and as India was trying to increase investment in infrastructure and provide a fresh impetus to manufacturing, the importance of the partnership would increase.        
	This mutually beneficial engagement will stimulate innovation, spur job creation and promote sustainable and inclusive growth in both the countries, said Mukherjee while addressing an Indo-US CEOs forum meeting.        
	Economic policy, finance and trade constitute important planks of our bilateral relations. For us, the US remains a prime source of investment, technology and an important trading partner, he said.        
	The finance minister said the partnership would strengthen engagement in economic, financial and investment-related issues.         
	He added that both the countries were negotiating a bilateral investment treaty and were committed to take further initiatives that would contribute to creating a more conducive environment for investment flows.        
	Mukherjee also met US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner to discuss ways to deepen economic ties between the two countries and reach a global agreement on rebalancing the world economy.        
	According to a US treasury spokesperson, Geithner and Mukherjee talked about technical co-operation in capital markets, investments in infrastructure and about joint efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.        
	They also talked about efforts to promote economic recovery and about a US-led plan to rebalance the pattern of global growth.         
	Speaking at a CII event later in the day, Mukherjee invited US investments in the infrastructure sector, while admitting the present facilities were insufficient to sustain high growth in the country.        
	The finance minister told US business leaders that India offered exciting opportunities in power, roads and ports. India presents an exciting opportunity for global investors. The recovery of the benchmark market indices of India over the last two years has been quite rapid and supports this assessment, he said.        
	Highlighting that India has emerged as an attractive global investment destination, Mukherjee said the infrastructure sector alone required an investment of $514 billion for the 11th Plan (2007-08 to 2011-12).         
	Almost 30 per cent of this investment are expected to come from private sources.

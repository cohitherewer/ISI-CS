The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Airlines to pay for delays

                              Reward for patience                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 6 (PTI): Airlines will have to pay compensation to those passengers who have been denied boarding or whose flights have been delayed or cancelled without prior notice, barring situations beyond their control.         
	The move will be effective from August 15, according to a new Civil Aviation Requirement issued today by the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).        
	However, airlines will not be liable to pay compensation if the delay or cancellation takes place because of reasons beyond their control.         
	Strike, labour problems and ATC-related delays are some such factors, sources said.         
	Airlines are exempted from paying compensation in case of political instability, natural disaster, civil war, insurrection or riot, flood, explosion, government regulation or order affecting the aircraft, meteorological conditions and security risks.         
	Passengers will be entitled to get a compensation of Rs 2,000 to Rs 4,000 if their flights are delayed by two hours to four hours.         
	If a passenger, who has a confirmed ticket and had reported well ahead of the scheduled departure of his flight, is denied boarding because of overbooking, the airline will have to compensate the passenger.         
	Airlines overbook their flights to some extent to reduce the possibility of planes departing with empty seats because of no shows, which means passengers do not report for travel despite confirmed bookings before the time limit stipulated by the airline.        
	Todays notice allows airlines to charge no show penalties on such passengers under rule 135 of the Aircraft Rules 1937.         
	This penalty will be deducted from the fare paid by the passenger.         
	In case of cancellation of flights, the notice makes it mandatory for the airlines to inform the passengers about it three hours in advance from the scheduled departure of the flight to reduce inconvenience to them.         
	The airlines will have to collect detailed contact information of a passenger like telephone number (landline or mobile), and/or fax number and/or e-mail id at the time of reservation.         
	However, passengers, who refuse to furnish such information could be denied compensation by the airlines. (More) PTI SMJ ARC KKE 08062048 NNNN

	DGCA 2LST If passengers are not informed about the cancellation of the flights, they were scheduled to travel, at least three hours in advance, then the airlines will have to provide compensation for the inconvenience caused, the new rule stipulates.         
	The airlines will have to refund the ticket prices if passengers do not wish to travel on an alternate or subsequent flight of the carrier concerned or on another airlines flight. If they desire to avail alternate travel opportunities, the airlines should provide the same at no additional cost.         
	Additionally, in case of passengers who have decided to travel to their destination on an alternate flight, the airline should provide them with reasonable facilities during the period that they are required to wait at the airport for the alternate flights.         
	However, no compensation would be paid to passengers who have not provided adequate contact information at the time of booking or when the ticket for confirm travel on the selected flight is issued, the CAR says.         
	Also, no compensation would be paid to passengers if they do not accept to alternate travel arrangements made by the airlines or the cancellation has been due to circumstances beyond the control of the airlines even if all reasonable measures had been taken by them.         
	In the event of delayed flights, the CAR allows a compensation of Rs 2,000 or the value of ticket, whichever is less for flights having a block time of upto and including one hour, Rs 3,000 or the value of the ticket whichever is less for flights having block time of more than one hour and upto and including two hours.        
	Similarly, Rs 4,000 or the value of the ticket, whichever is less, for the flights having a block time of more than two hours. The compensation will be paid in cash or by bank transfer or with the signed agreement of the passenger in the form of travel vouchers.

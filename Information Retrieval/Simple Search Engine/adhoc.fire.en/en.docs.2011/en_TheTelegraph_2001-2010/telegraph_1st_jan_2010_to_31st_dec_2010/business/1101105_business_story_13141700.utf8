	 New Delhi, Nov. 4: Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) today agreed to reduce interest rates they charge from borrowers to 24 per cent after a meeting with financial services secretary R. Gopalan here. A cut in rates comes from as high as 34 per cent in the backdrop of an unsavoury situation in Andhra Pradesh, where many borrowers have committed suicides apparently because of coercive methods adopted by the MFIs to recover money.                            
	 Mumbai, Nov. 4: Avantor Performance Materials Holdings S.A. has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire RFCL Limited from ICICI Venture Funds Management Company, a subsidiary of Indias second-largest bank, ICICI. Avantor identified RFCL as an attractive target to build on its current presence in the laboratory and pharmaceutical markets.                             
	 Mumbai, Nov. 4: Public sector lender IDBI Bank has raised $125 million foreign currency syndicated loan from the Singapore market to meet the growing demand from domestic corporate houses for foreign currency funds.

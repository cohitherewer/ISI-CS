The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL pushes for Posco deal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SAIL pushes for Posco deal
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              Chaturvedi, Roongta: Negotiation time				                                 
	New Delhi, May 13: A team led by steel secretary Atul Chaturvedi and SAIL chairman S. K. Roongta is in Korea to give the final touches to a deal that will see the state-run steel firm giving out prized land at its Bokaro steel plant to Posco.        
	Koreas Posco and SAIL have proposed to make 1.5 million tonnes of specialised steel by setting up a joint venture, in which the Korean firm may hold majority control.         
	Sources said SAIL might also help the joint venture in securing mining linkages.         
	The Indian government, keen to see the deal materialise in the interests of Indo-Korean ties, has been facilitating the negotiations.         
	However, Posco is not the only company looking for an alliance with the state-run company. SAIL is one of the few steel makers in the country with spare land in its townships and strong mining linkages.         
	The Tatas are in talks with SAIL to set up a 2-million-tonne steel making unit using an existing 50:50 mining joint venture formed a few years back. The proposed unit will also use SAIL land at Bokaro.         
	Talks are still on between the two sides ... but there has been a lot of progress, said officials.         
	ArcelorMittal, which had eyed part of SAILs Chiria mines, is also in talks for an alliance.         
	The Jharkhand government had tried to take back part of Chiria from SAIL to give away to private steel firms such as ArcelorMittal, but an appelate tribunal disallowed this. A protracted court case followed.        
	The Mittals, whose plans for large mills in Orissa and Jharkhand have not made much headway, now want to set up a 3-4mt plant in a joint venture with SAIL in eastern India.         
	The worlds No. 1 steel maker wants SAIL to provide land as well mining linkages.         
	However, SAIL insiders say the company does not have an inexhaustible supply of land. We are going through a Rs 70,000-crore expansion programme. Giving away our land to these joint ventures means our expansion programme will face scarcity of land.         
	Moreover, giving away mining linkages will affect SAIL, which could face a huge shortfall of 2.3 billion tonnes of iron ore in the future.        
	Only the Korean project talks of using fines ... the others dont ... ore may have to be supplied to these joint ventures. The question is where from, said a top SAIL executive involved in material planning.

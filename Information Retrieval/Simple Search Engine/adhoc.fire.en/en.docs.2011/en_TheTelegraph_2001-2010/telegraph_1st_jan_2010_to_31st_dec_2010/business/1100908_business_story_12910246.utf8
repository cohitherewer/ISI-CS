The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Code tightens screws on tax havens
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Code tightens screws on tax havens

	The 417-page new Direct Taxes Code Bill, 2010 was tabled in Parliament last week and already a host of issues have been placed before the select committee by industry experts. The much awaited draft DTC introduced in 2009 had sparked expectations that anti-abusive provisions would be introduced. DTC 2010 hasnt belied those expectations even though the provisions will only come into effect from April 1, 2012. This article aims to put forth some broad features of these anti-abuse provisions.        
	Anti-avoidance rule        
	Consistent with the international trend, in order to serve as a deterrent against tax avoidance practices, it was felt necessary and desirable by the Indian government to introduce the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR).        
	GAAR gives sweeping powers to a commissioner of income tax to treat an arrangement as impermissible if the intention of the tax payer is to derive tax benefit and the transaction lacks commercial substance or is not for a bonafide purpose. The benefits available under the tax treaties would be denied if GAAR provisions were invoked. These provisions, therefore, have a huge ground for litigation and uncertainty in the taxation regime of overseas investments and structures. The tax haven, which are currently regarded by foreign investors as a heaven for investments, may now have to go through the hell of taxes and litigation, if GAAR is invoked.        
	Controlled foreign firms        
	The introduction of controlled foreign company (CFC) rules is another step towards the prevention of potential tax avoidance. Under the existing law, if an Indian resident deploys funds through an overseas holding company (set up in a low-tax jurisdiction), which has a step-down operating company, the income earned by such a holding company attracts a tax in India only if it is distributed to the Indian resident. The Indian residents may avoid bringing the foreign income into India to accelerate its global expansion. CFC rules are introduced to avoid deferment or avoidance of domestic tax on income earned by residents through subsidiaries set up in overseas low-tax jurisdictions.         
	 While CFC has been introduced in line with the international trend, the actual implementation and applicability of these rules will be tested over time.        
	Treaty benefits        
	A year-long controversy of treaty override arising out of the earlier draft DTC has been put to a standstill with the new bill. Treaty benefits would be available to taxpayers except where GAAR or CFC rules are invoked or where branch profit tax is levied under DTC. This change is hopefully a relief, but one may need to be wary about the draconian GAAR provisions, that are not only widely worded but also entail a great deal of subjectivity on its treatment by the tax authorities.         
	Offshore asset transfer         
	Another significant move is the taxability of income arising from transfer outside India of shares or interest in a foreign company. Such transfers may now be taxed in India if at any time during the 12 months preceding the transfer, the fair market value of the assets in India (owned directly or indirectly by the company) represents at least 50 per cent of the fair market value (FMV) of all the assets owned by the foreign company.         
	Today, it is uncertain whether the tax authorities will prospectively exercise their jurisdiction over these provisions or not. This amendment could also have implications on multi-layered structures where an investor sold a meagre 1 per cent stake in the overseas fund, that ultimately holds assets representing 50 per cent of the FMV. The meaning of the term FMV is also unclear.         
	To conclude, considering that there is just a year and a half to go before DTC 2010 kicks in, one will need to start planning their affairs now and consider any realignment of their businesses in light of the proposed amendments.

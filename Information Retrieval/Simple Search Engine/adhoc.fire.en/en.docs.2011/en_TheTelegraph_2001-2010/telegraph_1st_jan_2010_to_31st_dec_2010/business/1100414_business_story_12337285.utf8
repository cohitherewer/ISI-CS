The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Congo move to jam Bharti-Zain network
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Congo move to jam Bharti-Zain network
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 13: Delay in getting regulatory approvals from the Republic of Congo as well as from other African countries could create major problems for Bharti Airtels acquisition of Zain Telecoms African assets.        
	On Monday, Congo Republic said it had not been informed of Bharti Airtels deal with Zain, and that the deal was a clear violation of the law in our country, a news agency reported.        
	Congo Republics telecom minister Thierry Moungalla said the parties had 30 days to remedy the situation or face sanctions, including fines or ultimately the withdrawal of local licence.        
	However, a Bharti spokesperson told The Telegraph, We have nothing to add beyond our media statements.        
	Last month, Bharti Airtel inked a $10.7-billion definitive deal to acquire Kuwaits Zain Telecoms operations in 15 African countries. After the agreement was signed, Bharti chairman Sunil Mittal had ruled out any hurdles. The deal, signed in March, would be completed only after the companies get regulatory approvals from all the African markets.        
	As the deal involves 15 countries, winning regulatory approvals will be an important hurdle for Bharti Airtel to cross. However, it is not a difficult task, said Romal Shetty, director of telecom at consulting firm KPMG.        
	Bharti also has to overcome the ownership dispute over Zains Nigerian unit, the Kuwaiti companys most important market.        
	The Gabonese government, too, had earlier released a statement saying it disapproves of the sale of Zains assets in the country.         
	Econet Wireless, which owns 5 per cent in Zains Nigerian unit, is disputing the control of Zains unit in Nigeria. It feels it should have had the right of first refusal on those shares. Zain Telecom owns 65 per cent of Zain Nigeria.        
	The Nigerian unit is a key asset for Zain. In 2008, Zain generated 21 per cent of its total earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and about 22 per cent of its total sales from Nigeria.        
	According to a report by Hugh McCaffrey, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, the Econet Wireless management believes that Zains Nigerian unit will not be available for sale until its ownership dispute is resolved.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL holds edge in review talks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RIL holds edge in review talks
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, May 7: Reliance Industries will be calling the shots from here on  quite literally.        
	The Supreme Court today said the two warring Ambani camps would have to renegotiate the provisions of the gas supply master agreement signed in January 2006.        
	The judges said RIL would initiate the renegotiation within eight weeks from Friday. They also wanted the discussions to close within a time limit of another six weeks.         
	This isnt the first time that the two sides have been advised to sit across the table and thrash out their differences.         
	Justice A.V. Mohta  the company judge at Bombay High Court  had also advised them to sort out the gas pricing issues within four months when he handed down his verdict in October 2007.        
	The two sides barely sat across the table then. This time it might be different.        
	The Supreme Court has said the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the two brothers that was reached in June 2005  and served as the template for the carve-up of Dhirubhais empire  did not supersede the demerger scheme approved by Bombay High Court in December that year.        
	The apex courts judgment completely reversed the verdict of the division bench of Bombay High Court that had ruled that the MoU was binding on all the parties.        
	The MoU contained some explicit commitments on gas supply to the Anil Ambani camp. It had reserved 28 million metric standard cubic metres of gas per day (mmscmd) for Reliance Natural Resources and directed that it would get another 12mmscmd if RILs deal with state-owned NTPC fell through.        
	That wasnt all: the Anil camp was also invested with the right of first refusal on additional gas from all exploration areas that RIL might take up in future.        
	The MoU also described scenarios for the sharing of gas. It said if the proven gas reserves were 60mmscmd, the sharing sequence would be: NTPC 12, Reliance Energy 28 and RIL (captive) 20.        
	If the reserves swelled to 100mmscmd, the sequence would be NTPC 12, REL 28, RIL (captive) 25, Anil Ambani group (second instalment) 16.67, and the remaining 18.33mmscmd would be shared in the ratio of 60:40 between the Mukesh and Anil camps.        
	The Supreme Court verdict now formally junks this proposal. The renegotiation will have to take place within the framework of the production sharing contract that RIL has signed with the government and the gas utilisation policy. Effectively, the government will have the final say on the pricing, quantity and terms of gas supply.         
	The verdict also means that matriarch Kokilaben Ambani may not be able to play the arbiters role between her two sons any more. Under the terms of the MoU, Kokilaben reserved the right to intervene if the Mukesh Ambani camp took any action in bad faith for not obtaining/scuttling the obtaining of  approvals from the government.                                                  
	The apex court order makes the government the supreme arbiter in all gas disputes with the onus to ensure that natural resources were always used in the interests of the country, and not private interests.

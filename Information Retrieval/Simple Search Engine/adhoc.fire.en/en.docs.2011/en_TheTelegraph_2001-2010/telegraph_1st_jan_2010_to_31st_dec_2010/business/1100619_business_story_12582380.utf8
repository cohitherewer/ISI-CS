The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Brakes on Bajaj FinServ stock rally
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Brakes on Bajaj FinServ stock rally
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 18: The Bajaj FinServ stock today took a beating on the stock exchanges after the Insurance Regulatory Authority of India (Irda) clarified that a Reserve Bank of India guideline issued last month on transfer of stake to foreign investors will not apply to the insurance sector.        
	The scrip crashed nearly 10 per cent, or Rs 44.90, to Rs 404.35 on fears that Allianz, its insurance partner, will have to pay a pre-determined price should it raise its holding in the insurance ventures.        
	In May, the RBI said in a circular that if the shares of an Indian company were not listed on the stock exchanges, the transfer of shares to a foreign entity should not be less than the fair value to be determined by the merchant banker.         
	This sparked a rally in the Bajaj FinServ stock on expectations that Allianz would have to pay a market price for raising its stake in Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company, thus benefitting Bajaj FinServ. Bajaj FinServ is the holding company of the two insurance ventures.        
	It may be recalled that according to an agreement entered in 2001 between Bajaj Auto and Allianz, the latter has an option to raise its stake in the life insurance company to 74 per cent from the existing 26 per cent at a pre-determined price.

	New Delhi, Dec. 30: The growth of six infrastructure industries slowed to 2.3 per cent in November  the lowest in this fiscal  mainly because of the contraction in the output of cement and petroleum refinery products.        
	The lacklustre performance raised apprehensions about the momentum of expansion in factory output.         
	The six core sectors crude oil, petroleum refinery products, coal, electricity, cement and finished steel  had expanded 5.9 per cent in November 2009.        
	Petroleum refinery output fell 3.7 per cent and cement by 11.6 per cent in November against a growth of 4.8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, in the year ago period.         
	Coal production witnessed a sluggish growth of 0.7 per cent against 4.7 per cent last year. Finished steel expanded 4.4 per cent compared with 11.7 per cent a year earlier.        
	However, crude production jumped 17 per cent compared with a contraction of 1.6 per cent in November 2009.        
	During April-November, the core sector, which contribute about 27 per cent to the index of industrial production, grew 5 per cent against 4.5 per cent in the year-ago period.         
	The contraction in core sector growth will impact IIP expansion. It may come down to single digits, Crisil principal economist D.K. Joshi said.

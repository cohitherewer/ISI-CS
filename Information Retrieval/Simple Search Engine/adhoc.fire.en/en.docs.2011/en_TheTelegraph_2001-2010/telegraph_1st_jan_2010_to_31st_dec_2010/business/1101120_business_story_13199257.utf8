          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 19: The spectrum scam and a weak start to trading in Europe weakened sentiments on local bourses that led to the sensex tumbling 345 points to a two-month low, with Reliance Industries and the State Bank of India taking a beating.        
	After an extremely volatile session, the BSEs 30-share sensex plunged 345.20 points, or 1.73 per cent, to settle at 19585.44. The last time the sensex closed near todays level was on September 17 when the index finished at 19594.75. The index has lost a steep 7 per cent in the past two weeks.        
	The NSEs Nifty lost 108.50 points to close at 5890.30.        
	Marketmen said the fluid political situation in the wake of the 2G spectrum controversy dampened investor sentiment. They said fears of an imminent rate hike in China also weighed heavy on investors in Asia.        
	Profit-booking by edgy investors after the governments probe into alleged irregularities in the award of 2G spectrum licences sent stocks of R-Com and Videocon plunging 3.57 per cent and 8.6 per cent, respectively.        
	Realty giant Unitech, which has a telecom joint venture with Norways Telenor, fell 4.56 per cent.        
	Bucking the trend in telecom stocks, Bharti Airtel surged 1.22 per cent a day after unveiling a new identity and crossing the milestone of 200 million subscribers.        
	Panic selling was witnessed on Dalal Street in view of the 2G spectrum issue. Investors also pulled out money from banking stocks that are exposed to micro finance. Also, a weak opening in the European market dampened the sentiment in the second half, Alex Mathews of Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services said. While Reliance fell 3.46 per cent, the SBI scrip was down 2.37 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ONGC holds trump card
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ONGC holds trump card
          R. SURYAMURTHY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: ONGC has the first right of refusal on Cairn Indias stake, and the London-listed Vedanta Resources may have to bargain over the payment of cess and royalty with the state-owned explorer before it gets to pick up a majority holding in Cairn, officials said.        
	Vedanta Resources and Cairn today separately announced a stake sale plan. Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy Plc is selling up to 60 per cent in Cairn India for $9.6 billion. However, the deal will go through only after the government approves it. Officials said the government and ONGC could bargain for a proportionate sharing of statutory levies to be paid to the Rajasthan government.         
	Cairns three producing oil and gas assets, including the Rajasthan fields and seven exploration blocks, either have explicit provisions for seeking prior approval before the transfer of interest or gives the right of first refusal to partners such as ONGC.        
	An oil ministry official said the government could now settle the issue of losses that ONGC incurs in the Rajasthan oil fields because it pays cess and royalty on behalf of Cairn India.        
	ONGC gets a 30 per cent share of crude oil from the Rajasthan fields but has to pay cess and royalty on the entire production, thereby getting negative returns on its investments.        
	ONGC will be consulted before the deal is approved by the government according to a production sharing contract (PSC), petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said. Definitely, we will consult ONGC. I have not yet looked into the credentials of the party (Vedanta). We will have to examine before giving approval. Definitely, the approval has to be governed by the PSC, he said.        
	The finance ministry today said Cairn was likely to pay close to $1 billion as capital gains tax on the $8.48 billion it expected to get from Vedanta Resources. This deal will attract a capital gains tax of 11.33 per cent, a finance ministry official said.         
	Tax will (have to) be paid by Cairn Energy at an applicable rate of tax on capital gains, a Vedanta spokesperson told PTI.

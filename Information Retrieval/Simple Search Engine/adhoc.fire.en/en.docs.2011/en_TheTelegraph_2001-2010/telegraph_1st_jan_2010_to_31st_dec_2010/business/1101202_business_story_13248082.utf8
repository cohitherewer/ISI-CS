          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 1: HDFC Ltd and ICICI Bank  two of the countrys biggest housing finance entities  have decided to wind up their teaser rate home loans.        
	A spokesperson said ICICI Bank had withdrawn the teaser rates on home loans with immediate effect and refused to elaborate on the reasons.        
	HDFC also said its dual rate home loan scheme, which was valid till November 30, had not been extended.        
	Late in the evening, PNB said it would also discontinue its special home and car loan schemes from next month.         
	The teaser rate home loan became popular after the State Bank of India pioneered the scheme in February 2009.         
	The Reserve Bank of India has always frowned on the scheme and had even advised banks to discontinue it since it felt that borrowers were being snared into a debt trap without being fully apprised of the risk they ran.        
	Last month, the RBI tightened the provisioning norms for the teaser rate loans after which banks have discovered that it no longer makes sense to offer lowball rates in the first two years.        
	In its monetary policy on November 2, the RBI had raised the provisioning norm for teaser rate loans to 2 per cent from 0.4 per cent  which meant banks would have to set aside an amount that was five times higher for every loan they disbursed.        
	The RBI took the extreme step after banks refused to heed its warning tone.        
	The provision will apply to standard assets of commercial banks. A standard asset is a loan where the customer hasnt slipped on his repayment schedule.         
	The central bank had said it was raising the provisioning requirement as banks often failed to assess in the loan appraisal stage whether the borrower had the capacity to repay when the higher rates kicked in.        
	An industry source here said the higher provisioning requirement wasnt the only reason why the banks had decided to drop the scheme.         
	They have apparently started waking up to the lending risks that the apex bank had warned about all along.        
	In October, ICICI Bank had said under the teaser rate scheme, home loan seekers had to pay 8.5 per cent in the first year, 9.25 per cent in the second year and 1.5 per cent over and above the base rate in the third year.         
	The base rate is the benchmark rate below which banks are not allowed to fix their lending rates.        
	ICICI Bank has fixed its base rate at 7.75 per cent.        
	On the other hand, HDFC which had launched its dual rate scheme in December last year, was offering its customers a fixed rate of 8.50 per cent up to March 31, 2011 and 9.25 per cent from April 1 to March 31, 2012. Thereafter, the interest rate was supposed to float. It was linked to its benchmark prime lending rate.        
	The industry is waiting to see whether the SBI will also scrap its scheme. When it first offered the scheme, the interest rate in the first year was fixed at 8 per cent.         
	Since then, the scheme has been extended several times and the rates have been tweaked.        
	The SBI scheme is due to end this month.

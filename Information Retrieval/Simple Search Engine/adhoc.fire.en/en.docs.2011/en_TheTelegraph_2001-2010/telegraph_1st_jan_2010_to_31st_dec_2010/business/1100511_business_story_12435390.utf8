	New Delhi, May 10: Car sales grew 39.5 per cent in April  the highest in over a decade.         
	Sales of bikes increased 17 per cent during the month and helped the domestic vehicle market to grow 25.24 per cent.         
	This is the highest growth since April 1999, during which car sales had grown 50.29 per cent, said Vishnu Mathur, director-general of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).        
	According to data released by Siam, car sales stood at 1,43,976 units in April against 1,03,227 units in the same month last year.        
	Analysts said the automobile industry continued to benefit from the overall economic growth but expressed concern over rising raw material costs. The new emission standards have resulted in high input costs for the company, said auto analyst Murad Ali Baig.         
	Total vehicle sales in April grew 25.24 per cent to 11,20,081 units from 8,94,380 units in the year-ago period.        
	There is investment in infrastructure and there is also availability of finance, and customer sentiments have improved, he said.        
	Market leader Maruti Suzukis sales grew 22.12 per cent to 68,668 units, while rival Hyundai Motor India registered a 28.15 per cent growth at 28,501 units. Tata Motors sales rose 76.41 per cent to 19,762 units during the month.        
	Two-wheeler sales grew 22.06 per cent to 8,55,670 units from 7,00,987 units a year ago.

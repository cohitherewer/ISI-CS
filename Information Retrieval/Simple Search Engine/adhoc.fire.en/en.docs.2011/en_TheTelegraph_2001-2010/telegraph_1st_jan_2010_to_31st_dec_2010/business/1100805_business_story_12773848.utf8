	Calcutta, Aug. 4: Keventer Agro and Apeejay Tea are exploring the possibility of building new tea brands in the semi-premium and economy segments.        
	Apeejay will handle plantation and packaging. Keventer, owned by the Jalan family, will do marketing, sales and distribution.        
	Controlled by the Paul family, Apeejay is one of the largest producers of tea in the country and owner of the UKs premium Typhoo brand.        
	The two companies today inked an agreement to sell Typhoo tea bags and fruit infusions in the east.        
	We have already entered the markets in north and west India on our own but decided to partner Keventer in the east. Our target is to be among the top three players in tea bags, said Karan Paul, chairman of Apeejay Surrendra Group. The two companies will continue to look for other business opportunities, Paul added.        
	Mayank Jalan, managing director of Keventer, said the response to Typhoo, that started rolling out from today, was encouraging.         
	Keventer, which makes dairy products such as milk, ice cream and fruit juices, supplies to about 100,000 outlets in the east.        
	The Rs 6,000-crore Apeejay Group earns Rs 950 crore from tea, of which Typhoo contributes Rs 600 crore. It produces 25 million kg in Assam. Keventer Agro is a Rs 1,400-crore group.        
	Packet tea is a Rs 7,000-crore business in India and is growing at 2-3 per cent annually. The market for tea bags is much smaller at Rs 400 crore segment, but is growing at 25 per cent.

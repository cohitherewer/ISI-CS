          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 3: Frances Sanofi-Aventis will commercialise a molecule of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, which can fetch the Indian company as much as $325 million.        
	Under the terms of the agreement signed today to develop a painkiller, Sanofi will make an upfront payment of $20 million apart from development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments aggregating another $305 million.        
	As the cost of developing a drug is huge, domestic pharma companies out-license molecules (after a certain stage) in their portfolio to global innovator companies, which then undertake the research.         
	On out-licensing, the domestic company receives milestone payments which depend upon the progress of the molecule in clinical trials. If the molecule gets commercialised, they are entitled to royalties on the sales of the drug.         
	Glenmark today announced that its subsidiary entered into an agreement with Sanofi-Aventis to grant the latter a licence for the development and commercialisation of novel agents to treat chronic pain. These agents include a first-in-class clinical compound GRC 15300.         
	GRC 15300 is in Phase I clinical development as potential next-generation treatment for various pain conditions, including diabetic neuropathic pain and osteoarthritic pain.         
	Glenmark said under the terms of the agreement, it is also eligible to receive royalties on the sales of products commercialised under the licence.         
	Sanofi-Aventis will have exclusive marketing rights for North America, European Union and Japan subject to Glenmarks right to jointly promote the products in the United States and five eastern European countries.         
	Sanofi-Aventis will also have joint marketing rights in 10 other countries, including Brazil, Russia, and China, whereas Glenmark will retain exclusive rights in India and other countries of the rest of the world.        
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the share gained 3.63 per cent, or Rs 9.80, to end at Rs 279.65.

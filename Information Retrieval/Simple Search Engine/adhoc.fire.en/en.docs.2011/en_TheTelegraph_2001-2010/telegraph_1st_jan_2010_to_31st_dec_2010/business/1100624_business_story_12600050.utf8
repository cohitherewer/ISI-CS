The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court stays Birla Corp annual meet
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Court stays Birla Corp annual meet
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      HARSH V. LODHA    Chairman of Birla Corp                          
	Calcutta, June 23: The annual general meeting of Birla Corporation was adjourned midway today following a local court directive.        
	Harsh V. Lodha, chairman of Birla Corp, informed shareholders after an unusual tea break during the AGM at Science City about an Alipore Court order that restrained the meeting from going on.        
	A petition was filed by one Prabhat Kumar Surekha in Alipore Court yesterday, which said the procedure adopted by the company to hold the AGM was prejudiced against the minority shareholders of Birla Corp like him.        
	Surekhas counsel Ranabir Raychoudhary said the notice was served to Birla Corp, flagship of MP Birla empire, now under the effective control of H.V. Lodha, at 9.45am, before the scheduled start of the AGM at 10.30am. However, the company accepted the same at 11.30am.        
	The meeting continued for about two-and-half hours in violation of the court order since the management knew about it, Raychoudhary said.        
	It was learnt that Fox and Mandal, the solicitor firm for Lodha, moved Calcutta High Court to vacate the order and ensure that the AGM was concluded and all resolutions passed.        
	However, Surekha had by then filed a caveat in the high court and the stay could not be lifted. The matter will come up for hearing tomorrow.        
	Lodha was replying to questions raised by shareholders before a vote on resolutions when the tea break was announced at around 2.20pm. Terming the development as unfortunate, Lodha said: We have not seen what the order is all about but to respect the judiciary and maintain transparency, the AGM is being adjourned. The meeting will take place on June 29 at Uttam Mancha.        
	The announcement followed a minor scuffle between shareholders belonging to the two rival camps of the Birlas and the Lodhas.        
	Incidentally, Surekhas decision to move the Alipore court coincided with the Birla Education Trusts move to approach Calcutta High Court with a similar plea. However, the high court rejected the trusts petition yesterday. The trust had earlier approached the Company Law Board seeking a stay on the AGM and the appointment of Lodha as director of the company. The CLB had also turned it down.        
	Sources said Surekha is the son of D.P. Surekha, director of the Birla family controlled firms Basant Properties and Jute Investment.        
	Debanjan Mandal, partner of Fox amp; Mandal, said: This is an abuse of the judicial process and a total fraud on the court.         
	He alleged that the trust did not inform the high court that a similar plea had been moved by Surekha in a lower court and an order obtained.        
	The fresh Birla offensive comes at a time when legal firm Amarchand Mangaldas had joined the fray on behalf of the Birlas. As many as 14 cases had been filed after they began handling the corporate law matter in March. NG Khaitan continues to look after the cases that pertain to the probate of will.        
	Meanwhile, Nandini Nopany, daughter of the late KK Birla, has resigned from the Birla Corp board.        
	Investment moves        
	Lodha said the company would invest Rs 2,400 crore to double cement capacity from 6 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes. B.R. Nahar, CEO of Birla Corp, said it would achieve a 9mt capacity by the middle of next year with Rs 1,100 crore investment.

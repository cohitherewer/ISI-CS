	Calcutta, July 6: The shipping ministry has promised to build two additional dock systems in Haldia and Calcutta.        
	Mukul Roy, Union minister of state for shipping, said the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) would build the two cargo-handling facilities at Diamond Harbour and Salukkhali.        
	Speaking at his first press conference as shipping minister after joining the cabinet a year ago, Roy said the facilities would be ready by 2011.        
	Diamond Harbour, which is on the eastern side of the river like the Calcutta Dock System in Khidderpore, will be equipped to handle containers; Salukkhali, on the western side of the river like Haldia, is going to handle bulk cargo.        
	Both systems are expected to have a 9-meter draft to facilitate the movement of bigger ships, which cannot come to either Calcutta or Haldia because of siltation on the river bed.        
	While the minister did not disclose the investment, port officials said around Rs 1,800 crore would be required.        
	Both the facilities will be built on a public-private partnership basis; the private company will build, operate and then transfer the berths.        
	The minister said he had held discussions with railway minister Mamata Banerjee about connectivity to the facilities at Diamond Harbour and Salukkhali.        
	Roy said CPT chairman M.L. Meena would meet Rail Board chairman Vibek Sahai on connectivity to Sagar Island where a deeper water port would be built in the future.        
	He said that the board of trustees of the CPT had agreed to merge the Calcutta Dock Labour Board with itself, taking on the burden of 7,000 pensioners and 340 existing employees.         
	The CPT has sought Rs 640-crore assistance from the Centre to meet the additional financial obligation.

   Crude, metal surge on China cue          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                                                  
	June 21: The Chinese yuan on Monday recorded its biggest single-day gain since its landmark revaluation in 2005 even as stocks and commodities soared from Tokyo to New York amid feverish excitement over Chinas promise at the weekend to revalue its currency against the dollar.        
	Chinas promise to make the yuan more flexible against the dollar  a pledge that came just days before this weekends G-20 summit in Toronto  has sparked hope among policymakers and markets that Beijings move could reignite a worldwide economic resurgence by stoking a sharp increase in global trade.        
	Stocks rallied, crude oil prices rose more than 2 per cent and metal prices surged as investor sentiment across markets were buoyed by the Chinese central banks signal that it would unshackle the currency from its de facto 23-month-old peg.        
	The Chinese appeared to back off a bit from that promise on Monday when the Peoples Bank of China ruled out a one-off revaluation of the currency and suggested that the yuans value was close to fair value.        
	Still, the Chinese central bank let the yuan rise 0.42 per cent to 6.7976 per dollar  which was the biggest daily gain and the highest close since China introduced a managed float regime in 2005.        
	The markets took the apparent Chinese double-talk on the yuan revaluation in their stride as stocks rallied on Hong Kong and other Asian markets.         
	The Hang Seng Index was up 3.08 per cent at 20912.18 with a turnover at its highest in at least four-and-a-half months. Chinas Shanghai index surged 2.90 per cent and Japans Nikkei jumped 2.43 per cent.         
	Sensex leaps        
	The sensex leapt on cue with a sharp gap-up opening. The bellwether index of the Bombay Stock Exchange rallied nearly 306 points to finish at 17876.55. The rupee also spurted nearly 41 paise to close at 45.75 against the dollar.        
	Metal stocks climbed on the expectation that the yuan revaluation would ignite demand from Chinas factories for a range of minerals and intermediate products from around the world.        
	Sentiment on the local bourses was also underpinned by a local factor  the governments ordinance on Saturday that gave the insurance regulator unfettered right to oversee the unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips).         
	Bank scrips vaulted as marketmen expected the Ulip ordinance to benefit those that had an exposure to the insurance sector. Ulips are life insurance products and part of the money parked in them are invested in the stock markets. This will result in Ulips not only attracting more inflows, but also fresh Ulips which will benefit the stock markets, said one analyst.        
	Metal stocks surged as the dollar weakened against major currencies. Since base metals are priced in the US dollar, they move in opposite direction to that of the greenback. At the London Metal Exchange, three-month delivery copper rose over 4.5 per cent to $6,729 per tonne.         
	With metal prices rising, the BSE metal index led the list of percentage gainers with a rise of 5.16 per cent. Sterlite Industries, the biggest copper and zinc producer, gained the most in a year after the face value of its shares was split from Rs 2 to Re 1, making them cheaper to trade. The stock gained over 8 per cent to Rs 183.70 and was the biggest gainer on the sensex. Tata Steel also climbed 6.30 per cent, while Hindalco rose 5.61 per cent.        
	Europe, US perk up        
	European and US stock markets rallied by more than 1 per cent, mirroring Asian equity gains. US stocks were propelled on by the long-term outlook for sales at US multinationals, as well as by gains in natural resource shares.        
	US crude for July delivery climbed as high as $78.87 per barrel on Monday, the highest since May 6, and was up $1.33 at $78.51 at 1342 GMT. August ICE Brent rose $1.28 to $79.50 a barrel, the highest since May 14.        
	US crude has recovered about 21 per cent from a trough below $65 a month ago but is still about $9 lower than the 2010 high.         
	We have broken above the range around $75 and we would expect prices to now rise above $80, said Amrita Sen, analyst at Barclays Capital in London.        
	At 23:50 IST, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 74.44 points, or 0.71 per cent, at 10525.10. The Standard amp; Poors 500 Index was up 5.75 points, or 0.51 per cent, at 1123.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 5.98 points, or 0.26 per cent, at 2315.78.        
	The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose for a ninth straight session to close 1 percent higher at 1,055.38 points, the highest close since early May, with basic resources stocks the biggest gainers.        
	Its totally on the back of China, and miners are the best performers, which shows you where the drive in the markets is coming from. Were also seeing generic higher appetite for risk, said Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index.

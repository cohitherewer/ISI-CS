          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Fresh ties                                  
	New Delhi, April 7: India and Japan today resumed their dialogue for a free trade deal as negotiators sought to thrash out differences over tariff, market access and other barriers.        
	The two had earlier failed to reach an agreement over access to Indian agricultural products and services after a dozen round of talk that began three years ago.        
	A senior Indian commerce ministry official said, We are seeking market access mainly for agricultural products and pharmaceuticals. Besides, services such as information technology and English teaching are of interest to us.         
	Japans tariffs for many agricultural commodities are high. Also, sectors such as oilseeds, dairy products, sugar and sugar products face higher levies. Non-tariff barriers such as health standards are also a roadblock.        
	Sources said Tokyo had been pressing for a bilateral agreement on government purchases, industrial machinery, electrical appliances, communication equipment, electronic equipment, motor vehicles and construction and financial services.        
	Sources said India was unlikely to agree to Tokyos demand of preferential treatment in government procurement as a study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) had found that Japan would have a comparative advantage. Though a final decision is yet to be taken, in view of the Unctad study, we may not negotiate on the government procurement front, officials said.        
	A bilateral agreement on government purchases means that Japanese firms will be treated on a par with Indian entities when bids are invited.         
	Government procurement is estimated at 5.8 per cent of Indias gross domestic product, according to Unctad.

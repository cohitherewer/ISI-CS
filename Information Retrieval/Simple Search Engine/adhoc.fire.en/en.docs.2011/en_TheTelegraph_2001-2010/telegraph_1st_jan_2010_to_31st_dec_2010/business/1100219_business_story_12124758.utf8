          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb 18: Life insurers want finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to remove the discrepancies in service tax on unit-linked life insurance plans (Ulips) vis--vis mutual fund products.         
	The service tax payable on Ulips should be changed to bring it on a par with MF products, said S.B. Mathur, secretary-general of the Life Insurance Council, the umbrella organisation of life insurers.        
	Since 2008-09, life insurance firms are required to pay service taxes on various fees charged under Ulips, such as the management fee, policy administration charge and premium allocation charge and others, including stamp duty on the policy. The mortality charge deducted from the premium has already been brought under the service tax net a few years ago.         
	The disparity in the levy of service tax is an area of concern for life insurers, Mathur said.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      US arm of Hindalco on profit track
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, May 27: Kumar Mangalam Birlas risky bet just over three years ago may have finally paid off.         
	Novelis  the US subsidiary of Hindalco  has clawed back into profits. The worlds largest producer of aluminium rolled products today announced a net income of $405 million for the fiscal year 2010.         
	Last year, it had suffered a net loss of $1.9 billion, which had deepened concerns about Birlas bet on the groups biggest overseas buyout. Hindalco acquired Novelis in February 2007 in a $6-billion deal.        
	In the fourth quarter ended March 31, Novelis reported sales of $8.7 billion, a decrease of 15 per cent compared with $10.2 billion in the year-ago period. This was a result of the lower aluminium prices and the softness in the companys endmarkets in the first half of the year.        
	The turnaround story was fashioned in the January-March period, which Novelis claimed was the first quarter since the economic downturn when shipments to all four regions  North America, South America, Asia and Europe  had grown year-on-year.        
	This was an unprecedented year for the company, said Phil Martens, president and chief operating officer of Novelis.         
	In 2009, we had set a target of annualised cost savings of $140 million and we have achieved this goal almost two full quarters ahead of schedule, Martens added.        
	Novelis said shipments of aluminium rolled products totalled 2,708 kilo tonnes in fiscal 2010, down 2 per cent from last years shipments of 2,770 kilo tonnes.

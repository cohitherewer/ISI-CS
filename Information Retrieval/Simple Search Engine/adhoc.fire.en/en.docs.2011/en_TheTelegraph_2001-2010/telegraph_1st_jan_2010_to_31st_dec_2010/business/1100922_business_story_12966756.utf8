          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 21: Barack Obama hasnt been able to poop the party for the technology titans.        
	Heading into a crucial November election, the US President had raised the outsourcing bogey once again and warned American companies not to outsource jobs to India if they wanted to retain their tax breaks.        
	Let us stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas, he had said as the poll rhetoric turned strident.        
	Ironically, with the jobs, American money has continued to pour into India in the quest for nifty returns. Foreign institutional investors many of them with American roots  funnelled money into TCS, Infosys and Wipro today and they were in the vanguard of the brigade that propelled the sensex above 20000 and the Nifty atop 6000.        
	Unlike in the past when the usual suspects from the Reliance group hogged the limelight on such occasions, IT stocks were clearly the flavour of the day. In fact, the BSE IT index led the list of sectoral gainers with a 2.43 per cent surge. Capital goods, power, and the auto indices were next in the pecking order.        
	Take TCS, the Tata groups flagship company that has been consistently churning better-than-expected profit numbers in the past few quarters. The share climbed to a new yearly high of Rs 957 after which it ended at Rs 952.75, a rise of Rs 42.20.        
	TCS was the leader in the 30-stock Tata pack that saw the groups market capitalisation grow 2.3 per cent (or Rs 9,108 crore) to a record Rs 4,10,059 crore.         
	TCS alone added Rs 8,529 crore  or 90.6 per cent  to the increase in the Tata groups market capitalisation today. Tata Motors and Tata Power together contributed Rs 1,986 crore.        
	Likewise, Bangalore-based Infosys Technologies rose 1.75 per cent to Rs 3,058.50. Interestingly, it was the largest contributor to the sensex gain of 95 points, chipping in with 32.78 points. It was followed by TCS. Following them were Larsen amp; Toubro, HDFC, HDFC Bank and Wipro.         
	On the NSE, too, Infosys was the largest contributor to its 28-point gain.        
	Experts say the current bull run will be remembered for the huge run-up seen in banking, auto and infrastructure stocks because of the India growth story. It is expected that these sectors will continue to see investor interest in the days ahead.         
	One key sector that we expect to be a big driver of the market is banking. We also believe that metals and mining would do well considering that the economy is booming and infrastructure growth will propel these sectors. On the same note, realty and construction will also benefit from this boom, said Prateek Agrawal, head (equity), Bharti AXA Investment Managers.        
	Market circles are, however, divided on what role the Reliance Industries stock will play in the days ahead. The stock has been an underperformer compared with other heavyweights stemming from growing worries over the margins in some of its business lines. These concerns have exacerbated after the company decided not to ramp up production from the KG-D6 block.        
	The RIL stock closed lower at Rs 1,032.90, down 0.65 per cent from its previous close.         
	On the BSE, its market cap slipped by less than a percentage point to Rs 337,868 crore.         
	The market cap of younger brother Anil Ambanis group companies also slid by just under 1 per cent to Rs 129,278 crore.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SBI sets date for rights issue
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 16: The State Bank of India (SBI) will raise around Rs 20,000 crore through a rights issue by the end of this calendar year to fund its business requirements.         
	The countrys largest bank is likely to approach the Union government soon with this proposal.        
	The rights issue is part of the banks plan to raise around Rs 40,000 crore over the next five years to meet demand for loans as the economic recovery takes firm root.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had recently said the bank was looking to raise between Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore through a rights issue in the next financial year for which it would need government support.        
	We need to raise some equity and we will do it in the next financial year. It will be a rights issue. In the next fiscal, we are looking at a ceiling of around Rs 20,000 crore. he said.        
	Sources at the bank said the fund-raising would be closer to Rs 20,000 crore with a rights issue likely by November.        
	However, the issue will be successful if the government subscribes to it.         
	The Centre holds 59.41 per cent in the PSU bank.        
	Recently, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee introduced the State Bank of India (Amendment) Bill, 2010 in Parliament.         
	The bill proposes to bring down the minimum statutory holding of the Centre in the SBI to 51 per cent from 55 per cent. It is estimated that the SBI can raise up to Rs 20,000 crore if the government chooses to bring down its stake in the nationalised bank to 51 per cent.        
	Bhatt had said the bank would prefer a rights issue to a dilution of the government stake.

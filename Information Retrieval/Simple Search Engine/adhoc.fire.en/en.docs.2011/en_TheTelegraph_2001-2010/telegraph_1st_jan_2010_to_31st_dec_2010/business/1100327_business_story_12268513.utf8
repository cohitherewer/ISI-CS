          A STAFF REPORTER                          Pankaj Mohindroo, president of the Indian Cellular Association, in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, March 26: The Indian Cellular Association (ICA) has asked Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta to levy a uniform 5 per cent value added tax (VAT) on mobile phones.        
	In his budget for 2010-11, Dasgupta had proposed to hike VAT on mobile phones costing more than Rs 3,000 from 4 per cent to 12.5 per cent.        
	According to the ICA, the decision would adversely affect mobile handset sales in the state.         
	At a uniform 5 per cent rate, we expect legitimate sales to be affected only marginally and the overall mobile handset industry could grow unhindered to touch the projected size of Rs 2,300 crore by 2010-11, ICA president Pankaj Mohindroo said here today.        
	The ICA has submitted a memorandum to the state finance ministry and hopes to meet Dasgupta very soon.        
	Mohindroo said revenue collection in the state would decrease because of the split VAT structure. Also, a higher VAT would lead to an influx of mobile sets from neighbouring states with lower VAT rates.        
	The two-tier system is ludicrous. What is most worrying is this policy would lead to a spurt in smuggled handsets from other states. The robust grey market would get consolidated. That would pose threat to the survival of local manufacturers, Bijay Agarwal, managing director of city-based handset maker Gee Pee Infotech, said.        
	According to the ICA, Assam imposes a VAT of 5 per cent on mobile handsets, while Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand levy 4 per cent. But, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh impose 12.5 per cent tax and Chhattisgarh has a 14 per cent VAT on mobile handsets across all price points.        
	Around 8.5 million handsets have been sold in Bengal this fiscal (2009-10), of which 5.9 million are in the sub-Rs 3,000 category.

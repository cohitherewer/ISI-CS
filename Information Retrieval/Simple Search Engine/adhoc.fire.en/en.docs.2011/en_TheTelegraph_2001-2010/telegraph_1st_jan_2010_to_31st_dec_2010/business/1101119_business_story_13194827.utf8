          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: Divestments in state-owned firms are likely to pick up in the coming weeks with the government planning to raise around Rs 19,000 crore before the end of this fiscal.        
	The initial public offer (IPO) of Manganese Ore India Limited (MOIL) will be launched on November 26. Shipping Corporation of Indias offer will follow this, disinvestment secretary Sumit Bose said.        
	The government is in a hurry to complete the share sale in MOIL, Shipping Corporation, Hindustan Copper, SAIL, IOC and ONGC so that it can raise at least Rs 40,000 crore in this fiscal.        
	Of the targeted Rs 40,000 crore, the government has been able to raise Rs 21,000 crore from stake sales in public sector undertakings. This is an achievement considering the amount raised through this route before this fiscal, Bose said.        
	Since April, the government has sold shares in Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam, Engineers India, Coal India and PowerGrid Corporation.         
	These four issues fetched about Rs 21,000 crore, Bose said.        
	MOIL will sell a total stake of 20 per cent. Of this, the Centres share will be 10 per cent of the total equity.         
	The Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra governments will divest 5 per cent each in the undertaking.

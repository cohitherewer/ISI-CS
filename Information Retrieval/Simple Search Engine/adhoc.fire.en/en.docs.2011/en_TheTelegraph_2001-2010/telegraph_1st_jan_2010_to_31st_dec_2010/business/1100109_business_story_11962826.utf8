The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance sweetens Lyondell bid 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Reliance sweetens Lyondell bid 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 8: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has raised its offer price for a controlling stake in bankrupt chemicals company LyondellBasell (LB).        
	Back in November, Reliance had made a non-binding offer to pay $12 billion in cash and debt to acquire LB.         
	Reports indicate that the Mukesh Ambani-led RIL has submitted a revised offer to LBs current management that pegs the enterprise value of the worlds third largest chemicals company at $13.5 billion.         
	If the deal goes through, the offer price will be the highest by an Indian company for an overseas buyout.         
	An RIL spokesperson declined to comment on the development.         
	Sources, however, said Reliance had made the offer to LBs management as the latter was in the process of presenting a reorganisation plan to a US bankruptcy court and had the option of presenting the RIL offer as a part of the plan.        
	 Analysts, however, had earlier pointed that while an enterprise value of $14-15 billion might be fair, Reliance would be better off if it capped LBs enterprise value at approximately $12 billion.        
	Later last year, international brokerage house CLSA said in a note, A $14-15 billion total enterprise value (TEV) would be fair but a margin of safety may be necessary to discount the chance of a persistent downturn as well as environmental litigation. We would view the acquisition as positive if the TEV remains below $12billion.        
	CLSA had not revised its views after reports appeared that RIL had sweetened the offer by $1.5 billion.        
	The RIL scrip fell 0.9 per cent in early trades. It closed 0.3 per cent lower at Rs 1,101.95 with markets spooked by the prospect of a higher cash outflow arising from the higher bid price. Speculation about a revised RIL bid for LyondellBasell swirled after the countrys largest private sector company sold a second tranche of treasury stock on Monday to raise Rs 2,675 crore. The stock sale has raised RILs kitty comprising cash and cash equivalents to roughly Rs 25,000 crore.         
	 International media reports, however, indicate that the current LB management is unlikely to accept RILs revised bid and may stick to its previous plan of pulling the company out of bankruptcy by handing it over to its creditors who aim to convert $18 billion of debt into equity.         
	These reports also suggest that under RILs revised proposal, the company will buy $2.5 billion in new stock of LB and support a separate $2.8 billion rights issue that has already been proposed in the creditors reorganisation plan. While Reliance has pegged LBs enterprise value at $13.5 billion, the management of Lyondell has estimated the value at $15.5 billion.         
	In the past, RILs offer of $12 billion has been termed as too low by LBs creditors.         
	Sources said RILs revised offer indicated that LB could boost its income by $500 million per year from operational synergies that would arise if Reliance took over the global major.

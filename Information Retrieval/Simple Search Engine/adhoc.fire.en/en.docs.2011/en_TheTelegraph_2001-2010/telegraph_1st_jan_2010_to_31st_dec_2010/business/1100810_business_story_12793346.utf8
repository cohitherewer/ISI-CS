	New Delhi, Aug. 9: The government has decided to allow the export of three lakh tonnes of non-basmati rice and two lakh tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh after good rainfall and higher cultivation improved crop prospects.        
	The ban on the export of non-basmati rice shall not be applicable on three lakh tonnes of parboiled non-basmati rice sent to Bangladesh from the central pool at prevalent economic cost through the Food Corporation of India, a notification by the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) said.        
	In another notification, the DGFT allowed the export of two million tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh.        
	The foodgrains will be shipped under a diplomatic deal by the Food Corporation at its economic cost, which is the price paid to farmers and the cost of storage and transportation.        
	The economic cost of wheat and non-basmati rice is Rs 15.44 a kg and about Rs 20 a kg, respectively, including the purchase price, taxes, warehouse and handling charges.        
	In May, too, India allowed the export of one lakh tonne of non-basmati rice and four lakh tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh.        
	The government has banned the export of wheat since October 2007 and non-basmati rice from April 2008 to ensure the availability of the grain in the domestic market and check the price rise. However, the ban has been relaxed from time-to-time on diplomatic grounds.        
	Foodgrain stocks have increased after four successive good harvests of wheat, but the government, struggling to calm inflation, has not allowed the export of wheat and rice.        
	Wheat stocks as on July 1 had risen to 33.6 million tonnes from 17.1 million tonnes a year ago, while rice inventory jumped to 24.3 million tonnes from 9.8 million tonnes.        
	Officials said if rice output from this years summer crop was good, the government might further ease the control on exports.

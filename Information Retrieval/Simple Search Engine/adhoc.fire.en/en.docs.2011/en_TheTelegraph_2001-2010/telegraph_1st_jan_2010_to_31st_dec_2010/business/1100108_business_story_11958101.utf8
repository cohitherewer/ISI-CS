	New Delhi, Jan. 7: Global steel giants ArcelorMittal and Posco are planning to make huge investments in Karnataka, while they cool their heels in Jharkhand and Orissa.        
	The southern state is expecting investments of about Rs 60,000 crore, overall, from the duo, who will each set up projects of 6 million tonnes per annum.        
	(Lakshmi) Mittal has come forward to set up a six-million-tonne steel plant in Karnataka at an investment of Rs 30,000 crore and having direct employment potential for 10,000 people. A memorandum of understanding would be signed in June, Karnataka chief minister B. S. Yeddyurappa said after his meeting with the steel tycoon here.        
	Mittals projects in Jharkhand and Orissa and Poscos in Orissa have been bogged by land problems and delays in getting mining leases.        
	Mittal told reporters that There are assurances from the Karnataka government and there is a clear commitment from them. This is my first meeting with the chief minister. We are very impressed with the kind of support and co-operation we are receiving from them.        
	The Karnataka government, in a release, said Mittal would also set up a captive power plant of 750MW capacity. The company aims to acquire 4,000 acres for the plant.        
	Posco, too, has received Karnataka approval for a Rs 32,300-crore project.        
	 It is absolutely in addition to our Orissa project. The planned capacity is 6 million tonnes a year. We remain committed to our Orissa project, Posco spokesperson Simanta Mohanty said.        
	Price relief        
	State-owned steel maker SAIL today said it might cut prices of some of its products. The company last week had raised prices of flat and long products by Rs 1,500 per tonne.

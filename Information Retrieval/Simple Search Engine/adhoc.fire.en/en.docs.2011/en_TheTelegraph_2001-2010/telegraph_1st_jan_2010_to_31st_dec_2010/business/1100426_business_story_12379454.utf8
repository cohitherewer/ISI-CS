                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Leave salary
                                Is leave salary and NSS taxable in the hands of the legal heir of an employee?          Nandadulal Mitra, Baguihati
                    der Section 17 (1) of the Income Tax Act, leave salary is part of salary and hence it is taxable in the hands of the employee during the employment period. However, if the cash equivalent of leave salary is paid to the legal heir on the death of the employee, the legal heir does not have to pay tax on it, the CBDT had clarified in a circular in 1989.                                    STT deduction      Can I deduct the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) as expense from my capital gain from selling shares?        Amalendu Banerjee, Howrah
                    From 2008-09 (that is assessment year 2009-10), STT has been allowed for deduction as expenses under Section 36 (xv) of the Income Tax Act. However, this deduction is available only in cases of income from share trading, speculative trading and derivative transactions. It is not allowed for deduction from capital gains under a proviso to Section 48. Thus, if you are selling shares as investment, you shall not get the benefit of STT deduction.                                  Zero coupon bond      The CBDT has notified zero coupon bond of Rural Electrification Corporation. What is the taxation rule for redemption or sale of these bonds?        Biswarup Saha, Calcutta
                    der section 2 (48), the CBDT has notified the zero coupon bond to be issued by REC in the coming months. According to the notification dated April 8, 2010, the bonds must have a tenure of 10 years; the bonds should be issued on or before March 30, 2011; the number of bonds to be issued is 25 lakh; the amount to be paid on maturity or redemption of the bond will be Rs 30,000; and the total discount given shall be Rs 4,736.25 crore. The sale will be taxable in the hands of the bondholder. There will be short term or long term capital gains tax liability depending on whether the bond is held for less than a year or more. If the bonds are held as stock-in-trade, the difference between the purchase price and the sale price will be considered as business income and will be taxed accordingly.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Mumbai, March 26: The grassroots financier is preparing to raise cash in the most conventional manner  through the capital market.         
	SKS Microfinance, the largest microfinance institution (MFI) in the country, plans to come out with an initial public offering (IPO) of 1.68 crore shares to raise close to Rs 1,000 crore. Investors in SKS include venture capital firm Sequoia and N.R. Narayana Murthys Catamaran Management Services.        
	The IPO of SKS comes at a time when the countrys largest foreign bank  Standard Chartered  is planning to raise up to $1 billion through an Indian Depository Receipts issue.        
	SKS, founded by former McKinsey amp; Co management consultant Vikram Akula, provides small loans exclusively to poor women, mostly in rural areas.         
	These loans are provided to such members essentially for use in their small businesses or other income-generating activities and not for personal consumption. The company is the largest MFI in India in terms of total value of loans outstanding, number of borrowers and number of branches, according to the October 2009 Crisil report titled India Top 50 Microfinance Institutions. It is a non-banking finance company.         
	SKS has already filed a draft red herring prospectus with Sebi.        
	Sequoia Capital and SKS Mutual Benefit Trust plan to offload 93.46 lakh shares through the IPO. SKS will also offer a fresh tranche of over 74 lakh shares as part of the issue. The IPO proceeds will be used to raise the companys capital base and help it meet lending requirements.        
	Market circles said the maiden offering was likely to be successful provided the pricing was right. The issue being first from an MFI, there will be no benchmark against which we can judge the price. However, with the government laying stress on financial inclusion and the rural sector holding potential, there should be a good response, an analyst said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | US draws up plan to sell Citi stake 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      US draws up plan to sell Citi stake 
                            
	Washington, April 26 (Reuters): The US treasury said it was launching a plan to sell its 7.7 billion share stake in Citigroup in an orderly fashion, another step in the withdrawal of the government as a major stakeholder in the company.        
	The treasury has given Morgan Stanley, its sales agent, discretionary authority to sell up to 1.5 billion common shares under certain parameters set out in a pre-arranged written trading plan.        
	It expected to provide Morgan Stanley with the authority to sell more shares after the initial amount.         
	The US government owns 27 per cent of the banks shares, a stake it acquired through $45 billion in bailouts to strengthen the banks capital base in 2008 and 2009. Citi has paid back $20 billion in preferred shares, but another $25 billion was converted to common stock last year.        
	Shares of Citi fell 1.7 per cent to $4.77 in premarket trade shortly after the treasurys announcement. If the shares are sold around that price, the treasury could still make a profit of around $12 billion on its Citi common stock holdings, as it acquired the shares at a conversion price of $3.25 each.         
	The treasury did not disclose the parameters determining the share sale. However, the Morgan Stanley pre-set trading plan does not include the treasurys holdings of Citigroup Trust Preferred Securities nor warrants to purchase Citi common stock.        
	Under the treasurys sales agreement with Morgan Stanley, the bank can earn between $23.577 million and about $134 million for selling all 7.7 billion shares. The treasury will pay Morgan $0.003 for each Citi share sold electronically and $0.0175 for each share sold via other methods.        
	Greece plan        
	Germany called for a financial rescue package to be ready for Greece by a May 19 debt deadline after uncertainty over the terms and implementation of the aid package pushed Athens borrowing costs up to a 12-year high.         
	Greeces efforts to reassure investors that aid would arrive in time to avert the euro zones first sovereign debt default proved unconvincing, and there were signs a 45-billion-euro ($60.49 billion) EU-IMF aid package would have to be bigger.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Anil knocks on PM door in search of gas
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Anil knocks on PM door in search of gas
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Ambani in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 12: Anil Ambani today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and is understood to have discussed with him the need for gas to run the Dadri power project in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Though Anil refused to divulge the details of the meeting that lasted for nearly an hour, sources said the junior Ambani had referred to the Supreme Courts suggestion to work out a new gas sharing agreement with brother Mukesh.         
	The apex court had scrapped the clause in the family pact under which Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries was to supply 28 million standard cubic metres of gas a day (mmscmd) at a price of $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) to Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Natural Resources Ltd.        
	According to the Supreme Court, the gas belongs to the government, and RIL is an operator. RIL is bound to sell the gas at a price set by the government to recipients identified by the Centre as part of its gas utilisation policy.         
	The courts suggestion is expected to see the two brothers hammering out a new agreement for gas supply to RNRL at the government-determined price of $4.2 per mBtu.         
	However, the governments gas utilisation policy has given priority to power projects that have already been set up or are nearing completion.         
	Since the Dadri project is yet to take off, it will be difficult for Anil to ensure the availability of gas.        
	Sources said todays meeting was to assure the Prime Minister of the need for RNRL to source the gas and use it for power generation.        
	Anil needs his companies to secure gas and ramp up power production, especially after the Tatas limited their power supplies to his distribution networks.         
	Earlier in the day, Anil had an hour-long meeting with the Prime Ministers private secretary T. K. A. Nair.         
	After the Supreme Court verdict, Anil had said, We now look forward to an expeditious and successful renegotiation with Reliance Industries within the stipulated period of six weeks to secure gas supply for the groups power plants.

          R.SURYAMURTHY                          Big plans                                  
	New Delhi, June 6: State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) plans to generate nuclear power in a joint venture with Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL).        
	The two firms are expected to sign an agreement by August. NPCIL will hold a 51 per cent stake in the venture.        
	The details of the agreement are being worked out. Besides greenfield projects, we are also looking at picking up equity in NPCILs upcoming ventures. Our partnership in a project will depend upon its viability, IOC chairman B.M. Bansal said.        
	The projects, for which investment proposals are being considered, are a 2X1000 megawatt (MW) unit at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu, a 2X700MW Kakrapar unit in Gujarat and a 2X700MW project at Rawatbhata, Rajasthan.         
	Sources said the PSU oil firm was in negotiation with NPCIL for equity stakes in projects which had either been completed or were nearing completion. These include the Rawatbhata 5 and 6 (2X220MW) and the Kudankulam 1 and 2 units (2X1000 MW).        
	We will look at the viability of each project and carry out a detailed financial and technical analysis of the proposal before firming up the choice of power plant. After we decide on the exact level of investment, we will approach our board again for investment approval, sources said.        
	According to industry standards, the cost of setting up a megawatt of nuclear power entails an investment of Rs 8-10 crore.        
	The foray into nuclear power is part of a blueprint drawn up by Bansal to make IOC an integrated energy firm. The company has already ventured into wind power and joined hands with the Tatas for a thermal plant to be set up in Orissa for the Paradip refinery and petrochemical complex. The Tatas will hold a 74 per cent stake in the venture. IOC has commissioned its first wind farm at Kandla, Gujarat, which generates 21MW.        
	NPCIL aims to increase capacity to 10,000MW during the 11th Five Year Plan (2007-12) from about 4,000MW.        
	The government plans to build 15 nuclear power plants to produce 20,000MW by 2020 from the current level of 4000MW, which constitutes about 3 per cent of the installed capacity in the country.

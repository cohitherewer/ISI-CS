	Calcutta, July 19: NMDC Ltd and Coal India Ltd (CIL) may form a joint venture to develop the Deocha-Pachami coal block in Birbhum.        
	CIL has sought the permission of the coal ministry to develop the block, one of the largest in India, with reserves of around 2 billion tonnes.         
	The steel ministry has also written to the coal ministry to push for NMDCs participation. NMDC is Indias largest iron ore miner and exporter.        
	The block was reserved under the state dispensation route whereby the coal ministry would have allotted it to a state government agency  in this case the West Bengal Mineral Trading amp; Development Corporation (WBMTDC).        
	NMDC and the WBMTDC had signed an agreement in November 2008 to jointly develop the block. However, Bengal has not received any coal block from the Centre after December 2007.        
	Rana Som, chairman and managing director of NMDC, said, I have taken the initiative along with CIL chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya to develop the mine so that it helps everyone. We will set up a joint venture where both companies will have an equal share. He said NMDC was keen to honour its commitment to the Bengal government. We also want the WBMTDC to participate in the venture, he said.        
	Som said a separate venture was needed since production would be as high as 30 million tonnes.         
	NMDCs expertise in removing the overburden (the earth matter over the mineral) will be of help in Deocha-Pachami since coal is hidden beneath a layer of basalt rock. The block is spread over 9.7 square kilometres.        
	Sabyasachi Sen, chairman of the WBMTDC, said the Bengal government was in favour of an equal joint venture for the project. The state chief secretary has written to the coal ministry about it. We have no problem if CIL joins in as coal will be available to the state, Sen said.        
	Ore pipeline        
	NMDC will build a Rs 3,000-crore pipeline from Bailadila in Chhattisgarh to Visakhapatnam to transport iron ore. The pipeline will be ready by 2012, Som said.

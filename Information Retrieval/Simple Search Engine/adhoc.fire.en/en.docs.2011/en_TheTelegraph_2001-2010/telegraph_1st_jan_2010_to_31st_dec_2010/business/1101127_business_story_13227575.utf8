The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stake reshuffle at Tech Mahindra
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stake reshuffle at Tech Mahindra
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 26: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M amp;M) today said it would acquire an additional 5.5 per cent from BT Group Plc (BT) in Tech Mahindra Ltd.        
	The acquisition will take M amp;Ms stake to 48.27 per cent in Tech Mahindra. For the quarter ended September 30, BT held around 30 per cent in the IT company.        
	The company has agreed to acquire 5.5 per cent of the equity shares of Tech Mahindra from BT over time through an inter-se transfer among qualifying promoters at a market related price, in accordance with the Sebi regulations, M amp;M said in a filing to the stock exchange today.        
	Though financial details of the deal were not disclosed, M amp;M said it would waive rights to buy BTs remaining stake in the software services provider, and the agreement would automatically terminate if BTs stake in Tech Mahindra fell below 10 per cent, the filing said.        
	This effectively means that BT can sell its remaining stake to other investors.         
	However, at current prices, the stake sale could fetch BT over Rs 432 crore.        
	In a separate statement, BT said while Tech Mahindra would continue to be a key strategic supplier to the group and further sales might be considered in the future, it expects to continue to have a shareholding in Tech Mahindra for some time.        
	Market circles said though the stake sale news by BT did raise apprehensions that Tech Mahindra would not be the preferred supplier to the multinational, these concerns were assuaged after BT clarified that Tech Mahindra would remain a key strategic supplier.        
	BT and M amp;M established the joint venture in 1986 called Mahindra British Telecom. The name was later changed to Tech Mahindra.        
	The company provides solutions and services to the telecommunications industry.         
	It posted total revenues of Rs 4,625.4 crore in the year ended March 31. It serves telecom service providers, telecom equipment manufacturers and software vendors.         
	In April last year, Tech Mahindra was declared as the highest bidder for Satyam Computer Services (now Mahindra Satyam) when it offered a price of Rs 58 per share.         
	The M amp;M group is now engaged in the process of merging Mahindra Satyam and Tech Mahindra.         
	Tech Mahindra holds around 43 per cent in Mahindra Satyam.

	New Delhi, Jan. 8: The much awaited announcement on the launch date for goods and service tax (GST) was pushed back today as the Centre and state governments were at odds over the compensation on central sales tax.        
	At a meeting with Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today, state finance ministers sought adequate compensation from the Centre for the loss in revenue because of a reduction in central sales tax before any further discussion on GST could be resumed.        
	Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who is the chairman of the empowered committee of state finance ministers, told reporters that they would meet Mukherjee later this month to talk about compensation and a roll-out date for GST.        
	He said a consensus on compensation would facilitate the launch of GST.         
	When merchandise manufactured in one state is sold in another state, central sales tax accrues to the state where the manufacturing is done.        
	Central sales tax is down to 2 per cent in 2009-10 from 4 per cent in 2006-07, as part of a process of gradual elimination with the launch of the GST. The Centre is due to compensate the states for the revenues lost because of the reduction.        
	States are cautious about GST because the amount of compensation as well as the mechanism for payment are yet to be determined for the earlier periods.        
	Officials told The Telegraph that the government had estimated the arrears for 2008-09 at around Rs 950 crore and Rs 14,000 crore for this fiscal. While the Centre has agreed to pay Rs 5,000 crore as compensation out of the Rs 14,000 crore, 50 per cent of the remaining Rs 9,000 crore have to be borne by the states. The rest will be paid as arrears, the officials added.        
	Gujarat finance minister Saurabh Patel said outstanding differences with the central government on compensation were making some states jittery.         
	GST is Indias most ambitious indirect tax reform, which seeks to stitch together a common market and reduce costs by replacing the current fragmented tax regime.         
	Former Union finance minister P. Chidambaram had fixed April 2010 as the date to roll out GST, but Mukherjee last month said it would not be possible to meet the deadline.

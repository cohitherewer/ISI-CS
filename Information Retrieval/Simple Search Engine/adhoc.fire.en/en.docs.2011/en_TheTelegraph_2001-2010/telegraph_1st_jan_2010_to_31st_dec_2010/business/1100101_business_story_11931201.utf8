          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          R.S. Agarwal in Calcutta on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 31: Emami is scouting for overseas acquisitions to grow its paper business, group joint chairman R.S. Agarwal said today.        
	Besides the US and Canada, it is looking for opportunities in Australia and a few Asean countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.        
	We can either acquire companies or even set up new plants depending on what is on offer, he said on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting here today.        
	Emami Paper is the largest newsprint manufacturer in the country. An overseas deal is expected to help it to expand in the writing and printing paper market.        
	The company is ready to invest Rs 1,500-2,000 crore in the venture, which will be capable of producing 500-600 tonnes of paper per day.        
	Ballarpur Industries, Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills Ltd and JK Paper are some of the leading manufacturers of writing, printing and photocopy papers. However, the companies are finding it hard to source wood-based pulp because of the paucity of cultivable land.        
	ITC has been trying to set up a plant for the last five years but has been unable to do so. Instead, it has been increasing the capacity of its existing unit at Bhadrachalam. Emami had wanted to set up a plant in Bengal but failed to procure land.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Close watch                                  
	Mumbai, July 1: A Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report today asked central banks and other supervisors to focus on mitigating systemic risks and watch out for the emergence of new ones in the face of rapid financial innovations.         
	It also made a strong case for co-ordination among central banks globally while formulating their stimulus exit strategies.        
	In its Report on Currency and Finance, which focused on the recent financial crisis, economists in the central bank said since the onset of the crisis, the need to focus on systemic risk was increasingly recognised and that regulators needed to look at system-wide risk and not just individual institution-specific risk.        
	It pointed out that to ensure financial stability, macro-economic and supervisory policies needed to be redesigned with a focus on mitigating the risks. All important financial institutions, markets and instruments should be subject to an appropriate degree of regulation depending on their local and global systemic importance, it said.        
	The supervisors need to take due cognisance of the increasing interconnectedness of the regulated and unregulated segments of the financial system. There is a need for regulation staying ahead of the curve, and for continually upgrading the skills and instruments for financial regulation and supervision,it observed.        
	The report said if the unrest in the global economy continued, it could impact jobs in the countrys labour-intensive sectors and might even affect domestic demand.

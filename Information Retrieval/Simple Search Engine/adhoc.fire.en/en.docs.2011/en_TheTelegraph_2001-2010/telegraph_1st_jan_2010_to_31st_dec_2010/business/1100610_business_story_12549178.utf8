The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Float rule tweak an option

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with minister of state S.S. Palanimanickam (centre) and finance secretary Ashok Chawla in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, June 9: The government is open to modifying the rule  notified last week  that mandates at least 25 per cent public holding in listed firms.         
	The ministry of finance and the disinvestment department are receiving different points of view from PSUs and other stakeholders. So, if there is any need for modification or correction, that will be done, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said.         
	Last week, the government had announced that all listed firms should increase their public holdings to 25 per cent in a phased manner, with at least 5 per cent equity dilution every year till the threshold limit is reached.         
	Many experts, market analysts and listed companies have expressed their reservations.        
	The new norms come at a time most public offers, including those of PSUs and multinationals such as Standard Chartered Bank, received a poor response from retail investors, a trend attributed by top banker and HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh to over-pricing.         
	Analysts said the new public holding norm could spark a flurry of share sales by promoters that could increase market volatility in the short term.         
	The finance ministry had first mooted 25 per cent public stake in 2008, but changes in the regulations were announced only last week.        
	According to the new rules, the non-compliance of public exposure conditions could lead to the delisting of an entity.        
	Chawla said delisting was the biggest penalty for errant companies. There is delisting as the biggest penalty. Not automatically, but there is a possibility.         
	He said the government had no intention to raise the divestment target of Rs 40,000 crore for this fiscal, following the new rules.        
	The two issues (divestment target and 25 per cent public stake) are different. The divestment target given in the budget speech remains intact. So, it is not a direct or indirect devise to increase the divestment target for the current year, he said.        
	Meanwhile, divestment secretary Sumit Bose said any divestment in Indian Oil, in which the government has over 78 per cent stake, was not on the cards.         
	He said the government was on track to mop up Rs 40,000 crore estimated through selloffs in this fiscal.

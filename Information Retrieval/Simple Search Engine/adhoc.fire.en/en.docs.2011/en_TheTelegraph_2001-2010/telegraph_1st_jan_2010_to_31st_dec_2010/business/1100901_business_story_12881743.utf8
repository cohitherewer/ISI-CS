The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Best quarterly growth in 3 years
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Best quarterly growth in 3 years
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The economy grew 8.8 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal, the fastest in nearly three years, on the back of strong manufacturing growth and better farm output as the government chiselled away at stimulus measures.        
	Manufacturing has registered a satisfactory growth, which means there has been more employment generation and job creation. We shall have to reach the 4 per cent target in agriculture to have sustainable growth. I am quite confident that GDP (gross domestic product) growth will not be less than 8.5 per cent to 8.75 per cent, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said.        
	Manufacturing, which bore the brunt of the slowdown that began in 2008-09, grew 12.4 per cent in the April-June quarter against 3.8 per cent in the same period last fiscal. Agriculture and allied activities expanded 2.8 per cent against 1.9 per cent a year ago, according to data released by the Central Statistical Organisation today.        
	While finance, insurance, real estate and business services grew 8 per cent in the April-June period this fiscal compared with 11.8 per cent in the same period last year, community, social and personal services expanded 6.7 per cent against 7.6 per cent last year.        
	Notwithstanding a partial withdrawal of stimulus packages, the growth rate at 8.8 per cent is the highest since the 9.73 per cent recorded in the third quarter of 2007-08 (October-December).         
	While the economy clocked an 8.6 per cent growth in the March quarter, it had registered a 6 per cent rise in the same quarter last fiscal.        
	In a partial rollback of stimulus, the government had increased excise duty to 10 per cent in the budget from 8 per cent.         
	Analysts said the data reflected the strength of the countrys recovery from the global financial crisis, but added that the economy might not be able to keep up this pace in the coming months. The growth rates of industrial production and exports, for instance, have started falling.        
	What worried economists the most was the huge divergence between demand side GDP growth and supply side GDP, or consumption growth.        
	Private consumption growth slumped to 0.3 per cent year-on-year in the April-June quarter from 2.6 per cent growth in the January-March quarter, while fixed investment growth dropped to 3.7 per cent from 17.7 per cent.         
	The biggest surprise in todays report is the substantial divergence between the demand side GDP growth (at factor cost) estimated at 8.8 per cent year-on-year and supply side GDP growth (at market prices) estimated at 3.7 per cent. The difference between the two is net indirect taxes. This suggests that taxes are falling while subsidy payments have risen substantially, said Sonal Varma of Nomura Securities.         
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said although the growth rate of manufacturing was likely to be low during the rest of the year, agriculture would register good performance.         
	He pegged the growth rate at over 8.8 per cent this fiscal. It (first quarter GDP growth) is on expected lines. The overall GDP growth in this fiscal would be slightly better than 8.5 per cent as projected earlier, Ahluwalia said.        
	We are skeptical about the next quarter (July-September), as we have seen deceleration in industrial output, Sujan Hajra, an economist with Anand Rathi Financial Services, said.        
	Industrial output in June rose 7.1 per cent from a year earlier, the slowest pace in more than a year and the first time below double digits in nine months.         
	The widespread inflationary pressures pose a downside risk to the growth momentum, Arun Singh, senior economist, Dun amp; Bradstreet India, said.

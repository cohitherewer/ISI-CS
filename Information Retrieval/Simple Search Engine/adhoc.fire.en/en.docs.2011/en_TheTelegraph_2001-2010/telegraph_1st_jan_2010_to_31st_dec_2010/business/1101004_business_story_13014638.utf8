                              STRICT WATCH                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 3 (PTI): Market watchdog Sebi may prescribe a code of conduct for the key executives of market players such as brokerages and merchant bankers to check frauds and probe suspected fraudulent activities.         
	Sebi is also planning to ask the market intermediaries to notify one or more key executives to be held responsible for any violation of norms, so that the entire firm does not face the risk of regulatory actions.        
	Other market players, who may need to follow these guidelines include portfolio managers, mutual funds, depositories, custodians and rating agencies.        
	Sources said the move followed growing concerns over some employees indulging in activities such as fraud against clients, front-running, circular trading and manipulating share prices through rumour mongering.        
	The regulator wants to put in place a mechanism to counter data tampering and data stealing by the staff for the benefit of rivals or other entities.        
	At times, only a few key officials are involved in fraud, but the entire company faces probe and regulatory risks. The regulator is looking into ways for safeguarding the interest of the innocent staff and the overall business interests of the entities.        
	Besides the investors, market players also lose in terms of reputation, regulatory action and at times market share from any fraud committed by their staff, a Sebi official said.        
	The regulator has already got a positive feedback from the market players for the need to prescribe a code of conduct for key employees at various intermediaries.        
	A Sebi-appointed committee, comprising representatives from various market intermediaries, has suggested the need for such a code.        
	The regulator might consider issuing broad guidelines, which every intermediary would have to follow while framing the code for their employees, the official added.        
	Market players will need to inform Sebi periodically about the compliance to the code, while the regulator will check from time to time on the status.        
	These guidelines along with a pending proposal for a common defaulter database for all market players will help to a great extent in checking fraud and in investigations of market manipulating activities, sources said.        
	The database will provide a one-stop reference point for all market players and make it easy for them to identify a person or institution having defaulted in the past.        
	The capital market defaulter database is being proposed to be set up on the lines of Cibil, a repository of credit information of all commercial and consumer borrowers in the country for the benefit of banks and other lenders.

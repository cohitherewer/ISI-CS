	 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The Association of Mutual Funds in India has advised fund houses not to accept third-party payments in mutual funds (with a few exceptions) with effect from November 15. The move is part of an effort to check fraudulent activities by agents and distributors, who have been found collecting cheques from investors and depositing them for investments in their own names.                             
	 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The corporate affairs ministry has asked the registrar of companies (RoC) to look into the books of Unitech Wireless for any anomaly in the Rs 6,120-crore investment by Norway-based Telenor Group. The RoC will also see if the amount for which the stake was sold to Telenor was justified.                            
	 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The industry ministry is not in favour of allowing foreign airlines to buy stakes in Indian carriers. The department of industrial policy and promotion believes that no other major country permits investment by foreign airlines in their domestic operators.                             
	 New Delhi, Sept. 19: Tata Motors is mulling a price hike of its passenger cars  Indica and Indigo  by a significant amount with effect from October 1 to minimise the impact of rising input costs, particularly tyres.                            
	 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The government has proposed a consolidated monthly salary of Rs 3 lakh for market regulator Sebis new chairman. This translates into an annual package of Rs 36 lakh for the Sebi chief.

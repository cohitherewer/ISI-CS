	Mumbai, April 30: Tata Tea today joined a growing list of companies announcing stock splits. The company has sub-divided its equity shares of face value of Rs 10 each to Re 1 apiece.        
	This decision was taken at todays board meeting. Companies that recently went for stock splits have been getting a positive response on the bourses. It is believed that a sub-division of shares stokes demand for a scrip. Also, a split increases the outstanding shares and improves a stocks liquidity.         
	Considering its current valuation, the stock split in Tata Tea will certainly be good news for retail investors, an analyst from a domestic brokerage said.        
	Sterlite Industries, which brought down the face value of its shares to Re 1 apiece from Rs 2 each, Engineers India Ltd and Jayshree Tea amp; Industries are a few companies to split their shares        
	HDFC  the countrys largest player in the housing finance segment  recently announced that its board would be meeting on May 3 to consider a stock split.         
	Last month, Tata Tea had signed up with cola company PepsiCo Inc to explore the potential of forming a joint venture that will focus on non-carbonated ready-to-drink beverages in the health and wellness categories.         
	The company had then said definitive agreements for the joint venture would be finalised over the next few months. Over the past few years, Tata Tea has transformed itself from a plantation player to a branded beverages company that aspires to compete with the likes of Coca-Cola.        
	The Tata Tea scrip gained 3.22 per cent to close at Rs 1,054.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today. The announcement of the split came after the trading hours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panel to recast financial rules
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Panel to recast financial rules
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 14: The government will soon set up a panel to rewrite and clean up financial regulations, making them simpler and doing away with multiple rules.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today told a conclave of global business leaders here that India would align global financial rules with the local environment.        
	The government has decided to set up a fiscal sector legislative reforms commission to rewrite and clean up the financial sector laws, Mukherjee said.        
	The simplified rules are expected to give more importance to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in implementing financial laws, except banking, sources said.         
	Major economies, including the US, are bringing in sweeping reforms in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.         
	Earlier this year, US president Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that requires all standardised swaps to be centrally cleared and traded on exchanges, and establishes a new regime for dealers and major swap participants.         
	Derivative products, which could not be fathomed by most buyers, were the main cause for the failure of Wall Street brokerages in 2008.         
	As part of the financial reforms, India has (also) decided to set up an apex-level Financial Stability and Development Council to strengthen and institutionalise the mechanism for maintaining financial stability, the minister said.         
	This council will undertake macro prudential supervision of the economy, including the functioning of large financial conglomerates and address inter-regulatory coordination issues.        
	The formation of the super regulator, as the council has been dubbed, was triggered after stock market watchdog Sebi and insurance regulator IRDA locked horns over the jurisdiction of Ulips.        
	In April, Sebi banned 14 life insurance firms from issuing fresh Ulips  insurance plans where the money collected from consumers can be invested in any proportion between equity and debt markets. This was followed by the IRDA asking life insurers to ignore the Sebi order.         
	The finance ministry had to broker peace between the two and proposed the setting up of the council to settle inter-regulatory issues.         
	Prudent banking policies have helped India to escape unscathed from a string of global bank failures, which spun the world economy into recession in 2008. Indias growth also slowed down to an average 7 per cent over 2008-09.        
	Growth optimism        
	At a gathering of around 700 CEOs and leaders from 50 countries, including Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, here to attend the India Economic Summit, Mukherjee said India would try to quickly leapfrog to double-digit growth as it had managed to pull itself out of the worst financial meltdown in decades. The summit is organised by the World Economic Forum.        
	The challenge now is to quickly revert to the high GDP growth path of nine per cent plus and even find the means to cross the double-digit growth barrier in the coming year or two, the minister said, adding that the economy was on a path to rapid recovery with the latest quarterly data showing an expansion of 8.8 per cent.        
	The manufacturing sector has been showing buoyancy reminiscent of the pre-slowdown years, though some concerns on its growth momentum have emerged in the last month or two, Mukherjee said. Industrial output growth slowed to 6.9 per cent in August and declined further to 4.4 per cent in September from 15.2 per cent in July.         
	However, Mukherjee said the macro-economic outlook was strong and the country would register robust growth in the coming years.         
	Savings and investment rates have reached levels that even 10 years ago would have been dismissed as a pipedream for India. On this important dimension, India is now completely part of the worlds fast-growing economies, he said.         
	India has one of the highest savings rate at nearly 36 per cent and an investment rate of over 37 per cent.

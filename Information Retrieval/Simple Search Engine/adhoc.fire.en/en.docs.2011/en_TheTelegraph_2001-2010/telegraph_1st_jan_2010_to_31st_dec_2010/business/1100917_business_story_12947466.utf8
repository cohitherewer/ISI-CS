          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 16: Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Ltd (BAPL), the company that will build an airport city at Andal in Burdwan district, will formally start work from tomorrow.        
	The company today appointed Simplex Infrastructure Ltd to build the airport, expected to be operational by April 2012.        
	The master plan and design has been prepared by Changi Airports Planners and Engineers, an affiliated company of Changi Airports India, which holds a 26 per cent stake in BAPL.        
	The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation has given around 1,800 acres to BAPL, in a successful instance of a large tract of land acquired without much resistance.         
	BAPL requires another 300 acres in the first phase for an information technology park, light engineering industries and residential and commercial projects such as hotels, malls and offices.         
	However, BAPL will not wait for the last tranche of land. The groundbreaking ceremony will take place tomorrow coinciding with Vishwakarma puja.         
	In adherence to our commitment to the state government, we have prioritised commencement of the airport construction, BAPL director Partha Ghosh said.         
	The airport is a regional one and has been designed to handle aircraft such as Airbus 320, Airbus 319 and Boeing 737. It will have a runway length of 2,800 metres that can be extended to 3,300 metres to handle larger aircraft in the future.        
	Changi Airports International, Singapore, has prepared a detailed route development. The company will also be responsible for the operations and management of the airport in the initial period. BAPL is in talks with some leading airline operators about the route plan so that they can put the airport on their map.        
	A delegation of Changi Airports International went to Writers Buildings today and met the chief minister and chief secretary.        
	They are ready to start construction soon. The land for the project has been acquired. They are happy, chief secretary Ardhendu Sen said at the Writers Buildings this evening.

	New Delhi, Dec. 6: France today lobbied for the opening up of multi-brand retail and insurance, heightening the pressure on India to relax its policy and allow greater FDI in the two politically sensitive sectors. Only last month, US President Barack Obama had made similar demands during his visit.        
	If it was possible to develop activities in insurance and retailif the Indian authorities consider it sensible to open up the sectors, I know French companies will significantly expand their activities. Everything is about give and take (in a) two-way street, said French minister of economy and finance Christine Lagarde, who is part of the delegation accompanying President Nicolas Sarkozy.        
	Lagarde said she shared with commerce minister Anand Sharma the way retail worked in France, where a regulatory framework was in place so that the farmers interest was protected.        
	Sharma said forming a policy is a calibrated procedure, and the feedback after consultations with the stakeholders had been very useful. Observers said Sharma was ready to place the French proposal before the stakeholders without any commitments.        
	Lagarde said investments by French companies in India could go beyond 10 billion euros by 2012 if sectors such as insurance and multi-brand retail were liberalised.        
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said as far as insurance is concerned, the government has initiated the parliamentary process to create a legislation to go for a 49 per cent FDI in the sector.         
	At present, FDI up to 26 per cent is allowed in insurance. Opposition parties as well as some Congress allies are believed to be against opening up this vital sector. Present FDI regime allows 51 per cent foreign investment in single brand retail and 100 per cent in wholesale cash and carry, but none in multi-brand.        
	Global retail firms such as Wal-Mart, Carrefour, Tesco, Metro AG are keen to enter.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: ONGC Ltd has quit a gas block in Trinidad and Tobago after it failed to engage a partner following the withdrawal of Mittal Investment Sarl from the project.        
	We tried to get an international energy firm as partner but did not succeed, so we had no option but to exit the block, an ONGC official said.        
	Mittal Investment Sarl, a Lakshmi Mittal company, had decided to exit the project in June stating the prospects and the global economic environment did not justify this investment.        
	ONGC officials said several global exploration and production firms such as Centrica, RWE Dea AG of Germany, British Gas and Repsol had expressed interest in the project but abstained from making a formal offer.        
	ONGC-Mittal Energy Ltd  a joint venture of ONGC Videsh Ltd and Mittal Investment  had in 2007 won the offshore block North Coast Marine Area-2 (NCMA-2), which is estimated to hold reserves of 2 trillion cubic feet.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Costly affair                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: A hike in petrol prices looks imminent after the winter session of Parliament ends next week because of a spurt in global crude oil prices.         
	The government is also expected to take a call soon on increasing diesel rates.        
	The government needs to take a view on diesel pricing. They should take a decision as quickly as possible, oil secretary S. Sundareshan said.        
	He said the government would not intervene in fixing petrol prices, which had been deregulated in June. On diesel price hike, he said, it will be a political decision.        
	PSU oil firms are planning to increase petrol prices because of an increase in global crude oil prices. Petrol prices will be raised after the current session of Parliament ends on December 13, oil ministry officials said here.        
	The three state-owned firms IOC, HPCL and BPCL are currently losing about Rs 2.40 per litre on petrol. The oil firms could hike the petrol prices by about Rs 2 per litre.        
	Global crude oil prices over the past few days have hovered around $90 a barrel, the highest since 2008.         
	Considering the winter in Europe and the festive season, there will be an increase in demand and crude oil prices will remain high. The consumers have to be prepared to share a part of the burden, Sundareshan said.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee yesterday to discuss the possibility of a meeting of the empowered group of ministers next week on diesel prices.

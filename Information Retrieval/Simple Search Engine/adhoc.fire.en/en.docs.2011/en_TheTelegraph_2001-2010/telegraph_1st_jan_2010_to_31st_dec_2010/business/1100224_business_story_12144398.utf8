          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 23: The Life Insurance Corporation of India and other institutions today sprang to the rescue of Rural Electrification Corporations (REC) follow-on public offering (FPO) which drew poor response from retail investors.        
	The issue  which appeared to be floundering yesterday  closed today and was oversubscribed three times.         
	Data show that against an offer size of 1,7173,2000 shares, the FPO received 5,3521,2030 bids, thus showing a subscription of 3.12 times. Most of the bids (23.26 crore shares) came in at Rs 205 per share and over 16.58 crore shares received bids at Rs 206 per share.         
	Although further subscription details were not available, it is learnt that the LIC bid for over 14 crore shares, totalling around Rs 3,000 crore. The qualified institutional buyer portion saw 9,3472,200 bids against 8,5691,000 shares reserved for the category.         
	However, the participation of the retail investor was disappointing.        
	Data available from the National Stock Exchange showed that this portion was the only one that wasnt fully subscribed. REC received retail investor bids for 2,013,180 shares against the 5,998,3700 shares reserved for this category.

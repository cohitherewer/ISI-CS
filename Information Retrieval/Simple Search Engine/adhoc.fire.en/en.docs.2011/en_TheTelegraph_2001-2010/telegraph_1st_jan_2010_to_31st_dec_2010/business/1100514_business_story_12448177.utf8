          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Growth route                                  
	Calcutta, May 13: Yes Bank plans to foray into the retail loan business, including credit cards, personal and home loans.        
	The first five years after launch were our start-up phase. The next five years till 2015 will be our growth phase. We want to grow our retail and SME portfolio to as much as 20 per cent each of our total business, said Somak Ghosh, co-founder and group president (corporate finance and development banking), Yes Bank.        
	According to Ghosh, the bank hopes to grow its total business to Rs 1,50,000 crore by March 2015 from Rs 22,800 crore at the end of March 2010.         
	This translates into an annually compounded growth of 35 per cent. The growth target is achievable as we have grown to Rs 22,800 crore in the first five years, he said.         
	At present, more than 90 per cent of the banks business come from large and mid-sized firms.        
	For the retail segment, the bank plans to come out with personal and home loans for customers such as lawyers, who are generally avoided by other banks. We shall customise products, which no one else is offering, for our target client groups, he said.        
	For salaried people, the bank will start with those who have salary accounts with it.         
	The bank is working with Nokia to offer money transfer through cellphones. A trial project is being worked out at Pune and we shall launch it soon, Ghosh said.        
	Yes Bank, which has 140 branches across the country, will have 750 branches by 2015.         
	The number of ATM kiosks will increase to 3,000 from less than 300 now, Ghosh said. We are in talks with the US-based First Data Corporation for an ATM tie-up.        
	First Data will set up 3,000 ATM kiosks on an outsourced model. The US firm will later take over our existing 200 offsite ATM kiosks, Ghosh said.         
	The bank is focusing on mobilising low-cost current and savings account deposits to improve profitability. Such deposits, along with retail fixed deposits together account for 10.8 per cent of the total deposits. We aim to increase them to 40 per cent, Ghosh said.         
	At present, the banks net interest margin is 3.2 per cent.

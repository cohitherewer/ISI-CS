The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cash prop for food processing
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cash prop for food processing
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 8: The Centre has set a target to attract investments worth Rs 1 lakh crore in food processing by 2015.        
	We aim to register a growth of around 20 per cent and value addition of around 35 per cent by 2015, Union food processing minister Subodh Kant Sahai said on the sidelines of a business summit on the Northeast here today. In the last five years, domestic food processing has grown nearly 10 per cent.        
	Sahai said his ministry was concerned with the goods and services tax (GST).         
	Food cannot be taxed. Ours is the only ministry to have brought down food related taxes to a negligible level. To further this motive, I am interacting with empowered committee on GST and also with Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta who is heading the committee. With GST coming up, our effort will be to push the food taxes in the range of 0-4 per cent and restrict them there, the minister said.        
	He said the states needed to come out with specific state-oriented policies to take advantage of the prospects in food processing.         
	We have come up with several holistic policies. For instance, one of the major concerns is protecting the shelf life of a product. So, we are extending a subsidy of Rs 10 crore to set up an integrated cold chain with forward and backward linkages, he said.         
	The food processing ministry is also hopeful of setting up 30 mega food parks by next year.                                             
	Seventy per cent of almost six parks have been completed and another four parks are in the process of completion. We also plan to have one food park in each of the Northeastern states, he said.        
	Last week, Sahai had said the ministry was trying to lead a campaign for motivating the market. According to him, the APMC (agriculture produce marketing committee) act makes it difficult for farmers to promote raw material.         
	Also, third party investment is required in farms in the form of seeds and fertilisers, he had said.         
	The need of the hour is market-driven farming to enable an assured income for our farmers and help them grow. The states should look out for such investors, he said.

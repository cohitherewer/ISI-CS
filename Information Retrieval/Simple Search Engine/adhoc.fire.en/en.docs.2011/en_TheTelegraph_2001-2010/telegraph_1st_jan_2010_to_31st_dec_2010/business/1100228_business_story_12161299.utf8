	New Delhi, Feb. 27: A day after the budget, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said he took a risk of facing inflation in raising excise duty across the board to mobilise resources, but expressed confidence that the impact would be absorbed.        
	I do agree that my tax proposals (excise duty increase from 8 per cent to 10 per cent on non-oil products) will have some inflationary ingredient. It will be about 0.41 per cent. But in course of time it will be absorbed, Mukherjee said at an interaction with members of industry associations.        
	Mukherjee said the purpose of the duty hike was to raise additional resources and, therefore, he took the risk of having a little inflationary pressure.        
	Trinamul Congress and the DMK, the two prominent allies of the UPA government, have joined the Opposition in asking the government to roll back the petrol and diesel price hike.        
	He said wholesale price inflation, currently at 8.56 per cent, is primarily because of rise in prices of wheat, sugar, pulses and rice, which could be tackled not through monetary policy but by improving supply.        
	Revenue secretary Sunil Mitra said the government would earn Rs 14,000 crore from the excise duty hike and Rs 26,000 crore from petro duties.        
	Mukherjee has raised customs duty on petrol and diesel to 7.5 per cent from 2.5 per cent, while excise duty was raised by Re 1 a litre to Rs 14.35 and Rs 4.60 per litre on non-branded (normal) petrol and diesel, respectively. He also imposed a 5 per cent import duty on crude (currently nil), a move that would impact refiners such as Reliance Industries and Essar Oil with their input cost going up.        
	However, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, said the rate of inflation would remain high for sometime and would ease after three to four months.        
	I think the finance ministry has done its bit to reduce fiscal deficit, so I think we are well situated to bring the inflation rate down over the next three to four months, Montek said in an interview to a private television channel.        
	Direct tax code        
	The finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today assured India Inc that the government would come out with a revised direct taxes code (DTC) draft and seek their comments before finalising it.         
	We will prepare a revised draft (of DTC) and that will be placed in the public domain for getting comments...but that will be for a shorter period, he said.        
	The government, he further said, would consider suggestion of the industry to raise savings limit for personal income tax payers next year.        
	At present, individuals can seek tax exemption on savings up to Rs 1 lakh in a year, in addition to Rs 20,000 in infrastructure bonds.

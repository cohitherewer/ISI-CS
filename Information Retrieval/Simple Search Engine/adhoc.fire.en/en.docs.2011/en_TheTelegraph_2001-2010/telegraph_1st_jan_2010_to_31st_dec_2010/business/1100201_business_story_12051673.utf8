	The SBI holds 98 per cent in the associate bank.         
	The merger will just be a technical restructuring of the subsidiary, he said, adding that the one with the State Bank of Saurashtra was very smooth. On combining the remaining five subsidiaries with the parent, Bhatt said, Well take them one by one.         
	He was here to set up a customer services centre at Sanyasidanga village  the 1,00,000th unbanked village adopted by the bank. The SBI also set up four branches here, taking the total number in the Murshidabad district to 50.

	Calcutta, Aug. 3: Life insurance agents are pressing customers to buy existing unit-linked pension plans with single premium and redeem them fully after a lock-in period of three years as a deadline banning withdrawals till maturity looms.         
	Come September, investments in unit-linked pension plans cannot be withdrawn till maturity. On maturity, policyholders can encash only a third of the accumulated fund. They will have to buy an annuity with the remaining fund value.         
	The rush to sell the pension plans  seen more among LIC agents  has led to insurers reporting a hefty 76.55 per cent growth in premium income from new policy sales in the first three months of the current financial year compared with the same period last year.         
	Sales of individual single premium policies of all life insurers, including the LIC, more than trebled to Rs 8,455.03 crore from Rs 2,749.24 crore recorded during April-June quarter last year. Sales of individual regular premium policies, on the other hand, grew only 32.97 per cent to Rs 9,944.11 crore.        
	Single premium policy business of LIC grew a massive 226.33 per cent to Rs 7,862.88 crore in the April-June period this year from Rs 2409.49 crore last year, primarily on the back of an increase in the sales of Market Plus-1, a unit-linked pension plan.         
	After the roaring success of Market Plus launched in July 2006, the LIC relaunched Market Plus-1 in August 2008.        
	Single premium policies have caught the fancy of investors because the charges in these policies are much lower than that in a regular premium policy. Besides, the surrender charges on single premium policies are also much lower than in a regular premium plan, said a senior official of a private sector life insurer on condition of anonymity.

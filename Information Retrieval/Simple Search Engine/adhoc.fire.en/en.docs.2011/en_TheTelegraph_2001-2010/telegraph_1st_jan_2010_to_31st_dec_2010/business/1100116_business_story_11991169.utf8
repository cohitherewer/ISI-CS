The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coca-Cola to pep up investment spread 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Coca-Cola to pep up investment spread 
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Singh: Robust plan				                                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 15: Coca-Cola is likely to scale up investment in India.        
	The company, which had reported growth in thirteen consecutive quarters, is expected to finalise a funding plan for the medium term in the next few months.        
	We are working on it. It is in the drawing board stage, Atul Singh, president and chief executive officer of Coca-Cola India, told The Telegraph.        
	The company, which owns the biggest soft drink brand Thums Up, has spent $250 million in the last three years in India. Total investment, so far, has been $1.1 billion.        
	Singh did not give the amount but indicated that the figure would be higher. The numbers have not been frozen, he said.        
	In the third quarter (July-September), the companys year-on-year sales growth has been 37 per cent in India compared with 15 per cent in China and 3 per cent in Brazil.         
	The last quarter has also been good, though the results are still to be declared.        
	In 2008, Coca-Cola had sold over 420 million cases from a varied portfolio that includes fizzy drinks such as Thums Up, Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, Fanta and Limca, juices Maaza and Minute Maid, packaged drinking water Kinley and Georgia tea and coffee.        
	The company had launched Fanta Apple and energy drink Burn last year. These are available in three cities  Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.        
	While more brands from its global basket are on the way, Coca-Cola wants to expand its existing brands as well.        
	The company also sees potential in packaged beverages. Only 4 per cent of the beverages drunk by Indians are packaged.        
	Coca-Cola, with its head office in Americas Atlanta, has two types of bottling operations in India. Some of the plants are owned by the company, while the rest belong to private entities.        
	Of the 50 plants, two-thirds are owned by Coca-Cola.        
	Along with the company, the private bottlers are likely to raise investments.        
	Coca-Cola, which is the market leader in India followed by PepsiCo, has built on the acquisitions from Parle.         
	The Maaza and Thums Up brands were taken over from Ramesh Chauhan-owned Parle along with Limca.        
	However, the company made the brands stronger on the back of a wider sales network, innovative packaging and extensive marketing. Many of its brands are endorsed by popular Bollywood stars. Its also one of the biggest sponsors in sports.

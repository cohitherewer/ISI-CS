	New Delhi, Jan. 6: Fiat is developing a small car for the Indian market.         
	Fiat will make the car in Italy with the help of an Indian team. It will be launched here with our joint venture partner Tata Motors, Fiat India president and CEO Rajeev Kapoor said at the 10th Auto Expo.         
	Fiat joins a host of auto makers who have announced plans to launch small cars.         
	The small-car segment is seeing phenomenal growth. There is space there and we see an opportunity, Kapoor said. Fiat today unveiled versions of the Linea, Fiat 500 and the Punto here. The company has, however, put on the backburner its plans to launch the Bravo.

	Volkswagens high-end Phaeton comes with a sticker price of Rs 75 lakh.

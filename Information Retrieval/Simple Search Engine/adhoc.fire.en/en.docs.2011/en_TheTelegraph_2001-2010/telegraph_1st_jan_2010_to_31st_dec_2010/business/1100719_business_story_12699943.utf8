The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Essar to rush Vodafone stake sale
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Essar to rush Vodafone stake sale
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          EXIT OPTION                                  
	New Delhi, July 18: The Ruias are keen to sell part of their 33 per cent stake in Vodafone Essar before huge payouts for 3G spectrum erodes the value of their holding in the telecom joint venture.        
	According to sources, Vodafone had to borrow for the Rs 11,617 crore it needed to shell out for 3G spectrum. It also has to pay Rs 2,849 crore for excess 2G spectrum received since 2006. For radiowaves beyond the initial allotment of 6.2MHz, the telecom regulator has recommended that operators pay a one-time fee linked to the price of 3G spectrum.        
	The huge payouts will affect the profitability of the telecom firm in the medium term. Vodafone reported a profit of 807 million, or around Rs 5,400 crore, on a turnover of 3.114 billion, or around Rs 20,000 crore, for the year ended March 2010.        
	In 2007, the UKs Vodafone bought a controlling stake in Hutchison Whampoa Ltds mobile business in India, in which Essar had been a partner. The deal gave Essar the option to sell its entire 33 per cent stake in the telecom venture to Vodafone for $5 billion between the third and fourth years of the deals completion.        
	So, an option before the Ruias-owned Essar Group is to sell its stake by May 2011. There have been talks with the British firm for a higher price. Alternatively, Essar can get an independent valuation by selling its shares in the open market. An Essar spokesperson refused to comment.        
	Vodafone, which is saddled with huge payouts as spectrum fee, does not want to spend too much on buying out Essars stake in a company of which it is in firm control.         
	However, Essar Group is keen to exit before its profitability is hit by the spectrum fee payments. Its a battle of who blinks first. Essar is talking to banks for a possible offering to make Vodafone raise its offer, sources said.         
	Essar has been restructuring its telecom shareholding pattern. The Mumbai-based group owns its stake in Vodafone through two entities  Essar Telecommunications Holdings Pvt Ltd and offshore firm Essar Telecom India Ltd. It needs to raise funds to repay the loan taken for its energy, steel and power businesses.        
	Ideally, Essar should sell part of its stake and hold on to a small portion as a pure equity investor as a hedge option betting on high growth in telecom business to overcome the current loan problems of telcos and bringing in great returns later, said independent telecom analyst Sudipto Bose.                           
	Three months ago, Essar raised  1.27 billion through a London IPO for its energy business.                                       
	Essar feels a late exit may mean bad timing, sources say. Though the put option gives Essar a right to sell, there is no such obligation on the company.        
	Vodafone, however, holds just 151.40MHz of spectrum compared with Reliances 210.5MHz and Tatas 159.2MHz , respectively, compared with Rs 192 crore by Reliance and 217 crore by the Tatas. The high fees are already eroding the market value of these telecom firms offering GSM-based mobile services.         
	Vodafone and Bharti are paying the highest spectrum charges on an annual basis at Rs 802 crore and Rs 1,265 crore. Spectrum for 2G will also be alotted through auctions, adding to the financial burden of telecom firms.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 21: Engineering and construction company Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) today reported a decline in both its net profit and net sales for the third quarter ended December 2009.        
	Net profit, after extraordinary income, fell 50 per cent to Rs 758.82 crore from Rs 1,520.44 crore in the same period last year. Extraordinary income stood at Rs 62.55 crore after L amp;T sold part of its stake in Satyam Computer. During the same period last year, extraordinary income, from the sale of the ready-mix concrete business, was much higher at Rs 1,520.44 crore.        
	While the net profit fell below estimates, lower revenue added to the disappointment. Net sales fell to Rs 8,071.37 crore from Rs 8,593.96 crore in the year-ago quarter.         
	L amp;T attributed the fall in revenue to the slow progress of work and delayed financial closure in infrastructure projects.

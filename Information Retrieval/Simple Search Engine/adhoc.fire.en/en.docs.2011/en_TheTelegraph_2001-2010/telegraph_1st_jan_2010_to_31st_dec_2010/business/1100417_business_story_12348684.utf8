          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                
	Mumbai, April 16: Five years after it was formed, Renault is exiting a joint venture with Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M).         
	M amp;M is buying the French car makers 49 per cent stake in Mahindra Renault Pvt Ltd (MRPL) through which the Logan mid-size sedan is manufactured.        
	In an interesting agreement entered between the two car makers, the Logan will be renamed and will carry a Mahindra logo. The re-badging exercise is expected to take around 18 months.        
	M amp;M is also planning to refresh and carry other modifications in Logan, which include reducing the length of the car to less than 4 metres to take advantage of lower excise duties and thus offer better pricing.        
	There is also a possibility that M amp;M may build other vehicles on the Logan platform.        
	MRPL was established in 2005 as a 51:49 joint venture between M amp;M and Renault to manufacture and sell the Logan. Though it started off well in 2007, the Logan saw its sales dip, which plunged the venture into losses.        
	Close to 300 Logans are now sold every month. In February, the French car maker had given a firm indication that the joint venture would be restructured when it announced plans to set up an independent distribution network to support the launch of various cars from its international portfolio.        
	While M amp;M will now execute additional localisation to bring down costs, it will pay a small royalty fee to Renault. M amp;M will be responsible for the management of the Logan in the Indian market.        
	It also has the licence to sell it in Nepal and Bhutan. The car can also be exported to South Africa, but there it will be a Renault-badged product. M amp;M did not disclose the consideration that it was paying to Renault for buying its 49 per cent stake except to say that the valuation had been done on impaired value of assets.        
	Pawan Goenka, M amp;Ms president (automotive and farm equipment), told reporters that this was not a stop-gap arrangement between the two car makers. If that was the case, why would we waste our energy in refreshing it and carry out other modifications, he asked.        
	Goenka maintained that both the partners shared the view that the new agreement would prove beneficial for the Logan.         
	He said the sales and marketing functions would now be fully integrated with M amp;M following the acquisition of the 49 per cent stake. Apart from cost optimisation in purchasing, M amp;M was quicker in responding to customers demand for engineering changes in a vehicle.        
	He ruled out the possibility of M amp;M shifting its focus from multi-utility vehicles, sport utility vehicles or pick-ups.        
	As part of the understanding, Renault will continue to support M amp;M and the Logan through a licence agreement and supplykey components, including engine and the transmission. The Renault name and logo will continue to be used on the Logan till the end of this calendar year.

	In India, 27.8 per cent of the total population in 2001 lived in urban areas. India is less urbanised compared to many Asian countries such as China, Indonesia and South Korea.         
	However, with about 285 million people living in urban areas (according to the 2001 Census, above 300 million at present), India still has the second largest urban population in the world.               
	Key challenges: The urban population is expected to rise to around 40 per cent by 2020. The current state of delivery of urban services also leaves much to be desired. About 40 per cent of urban households do not have proper sanitation and only 85 per cent of the urban population have access to safe water supply, which are lower in the slums (65 per cent). Despite an improvement in the figures and statistics as compiled by the Government of India and research institutions over the last decade, universal coverage of the population, as far as the water sector is concerned, is still an unattained goal.               
	Investments required: To meet the Millennium Development Goals, investments required alone in urban water sector for 2007-12 according to estimates are about Rs 385 billion. If we were to look at the investment requirements for all the 5,161 urban centres across the country, estimates suggest a capital investment requirement of over Rs 800,000 crore (see Figure 1).         
	The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM)  launched in December 2005, it is an urban sector programme in line with the economic reform programme undertaken in the 1990s  has focused attention on the integrated development of urban infrastructure and services.         
	The JNNURM was launched with the goal of achieving reforms-driven, fast track and planned development of identified mission cities. This level of investment clearly cannot be met from public funds alone and therefore, alternate sources of funds, including private capital, will need to be tapped.                           
	Allocation vs Expenditure: The progress under the urban infrastructure and governance (UIG) component has not been encouraging. The overall allocation in the JNNURM till date (in the last five years) has been 50 per cent (Rs 15,810 crore) with the remaining 50 per cent (Rs 15,590 crore) to be allocated in the balance two years. The pace of expenditure has also not been encouraging, with only 65 per cent (Rs 10,270 crore) of the allocation spent. To spend the entire amount in the next two years, the pace of expenditure needs to improve by at least five times (see Figure 2). Out of 89 projects that were scheduled to be ready by December 2008, only 33 have been completed till date.         
	Overall, out of 107 projects supposed to be completed by January 2010, only 50 have been completed. Clearly, the focus needs to shift to delivery and implementation.               
	Expectations from the budget: The budget needs to look at increasing allocations to the sector and provide incentives to the private sector for investments.         
	The finance minister and his team need to come out with a carrot-and-stick policy. The states and cities that are doing good work need to be given incentives whereas those who are laggards need to be strictly penalised.

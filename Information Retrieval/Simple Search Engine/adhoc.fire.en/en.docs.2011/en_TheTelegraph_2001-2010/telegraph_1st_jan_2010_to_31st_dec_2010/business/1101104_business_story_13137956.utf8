          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Meera Shankar in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: India is expecting the US to ease its rules on the export of dual-use items.         
	Yes I do see...we are expecting progress in that field, Meera Shankar, Indias ambassador to the US, said.         
	Dual-use technology is expected to figure prominently during the talks between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President Barack Obama here on November 8.        
	The US has a list of items that requires clearances for export to certain countries .        
	In the case of India, such clearances are required for chemical products and biological materials, among other items.        
	India wants such items to be allowed to be transferred without clearances.        
	The global dual-use market is estimated to be between $800 billion and $1 trillion and is growing at 5 per cent annually.         
	Sources said some announcement was likely in the joint statement to be issued after the meeting between Singh and Obama.        
	They said the US was undertaking an India-specific review of the policy, and the two sides were working to fine- tune the provisions to Indias benefit.        
	Shankar said the countrys maximum technology collaboration was with US firms.        
	She said bilateral trade was expected to reach $50 billion this fiscal, with investments moving in both directions.        
	We are expecting bilateral trade to grow 30 per cent and reach $50 billion by March, she said, releasing a report on Indian investment in US brought out by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and Ernst and Young.        
	At present, India-US trade is worth $37 billion, including $16 billion worth of imports from Washington.        
	Shankar said trade was a key driver in the relationship. If we look at the trade in goods, it is growing on both sides.        
	She said Indian foreign direct investment was growing fast in the US markets. Indian companies have created 65,000 jobs, both in terms of greenfield projects and by means of mergers and acquisitions.

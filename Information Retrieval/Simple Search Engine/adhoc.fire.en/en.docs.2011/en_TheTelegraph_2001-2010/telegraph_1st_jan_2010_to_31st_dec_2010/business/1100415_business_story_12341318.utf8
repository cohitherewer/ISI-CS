          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chawla: Action time                                  
	New Delhi, April 14: The finance ministry today asked Sebi and the IRDA to approach a court at the earliest to resolve the contentious issue of who would regulate Ulips.        
	A day after finance minister Pranab Mukherjee brokered peace between the two regulators, Sebi yesterday came out with a notification saying it would regulate Ulips launched after April 9.        
	We want them to go to the court soon. The finance minister has mentioned status quo ante, which means that whatever prevailed before the date of the Sebi order will continue unhindered That is what Sebi has said, Chawla told reporters.        
	The larger issue of who has the regulatory oversight authority (over Ulips) Will be decided by the court. We want them to go to the court fast, he said.        
	However, the IRDA today told insurers to ignore Sebis fresh order on Ulips launched after April 9. There is no fresh clarification. The earlier one (order issued by it on April 10, 2010) stands good, IRDA chairman J. Hari Narayan said.        
	Hari Narayan, who had earlier asked 14 insurers to ignore Sebis ban on the sale of Ulips, said whatever updates or notifications were to be given had been updated on the IRDA site and no fresh clarifications were being issued.        
	Meanwhile, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said differences between the two warring regulators had not caused any uncertainty in the market. I dont think there is any uncertainty in the market. This (regulatory dispute) happens all over the world, he said.        
	Ahluwalia said the proposed financial development and stability council could help in resolving such regulatory issues.        
	Ulips, or unit linked insurance plans, are sold by life insurers, where money collected from consumers can be invested in any proportion between equity and debt markets. These have, however, become a bone of contention between the two financial regulators, with both claiming regulatory authority over the schemes.        
	Commissions, which form a major part of the entry load for Ulips, are at the heart of the mutual fund versus Ulip battle with mutual fund commissions being decided between the investor and broker, while Ulip commissions range from 10 to 50 per cent of the first years premium.

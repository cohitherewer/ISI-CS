The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dollar dose to spur growth
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Dollar dose to spur growth
          SEWELL CHAN amp; DAVID E. SANGER                                            
	Washington, Nov. 3: The US Federal Reserve, concerned about the slow recovery, announced a second, large purchase of treasury bonds on Wednesday, an effort to spur economic growth by lowering long-term interest rates.         
	The Fed said it would buy an additional $600 billion in long-term treasury securities by the end of June 2011, somewhat more than the $300 billion to $500 billion that many in the markets had expected.         
	The Fed also said it would continue its programme, announced in August, of reinvesting proceeds from its mortgage-related holdings to buy treasury debt. The Fed now expects to reinvest $250 billion to $300 billion under that programme by the end of June, making the total asset purchases in the range of $850-$900 billion.         
	That would just about double the $800 billion or so in treasury debt currently on the Feds balance sheet.         
	While the Fed has been signaling for months that it would take action to bolster the economy, the announcement was the first major policy move since the mid-term US elections, which brought more Republicans to Capitol Hill and heightens the potential for gridlock on fiscal policy, including tax cuts and spending to encourage job creation and growth.         
	In justifying its decision, the Fed noted that unemployment was high and inflation low, and judged that the recovery has been disappointingly slow.         
	Options open        
	In a striking move, the Federal Open Market Committee, which ended a two-day meeting on Wednesday, also left open how much it will purchase.         
	The committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase programme in light of incoming information and will adjust the programme as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability, the committee said.         
	Economists disagree about how much the new round of debt purchases  a reprise of an initial, $1.7 trillion round that ended in March  will have on spurring consumer and corporate demand.         
	Lower long-term interest rates in theory should ripple through the markets, affecting other rates, like those of 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages. That could encourage homeowners to refinance into cheaper mortgages, though it would not help the millions of Americans facing foreclosure.         
	But there are several significant risks. The new actions are likely to further drive down the value of the dollar, which has fallen about 7.5 per cent since June against the currencies of major trading partners. That could exacerbate the trade and exchange-rate tensions that have threatened to unravel co-operation among the worlds biggest economies.         
	Moreover, the Fed is exposing itself to the risk that the assets it has purchased, like the $1 trillion in mortgage-related securities on its balance sheets, could shrivel in value as interest rates rise. That could reduce the amount of money the central banks turns over to the US Treasury each year, and expose the Fed  which has been attacked for failing to prevent the 2008 financial crisis  to further criticism.         
	And then there is a risk that the Feds action could be neutralised by a new Congress that has vowed to contract government spending, a core argument that led to the overwhelming Republican victory on Tuesday.         
	Leonard J. Santow, an economic consultant, said he feared that the Fed was reacting to one mistake  the failure of fiscal policy  by adding another.         
	Monetary policy is already unsustainably easy, and adding to the Feds generosity through more quantitative easing will do little to stimulate the economy, Santow said.         
	The main problem is on the fiscal side and there is nothing wrong with the Fed chairman making budget recommendations and admitting there is not a great deal left for monetary policy to achieve when it comes to stimulating the economy.         
	The Fed had bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and government securities, a programme that was phased out last March.         
	Only months ago, the Fed was talking about returning to normal monetary policy and discussing the timetable for eventually raising interest rates and tightening the supply of credit, as it would normally do after a recession has ended.

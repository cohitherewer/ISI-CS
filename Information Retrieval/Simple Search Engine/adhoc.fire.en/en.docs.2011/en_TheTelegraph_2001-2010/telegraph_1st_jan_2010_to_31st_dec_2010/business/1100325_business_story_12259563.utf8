          SOUNAK MITRA                          GETTING AMBITIOUS                                  
	Calcutta, March 24: BSE-listed IKF Technologies Ltd plans to increase its headcount to about 2,000 by the end of 2010-11 from 400 for the companys BPO arm.         
	The city-based company is also looking at acquiring a 100-seat BPO firm in the US.        
	In the BPO business, we have concentrated on the domestic telecom sector so far. Now, we are entering new segments such as insurance to achieve our target of earning a revenue of Rs 1,500 crore from the BPO business in the next two years, IKF Technologies managing director C. S. Jalan told The Telegraph.         
	The company aims to cross a turnover of Rs 2,500 crore over the next two years. In 2008-09, its net income stood at Rs 185.23 crore.        
	Jalan said IKF was identifying smaller BPO firms in the US for possible buyouts. Acquiring a company in the US will help us in getting local outsourcing jobs there, he said. The company has also joined hands with state authorities to spread IT education in rural areas. We will use Internet connectivity at the panchayat offices to provide better education to kids who are yet to attend schools, he said.         
	Last week, IKF had entered into a partnership with WAPMERR-India to execute GIS-based surveillance projects globally.         
	The strategic partnership aims at exploring new horizons in the GIS/MIS-based services. IKF has operations in Delhi, Noida, Jaipur and Mumbai.        
	According to the agreement, both the companies will provide software development services and solutions in 3D, GIS, simulation, security and survey projects.         
	The companies will initially concentrate on India and then expand overseas.

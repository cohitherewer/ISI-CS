	Calcutta, May 14: The State Bank of India will come out with a retail bond issue in the first half of the current financial year to raise between Rs 200 crore and Rs 500 crore.        
	This will be the first time that the countrys largest lender will float such an issue, which will be in the nature of subordinated debt and will be used to shore up its tier II capital.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt, in the city for the fourth quarter and annual results of the bank, said, We planned to float the retail bond issue last year. But we didnt do it then. Now we have got the approval of our board to raise between Rs 200 crore and Rs 500 crore during the first six months of the current financial year. We are now talking to merchant bankers to look into the details of the proposed bond issue.        
	According to Bhatt, the retail bond issue will be offered to the public at the banks branches.        
	This will give a new investment opportunity for retail investors, he said.        
	The interest rate on these bonds will depend on the market rate at the time of the launch.         
	The tenure of these bonds will be 10 years or more. A 15-year bond will have a call option (wherein the bank may recall the bonds from investors after paying the bond value) at the end of 10 years and in case of a 10-year bond, the call option will be at the end of five years, said a senior bank official.         
	According to him, the State Bank is looking at 10-year bonds.         
	In September last year, the Reserve Bank had permitted scheduled commercial banks to issue subordinated debt to raise tier II capital.         
	A subordinated debt is a borrowing that a company will repay after paying all other loans should it become insolvent.         
	Unlike fixed deposits, subordinated debt is not covered by the deposit insurance scheme.         
	Net profit        
	The SBIs net profit declined nearly 32 per cent to Rs 1,867 crore for the January-March quarter of 2009-10, while for the full year, it rose marginally to Rs 9,166 crore from Rs 9,121 crore a year ago. Net profit for the fourth quarter of 2008-09 stood at Rs 2,742 crore.        
	Net interest income increased 38.82 per cent to Rs 6,721 crore.        
	The 4.44 per cent decline in other income (including treasury profit), a 40.93 per cent increase (Rs 627 crore) in salary cost, a 26.42 per cent increase (Rs 347 crore) in overhead expenses for setting up 1,049 new branches and 7,000 plus ATMs, and a 31.27 per cent rise in provisioning (from Rs 1,378 crore to Rs 2,349 crore) for bad loans and other contingencies such as employees pension ate into the profit.        
	The SBI stock fell Rs 92.50, or 4 per cent, to end at Rs 2,222.65 on the BSE from Thursdays close of Rs 2,315.15         
	The increase in wage cost, provisioning for pension and overhead costs are one-time. On the other hand, incremental bad assets are expected to go down. So, I believe, the provisioning requirement will remain the same in the subsequent quarters, Bhatt said.         
	The bank expects a credit growth of 22 per cent and a deposit growth of 16 per cent in 2010-11. In 2009-10, advances grew 16.94 per cent to Rs 641,480 crore, while deposits grew 8.36 per cent to Rs 804,116 crore.         
	Bhatt said the bank management was talking to the government for a rights issue during the current fiscal.         
	We are planning to raise between Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore without diluting the governments 59 per cent stake, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 15: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is widely expected to retain its key policy rates when it announces the mid-quarter policy review on Thursday.        
	A dip in the inflation rate to 7.48 per cent in November and the prevailing tight liquidity conditions are widely seen as the two major factors that will prompt the RBI to hit the pause button after raising benchmark interest rates six times this year.        
	While making its second quarter review of the annual policy last month, the RBI had said that it might not take further rate action in the immediate future based on the growth and inflation trends. Governor D. Subbarao later added that immediate future would mean a period of three months.        
	In November, the RBI raised the repo rate and the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points each to 6.25 per cent and 5.25 per cent, respectively. The reverse repo is the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity from banks. The repo is the rate at which it provides money to banks against securities.        
	If the RBI decides to pause, it will be the first time since January when it wont be raising rates during a policy review. The RBI has raised the repo rate by 150 basis points and reverse repo by 200 basis points this calendar year.         
	The banking system is currently witnessing tight liquidity conditions and they have been borrowing over Rs 1 trillion on a daily basis from the central banks repo window. It is felt that liquidity will become tighter this month because of the advance tax outflows.         
	The systems liquidity deficit is currently much larger than the RBIs comfort level and is expected to come under further stress because of seasonal tax-related outflows. Any further increase in policy rates at this point could exacerbate the strain, Anubhuti Sahay, economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said in a recent report. She added that the tight liquidity further supported the need to maintain status quo.        
	 The central bank has taken a number of measures but has failed to ease the liquidity crunch.         
	Some economists are calling for a temporary cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR), others aver that a cut in CRR will be seen as a reversal of the RBIs monetary policy stance. CRR is that portion of deposits which banks must keep with the RBI.

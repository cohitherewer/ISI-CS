The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Retail investors prefer to play safe in equities
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Retail investors prefer to play safe in equities

	Calcutta, Jan. 1: Retail investors, who saw the value of their equity portfolio get eroded by nearly 60 per cent in 2008, chose not to participate in last years spectacular rally and instead redeemed their investments with the surge in stock prices.        
	Though data on retail participation in the secondary market are not easily available, brokerages said small investors had been watching the stock rally from a distance. In mutual funds, which account for the lions share of investment by small investors, there have been redemption requests since August.        
	Unit-linked insurance plan (Ulip) is another instrument through which small investors gain equity exposure. Ulips account for more than 80 per cent of the total sales of private life insurance companies.         
	In Ulips, firms reported an 8.9 per cent fall in premium from new businesses at Rs 16,220.02 crore in the current financial year till October.         
	The drop in sales was more in the first half of the current financial year. However, sales have started picking up slowly as companies started offering guaranteed products, said a senior official at Bajaj Capital, a financial product distribution company.         
	Around 60-70 per cent sales of life insurance policies take place in the second half of the financial year when people rush to save income tax.         
	Retail investors, who parked their money in equities during the peak in December-January 2008, scouted for redeeming their investments in the last three-four months when share prices climbed to their 52-week highs. Small investors refrained from putting in fresh money as stock prices rose too high too fast, said Jaideep Bhattacharya, chief marketing officer of UTI Mutual Fund.         
	A similar trend was seen in balanced funds where the debt component was higher than in diversified equity funds.        
	Till November, bank deposits increased Rs 7,00,000 crore compared with a decline in Ulip sales and net outflow from equity mutual funds. This shows retail investors shunned equity investments in 2009, Bhattacharya said.        
	Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who staged a mass exodus in 2008, came back with renewed vigour but with little penchant for secondary markets.        
	FIIs made a net investment of $1,745.75 billion (Rs 81,579 crore) in equities in calendar year 2009. But only Rs 24,132 crore, or 29.58 per cent, of this went into the secondary markets  the remaining Rs 57,627 crore came through qualified institutional placements.

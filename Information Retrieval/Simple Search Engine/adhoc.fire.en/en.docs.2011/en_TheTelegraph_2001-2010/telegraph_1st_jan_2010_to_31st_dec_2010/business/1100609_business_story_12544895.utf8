          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 8: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) expects operators to launch the much delayed mobile number portability (MNP) system by September. The telecom regulator claims that the delay was because of state-owned operators BSNL and MTNL.        
	MNP should not go beyond September, Trai chairman J.S. Sarma said here today. The department of telecommunications (DoT) had last month said that MNP might not take off before September 30.         
	Officials of telecom companies said it would not be feasible to start MNP before the anticipated 3G rollout, expected by the end of the year. The DoT had asked operators to implement portability by June 30. However, some firms, including MTNL and BSNL, were not ready with the equipment.

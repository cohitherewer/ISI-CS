          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: Commerce minister Anand Sharma has said the twin moves by the US  visa fee hike and curbs on outsourcing  are not welcome, and he would discuss these issues at a high-level bilateral trade forum in Washington next week.        
	Sharma said these moves would adversely impact the economic relations between the countries and hoped the Washington meeting on September 21 would be constructive.        
	The Indian IT industry has made a notable contribution, which is acknowledged globally, even in the US. Indian entities are responsible for creating jobs, even now when there are big job losses, Sharma told reporters here.        
	Sharma and US trade representative Ron Kirk will co-chair the trade policy forum, which is the principal platform for trade dialogue between the US and India.

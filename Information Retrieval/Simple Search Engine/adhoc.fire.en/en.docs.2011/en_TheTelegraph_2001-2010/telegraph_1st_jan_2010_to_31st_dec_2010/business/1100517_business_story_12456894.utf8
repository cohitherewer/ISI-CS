	New Delhi, May 16 (PTI): Power trading company PTC has launched a fund in a collaboration with global investment manager Ashmore to provide equity financing to various kinds of power projects in the country.        
	PTC Ashmore India Energy Infrastructure Fund will finance projects involving power generation, transmission, distribution, fuel extraction and fuel transport infrastructure.        
	To meet the widening demand-supply gap in power, the fund will target the private sector to lead the initial investments and exit once the assets mature.        
	The portfolio will contain an optimum mix of holding and asset companies, to secure various exit channels.        
	The close-ended fund will offer a target return of 20 per cent with 10 years maturity, and is aimed at local and international investors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks on fire as US recession fear recedes
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stocks on fire as US recession fear recedes
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 6: The sensex today surged to its highest level in two-and-a-half years as better-than-expected jobs data from the US allayed apprehensions that the economy might slip into a recession.        
	Stocks rallied on global markets and foreign institutional (FIIs) investors funnelled money into the local bourses, igniting a broad-based surge across counters. The benchmark rose nearly 339 points, or 1.86 per cent, to end the day at 18560.05.        
	Market circles said the principal trigger for the strong rally was the US jobs data released last Friday which indicated that the American recovery wasnt showing any signs of strain. The data showed that the economy lost 54,000 jobs in August against forecasts of over 100,000 job losses.        
	Asian stocks opened higher and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose to its highest level in four weeks. Although the sensex opened lower at 18124.29, the trend was quickly reversed as buying saw the index nudge higher. It hit a high of 18600.30 before ending at 18560.05, up 338.62 points.        
	Ambareesh Baliga, vice- president of Karvy Stock Broking, said the US jobs data had underpinned the surge in stocks, which gained further momentum on strong FII buying and short-covering. We were expecting a 25-30 points rise in the Nifty but it ended higher by nearly 98 points though the world markets were not showing the same exuberance, he told The Telegraph.         
	Baliga said though the benchmark index could consolidate at the current levels, there could be sharp mood swings in the short term as valuations were looking expensive. I will not be surprised if we see a major downswing in the near future.        
	On the BSE, all the sectoral indices ended in the green as metals, financials and realty stocks led the rally. Metal stocks rose because of a gain in global prices. While Tata Steel gained nearly 6.42 per cent, shares of Hindalco and Sterlite rose around 5 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.                                      
	Bank stocks were back in favour on expectations that the sector would stand to gain from an economic recovery. A noteable highlight here was ICICI Bank whose share hit a yearly high at Rs 1045.60 at the BSE today. Shares of State Bank of India, on the other hand, rose more than 3 per cent, or Rs 85.25, to close at Rs 2858.75.        
	Top-weighted Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)  which has come under pressure in the past few sessions  rose nearly 3 per cent to finish at Rs 953.20 on bargain hunting. IT stocks were also active with sentiment anchored in expectations that a US recovery would boost their earning prospects.

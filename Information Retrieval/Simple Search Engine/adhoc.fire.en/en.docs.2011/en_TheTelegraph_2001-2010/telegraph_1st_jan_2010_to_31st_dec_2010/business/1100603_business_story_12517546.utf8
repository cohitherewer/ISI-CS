	New Delhi, June 2: The assets under management of the mutual fund industry grew over 4 per cent in May to cross the Rs 8-lakh-crore mark and attain a six-month high.         
	The industrys average assets under management (AUM) grew Rs 34,393.67 crore, or 4.47 per cent, in May. The combined average AUM of the 37 fund houses stood at Rs 8,03,559.06 crore.        
	The last time the industry saw this record level was in November, when the assets hit an all-time high of Rs 8.07 lakh crore, data by the Association of Mutual Funds in India showed.        
	Reliance MF, the largest fund house in the country, saw an addition of Rs 7,154 crore to its average assets at Rs 1.19 lakh crore in May.         
	After a gap of six months, the assets of HDFC MF breached the Rs 1-lakh-crore mark in May. HDFC assets had increased Rs 7,160.53 crore to Rs 1,01,863.31 crore, becoming the second fund house to manage assets of over Rs 1 trillion. ICICI Prudential MF saw its assets rising Rs 4,674.30 crore to Rs 87,709.81 crore.        
	The funds, which were pulled out in March, were reinfused in May. Also, short-term and ultra short-term funds saw hefty inflows, which propelled MF industry assets, Lakshmi Iyer, head of Kotak Mutual Fund (fixed income and products), said.        
	However, UTI MF bucked the trend and saw a decline of Rs 840 crore from its assets to Rs 78,617.15 crore in May.         
	The BSE sensex dropped 3.5 per cent as world equities wobbled on concerns over a debt crisis in the Eurozone. Analysts said although inflow was not there in equity schemes, debt funds continued to witness investment interest.

                                I am a 19-year-old student. I would like to invest in PPF. But I dont have a PAN card. Can I open a PPF account? What is the maximum amount I can invest in PPF?          Binay Ghosh, Calcutta
                    PAN card is not necessary for opening a PPF account. If you dont have a PAN card, submit Form 60. The maximum amount that you can invest in a PPF account in a year is Rs 70,000. You may not need anything if you have a deposit account with the State Bank of India where you can open a PPF account.                                  Refund takes time      I am a retired person. I had investments worth Rs 6,00,000 in a post office monthly saving scheme. One such account amounting to Rs 43,000 came up for maturity and I invested the sum in a fixed deposit with Axis Bank in September last year. I was late in submitting Form 15H to the bank for non-deduction of tax at source. The bank deducted Rs 1,426 from my interest income. In June this year I filed tax return in ITR4 with ITO ward number 19(3). I have not yet got the refund. How can I get it back?        A.K. Basu, Calcutta
                    You should have submitted your return in ITR2, which is meant for individuals not having income from business or profession. However, you can contact your income tax assessment officer and rectify the same. The tax department takes some time for refund. You will have to wait for some time.                                  Record keeping      How long should I keep the records  7 years or 10 years  against filing of IT returns for assessment year 2010-11?         B. Ganeshan, Calcutta
                      Under Section 142(1), an assessee may not need to produce any record for a period of more than three years prior to the previous year. However, under Section 148, the tax department can ask for records for four preceding years. If there is a failure on the part of the assessee to disclose all facts for a relevant assessment year, a notice can be issued for documents for not more than six years. Hence, records for six years should be sufficient.

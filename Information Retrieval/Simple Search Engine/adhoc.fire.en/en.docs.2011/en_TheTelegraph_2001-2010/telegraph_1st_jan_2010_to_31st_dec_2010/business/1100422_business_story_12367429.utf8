  - Bid to prevent Goldman repeat         JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                                  
	New Delhi, April 21: The government has decided to amend the Sebi act and the securities contracts (regulation) act to give the market regulator more teeth to deal with insider trading along with powers to tap telephones and cancel illegally allotted securities.         
	Recent controversies surrounding the Indian Premier League and Americas Goldman Sachs form the backdrop to the moves.         
	Top finance ministry officials said they had made a presentation to the parliamentary standing committee on finance. The move to give Sebi teeth, which the market regulator has also asked for, will be fast forwarded. We have worked out the amendments.         
	Top on the list is reorganising the board of the capital market regulator by clearly stating its powers and functions. This will clarify Sebis powers over various financial firms and markets and is considered necessary given the kind of regulatory spat that broke out between the market watchdog and the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority over Ulips.         
	Another proposal relates to curbing insider trading, prohibiting manipulative and deceptive devices and preventing substantial acquisition of securities or control over them. Such actions are necessary in the wake of last years Rs 7,100-crore Satyam scam where the Rajus were found to have indulged in circular trading to jack up share prices.        
	Greater powers will be vested on the regulator during its investigations. It can seek information from any person, including telecom operators, and have the powers of a civil court to seek information. This means Sebi can even ask for phone conversation details from telecom operators.         
	Besides, the regulator will have more powers to penalise market manipulators. It can direct people to pay up money equal to the disproportionate gain they have made.         
	More significantly, Sebi will have the power to ask market manipulators to pay up money equal to the losses other shareholders and market players may have incurred.        
	Officials said the regulator could cancel illegally allotted securities and debar people from serving in the securities market or in a listed company. It can also freeze voting powers on a share.         
	A few years back, there were instances of unscrupulous operators cornering public issue portions meant for retail investors.         
	Sebi can dispense with the requirement of sub-brokers if it feels necessary and can specify different combination of services that an intermediary can do.         
	This is being done to give Sebi the power to move with the times and the way the market evolves in the future, the officials said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 13: Infosys Technologies, the countrys second largest software exporter, today announced a net profit of Rs 1,600 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, signalling a 0.9 per cent decline over the same quarter a year ago.         
	However, net profits rose 2.6 per cent over the previous quarter ended December 31.        
	The software major which earns more than 98 per cent of its revenues from overseas operations  forecast a strong 18 per cent rise in dollar revenues for 2010-11.         
	However, the IT bellwether gave a muted earnings guidance for the year as it expected an appreciating rupee and wage hikes to impact margins. As a result, income in the year ended March 2011 is projected to rise only 9-11 per cent in rupee terms. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter stood at Rs 5,944 crore against Rs 5,635 crore in the same period last year. For the full year, net profit rose 4.1 per cent to Rs 6,219 crore from Rs 5,975 crore a year ago.         
	Overall revenues rose 4.8 per cent during the year to Rs 22,742 crore (Rs 21,693 crore).        
	We have been able to take advantage of the opportunities in the market and grow faster because of our investments in capacity and capability building even during the economic downturn, CEO S. Gopalakrishnan said.        
	Although the company met analyst estimates for the quarter ended March 31, there was some disappointment on the guidance front. Infosys projected that for the quarter ended June 30, income in rupee terms is expected to be in the range of Rs 5,919-5,963 crore, a growth of 8.2-9 per cent. For the fiscal ending March 31, 2011, the income is expected to be between Rs 24,796 crore and Rs 25,239 crore, a growth of 9-11 per cent. In dollar terms, consolidated revenues were expected to be in the range of $5.57 billion to $5.67 billion, a growth of 16-18 per cent next year.         
	The guidance, particularly at the upper end, came in higher than estimates of a 17 per cent growth. Analysts said the strong dollar growth guidance was an indication that Infosys expected more firms to outsource IT services.         
	However, the earnings guidance came in as a major disappointment. Infosys estimated that for the year ended March 31, 2011, earnings per share (EPS) would be in the range of Rs 106.82 to Rs 111.28, a year-on-year decline of 2 per cent to a growth of 2.1 per cent. Analysts were expecting a guidance at the lower end of at least Rs 110 per share. The Infosys stock surged Rs 99.10, or 3.69 per cent, to Rs 2782.35 on the BSE.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 1: IDBI Bank has waived charges and fees on 21 services to lure customers to open savings and current accounts with it.        
	Customers will no longer have to pay charges for not maintaining average balance, ATM inter-change fee or for other facilities such as demand drafts.        
	The move  the first by a domestic bank in India  may prompt rivals to follow suit, especially those with a low proportion of current accounts and saving accounts (CASA).        
	At 14 per cent, IDBI Bank has one of the lowest CASA deposits and, therefore, the decision is seen as clearly being made to raise this ratio.        
	The waiver covers ATM card fees, cheque book charges, that for ECS and EFT payments, outstation cheque collection, account statement charges, fees paid for standing instructions, stop payment, demand draft and ATM inter-change.         
	Most banks do not charge a fee for cash withdrawals from ATMs owned by other banks for five transactions in a month.         
	However, if a customer exceeds five transactions, a charge of Rs 20 is usually levied. In the case of IDBI Bank, this fee will now be borne by the bank.         
	IDBI Bank chairman R.M. Malla admitted that it might lose some income by doing away with these charges, but the benefits would be significant. Between money that we charge and the relationship with customer, we found the latter to be more important.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pranab Mukherjee in Mumbai on Tuesday. (Fotocorp)                          
	Mumbai, July 13: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said the government was looking to attain 9 per cent GDP growth this year and would then aim to tear down the barrier to double-digit growth  a goal that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had often articulated in the past.        
	Mukherjees comments come just days after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised Indias growth forecast for 2010 to 9.4 per cent. The IMF said Indias growth was likely to be driven by corporate investment because of strong profitability and the easier availability of credit. This is higher than the governments projection of 8.5 per cent for the year ending March 31, 2011.        
	Speaking at a function to kick off an investor education initiative by UTI Mutual Fund here today, Mukherjee said the government wanted the country to return to the high growth path and create a situation where India crossed the hurdle to a double-digit growth. He said such a growth ought to be sustainable over a period of 7-10 years till we overcome basic problems such as poverty.        
	Referring to the global financial crisis, he said it had resulted in the GDP growth slowing down. While the GDP growth in the first quarter of 2008-09 was around 9 per cent, it came down to 5.8 per cent in the last quarter. In such circumstances, the government had to devise a stimulus package, which amounted to Rs 1,85,000 crore, or 3 per cent of the countrys GDP.        
	We were able to achieve some success despite facing another problem from our own source, he said while referring to the drought conditions.

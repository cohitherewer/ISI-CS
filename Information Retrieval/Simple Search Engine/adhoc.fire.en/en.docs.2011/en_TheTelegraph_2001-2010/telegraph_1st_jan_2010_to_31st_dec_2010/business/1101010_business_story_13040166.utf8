          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 9: The Reserve Banks suggestion that business houses can acquire regional rural banks (RRB) before they are allowed to set up their own banks has met with stiff opposition.        
	The All India Regional Rural Bank Officers Federation (AIRRBOF), which represents more than 2,65,00 officers in 82 RRBs, is not in favour of the proposal and has conveyed its views to the central bank in a meeting on Friday.         
	In its discussion paper on the entry of new banks in the private sector, the RBI said allowing business houses to take over regional banks has some advantages. The new entrants will get an opportunity to prove their suitability in the banking sector. The move is also expected to encourage financial inclusion and revive the RRBs.        
	The RBI has been meeting various industry associations before it prepares the guidelines on the entry of new banks.        
	According to S. K. Bhattacharjee, general secretary of AIRRBOF, the priorities of industrial houses and the RRBs are different. The rural banks are owned by the central and state governments and are linked with sponsor banks.        
	This arrangement cannot be substituted by industrial houses. Moreover, RRBs are a major source of credit in semi-urban and rural areas. Industrial houses owning RRBs are not expected to take over the same responsibility, Bhattacharjee said, adding that the government should continue to own the RRBs.        
	The federation pointed out that the RRBs cannot be made the testing ground for the entry of business houses into banking. It is highly doubtful that the taking over of RRBs by industrial houses shall provide them the necessary experience. The entire clientele of RRBs shall be eroded if access to industrial houses is allowed, the federation said.

          OUR BUREAU                           Acquisition mode                                  
	Mumbai, May 30: The Essar group has struck a deal to acquire a controlling stake in communications solution firm AGC Networks for $44.5 million.         
	The Ruias will pay Rs 245 a share to acquire a 59.13 per cent stake in AGC Networks from US network equipment maker Avaya Inc.         
	Later, it will come out with an open offer to acquire an additional 20 per cent stake in AGC as mandated by Sebi regulations.         
	The agreement for the sale of Avayas shares in AGC Networks Ltd has been signed with Essar Services Holdings Limited, a division of Essar Global Ltd.         
	The offer price is 12 per cent lower than AGCs Friday closing price of Rs 278.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	Essar said the open offer for the additional 20 per cent stake would cost Rs 78 crore. Company officials said the open offer would be announced in about three weeks.         
	This transaction allows us to offer a wider range of services, said Aparup Sengupta, global CEO of Essar Groups outsourcing venture Aegis Ltd.         
	AGC Networks, which was established in 1986, is focused on the Indian and Australian markets and had annual revenues of about $100 million, Sengupta said. The company employs about 500 people.         
	Sengupta said there was no plan to merge Aegis Ltd with the listed AGC Networks.         
	Edelweiss Capital Ltd advised Essar on the transaction and is also the manager of the open offer.         
	The sale of its AGC Networks stake will enable Avaya to focus on two of its strategic imperatives  the development of the Avaya business in India and the growth and extension of its coverage model through Avayas global channel programme, Avaya Connect.         
	Deep bonds        
	AGC Networks remains a key channel partner of Avaya serving customers in India, one of the fastest growing enterprise communications markets in the world, and in Australia.         
	In a press release, Avaya said the open offer process was expected to take between three and five months to complete. During that time, Avaya and AGC Networks will continue to work together to provide industry-leading products and services to customers in India and Australia.         
	The AGC Networks relationship remains key to Avayas success in India and Australia  both through the period of this transaction and beyond, said Jangoo Dalal, managing director of Avaya India.         
	In India, we work together to serve some of the countrys leading organisations spanning multiple business sectors and we look forward to continuing to work with AGC Networks as a trusted and well-established business partner, Dalal said.

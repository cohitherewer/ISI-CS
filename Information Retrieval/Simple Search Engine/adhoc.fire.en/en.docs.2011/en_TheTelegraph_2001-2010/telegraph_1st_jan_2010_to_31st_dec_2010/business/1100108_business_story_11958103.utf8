The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jindals cut stake in Rocklands
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Jindals cut stake in Rocklands
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 7: Jindal Steel and Power today stunned Australian investors when it cut its stake in takeover target Rocklands Richfield by close to 3 per cent, just days after raising the cash offer to buy the company.        
	JSPL brought down its holding from 16.4 per cent to 13.6 per cent, leading to a slide in the Rocklands stock on the Australian Securities Exchange.        
	The development surprised investors as Navin Jindals company had only a week back raised its bid to buy Rocklands.        
	JSPLs rival in the bidding game for the Australian coking coal miner is Chinas Meijin.        
	The Indian entity raised its bid to Aus $0.56 a share, valuing the deal at Aus $197 million, or about Rs 827 crore, to match a higher offer by Meijin.        
	The Chinese company had entered the fray with a Aus $0.52-a-share bid. JSPL had first offered Aus $0.42 a share when it signed a term sheet to buy out Rocklands after a satisfactory due diligence.        
	Rocklands chief executive John Girdlestone said he was equally surprised at Jindal lowering its stake and said Rocklands was seeking clarification.        
	Girdlestone was quoted by The Wall Street Journal as saying, We were already in the process of organising a meeting with Jindal in New Delhi after the company matched Meijins offer. A meeting is likely early next week, he added.        
	Jindal officials declined to comment on the development.        
	A source said the company could be cutting stake in order to comply with the terms of the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board.        
	The Australian government had in the past said foreign ownership in resource companies such as Rocklands should not cross 15 per cent without prior approval.        
	Rocklands has a slew of coal tenements in Queensland. According to the miner, they hold more than 900 million tonnes of coal. Apart from that it has metallurgical coke plants in China.         
	The bidding over Rocklands comes when Chinese and Indian companies are trying to secure everything abroad  from oil to coal to fuel their rapidly growing economies. However, China has edged ahead of India everywhere, and Australia is no exception. More Chinese companies have a presence in Australia than India, but the latter, is now turning aggressive.

	New Delhi, Dec. 28 (PTI): A banking fraud, which could run into a whopping Rs 400 crore, has been unearthed at leading multinational lender Citibanks Gurgaon branch.        
	Gurgaon police commissioner S.S. Deswal said an FIR against a bank employee and three others has been lodged and 18 accounts having close to Rs 4 crore frozen.        
	Sources said funds amounting to Rs 400 crore of 20 high net-worth customers have been siphoned off.        
	The fraud is said to be the handiwork of Shivraj Puri, the employee who is alleged to have sold investment products to high net-worth clients claiming that they will generate unusually high returns.        
	It is also alleged that Puri, who is named in the FIR, showed a forged notification of market regulator Sebi to obtain funds from customers. He is also accused of claiming that these products were authorised by the banks investment product committee.        
	The bank in a statement said, We immediately reported the matter to all the relevant regulatory and law enforcement authorities. Identified suspicious transactions have been isolated and we are providing full assistance to the authorities in their investigations.        
	Sources said Puri allegedly sought deposits from high net- worth customers in lucrative schemes but transferred the funds to some fictitious accounts.        
	We recently initiated an investigation into a certain set of suspicious transactions based on documents forged by an employee involving a few accounts in our Gurgaon branch, the bank said.

	Calcutta, Aug. 21: Public sector general insurance companies are planning to introduce a cover limit depending on the ailment along with cashless hospitalisation.         
	We are also considering separate products for those who want five-star hospital facilities, Girija Kumar, director of National Insurance Company, told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today.         
	Last month, the four state-owned general insurance companies stopped providing cashless facilities at select hospitals in cities such as Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore on the ground of overbilling.         
	The general insurers have since reworked their lists, retaining only those hospitals that have agreed to their packaged rates for various medical treatments.        
	At present, 450 hospitals have joined the cashless network. High-end hospitals such as Fortis and Apollo yesterday agreed, though as an interim measure, to resume the cashless facility.         
	Insurers and the high-end hospitals are locked in a dispute over medical charges.        
	Hospitals are being classified into various categories. If a policyholder wants the luxury of a high-end hospital, he may have to pay a higher premium, said Kumar.         
	Insurers have also proposed standard rates for some common medical procedures.         
	The move to categorise hospitals and standardise rates is expected to bring down the losses suffered by the insurers.

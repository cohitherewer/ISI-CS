          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 18: Samsung India is in favour of higher localisation and has been working with the Indian Cellular Association (ICA) to develop component manufacturing.        
	The ICA is a lobby group of handset makers.        
	We manufacture (assemble) around 17 models out of 44 sold in India, the spokesperson for Samsung said. At present, companies import critical components such as motherboards and chips and assemble them here.         
	Big telecom players expect immediate benefits from the recent government notification aimed at restricting the direct import of handsets to promote manufacturing in India. Samsung aims to gain a 20 per cent market share in smartphones and bring down the prices of many models to below Rs 10,000 soon.         
	The firm will expand its smartphone portfolio to 10 handsets by the end of this year, said Ranjit Yadav, director (mobile and IT business) of Samsung Electronics, at the launch of the Galaxy 3 and Galaxy 5 smartphones today.

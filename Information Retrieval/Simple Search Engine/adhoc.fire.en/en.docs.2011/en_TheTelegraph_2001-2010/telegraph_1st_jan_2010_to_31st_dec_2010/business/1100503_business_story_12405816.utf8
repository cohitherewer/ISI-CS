          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Growth plans                                  
	Mumbai, May 2: The Bank of Baroda (BoB) has laid out an ambitious road map for financial inclusion based on the business correspondent model. The countrys third largest PSU bank plans to enter 6,000 villages over the next couple of years.         
	Around 1,500 business correspondents will serve these villages by not only garnering deposits but also offering loans and micro-insurance products.         
	Recently, BoB had finalised a financial inclusion plan, of which the business correspondent model is a part.        
	The Reserve Bank of India had asked banks to put in place a financial inclusion plan and submit it by March.         
	The central bank did not enforce a uniform model but gave banks freedom to choose a strategy that best suited them.        
	Banks have been told to focus on villages having a population of over 2,000. The RBI is expected to monitor the implementation of each banks plan. Sources at BoB said they had developed a technology-based model to provide services at the doorstep of the customers in the identified villages.         
	According to the plan, each business correspondent will be equipped with a smart card-based device that has a biometric identification system.         
	An individuals bank account can be operated by this device. The business correspondent only needs to verify the individual through the device and once its done, the service is provided, the source said.         
	BoB is soon expected to float a tender for the hand-held device inviting bids from various service providers.         
	The business correspondent model took off in 2006 when the RBI permitted NGOs, micro-finance institutions, retired bank and government employees, ex-servicemen and other organisations to be hired as correspondents.

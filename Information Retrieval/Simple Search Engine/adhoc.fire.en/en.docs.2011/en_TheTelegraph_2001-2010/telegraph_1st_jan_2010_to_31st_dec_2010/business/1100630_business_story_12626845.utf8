          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 29: Private sector banks are likely to give state-owned lenders a stiff competition by setting their base rates 100 to 50 basis points below PSU bank rates.        
	Private banks said the base rate  the lowest rate at which banks can lend  would be fixed between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent to woo blue chip companies, which are used to shopping around for bargain rates.         
	Triple A rated companies currently borrow at 6.5 per cent to 6.7 per cent for one year. Some short-term loans to top-rated companies are also going as low as 5-6 per cent, said bankers.         
	However, Punjab National Bank chairman K.R. Kamath does not expect customers to change banks because of lower lending rates.        
	Private lenders, including major players ICICI and HDFC, will announce their base rates tomorrow. The rates will be based on funding costs among other variables and can be revised every quarter.        
	To end the practice of retailers and small enterprises subsidising large companies, the RBI has mandated that all banks arrive at a base rate for lending, below which no loans can be extended.         
	Once this rule comes into force on July 1, large companies, which benefited from so-called sub-prime rate lending, will have to pay at least the base rate. However, a likely rise in their short-term borrowing cost may drive them to tap alternative sources such as the commercial paper market for funds.         
	Our opinion is that this (short-term) portion of the lending basket will look for alternative avenues and instruments and hence move out of the conventional system. said Krishnan A.S.V. of Ambit Capital.

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                           Close watch                                  
	New Delhi, July 11: The government is preparing a policy that will allow Indian companies to buy telecom equipment from foreign vendors, including the Chinese, after local cyber experts examine the devices for hidden bugs and other security threats.        
	The move comes after protests by China against Indias stringent rules on importing mobile equipment.        
	The government will insist on third party verification of the equipment bought from Chinese and other foreign manufacturers, on which security agencies have doubts.         
	Centres will be set up to help the governments cyber security system to regularly test and monitor the equipment used by telecom networks, following the model of the China Information Technology Certification Centre. Officials said the finance ministry had recently sanctioned funds for the setting up of the test centres.         
	China is Indias largest trading partner. While India cannot legitimately impose a ban on the import of certain goods, the government doesnt want to overlook the concerns raised by security agencies following a cyber attack on Indian websites in April, allegedly committed by China.         
	Beijing has reacted to New Delhis reluctance by voicing its protests in diplomatic circles. China wants India to have an open and transparent investment environment for its telecom companies.         
	Commerce minister Chen Deming said his country was looking into reports of 25 Chinese companies being blacklisted by India because of security reasons. The ruling Communist Partys newspaper has also attacked India for under the table and unfair competition aimed at the Chinese industry.        
	The decision to have security scans is an attempt to placate the Chinese, while allaying the concerns of the Indian security agencies.         
	The compromise would burn a huge hole in the pockets of domestic operators because while Chinese equipment are cheaper, the checking process will come at a high cost.

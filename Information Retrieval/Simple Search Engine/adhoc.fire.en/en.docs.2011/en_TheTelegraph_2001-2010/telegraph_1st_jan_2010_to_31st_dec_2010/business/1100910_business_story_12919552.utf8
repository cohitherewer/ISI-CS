          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Swapan Bhowmik: Extended duty                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 9: Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) has formally initiated a search for a new managing director.         
	The company, jointly owned by the Bengal government and The Chatterjee Group (TCG), has employed headhunting firm Spencer Stuart.        
	Incumbent Swapan Bhowmik is handling the affairs even after his three-year extension term ended on March 31.         
	The HPL board had decided on March 2 to look for a new face and had constituted a five-member committee.        
	The board asked Bhowmik to continue till a replacement was found.        
	Today, the company came out with advertisements in newspapers seeking applications.        
	Company insiders said the latest move followed a fresh salvo by Purnendu Chatterjee, chairman of TCG and vice-chairman of HPL, at a board meeting last week. He complained that precious little had been done to find a replacement.        
	HPL chairman Tarun Das heads the search committee along with Chatterjee and three others.        
	The development comes at a time TCG and the Bengal government are locked in a legal battle for the control of the Rs 6,000-crore company. Bhowmik is close to the Bengal government but does not get along well with Chatterjee.        
	Apart from managing the plant, which raised capacity by a third earlier this year, the new managing director has to strike a fine balance with the warring groups. Bhowmik joined HPL as president (polymer) in 2001, rose to the rank of CEO and later became managing director in 2005.

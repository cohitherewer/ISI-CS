	New Delhi, March 23: Dell, the worlds largest personal computer maker, plans to convert India into a servicing hub.         
	Founder Michael Dell, who is in the country to chalk out growth strategies for the region, is expected to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss Dells participation in the unique identity project.         
	India is the fastest growing market for us, growing at 100 per cent. We have already started to export from the Chennai plant to West Asia, Dell said.        
	The companys recent acquisition of Perot Systems helped Dell India to almost double its headcount to 21,500  a quarter of its global employee base  and also make India a service delivery hub.        
	Dell said the firm would try to transform its service delivery model from one based on sending its employees to customer premises to getting things done remotely.         
	The CEO of the Texas-based firm expects demand for computers and servers to pick up with the phasing out of recession.

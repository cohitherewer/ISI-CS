The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Virtual operator policy to facilitate 3G spread
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Virtual operator policy to facilitate 3G spread
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Alternative route                                  
	New Delhi, June 6: Telecom operators will soon be able to offer third-generation (3G) services on a pan-India basis through mobile virtual networks even if they do not have high-speed spectrum in all circles.         
	The guidelines, which the department of telecom (DoT) plans to issue for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), will enable firms to buy airtime on wholesale rates from existing operators and sell it under their own brands in circles where they do not have 3G spectrum.        
	Bharti Airtel, for instance, offers voice services in Calcutta but did not win spectrum for that circle. Under the MVNO route, it can buy high-speed spectrum from any private player, or BSNL, to offer data services in the city.        
	An MVNO offers voice and data services without actually owning any spectrum or infrastructure such as towers or transmission equipment.        
	According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, An MVNO will be a licensee in any service area, and can provide services to its customers through an agreement with the licensed mobile service provider.        
	MVNOs will have the option to either provide the same service as that of the carrier the airtime has been purchased from or set up its own billing systems and value-added service platforms, DoT officials said.        
	According to the policy details, which are yet to be finalised, MVNOs will have to pay spectrum usage charges similar to what existing operators pay. Officials said the service area of an MVNO would be the same as its parent and there would be no limit on the number of MVNOs attached to one main operator. However, each virtual operator will be restricted to buy airtime from one firm in a circle. Spectrum usage charges for a virtual operator will be calculated on the basis of the subscriber base of the parent operator.        
	Officials said the MVNO concept would intensify competition in terms of tariffs, and if some companies hiked rates, MVNOs could be used to rebalance it.         
	Globally, the MVNO model has brought down tariff as the cost of rolling out services is low for new players as they do not have to set up their own networks and share telecom towers with existing mobile operators, officials said.        
	According to analysts, this model has experienced phenomenal growth, particularly in 3G, as MVNOs are able to connect to users through specialised value-added services and superior branding experience. Firms such as the UKs Virgin Mobile, BT Mobile and Japans KDDI have based their strategies on the MVNO model. At present, there are 360 virtual operators globally.

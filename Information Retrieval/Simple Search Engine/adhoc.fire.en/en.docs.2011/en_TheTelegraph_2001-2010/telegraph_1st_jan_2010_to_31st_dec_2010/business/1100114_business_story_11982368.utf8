The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cash comfort for oil refiners in pipeline
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cash comfort for oil refiners in pipeline
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Watchful                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: The government is likely to decide tomorrow the amount of compensation to state-run oil refiners for selling fuel below costs.        
	However, a decision on freeing petrol prices has been deferred in the wake of soaring food inflation, though issues relating to pricing will be discussed tomorrow by oil minister Murli Deora and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Tomorrow we will be meeting the finance minister to discuss pricing, and everything else, said S. Sundareshan, special secretary in the petroleum ministry.         
	He was speaking to reporters after a review of the oil sector by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with oil minister Murli Deora, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, Kirit S Parikh, who heads a high-powered group on the pricing of auto fuel, and heads of oil companies.        
	A fuel price hike seems unlikely at this juncture as costlier petrol and diesel can spur inflation.         
	However, oil bonds as a form of compensation would put further pressure on the governments ballooning fiscal deficit.        
	The oil ministry is seeking bonds worth Rs 30,000 crore for the three PSU refiners  IOC, HPCL and BPCL  to make up for the losses suffered on selling petrol, diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG cylinder below cost.        
	The issue of oil pricing and the need for bonds figured prominently in todays review meeting.         
	In the beginning of this fiscal, the government had said it would issue oil bonds, as it had done in the last two years, only to revoke the decision later.        
	Deora again took up the issue of oil bonds with the finance ministry earlier this month. The oil refiners are projected to lose Rs 44,300 crore by selling fuels below the cost price in the current fiscal.        
	We are hopeful that compensation will be issued Whether it is in the form of oil bonds or cash, it has to be decided, a senior petroleum ministry official said.

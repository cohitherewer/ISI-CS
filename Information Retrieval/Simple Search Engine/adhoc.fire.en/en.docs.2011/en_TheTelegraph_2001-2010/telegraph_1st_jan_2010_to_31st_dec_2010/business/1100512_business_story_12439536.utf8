The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cash call in spectrum proposal

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 11: The telecom regulator today said operators should pay for 2G spectrum on a par with 3G at a time telecom minister A. Raja is under fire for giving away 2G radiowaves at 2001 prices.        
	Its recommendations on pricing, as part of a wide range of proposals for mobile firms, were two-pronged: existing GSM operators holding more than 6.2 Mhz of spectrum (5MHz in CDMA) would have to pay for excess spectrum at rates comparable with the 3G rates, which might fetch the exchequer as much as Rs 35,000 crore. Besides, those operators seeking more than 6.2Mhz of spectrum, or radiowaves through which voice and data travel, would have to pay the 3G rates.         
	According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), spectrum beyond 6.2Mhz till 8MHz will be charged at rates equal to the 3G rates, while beyond 8Mhz till 10Mhz the rate is 1.3 times the 3G rates. It has placed a cap of 8Mhz of 2G spectrum in all circles, apart for Mumbai and Delhi, where the limit is 10Mhz.        
	The auction for 3G (third generation) mobile telephony licence is currently underway, and the bid price for pan-India 3G spectrum today crossed Rs 14,000 crore  eight times higher than the Rs 1,651 crore at which 2G spectrum was sold in 2008. The Opposition has been demanding Rajas resignation alleging a scam in spectrum allocation that they claimed cost the exchequer Rs 60,000 crore.        
	Around 156 Mhz of spectrum is been held by various (GSM) operators beyond the specified limits (6.2 Mhz). At these levels, operators could end up paying around Rs 35,000 crore to retain additional spectrum, said J.S. Sarma, chairman, Trai.        
	Operators such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Idea Cellular and BSNL would be affected as they held more than 6.2 Mhz of 2G spectrum in various circles and would need to pay a fee to keep the additional radiowaves, or spectrum.        
	GSM operators association COAI today said the rising cost of spectrum could affect telecom growth plans, particularly in the rural areas. Growth could be hampered, said COAI director-general Rajan S. Mathews.        
	Share prices of leading operators nosedived after the telecom regulator announced its recommendations. Airtel shares on the BSE closed 3.11 per cent lower at Rs 285.20, while Idea Cellular closed at Rs 59.70, down 5.31 per cent. RCom was down 4.95 per cent at Rs 147.05, while MTNL hit a low of Rs 68.15, down 1.8 per cent on the BSE.        
	The recommendation could mean the government would earn more than Rs 90,000 crore from telecom spectrum this year. It already stands to gain more than Rs 55,000 crore from the auction of 3G spectrum.         
	However, it is not clear whether operators who hold more than the base level of 6.2 Mhz of spectrum will have to pay up the money in one go or pay in instalments, meaning the Rs 35,000 crore will be split over several years.         
	At present, all operators get 4.4 Mhz as start-up spectrum, with additional allocations based on subscriber additions. Operators only pay an annual spectrum use fee.        
	Trai also said future allocations of the 2G radiowaves should be linked to infrastructure rollouts instead of the current practice of giving spectrum on the basis of subscribers.        
	It said rules governing mergers and acquisitions needed to be relaxed to make it easier for operators to buy out one another as long as the combined entity did not command more than 30 per cent market share. According to the existing rules, a company cannot hold more than 10 per cent stake in another company that has operations in the same service area.        
	Mergers will require prior approvals from the telecom department and are restricted between two players in the same circle; merger will not be allowed if the number of operators fall below six in a circle.         
	However, the merged entity will not hold more than 14.4Mhz of spectrum (GSM). It is 10Mhz in CDMA. Excess spectrum if any beyond these limits shall be returned, said the regulator. Besides, those operators who got licences in 2008 need not have to wait for three years to sell out.         
	The regulator has also suggested that operators should be allowed to share spectrum for 5 years.         
	It wants the licence fee to be reduced to 6 per cent of adjusted gross revenue in the next 4 years from the current 6-10 per cent of the revenue.

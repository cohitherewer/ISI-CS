          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	New Delhi, July 23: The Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council today called for strong RBI action to tame inflation, which with low farm productivity and weak infrastructure threaten to tarnish an otherwise healthy economy outlook.        
	In its Economic Outlook released today  ahead of the Reserve Banks policy meet on Tuesday  the panel has forecast high growth rates of 8.5 per cent in this fiscal and 9 per cent in the next compared with 7.4 per cent growth in 2009-10 and just 6.7 per cent in 2008-09.        
	However, there are irritants in high inflation, low farm productivity and poor infrastructure that can turn the growth story sour in the medium term.        
	Inflation at 10.55 per cent in June is way above the comfort zone, and the Reserve Bank should either take strong monetary action or baby steps to arrest it. A bias towards (monetary) tightening is necessary, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the panel, said.        
	A recovery in the farm sector should, however, cool inflation down to 7-8 per cent in December and further to 6.5 per cent by the end of this fiscal. Still, the panels fiscal-end forecast is higher than the RBIs projection of 5.5 per cent and Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs forecast of 5-6 per cent.        
	The farm sector is likely to grow 4.5 per cent because of good rains, while industry will grow 9.7 per cent and services, 8.9 per cent; together they will push growth in this fiscal to 8.5 per cent. The panel had earlier projected 8.2 per cent growth.         
	On the basis of a normal monsoon forecast by the Met department, one may reasonably expect a strong rebound in crop output in kharif and rabi in 2010-11, Rangarajan said.        
	N.R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy said: Much of the projection on agricultural growth is on the assumption of normal monsoon after two successive drought years. The base impact would also boost the growth. The industrial growth numbers seem conservative as there is domestic pull. Services growth could be impacted because of the crisis in Europe.        
	Low farm productivity could come in the way of the nine-per-cent growth projections in the long run. The panel wants better water and soil management, improved farm practices and cultivation of a wide range of crops. We need to develop an integrated approach to these issues, Rangarajan said.        
	Another area of concern is infrastructure, particularly power, where capacity addition will be considerably less than the target in the Eleventh Five Year Plan. As against a planned target for creating 78,740 mega watts, it appears we would be lucky to get 62,000 mw by March 2012, Rangarajan said.        
	The panel said implementing the goods and services tax is a priority. It said the budgeted levels of fiscal and revenue deficits were still beyond the comfort zone and stressed the need to rationalise the food and fertiliser subsidies.        
	Food subsidy may be difficult to bring down, especially when we are talking in terms of universalisation of PDS (public distribution system) and so on, but fertiliser (subsidy) can be thought of, Rangarajan said.        
	Export outlook        
	Exports are expected to grow at a robust pace of 22 per cent to $216 billion in the current fiscal. The panels projections are much higher than the commerce ministrys target of $200 billion. Exports touched $176.6 billion in 2009-10. The panel has projected exports of $254 billion in 2011-12.        
	The economic oulook was released a day before the meeting of the National Development Council, the countrys top policy forum.                                                  
	Rangarajan said capital flows will be sufficient to cover current account deficit estimated to be 2.7 per cent of GDP this fiscal and add to the forex reserves.               
	Even as he expected portfolio investment, which is the foreign fund inflows in the capital markets, to decline to $25 billion this fiscal from $32 billion last fiscal, Rangarajan said robust FDI inflow will more than make up for the decline. Overall, capital inflows will add to $30.9 billion in forex reserves after meeting current account deficit this fiscal.              
	Ends                    
	High investment and savings rates of 38.4 per cent and 36 per cent that year, Rangarajan said would enable the country to post nine per cent economic growth despite the shortfalls.              
	Rangarajan said the Council has assumed recovery to be slow in the West, although it ruled out a second bout of recession like the one following the 2008 global financial crisis.               
	Robust economic growth will translate into higher tax collections, which in turn will help government cut its fiscal deficit to below the budgeted 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 2010-11. Fiscal deficit may fall to around 5 per cent of GDP in 2010-11, Rangarajan said, referring to strong revenues and higher-than-expected earnings from third-generation mobile and broadband wireless access spectrum auction.

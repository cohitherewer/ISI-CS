	Calcutta, March 10: Sony plans to launch 3D television sets in India by July.        
	We have already announced that 3D television sets would be available in Japan from June 10. We expect the product to be available in India by July, Sunil Nayyar, general manager (sales) of Sony India, said here today.        
	According to the company, a 3D set will be about 52 per cent costlier than a regular Sony flatscreen model.         
	The company has also said it hopes to liberate 3D from the confines of movie theatres. The success of 3D films such as Avatar, which won three Oscars on Sunday, has boosted the hopes of 3D television.         
	Samsung and LG are already selling 3D sets in few countries and expect to roll them out worldwide over the next couple of months.        
	The Sony sets will be packed with two pairs of special glasses and a camera sensor that will adjust the sound and picture quality depending on where the viewer sits. The glasses will cost extra.        
	Walt Disney-owned sports network ESPN also plans to launch a 3D channel this year.

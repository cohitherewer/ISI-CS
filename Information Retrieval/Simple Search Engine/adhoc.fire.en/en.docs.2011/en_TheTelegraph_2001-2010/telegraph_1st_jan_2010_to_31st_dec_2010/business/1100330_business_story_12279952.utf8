                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      TeamLease acquires city firm
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 29: Global staffing firm TeamLease Services has acquired a majority stake in Calcutta-based vocational training provider Indian Institute of Job-Oriented Training (IIJT) for an undisclosed amount.         
	TeamLease will invest Rs 75 crore in vocational training over the next two years.        
	IIJT, which started operations in 2006, has over 250 centres across the country. It specialises in finance, retail and IT. After the acquisition, TeamLease will operate the training centres, a company statement said.        
	TeamLease has funded the buyout through a combination of internal accruals and private equity investment from Gaja Capital.         
	The deal was completed by buying out existing shareholders (founders and Tiger Capital Management) and inducting new capital into the company.        
	TeamLease also has an option to take full ownership of the company in the future, the statement said.        
	This acquisition builds on our belief that quality supply creates its own demand and the ability to improve our interview rejects creates substantial operating leverage, TeamLease Services chairman Manish Sabharwal said.

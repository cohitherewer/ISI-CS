          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                                            
	Bokaro, June 10: ArcelorMittal Steel has broken the logjam over land acquisition that had been holding up plans for its 12-million-tonne steel plant in Jharkhand.         
	Top ArcelorMittal officials have reached an understanding with the villagers of Kasmar and Petarwar  an area with a strong Maoist presence  for the acquisition of 2,500 acres that is expected to cap protests over land pricing and assure jobs for the displaced people. The project requires 2,900 acres, and the remaining 400 acres will come from the government.         
	The worlds No. 1 steel maker has proposed to invest Rs 45,000 crore in the project, which was shifted from Torpa-Kolebira region straddling Khunti and Gumla districts to Petarwar-Kasmar in Bokaro district.         
	The acquisition of land in the first phase will start from June 14. Distribution of the forms for land sale, to be registered with the local court, started today.        
	The form will contain details of the land and information about the members of the displaced family, which will be verified from government records, a senior official of ArcelorMittal told The Telegraph.         
	Though the understanding with the villagers has been done but the agreement has still not been inked and will follow soon. Officials of the district administration will also be taken into confidence, said another official.         
	A phalanx of ArcelorMittal officials, led by general manager P. S. Prasad, had arrived at the plant site to discuss the land sale.        
	Prasad told the villagers that the company had agreed to pay Rs 5 lakh per acre besides a pension of Rs 60,000 each year to every family for a maximum of three years. The company, which expects to start production in 36 months, will look to provide jobs.        
	A job will be given to one member of each family. A married couple will be treated as a nucleus family. For example, if a father has four married sons in a family and the family has given its land, then it will be entitled to five jobs, said a villager.        
	Villagers not interested in a job because of personal reasons will be given Rs 5,000 per month for the next 30 years.         
	The company has assured that 75 jobs in the steel plant for fourth grade employees will be reserved for the locals.         
	One can move higher up the rank if one has the required qualification as priority will be given to the locals.         
	In addition, the company plans to take up a number of community development initiatives such as better roads, drinking water, power, health facilities, training centres for the unemployed and the promotion of cottage industries for the weaker sections, including widows.        
	Kamleshwar Narain Singh, the block development officer of Petarwar and Kasmar, said he was not brought into confidence for the land deal, which fell under his jurisdiction.         
	Bokaro deputy commissioner Satyendra Singh, however, said an ArcelorMittal official had informed him about the exercise.

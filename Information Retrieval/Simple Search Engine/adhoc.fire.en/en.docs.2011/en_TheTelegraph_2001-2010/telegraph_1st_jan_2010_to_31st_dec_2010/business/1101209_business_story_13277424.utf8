          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Work in progress                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The government has proposed that firms allotted coal and lignite mining blocks in the future will have to clearly describe the environmental impact of their activities.         
	Besides, they will have to inform the government of the welfare plans for the people affected by mining.        
	The coal ministry today came up with draft guidelines for companies to prepare their mining plans as it sought to speed up the process of mine development.         
	The ministry has already served notices to over 70 firms for delays in developing coal and lignite blocks.        
	With a view to bringing in uniformity and to standardise the preparation of mining plan by coal/lignite holders, this ministry has prepared draft guidelines, the coal ministry said in a letter.        
	Companies will have to mention their mining methods and the geological reserves considered for mining vis-a-vis extractable reserves.        
	The location of the coal deposit and details of the exploration done will have to be submitted to the ministry.        
	The move was aimed at a faster development of the blocks and conservation of environment, a senior ministry official said, adding the guidelines would be applicable to all new allottees.        
	The ministry has sought suggestions from stakeholders by December 20.        
	It has allotted 208 coal and 28 lignite blocks to public and private sector companies with combined geological reserves of about 50 billion and 1.8 billion tonnes, respectively.        
	The government periodically reviews the development of blocks as well as the end-use of the minerals.        
	After such a review in July, it was noted that the development of some blocks did not follow the existing parameters.        
	Accordingly, it was decided to issue showcause notices to 45 coal blocks allotted to government companies, including NTPC, and 48 coal blocks allotted to private companies.        
	The review committee also recommended the issue of advisory to five coal blocks allocated to government companies, seven coal blocks allocated to private companies and seven blocks allocated under tariff based competitive bidding.

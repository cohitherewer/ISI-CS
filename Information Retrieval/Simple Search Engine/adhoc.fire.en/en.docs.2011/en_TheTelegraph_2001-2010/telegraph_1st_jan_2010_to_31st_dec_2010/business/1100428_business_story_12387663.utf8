          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                       Kapoor: Upbeat      
	Mumbai, April 27: Private sector lender Yes Bank today reported a 75 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 140 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 80.1 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	This is the highest profit notched up by the bank since its inception in 2004. The bottomline growth was driven by a strong rise in advances, which led to a surge in its net interest income (NII).         
	For the year ended March 31, 2010, advances rose nearly 79 per cent to Rs 22,193 crore (Rs 12,403 crore), while NII grew to Rs 788 crore (Rs 509.3 crore). NII during the quarter grew 63 per cent to Rs 244 crore (Rs 150 crore).         
	On the results, Rana Kapoor, the founder, managing director and CEO of Yes Bank, said, The bank has delivered a robust financial performance with a sustainable net interest income and exceptional credit growth. Over the last 22 quarters, we have substantially built our corporate and branch banking businesses through concerted efforts with a strong demonstration of knowledge banking and relationship management competencies.         
	He said the bank would accelerate business growth across commercial banking, retail, small and medium enterprises and liabilities generation (deposits) to achieve a balance sheet size of Rs 1,50,000 crore and a pan-India network of 750 branches with a human capital base of 12,000 by 2015.         
	At its board meeting today, the directors recommended a maiden dividend of 15 per cent to its shareholders.         
	Kapoor said the bank was planning to raise Rs 1,500-crore from the domestic market during this fiscal.         
	We are well-endowed with capital as on March 2010 but we do have a headroom to raise around Rs 1,500 crore of hybrid capital in both our tier II and tier I structure, he said.         
	As on March 31, the banks capital adequacy ratio stood at 20.61 per cent.

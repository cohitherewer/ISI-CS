The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | High food prices remain an irritant
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      High food prices remain an irritant
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 28: High food prices, which could ease in the coming weeks, remain a cause for concern as there are fears it can spill over to other sectors.        
	The most worrisome feature of the economy is inflation, which agitates the House and people outside the House. I share the concern of the honourable members, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told Parliament today.         
	Reserve Bank of India governor D. Subbarao had yesterday said inflation was a big worry for the economy and the authority planned to remove monetary stimulus in a phased manner to ensure sustained growth.         
	The countrys wholesale-price inflation accelerated to a 17-month high of 9.9 per cent in March, while consumer prices paid by industrial workers surged 14.9 per cent in February from a year earlier.        
	The RBI reacted by hiking the key rates by 25 basis points on April 20.         
	The repo, or the rate at which it lends to banks, was raised to 5.25 per cent, while the reverse repo, or the rate at which it absorbs surplus cash, was raised to 3.75 per cent. The cash reserve ratio, or the proportion of cash that banks have to keep with the RBI, was increased to 6 per cent.        
	These measures are expected to anchor the inflationary expectations, Mukherjee said. However, the government has adequate stocks of rice and wheat to meet local demand.

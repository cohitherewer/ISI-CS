The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Online shoppers proliferate
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Online shoppers proliferate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          BEST BARGAIN                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: Virtual shopping is on the rise in India, egged on by product references from family and friends.        
	According to a Nielsen global online shopping report more than eight out of 10 Indian online buyers plan to shop through websites in the next 12 months and more than a quarter indicate they will spend above 11 per cent of their monthly shopping expenditure on online purchases.        
	The country has about 81 million Internet users, which will nearly triple by around 2015 to 237 million, said Boston Consulting Group.         
	The Nielsen report added that 71 per cent Indians trusted recommendations from family when making an online purchase decision, followed by recommendations from friends at 64 per cent and online product reviews at 29 per cent.         
	Indians still like a first hand experience for high involvement products and services that they buy. The traditional one-to-one experience with the sales person, who clarifies all their doubts, is preferred by many. Since the online medium does not allow them this interaction, the closest is the recommendation from their family and friends, though this is being largely replaced by expert reviews online, said Karthik Nagarajan, director (online division) of the Nielsen Company.        
	He said 50 per cent of online consumers use social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to help them make purchase decisions.        
	There is a bit of a silent social media revolution going on in India at the moment and it is largely mistaken for just social networking. The truth is that discussion boards, forums and review sites are seeing high growth in terms of conversations and this is where many shopping decisions are being made, Nagarajan said.        
	When shopping online, one-third of Indians purchase most frequently from websites that allow them to select products from many different stores.         
	In the next six months, Indians are most likely to buy books (41 per cent), airline tickets (40 per cent), and electronic equipment such as television sets, camera and mobile phone (36 per cent).         
	However, 23 per cent Indians surveyed also said that they had never shopped online. Globally, 16 per cent of consumers have never shopped online.                           
	Low Internet penetration and lack of confidence in using credit card credentials, are the biggest challenges for online shopping in India, though high adoption for online travel sites is changing this, said Nagarajan.

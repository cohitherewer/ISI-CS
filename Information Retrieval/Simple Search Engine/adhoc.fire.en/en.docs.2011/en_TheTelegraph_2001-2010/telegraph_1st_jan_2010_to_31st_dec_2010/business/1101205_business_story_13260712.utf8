The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IIFCL plans Rs 1200cr tax-free bond 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      IIFCL plans Rs 1200cr tax-free bond 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Goel: Money matters                          
	Mumbai, Dec. 4: India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) will come out with a Rs 1,200-crore retail infrastructure bond issue in the last quarter of the current financial year.        
	S.K. Goel, chairman and managing director of IIFCL, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference that the bond issue would come in three tranches of Rs 400 crore each between January and March.         
	I am sure of a successful completion of these bonds as the last quarter generally attracts investment from retail investors, he said.        
	The IIFCL chief said the bonds that were AAA-rated would carry a coupon rate of 8.5 per cent for 10 years and 8.75 per cent for the 15-year series and that both of them would have a put and call option at the end of five years.        
	IIFCL is not the first entity to come out with such a bond issue in recent times. Earlier, IDFC and L amp;T Infrastructure Finance Company had come out with such bond issues.         
	However, they met with a relatively poor response from investors.         
	Compared with them, the retail bond issue from the State Bank of India (SBI) received a huge response from investors because of the attractive interest rates the bank had offered.        
	In the last budget, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had announced a new income tax section 80CCF entitling taxpayers to exemption on money invested in infrastructure bonds up to Rs 20,000 a year, over and above the Rs 1 lakh invested under section 80C.        
	Under this scheme, institutions that qualify as infrastructure financing companies can launch retail tax-free long-term bonds with a minimum tenure of 10 years and a coupon rate not exceeding government securities.         
	These infrastructure bond issues are part of the governments effort to mobilise money to part-fund the massive $1-trillion infrastructure spend it has planned for the Twelfth Plan.

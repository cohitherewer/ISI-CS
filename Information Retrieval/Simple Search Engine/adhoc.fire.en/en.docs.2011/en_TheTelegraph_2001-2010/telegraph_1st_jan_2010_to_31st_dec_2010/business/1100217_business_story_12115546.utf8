          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 16: A consensus on the date for the auction of 3G spectrum seems to be eluding the government.        
	There is no clarity yet. I am waiting for directions from the finance ministry and the law ministry and have not got any from them, telecom minister A. Raja told reporters when quizzed about the date.        
	Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar, who heads the committee to monitor the vacation of spectrum by the defence forces, said revenues would get preference to timing.        
	I dont think it really matters if it happens this year or the next. They (department of telecom and the finance ministry) will take the decision based on how the revenue can be maximised, he said.         
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla said the date would be decided by the telecom ministry. The issues relating to 3G auction have been resolved, but I cant say whether the actual auction will happen before March 31, he said.        
	The finance ministry has reportedly cleared the decks for the auction by the end of March. The plan is for the government to give spectrum to the successful bidders by September 1 instead of selectively releasing spectrum.        
	The issues relating to 3G auction have been resolved, but I cant say whether the actual auction will happen before March 31, he said.

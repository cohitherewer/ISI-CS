                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sebi penalises Adlabs creator
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Shetty: In line of fire                                  
	Mumbai, June 9: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today imposed a penalty of Rs 1 crore on Manmohan Shetty, the founder of media company Adlabs Films, for allegedly violating insider trading norms.         
	The market regulator imposed this penalty after it observed that Shetty sold shares of the company within 24 hours of making public the information on the demerger of the FM radio business from Adlabs.         
	According to Sebi, information on the Adlabs boards decision on the demerger was sent by the company to the NSE and BSE on April 24, 2006.         
	However, Shetty, it alleged, sold 10 lakh shares of Adlabs Films the same day through a bulk deal. Sebi said Shetty sold these shares at an average rate of Rs 402.60 on the BSE, and the closing price on that day was Rs 409.14. On the following day, the scrip closed at Rs 393.63. It further said Shetty did not sell shares prior to this period (January1-April 23, 2006). Thus it is seen that he benefited by selling the shares before the expiry of 24 hours after the outcome of the board meeting was made public, Sebi said.         
	RIL freak trade        
	The BSE today said there was no manipulation involved in the sharp decline witnessed in the scrip of Reliance Industries on June 1, when for a few seconds the companys shares plunged over 20 per cent.        
	On June 1, the RIL scrip plunged 20 per cent to a low of Rs 840.50. However, it recovered within minutes to close at Rs 1,011.55, down 3.21 per cent.

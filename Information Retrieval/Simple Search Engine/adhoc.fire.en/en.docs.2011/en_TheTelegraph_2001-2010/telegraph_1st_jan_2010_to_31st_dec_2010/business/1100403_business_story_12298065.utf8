	Calcutta, April 2: Sale of mobile phones in India remained flat in 2009, while new connections rose 57 per cent.        
	According to research firm IDC India, handset sales fell in the first two quarters. Handset makers sold 101.54 million units in 2009.         
	According to the Trai website, 178.26 million new mobile connections were added in 2009, a 57 per cent growth over 2008.        
	Telecom analysts say a large number of users still buy smuggled or unbranded mobile phones at cheaper rates.         
	Estimates suggest that the demand for phones in the grey market can be over 2 million units a month.        
	The mobile handset market got even more crowded and fragmented at the lower and mid-market segments with the rise of copycat models that resemble high-end smartphones, IDC India lead analyst (mobile handsets research) Naveen Mishra said.        
	These copycat phones are often available for as little as one-tenth of the average sales value of a smartphone, Mishra added.        
	The difference between the number of new connections and sales of new handsets can also be attributed to existing mobile users holding on to older connections at a nominal cost, while acquiring new connections from other operators, Mishra said.         
	Among branded handset makers, Nokia had the largest share at 54.1 per cent.

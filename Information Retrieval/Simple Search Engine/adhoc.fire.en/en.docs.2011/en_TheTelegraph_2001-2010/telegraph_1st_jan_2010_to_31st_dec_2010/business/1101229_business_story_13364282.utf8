The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam gets notice for special audit
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Satyam gets notice for special audit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 28: Income-tax authorities today ordered a special audit at Satyam Computer Services for the years 2002-03 and 2007-08  the start and the end years that mark the period during which disgraced founder Ramalinga Raju had fudged the accounts of the countrys third largest software exporter.        
	Satyam Computer Services, now known as Mahindra Satyam, today said it had received communication from the office of the additional commissioner of income tax, directing it to get its accounts for the accounting year 2002-03 and 2007-08 audited under Section 142 (2A) of the Income-Tax Act.         
	It, however, did not provide further details on the communication. Sub-section 2A of Section 142 confers power on the assessing officer to order a special audit.        
	The directive from the income-tax department comes nearly two months after Mahindra Satyam had come out with accounting restatement of the company for the period 2008-09 and 2009-10.         
	On September 29, Mahindra Satyam had announced that the accounting fudge between April 1, 2002 and September 30, 2008  the last date up to which the company had published its financial results  amounted to Rs 6,763.1 crore, surprisingly close to Rajus claim of a Rs 7000-crore fudge.         
	While declaring the restated numbers, Vineet Nayyar, chairman, Mahindra Satyam had said the company could not access figures prior to 2002.        
	I-T officials are now ordering the special audit of the two years to determine if the forensic audit had unearthed the correct figure. The CBI has claimed in a Hyderabad court that the scam was worth over Rs 14,000 crore.        
	These numbers showed that the company posted a revenue of Rs 5,481 crore during 2009-10 and a net loss of Rs 123.9 crore. In the previous fiscal, its total income was Rs 8,812.6 crore though the loss was higher at Rs 8,177 crore.        
	The company subsequently came out with numbers for the first and second quarters of this fiscal last month. It posted a net profit of Rs 23 crore for the second quarter of the current fiscal ended September 30 and Rs 97.5 crore in the first quarter.         
	Revenues were flat as they stood at Rs 1,242 crore compared with Rs 1,248 crore in the first three months of the year. Although Mahindra Satyam is now mulling a merger with Tech Mahindra, recent indications are that this will happen only in the latter half of 2011.

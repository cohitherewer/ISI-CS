          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Same Footing                           
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The government today proposed to increase the overall minimum alternate tax (MAT), the amount companies getting tax exemptions pay on their book profits, from 15 per cent to 18 per cent, in an attempt to promote equitable tax payment among corporate taxpayers.        
	According to an internal study by the government, effective tax rate paid by most non-MAT paying corporates is around 22.78 per cent. While around 998 MAT paying companies such as Reliance Industries, NTPC, Bharti Airtel were paying 15 per cent of book profits as taxes.         
	MAT was introduced in India in 1996 to bring zero-tax companies into the tax bracket. MAT, which was raised from 10 per cent to 15 per cent last year, is imposed on profitable companies which do not fall under the corporate tax net because of various exemptions.         
	The increase of MAT to 18 per cent will reduce the gap in corporate taxes paid by MAT and non-MAT paying firms. This will promote inter-se equity among corporate taxpayers, said Pranab Mukherjee, finance minister in his Budget speech. The revision of the rate of MAT is expected to fetch the government additional revenue of around Rs 4,035 crore in the financial year 2010-11.         
	The rise in MAT to 18 per cent of book profits is also expected to affect the pre-tax profit of the 998 companies by around 3 per cent. These companies paid corporate tax at the rate of 15 per cent and below in 2008-09.         
	The MAT burden for the top 10 companies in the list is expected to increase by Rs 2,000 crore in 2010-11.         
	Reliance Industries would have to pay an additional MAT of Rs 536 crore, NTPC (Rs 279 crore), Bharti Airtel (Rs 275 crore), Reliance Communication (Rs 186 crore) and TCS would have to shell out an additional tax of Rs 184 crore.        
	Increase of MAT from 15-18 per cent may impact some companies in the IT sector, especially the midsized companies, small companies etc, said S. Gopalakrishnan, managing director and chief executive officer of Infosys.         
	In Infosys, the effective tax rate is around 21 per cent. Initial analysis shows that the change will not impact us at this point, added Gopalakrishnan.         
	However, the direct tax code has proposed to reduce overall MAT to 2 per cent.

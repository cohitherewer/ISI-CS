The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telecom trio beat retreat

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 25: Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular today withdrew their petition from the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) challenging the regulators proposals on second-generation (2G) spectrum pricing.        
	The TDSAT observed that the proposals of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) could not be challenged as they were only recommendations.         
	The tribunal has, however, allowed the operators to approach other appropriate forum. Sources said the three operators might move the Supreme Court to get a stay on Trais proposals.        
	Trai had recommended the payment of a one-time fee for holding spectrum beyond 6.2 megahertz (MHz). It had said the fee would be linked to the price of 3G radio waves.         
	It had also proposed that the operators pay the market rate for spectrum when their licences came up for renewal.        
	If the government accepts these proposals, operators with more than 6.2MHz may have to stump up more than Rs 17,000 crore to keep excess spectrum. They may have to pay Rs 1,00,000 crore when their 2G licences come up for renewal between 2014 and 2021.        
	Paying a higher fee for existing as well as future 2G spectrum will be a huge burden for Bharti and Vodafone as their profits have already come under pressure because of the tariff war.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      NMDC, Mittal mull venture for Africa
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Common interest                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: ArcelorMittal and state-owned NMDC plan to join hands to develop the formers Faleme iron ore mines in Senegal and explore mining opportunities in Africa.        
	Both the companies plan to invest Rs 5,000 crore each for the project, wherein there is an express need to build a new port and develop nearly 750 km of railway infrastructure to link the mine and the port, officials said.        
	They said the two firms had entered into a confidential agreement a few months back. The partnership could expand to other countries as well, they said.         
	Faleme has estimated reserves of 750 million tonnes of iron ore, which would be developed at an investment of nearly Rs 10,000 crore. Officials said the two companies were now sorting out the details of the deal. However, the spokespersons of both the firms declined to comment.        
	According to a 2007 agreement between ArcelorMittal and the Senegalese government, the steel giant was expected to start production from the mines in 2011. But the project did not take off because of the global downturn, compelling ArcelorMittal to scout for a viable partner to develop the mines.        
	The company is now looking to start production from the mines only in 2014. The project will be developed in phases to achieve an annual production capacity ranging between 15 million and 25 million tonnes per year at peak operations, the officials said.        
	In August 2008, NMDC had announced a tie-up with global mining giant Rio Tinto to acquire and develop mines both in India and abroad, especially in Australia and Brazil.        
	NMDC is looking at entering a joint venture with Australias Boulder Steel and Saudi Arabias ABS LLC.         
	The PSU firm plans to start roadshows, globally, from next week to attract investors for its estimated Rs 20,000-crore follow-on public offer, which is likely in March.        
	In the follow-on offer, the government is looking to divest 8.38 per cent in NMDC.         
	At present, the government owns 98.38 per cent equity in the company.

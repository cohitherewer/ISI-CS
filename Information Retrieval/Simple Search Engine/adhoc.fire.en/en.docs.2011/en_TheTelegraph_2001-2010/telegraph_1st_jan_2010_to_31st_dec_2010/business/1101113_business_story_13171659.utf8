          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: Industrial growth slipped to 4.4 per cent in September  the lowest in 16 months  that deepened worries over the capabilities of factories to churn out goods to maintain high growth rates and raised the possibility of the central bank pulling the brakes on further rate hikes.        
	The slide in the index of industrial production (IIP) for two consecutive months is a cause for concern to the government. We will have to examine the reasons behind this fall, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said.        
	As industrial growth almost halved from 8.2 per cent in September 2009, the target of 8.5 per cent growth for this fiscal year has come under the scanner.        
	Chief statistician T.C.A. Anant also expressed concern but said the country would end the fiscal with double-digit growth in industrial output and an 8.5 per cent GDP (gross domestic product) growth. Such low IIP growth was last seen in May 2009, when the index rose 2.7 per cent.        
	Growth in India has been fuelled by robust local demand and a resurgence in exports.         
	Car sales  a key indicator of economic activity  have touched new highs in recent months, while the demand for consumer goods has climbed steadily.         
	Though 14 out of the 17 industries, which constitute IIP, showed positive growth in September, the increase was modest, according to CSO data.         
	The decline in manufacturing, which grew 4.5 per cent compared with 8.3 per cent in the year-ago period, is a major concern as the sector constitutes 80 per cent of the industrial output.        
	Mining output grew 5.2 per cent against 7.4 per cent last year, while electricity grew 1.7 per cent compared with 7.5 per cent a year ago.        
	Production of consumer durables goods declined to 10.9 per cent from 21.9 per cent in September last year.         
	Capital goods production contracted by as much as 4.2 per cent.        
	Analysts said with industrial growth lagging, the RBI was likely to stop raising its policy rates.        
	In the light of IIP data, we would urge the government to relook its monetary measures and intervene in time to arrest this slowdown in manufacturing, said Amit Mitra, secretary-general of Ficci.

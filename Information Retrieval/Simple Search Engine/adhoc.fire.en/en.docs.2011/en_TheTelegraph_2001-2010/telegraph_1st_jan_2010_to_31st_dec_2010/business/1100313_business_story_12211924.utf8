          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, March 12: Industry output grew 16.7 per cent in January on robust manufacturing activity, reinforcing the optimism expressed by the Prime Minister of higher economic growth that prompted the partial rollback of stimulus measures in Union Budget 2010-11. Growth in January is, however, a tad slower than Decembers 17.6 per cent. In January 2009, production stood at just 1 per cent.        
	The index of industrial production, which measures the countrys factory output, stood at 9.6 per cent during the first 10 months (April-January) of 2009-10 against 3.3 per cent in the corresponding period last year, data released by the Central Statistical Organisation showed.        
	Manufacturing, the major constituent of the index, was up 17.9 per cent in January from 1 per cent a year earlier. Mining grew 14.6 per cent from 0.7 per cent a year ago. Power output went up 5.6 per cent and consumer durables expanded 31.6 per cent.        
	The signal is quite clear and it is encouraging. I do hope it will be possible for us to achieve the growth (rate of 7.2 per cent) which has been projected by the advance estimate of Central Statistical Organisation, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters.        
	For two consecutive months, there has been high growth. Perhaps it indicates that the manufacturing sector is going to make substantial contribution to growth and it (growth) is on the path of fast recovery, Mukherjee said.         
	According to CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee, The partial rollback of stimulus proposed in the current budget may not significantly impact the robustness of industrial recovery.        
	However, analysts expect strong consumer demand to fuel inflationary pressures, prompting the central bank to raise interest rates within weeks. Stronger production and equally headstrong inflation will nudge the central bank to tighten monetary policy in its April meeting, said Mridul Saggar, chief economist at Kotak Securities.         
	The recovery has firmly taken hold and the industry can live with the withdrawal of monetary and fiscal stimulus.         
	Analysts expect the central bank to raise rates by as much as 50 basis points when it issues its monetary policy on April 20 to tame inflation.        
	The wholesale-price based inflation rose to 8.56 per cent in January.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Foul play hint in rice exports 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Foul play hint in rice exports 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharma: Fresh disclosures                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The government today admitted that PSU officials did not follow transparent norms for the export of non-basmati rice to some African countries during the previous tenure of the UPA, resulting in huge profits for private entities.         
	The revelation could provide fresh ammunition to the Opposition to attack the government, already mired in the controversies over spectrum allocation, the Commonwealth Games and the Adarsh Housing Society in Mumbai.        
	The matter has been referred to the Central Vigilance Commission, commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma said in a statement in the Lok Sabha. He did not name the private parties that benefited, or the profits they made.        
	Showcause notices have been slapped on the officials allegedly responsible for the hugely disproportionate profits to private parties and denial of legitimate profits to PSUs, he said in a statement, adding the possibility of collusion cannot be ruled out.        
	The transactions were carried out between December 2007 and March 2009 by PSUs under the commerce ministry when it was headed by Kamal Nath, who is now the minister for road transport and highways. The government had banned the export of non-basmati rice in the wake of escalating prices in the domestic market.         
	On diplomatic grounds, the government allowed the export of a limited quantity to some African and least developed countries.         
	However, predetermined terms of contracts between foreign buyers and domestic suppliers (with small margins for the PSUs) led to hugely disproportionate profits accruing to private parties, namely the foreign government nominated domestic suppliers in India, Sharma said.        
	With the exception of exports to Mauritius, the PSUs did not follow the transparent rules in the selection of the domestic associates (suppliers), he said.        
	The lack of due diligence on the part of officials resulted in a denial of legitimate profits for the PSUs.         
	State Trading Corporation, MMTC and PEC Limited are the three PSUs involved in export and import on behalf of the government.

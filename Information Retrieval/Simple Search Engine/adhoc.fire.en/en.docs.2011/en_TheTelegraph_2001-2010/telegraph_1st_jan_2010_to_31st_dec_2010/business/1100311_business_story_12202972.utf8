The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Quiet start to NMDC follow-on offer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Quiet start to NMDC follow-on offer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 10: The follow-on public offer of NMDC Ltd, Indias largest mining company, got off to a tepid start today with the issue garnering a subscription of just over 17 per cent. Most of the bids came in at the lower end of the price band.        
	Data from stock exchanges show that as against a total size of 33.22 crore shares, the issue received bids for 5.71 crore shares on the first day.        
	Capital market observers said most of the bids that came in from institutions were at Rs 300 per share. On Monday, NMDC announced a price band of Rs 300-350 per share.         
	Analysts were, however, disappointed by the pricing with many saying the issue had been steeply priced. Few brokerages have even asked investors to stay away from the issue.        
	Though the final picture will be known only by March 12 when the issue closes for subscription, it is feared that the follow-on public offer (FPO) may see a poor response even from foreign institutional investors. Domestic financial institutions are expected to invest in the issue.        
	The FPO comprises a net offer to the public of 330,500,000 equity shares apart from reservation for its employees. NMDC is offering a discount of 5 per cent to the offer price to retail investors.         
	In spite of NMDCs various strengths that include a healthy balance sheet, lower cost of production and higher operational efficiency, brokerages such as Angel Broking are asking investors to avoid the issue because of its pricing.         
	In comparison to its domestic peer Sesa Goa, the only listed domestic iron ore company, we feel that the FPO is overpriced, the brokerage said in a report.        
	The lukewarm response to the NMDC follow-on offer on its first day was in sharp contrast to the flotation by DQ Entertainment (International) Ltd, an animation and gaming company, which closed today.         
	Data from the NSE website showed that it was subscribed a whopping 85.78 times.                     
	Against the total issue size of 1,32,17,151 shares, the IPO received bids of 113,37,82,240 shares. The IPO came in the price band of Rs 75 to 80 per share. Though the retail portion was not entirely subscribed, the Qualified Institutional Buyer portion was subscribed nearly 6.5 times. Capital market circles said the massive response to the issue despite concerns of it being over-priced came as the company is in an industry which is growing at a fast pace.        
	DQs clients include the Walt Disney group, Nickelodeon, BBC and NBC Universal.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: The petroleum ministry is unlikely to give up on ONGCs pre-emptive rights to Cairn-ONGCs Rajasthan oil fields.         
	While the ministry is considering seeking legal opinion to ascertain if ONGCs pre-emption rights can be ignored while deciding on Vedantas acquisition of 60 per cent stake in Cairn India, sources say such a stand is unlikely. The legal opinion would also ascertain if Cairn had fulfilled all its statutory obligations.         
	We have a law ministry opinion signed by the law minister Veerappa Moily and an opinion from the solicitor-general stating that Cairn Energys sale of a majority stake in Cairn India requires prior government approval and triggers ONGCs preemption rights, a senior oil ministry official said.        
	Though UK-based Cairn Energy has reluctantly acquiesced to the need for prior government consent in the $9.6-billion deal, it still maintains that ONGCs pre-emption, or right of first refusal, will not be triggered in a corporate deal as such rights come into force only when there is stake sale in a particular block such as say Rajasthan.        
	ONGC partners Cairn in all three of its producing properties in the country, besides five of the seven exploration blocks, by virtue of which it claims to have preemption rights over the Vedanta deal. Cairn has made a general application, which is open to interpretation. Besides, the company is self-contradictory. While it has agreed to the need for government consent, it continues to deny the existence of partner ONGCs rights. The two things cannot co-exist. Government consent and ONGCs preemption rights go hand-in-hand, at least that is what the legal opinions we have say, said the official.        
	This week Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy CEO Bill Gammell made his third trip to India since the deal was announced in August. He met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and principal secretary to the Prime Minister T.K.A. Nair, oil secretary S. Sundareshan to seek support for the deal. However, he did not meet the ONGC top brass during his three-day visit.        
	In August, Anil Agarwal-run Vedanta  a mining firm with no prior oil and gas experience  made an offer of $9.6 billion to acquire 51-60 per cent of the Indian subsidiary of the London-based Cairn Energy.         
	ONGC holds 30-50 per cent stake in each of Cairn Indias three oil blocks, including the mainstay Rajasthan oil fields, as well as some Nelp (new exploration licensing policy) blocks in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, where gas has been discovered.

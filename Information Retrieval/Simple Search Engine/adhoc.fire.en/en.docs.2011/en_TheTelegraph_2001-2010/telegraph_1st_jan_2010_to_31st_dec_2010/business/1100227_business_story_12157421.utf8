The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pranab takes a deficit gamble
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Pranab takes a deficit gamble
          SEETHA                           VIRTUAL REALITY                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: Is finance minister Pranab Mukherjees claims that he is putting the fisc back on track for real? Or is it just a hype? Its a bit of both, actually.         
	The fiscal deficit (the gap between the governments total receipts and total expenditure, which represents the amount it will have to borrow) has come down from 6.8 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) that was budgeted for in July 2009 to 6.7 per cent. The government has also set a target of bringing the fiscal deficit down to 5.5 per cent in 2010-11, 4.8 per cent in 2011-12 and 4.1 per cent in 2012-13.         
	Can Mukherjee pull it off?         
	Part of the governments success story in fiscal consolidation in 2009-10 has to do with a higher GDP figure, thanks to a change in the base year from 1999-2000 to 2004-05. The 6.8 per cent fiscal deficit assumed a GDP of Rs 58,56,569 crore. This has now increased to Rs 61,64,178 crore, which reduced the deficit ratio, though in absolute terms it increased from Rs 4,00,996 crore to Rs 4,14,041 crore. The government did benefit from a higher GDP number, finance secretary Ashok Chawla admitted.         
	But the government, he said, had also focussed on expenditure compression. Thats why the revised estimates of expenditure in 2009-10 of Rs 10,21,547 crore were almost the same as the budgeted estimates of Rs 10,20,838 crore.         
	The finance ministers promise of bringing down the fiscal deficit to 5.5 per cent in 2010-11 seems more ambitious, but D. K. Srivastava, director of the Madras School of Economics, says the target is achievable. The government seems to be banking on a 14 per cent rise in net tax revenues (from Rs 4,65,103 crore to Rs 5,34,094 crore) and a mere 8 per cent increase in expenditure (Rs 10,21,547 crore to Rs 11,08,749 crore).         
	Whether the government will get the taxes is a moot question. The concessions on the direct tax front will mean a 3 per cent dip in income tax collections, but there is an 18 per cent rise in corporation tax collections, part of it coming from an increase in the MAT rate which, Chawla said, is expected to net Rs 6,000 crore.         
	Big assumptions         
	What is puzzling is the huge increases in excise and customs duties that the government is budgeting  29.4 per cent in excise and 36 per cent in customs.         
	The increase in the excise rate from 8 per cent to 10 per cent (a return to the rates in December 2008 which were cut as part of the stimulus package) is expected to net Rs 14,000 crore, while the increase in the central excise duty on petrol and diesel is expected to bring in Rs 9,300 crore.         
	The government seems to be relying on the increase in rate and higher production to get higher revenues, says D.H. Pai Panandikar of the RPG Foundation. Some public finance experts feel these assumptions are a bit risky.         
	The government seems to be gambling heavily on additional revenue, said Tapas Sen of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.

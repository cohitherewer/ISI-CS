The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bourses rise early, see surge in volumes 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bourses rise early, see surge in volumes 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 4: The bourses opened for the first day of trading in 2010 almost an hour ahead of schedule at 9am  and brokers had little to complain about after a surge in volumes triggered by a block deal in the Reliance Industries counter.        
	The sensex opened at 17473.45  just nine points higher than Thursdays close  and dipped soon after to a low of 17378.38.        
	But the good news kicked in quickly and the markets started to sizzle. JSW Energy broke the jinx for power stocks with a nifty gain on listing, and the market drew strength from Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singhs comment that food inflation  which has already been flagged as a big worry by the Reserve Bank of India  would cool next month.        
	Meanwhile, FCS Software announced that its board of directors would meet on January 11 to consider a bonus issue, which, if cleared, will be the first one this year.        
	At the end of a robust day of trading, the sensex closed at a 20-month high of 17558.73, a gain of 93.92 points. It had hit an intra-day high of 17582.84 around noon.         
	Most of the action was concentrated at the auto counters that have witnessed a sharp rally since the second half of this fiscal on robust sales.         
	Metal stocks were also in demand as prices surged worldwide in the hope of a global economic recovery. LME copper surged to a 16-month high that came on top of a 140 per cent surge in the metals price in 2009.        
	Market circles said gains in the key indices would have been higher if the RIL scrip hadnt ended a tad lower at Rs 1,075.80, a drop of 1.2 per cent, as investors felt that it should have got a better price for its treasury stock sale.        
	The positive close on the first day of the new calendar year came amid mixed cues overseas. In Asia, Nikkei, Kospi and Taiwan weighted index finished in the green, while Hang Seng and Strait Times closed with losses. Elsewhere in Europe, most of the indices were in the green.        
	For the votaries of the extended trading hours, the first day did give them some encouragement.         
	On the BSE, the trading value rose to Rs 6,591.78 crore from Rs 4,652.10 crore on December 31, 2009.         
	On the NSE, the value was marginally lower at Rs 14,978.55 crore compared with Rs 15,149.24 crore on December 31. But overall trade rose to 6.4 million from 5.8 million in the previous session.        
	Stockbrokers had railed against the extension of trading hours on the ground that it wouldnt lead to higher volumes. Analysts said they would need to wait a little more for a clear trend to emerge.

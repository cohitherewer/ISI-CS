The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Orissa mega power project on fast track

          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Bigger circuit                                  
	New Delhi, June 2: The government is likely to invite bids for the 4,000-mega-watt (MW) power project in Orissa by the middle of this month.        
	The request for qualification (RFQ) for the Bedabahal project will be issued by the middle of this month, said sources in Power Finance Corporation, the nodal agency that invites bids for the large power projects.        
	Sources said they were awaiting the final clearance from the state government before seeking technical-cum-commercial qualification bids. We have been given an assurance by the state government that the final clearance will come within days, they said.        
	The Orissa government has acquired the land for the mega power project to be set up at Bedabahal in Sundergarh district, while the coal ministry has allocated Meenakshi, Meenakshi B and Meenakshi dipside blocks.        
	A project reaches the RFQ stage when land acquisition hurdles are cleared, and the process to finalise the promoter can be initiated. This is followed by the request for proposal, where financial bids are sought and evaluated.        
	The 4,000MW project requires an investment of between Rs 16,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore.        
	Mega power projects enjoy single-window land, water and environment clearances. These projects are given to firms that qualify in the technical and financial rounds and quote the lowest tariff for the power to be generated.        
	Reliance Power (RPower) has been the most successful in clinching such large projects. It has already been awarded the projects at Sasan (Madhya Pradesh), Krishnapattnam (Andhra Pradesh) and Tilaiya (Jharkhand).         
	The project at Mundra, Gujarat has been awarded to Tata Power, and the first 800MW unit is expected to be commissioned during the current Five-Year Plan period (2007-12).        
	RPower, however, may not be able to bid for the new projects as the empowered group of ministers has put a condition that a firm can develop only three mega power projects at a time.        
	According to the eGoM, a company can bid for a fourth one if it is able to complete at least one of the three projects. The cap has been imposed as it is difficult for a single company to arrange the funds, and any delay could affect governments power generation plans.

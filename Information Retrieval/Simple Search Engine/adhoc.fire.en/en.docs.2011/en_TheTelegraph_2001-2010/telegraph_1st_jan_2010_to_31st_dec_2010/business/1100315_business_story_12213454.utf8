                          Action time
    
	In July 2007, I had opened two recurring deposit accounts with ICICI Bank, one in my daughter rsquo;s name and the other in my son rsquo;s name. The term of the deposits was five years and the annual interest payable was 10 per cent. I have been depositing Rs 1,000 per month. But apart from pay-in slips, I have no other documents from the bank stating that my deposits are earning a 10 per cent interest for five years. Despite repeated requests the bank has not given me a passbook or a certificate against the deposit. What should I do?
    
	Jayasree Mitra, Calcutta    You make a written application to the bank asking them to issue you passbooks against the two recurring deposits. Keep a copy of the application acknowledging the receipt by the bank. Wait for a month. If the bank doesn rsquo;t reply or the replies are not to your satisfaction, approach the banking ombudsman at the Reserve Bank office on N.S. Road.
      Keep watching
    I purchased a house in Bhowanipur in 2005. I decided to sell it after some litigation arose. I believe that I shall have to pay tax on the selling amount. Please advise me different savings instruments that come without risks. 
    
	S. Nag, Calcutta  You shall have to pay tax on the long-term capital gains, if you have one, on the sale of the house. In our Personal Finance column, we keep on discussing various tax-exempt investment instruments from where you can get a reasonable return at lower risks. Keep watching this column.
    No need to declare
    Investment up to Rs 1 lakh in the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme is non-taxable under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, provided the principal amount is not withdrawn before five years. But the form for such investment doesn rsquo;t contain any such declaration by the investor. Is declaration necessary? 
    
	Sunil Chandra Kar, Calcutta  Declaration is not necessary. For example, when you take a home loan, the tax benefit is available if the loan is not repaid in full within five years. What it means is that you shall not get the tax benefit that you might have claimed earlier had you withdrawn the amount within five years.   If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraph@abpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: Tea output in Assam, the largest producer in the country, dropped 16 per cent in June after pest attacks damaged the crop.        
	Production in north India fell to 76.8 million kg from 91.9 million kg a year ago, statistics published by the Tea Board said today. Total production from the region grew 4.5 per cent to 212.3 million kg in the first six months ended June 30.        
	The harvest in Assam may drop by as much as 40 per cent during the second flush, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee had said last month.         
	Output in Assam shrunk 20 per cent in June to 50.7 million kg from the year-ago period, Tea Board data revealed. The second flush pickings are typically the best-quality leaves that fetch a premium from overseas buyers.         
	Heavy rainfall, particularly in Assam, has affected production in all gardens in May and June, the Indian Tea Association said in a statement.         
	According to the Tea Board, prices at auctions in the northeastern region rose Rs 15 per kg in the first two weeks of July because of the damage. North India fetched an average Rs 99.2 per kg against Rs 95.60 a year ago, it said.        
	Indias total tea production dropped 12 per cent in June to 104 million kg.         
	Output in the January-June period stood at 339 million kg compared with 333.9 million kg last year.         
	Exports increased to 83.9 million kg in the first six months of this year against 74.54 million kg reported during the same period last year. In June, exports fell to 12.76 million kg compared with 14.95 million kg during June 2009.

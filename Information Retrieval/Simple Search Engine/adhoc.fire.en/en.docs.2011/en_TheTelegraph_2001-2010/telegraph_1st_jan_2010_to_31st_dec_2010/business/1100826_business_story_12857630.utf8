The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cairn counter-bid ruled out
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cairn counter-bid ruled out
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharma: Sticking to his stand                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: ONGC Ltd will not join hands with other PSUs to launch a counter-bid for Cairn India, a senior petroleum ministry official said.         
	As the valuation done by Vedanta for Cairn India is already very high, there is no chance of a counter-bid, the official said. Besides, ONGC has the first right of refusal and should not be coming up with a counter-bid as it would weaken its case, the officials added.         
	ONGC chairman and managing director R.S. Sharma said: If the oil ministry is saying so, then maybe it is (PSU oil companies not bidding for Cairn stake). I myself cannot make any comment.        
	Sharma met oil ministry officials today ahead of tomorrows crucial board meet of the PSU, which has a 30 per cent stake in Cairn Indias Rajasthan blocks.        
	Sources said ONGC and oil ministry officials discussed the strategy to be adopted by the government and the explorer, which has a first right of refusal in any stake sale in the blocks.        
	ONGC again emphasised the need to proportionately share cess and royalty as the present arrangement yielded negative returns.        
	ONGC has a 30 per cent interest in the Rajasthan fields but pays cess and royalty on the entire production. ONGC will have to pay a royalty of over Rs 18,000 crore in 10 years, which will include Cairns 70 per cent share. ONGCs 30 per cent interest means it gets a 30 per cent share of the crude produced in Rajasthan.        
	Analysts say the government, ONGC, Vedanta and Cairn India may work out an agreement under which Cairn agrees to pay royalties for its 70 per cent share.        
	On the bourses, news that state-owned companies were not bidding for Cairn pulled down the companys stock. On the BSE, the share ended at Rs 344.20, a drop of Rs 10, or 2.82 per cent. Brokers added that Cairn could remain under pressure in the near-term.        
	Meanwhile, corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed said the government had no issues with Vedanta acquiring Cairn India if the shareholders of both the companies approved the deal.

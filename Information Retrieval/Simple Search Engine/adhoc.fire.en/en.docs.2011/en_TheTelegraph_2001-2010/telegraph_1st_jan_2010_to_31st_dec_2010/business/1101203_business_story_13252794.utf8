The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IMF open to break in tradition
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      IMF open to break in tradition
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dominique Strauss-Kahn in New Delhi on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said he favoured the new heads of the Fund and the World Bank to be from countries outside Europe and the US.        
	Let us be candid. I think the so-called agreement between the US and Europe whereby the IMF head would be European and the World Bank president an American is over. I think it would be just fair that the next leaders of the two institutions come from somewhere else in the world, Strauss-Kahn told reporters after a meeting with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee here today.        
	His remarks come amid reports that Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia may be in the race for the IMF top post.        
	Mukherjee said India would play its due role in the G20 and support the process of policy co-operation in tackling external and development imbalances.         
	The shift in economic power to Asia  particularly Japan, China and increasingly India  has strengthened calls for the unwritten convention to be scrapped.        
	On the debt crisis in Europe, Strauss-Kahn said it should not be underestimated. The IMF chief, however, was confident that Ireland would recover after its weekend bailout. The European Union and the IMF announced a $111-billion rescue package to shore up Irelands banking sector and enable the country to meet its debt obligations.        
	We should not underestimate the importance of this crisis which, in Ireland, is mostly coming from the banking sector. But I think the decision that has been made will fix the problems in the banking sector, and the Irish economy will come back on track rather rapidly, he said.        
	Comparing the economic vitality of Asia with the sluggish recovery in Europe and the US, Strauss-Kahn said, The crisis in Europe is still strong. A number of European countries needed to reduce their public spending deficits to avoid running into trouble. Even small economies may create a lot of damage.        
	The IMF chief said growth in India was amazing and was likely to match the Funds over 9 per cent forecast.

	Calcutta, May 13: Graphite India has decided to scale up its investment in Bengal.        
	The company plans to add a graphite electrode capacity of 20,000 tonnes to its Durgapur plant against the 10,500 tonnes envisaged earlier.        
	The investment will now be increased by Rs 67.5 crore to Rs 255 crore, Krishna Kumar Bangur, chairman of the company, said today.        
	We expect demand to get back to the level seen before October 2008 (when the global economy crashed) in the next one year. Graphite India wants to be prepared for that, he said after announcing the financial results for 2009-10.        
	The scale-up is being done at a very tight cost, promising a better operative margin when the capacity goes on stream in 18 months.        
	The companys capacity utilisation was only 52 per cent in the last fiscal.         
	Bangur said he was hoping the utilisation rate to go up to 70-80 per cent this year.        
	Graphite posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 234 crore in the last fiscal.         
	Gross revenue stood at Rs 1,394 crore, while basic earning per share was Rs 13.73. The board has proposed a Rs 3.5 dividend over equity shares of face value Rs 2.

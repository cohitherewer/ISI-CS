	Mumbai, March 2: Tata Motors today unveiled an electric version of the Nano in Geneva.        
	This is the second electric vehicle from the Tata stable after the Indica Vista EV.         
	The car, which will seat four people, has a predicted range of up to 160 km and an acceleration of 0-60 km per hour in under 10 seconds. According to a company statement, it will use super polymer lithium ion batteries, as used in the Indica Vista EV, which provide superior energy density.         
	Tata Motors vice-chairman Ravi Kant said electrification would be an integral part of the companys initiative to launch environment-friendly vehicles.         
	The Tata Indica Vista EV would be introduced in select European countries beginning this year.         
	We will progressively introduce electric vehicles in all relevant markets, he said.         
	The company had earlier displayed the Nano Europa at the Geneva Motor Show last year and expects to launch it in select European countries within a couple of years. In India, the Nano is being delivered to the first 100,000 chosen customers.

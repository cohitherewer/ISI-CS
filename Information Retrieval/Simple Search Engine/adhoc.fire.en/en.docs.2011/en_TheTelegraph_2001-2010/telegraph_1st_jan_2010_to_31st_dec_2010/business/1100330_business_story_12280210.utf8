          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Jhaveri: New role                          
	Mumbai, March 29: Citigroup today appointed Pramit Jhaveri as the head of its Indian operations in place of Mark Robinson who has joined Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ).        
	Jhaveri will oversee Citis businesses in India, including the institutional clients group, consumer banking and global cards and wealth management businesses.         
	He will report to Shirish Apte, CEO of Citi Asia Pacific.        
	Robinson has moved to ANZ as CEO of its South and Southeast Asian operations.        
	Jhaveri, who is a 23-year Citi veteran, was previously the vice-chairman of Asia Investment Banking, where he led Citi Indias investment banking franchise and the South Asian capital markets business.         
	Citi has been helping Indian companies to raise about $20 billion from local and international markets since 2009, the US bank said in a statement quoting data provider Dealogic.        
	Under Jhaveris leadership, Citi advised and provided financing for Tata Motors purchase of JLR and Tata Steels acquisition of Corus. It also advised Reliance Petroleum on its domestic merger with Reliance Industries last year. It played a lead role as financial adviser to Tata Teleservices in the merger of tower subsidiary WTTIL with Quippo for $2.6 billion.        
	Jhaveri said, Our focus is to continue to build our core businesses and deliver the best Citi products and services to our clients in this priority market.         
	Share sale        
	The US treasury department today said it planned to sell 7.7 billion shares of Citigroup, amounting to about 27 per cent in the banking major, this year. The treasury department had acquired these shares as part of the rescue programme, which saw $45 billion being infused into the entity to help it overcome the financial crisis.

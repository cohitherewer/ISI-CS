	Oct. 29: Naresh Goyal-controlled Jet Airways today reported a net profit of Rs 12.4 crore on a standalone basis for the three months ended September 30 compared with a loss of Rs 407 crore in the same period a year ago.        
	The airline had hauled its way into the black in the middle of the last fiscal after struggling for two years.        
	The airline recorded total revenues of Rs 3,523 crore in the second quarter, an increase of 31.2 per cent over the corresponding quarter of last year.         
	The airlines international operations of Rs 1,868 crore accounted for 59.5 per cent of total revenues. Over the second quarter of this fiscal, the airlines seat factor on international routes was consistently over 80 per cent, Jet said.        
	With the introduction of new service from Mumbai/Delhi to Colombo and Delhi to Milan by the year end, Jet is set to further consolidate its dominant market leadership as the preferred airline, chief executive Nikos Kardassis said.        
	On the airlines performance, Kapil Kaul, CEO of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, said, That the airline (on a standalone basis) has achieved a profit in what is traditionally the slowest quarter for the airline reflects that business is on a strong recovery path.        
	JetLite, the low-cost arm of the carrier, however, continued to suffer losses. The airline suffered a loss after tax of Rs 62.4 crore compared with a loss of Rs 126 crore in the year-ago period. The loss proved to be a drag on the group with a post-tax loss of Rs 50 crore on a consolidated basis.        
	Hero Honda        
	Hero Honda reported a 15 per cent decline in second-quarter net profit at Rs 506 crore as increased input costs offset sales.        
	The firm had reported a net profit of Rs 597 crore during the corresponding period last year.

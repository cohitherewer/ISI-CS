	Calcutta, Jan. 27: The Bengal IT department has earmarked a 100-acre plot to set up a hardware park near the upcoming airport city, Aerotropolis, in Burdwans Andal.         
	We are talking to both domestic and international firms to set up shop in the proposed hardware park and get tax incentives by generating employment, state IT minister Debesh Das said at an interactive session with a visiting Chinese government delegation from Kunming organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce here.        
	He said the state wanted specific proposals from China.         
	We invite companies who will invest in solar energy accessories, LEDs and electronics here, he said.        
	Besides Bengal, Karnataka had earlier made similar efforts to set up a hardware park.         
	The Karnataka government, too, wanted China to be part of the project, but nothing fruitful happened.        
	The 22-member Chinese delegation, however, did not commit any immediate investment.         
	Li Heliu, leader of the delegation, said the visit was meant to familiarise the Chinese industrialists with Bengal.         
	In September, another business delegation from Kunming had visited the state to explore business opportunities.

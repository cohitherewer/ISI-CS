          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 31: Some banks have started raising lending rates, taking borrowers by surprise. After the RBI monetary measures, banks had almost unanimously ruled out an immediate rise in loan rates, while most went ahead with a deposit rate hike.         
	The Union Bank of India jacked up its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 50 basis points to 12.25 per cent today, while Punjab National Bank (PNB) yesterday made loans dearer for its existing borrowers by 75 basis points.        
	The Union Bank said the rate revision would be effective from August 4. The hike in its BPLR will mean that the banks existing customers of home loans will have to pay higher equated monthly instalments.         
	Though the domestic banking system has switched to the base rate from July 1, many of the existing home loans continue to be benchmarked against the BPLR.         
	The Reserve Bank has said existing loans based on the BPLR system may run till their maturity.         
	In case existing borrowers want to switch to the new system, before expiry of the existing contracts, an option may be given to them. Banks, cannot charge any fee for such a switch-over.         
	The Union Bank has set its base rate at 8 per cent. The nationalised bank now provides new home loans of Rs 5-30 lakh at a rate of 1-1.50 per cent above the base rate. For loans above Rs 30 lakh and up to Rs 50 lakh, the margin over base rate stands at 1.50 per cent to 2 per cent.        
	On Friday, Punjab National Bank raised its PLR by 75 basis points to 11.75 per cent.         
	This comes after the central bank raised the repo rate and the reverse repo by 25 and 50 basis points, respectively, in its July 27 monetary policy.

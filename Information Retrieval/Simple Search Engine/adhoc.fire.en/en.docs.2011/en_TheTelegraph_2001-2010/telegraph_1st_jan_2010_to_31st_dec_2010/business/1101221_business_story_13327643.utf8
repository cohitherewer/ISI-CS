          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Message pending                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: Video calls on high-speed third generation (3G) networks have hit a snag with intelligence agencies demanding the monitoring of the service in real time, while mobile operators maintain that such technology is not available.         
	Telecom operators in a meeting today with officers from the intelligence bureau and the telecom department suggested that some mobile equipment vendors were working on a technology that would enable real time interception of video calls, and those can be put into use within the next 6-8 months.         
	The intelligence bureau has decided to study the option and get back to the department of telecom and mobile operators within a week. Currently, video calls can be monitored with a lag time of 5-8 minutes.         
	While the department of telecom (DoT) officials maintain that all 3G services, including voice, video and data, have been put on hold, sources said that telecom operators had already demonstrated real time interception of voice calls and data services, which the IB has accepted.         
	Both Tata Teleservices and Reliance Communications, who are providing 3G services among private operators, will continue offering voice and data 3G services. The Tatas have put its video call service on hold, while R-Com does not offer it because of lack of clarity. The DoT had, through a letter to mobile operators last week, asked them to stop video calls till a monitoring system was in place. Analysts said video calls bring the highest revenue to operators.         
	The meeting was also attended by telecom equipment makers. However, BSNL and MTNL, the two PSU telecom operators who have been providing 3G services for over a year, were not called. They also have not been given any instructions to stop 3G services.         
	Sistema plan        
	Sistema Shyam Teleservices today said its expansion and investment plans for India would not be affected by the ongoing investigations by the DoT into the delay in the rollout of 2G services.        
	Sistema-Shyam, which operates under the MTS brand, has received a showcause notice from the DoT, claiming Rs 11 crore for delay in launching services in 10 areas.        
	Chief executive Vsevolod Rozanov today said the company would reply within 15 days. This doesnt affect Sistemas plans in India. We continue to roll out our network, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal coal block for Shyam Sel
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bengal coal block for Shyam Sel
          SAMBIT SAHA                                           
	Calcutta, Dec. 5: Bengal has offered a coal block to local investor Shyam Sel Ltd after the company dragged the state to court on the grounds of lack of transparency in the allocation of mines.         
	The state government has agreed to give the Trans Damodar underground block to the company, which has signed an MoU with it to build a 1.1-million-tonne steel plant and a 1000-mega-watt power plant at Jamuria, Burdwan.         
	The authorities had last offered coal mines in 2007 when local investor Jai Balaji Group and Indias largest private steel maker  JSW Steel  bagged five blocks among themselves.         
	Since then a number of local and national players such as Kalyani Steel, Videocon, Vedanta and Shyam Steel have been waiting to get blocks  the prime reason for these investors to come calling in Bengal.         
	However, the Centre has not allocated any coal mine to Bengal since the end of 2007 and hence, the state cannot offer any to the industry.         
	The block given to Shyam Sel with reserves of around 40 million tonnes is believed to be small compared with what Jai Balaji and JSW Steel have got. Incidentally, this block was kept for a high-profile speciality steel maker from western India. Shyam Sel, which is still pursuing the court case, has neither accepted the offer nor rejected it.         
	According to the company, detailed exploration has to be carried out to establish the reserves and whether that meets Shyams long-term need. The government has told the investor to accept the small block and withdraw the court case, with a promise of a bigger block when the Centre gives it.         
	Bhushan Agarwal, managing director of Shyam Sel, declined to comment on the offer citing the court case. Bengal industry secretary Dipankar Mukhopadhyay did not return calls and text messages left by The Telegraph.         
	The petition of Shyam Sel, admitted by the court, has sought a directive to cancel the allotment of the five blocks to JSW and Jai Balaji. The petition said there was a lack of transparency in the allocation and the state government should redistribute them. Shyam Sel added these companies were sitting idle on the mines as well as on their respective projects.         
	The respondents  the state government, Jai Balaji and JSW  have filed their replies, but hearing on the case is yet to start.         
	The government defended the allocation of mines to Jai Balaji and JSW in its reply to the court and said the allocation could not be cancelled.         
	JSW has officially told shareholders that construction at its Salboni plant  a 4mt steel and a 300MW power unit initially  will start from April and finish in 2014, three years behind the original schedule.         
	Jai Balaji is yet to inform the shareholders when it will start work on its Raghunathpur project, but a senior official informally said construction of the first phase of the 1mt steel and 75MW power projects could start in January-February, two years behind schedule.         
	Industry observers said it was unlikely that the state would take any action against investors such as JSW and Jai Balaji who got both the mine and the land from the government. These companies have missed several deadlines, but the government believes they are closer to execution than ever before.         
	However, there has been a spate of events in the recent past when the Centre and other state governments have sent notices to investors for failing to meet the deadline to start mining. In some cases, the mines have even been taken back. No such action is expected from the present government ahead of the Assembly polls.         
	The Bengal governments job could have been made easier if the Centre had been more kind and approved some of the nine blocks that was sought for investors such as Kalyani, Vedanta and Videocon.         
	But after the split between the Left Front and the UPA in August 2008, no mines were offered to the state. The Centre often found a valid excuse to ask the state government about the status of the mines already allotted. The states response was far from satisfactory since neither Balaji nor JSW had started work on the mines.         
	Observers feel investors need to wait for the new government at Writers Building to get more mines.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Basel III deal signed
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Basel III deal signed
                              NEW NORM                            
	Basel, Switzerland, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Global regulators and central bank governors have reached a deal on Basel III, a sweeping reform that will force banks to hold more capital to withstand financial shocks.        
	Agreement was reached at a meeting of central bank governors and top supervisors from 27 countries chaired by European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet.        
	According to the agreement, banks will have to triple to 7 per cent the amount of top quality capital they must hold to withstand future shocks.        
	Banks will have to hold a core Tier 1 ratio of top quality capital  retained earnings or shares  of 4.5 per cent compared with 2 per cent at present, a statement from the group of bank governors and supervisors said.        
	Total Tier 1 capital was set at 6 per cent compared with 4 per cent at present.        
	Banks will also have to build a new, separate 2.5 per cent capital conservation buffer on top of their Tier 1 holdings, the statement said. It will be formed of common equity.        
	A separate countercyclical buffer of 0-2.5 per cent will be required when excessive credit conditions emerge.        
	Implementation of the new Tier 1 rules will start in January 2013 and be fully implemented by January 2015, with the capital conservation buffer phased in from January 2016 to January 2019.        
	Most details of Basel III were agreed in July, leaving todays meeting to add the final two pieces in the jigsaw  how much extra capital will be required and how long banks have to comply.         
	In the wake of the global financial crisis, which was partly because of risky trading by banks, leaders of the Group of 20 leading countries called on regulators and central bankers in 2009 to work on tougher bank capital rules.        
	The G20 leaders are set to endorse todays deal when they meet in Seoul in November, with the new rules taking effect from 2013 in stages.        
	Regulators say they are confident that the new Basel capital rules will increase the stability of the financial system without hurting the volume of lending.

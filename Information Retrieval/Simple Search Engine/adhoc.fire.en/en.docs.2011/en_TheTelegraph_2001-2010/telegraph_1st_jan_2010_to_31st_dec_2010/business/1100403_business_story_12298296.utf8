The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mobile players eager to dial 4G tech

	New Delhi, April 2: Mobile operators and technology firms in India are keen to switch over to fourth-generation (4G) technology even before the launch of predecessor third generation (3G) technology, the spectrum auction for which are scheduled next week. Currently, services are provided on the 2G platform.        
	Long Term Evolution (LTE), or 4G, technology allows more data to be transferred and at a higher speed compared with 3G.         
	With LTE gaining momentum (globally) last year, India can look ahead to leapfrogging to 4G directly, dual mobile service provider Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL) has told the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).        
	Microsoft, the worlds largest software developer, told Trai: Considering the challenges of extending broadband access to more than 600,000 villages in the country, it is imperative that (India) aggressively looks to make frequency bands available in the sub 1GHz band.         
	According to Microsoft, the costly and time-consuming process of increasing optical fibre network for broadband connectivity can be overcome by modern wireless technologies such as LTE.        
	Trai is also planning to prepare a policy framework for introducing 4G.         
	A number of countries, including Sweden, Norway, the US, Korea and Japan, are moving towards 4G. India should be prepared to introduce the technology at the earliest, says the regulator, which floated a pre-consultation paper in February to seek the views of the industry on 4G.        
	CDMA technology pioneer Qualcomm has proposed that large chunks of radiowaves should be made available for futuristic technologies.         
	Qualcomm has placed bids for the upcoming spectrum auction for wireless broadband (WiMax).         
	While 4G does require new spectrum blocks for operators, it is still an access service covered by the telecom license. As a result, TTSL believes that no separate 4G license be required and only spectrum be auctioned for this purpose, TTSL said in its reply to the pre-consultation process on 4G airwaves.         
	Next week, the government will auction 3G spectrum that will allow companies to offer services such as high-speed Internet and video conferencing on mobile.         
	Nine telecom players will bid for 3G spectrum on April 9, and the government expects to rake in over Rs 45,000 crore as licence fee.         
	TTSL also said it was highly desirable for India to auction 4G spectrum as soon as possible since limited competition in 3G  only three slots in most circles  could make high-speed services more expensive. Globally, 59 4G networks are due for launch in 28 countries by next year.        
	Compared with the 3 Mbps (mega bytes per second) speed offered by third-generation services, LTE can offer speeds of up to 10 Mbps. As a result, service providers should be able to get more data transferred through their network and possibly lower the cost of running their networks, too.        
	LTE allows operators to introduce exciting services such as HD (high-definition) video blogging, HD video on demand, media mobility and online gaming.

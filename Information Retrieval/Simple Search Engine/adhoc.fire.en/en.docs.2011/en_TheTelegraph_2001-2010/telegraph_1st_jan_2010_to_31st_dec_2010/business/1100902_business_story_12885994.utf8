The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance ups EIH stake to 14.8%
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Reliance ups EIH stake to 14.8%
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 1: Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Ltd today announced that it had scooped up another 26.7 lakh shares  roughly 0.68 per cent of the equity  in EIH Ltd, raising its stake in the hotel chain to 14.8 per cent.        
	The shares were bought from the open market on Monday and Tuesday though it wasnt clear at what price.        
	On Monday, RIL stunned the markets by announcing that it had bought a 14.12 per cent stake from the Oberois in an off-market deal valued at Rs 1,021 crore, or an average price of Rs 184 a share. The Ambanis had paid the Oberois a 36 per cent premium to last Fridays closing price.        
	In a communication to the NSE after market hours, RIL said its affiliate  Reliance Industries Investment and Holding Pvt Ltd  had acquired 5,8157,188 equity shares of EIH in an off-market trade spread over the last few days which had taken its holding to 14.8 per cent. Sources said this included the shares bought from the promoters of EIH.        
	The EIH stock closed today at Rs 143.70 on the BSE.        
	The stake purchase brings RIL within striking distance of the 15 per cent threshold which, when breached, will make it mandatory for it to come out with an open offer.        
	It was not immediately clear if the Ambanis were playing a game of brinkmanship with Calcutta-based ITC, which has held a 14.98 per cent stake in EIH for almost 10 years.        
	The Oberois have been worried about a possible hostile takeover bid by ITC for the hotel chain that operates 28 hotels under the Oberoi and Trident brands.        
	On Monday, the EIH stock hit a high of Rs 153.70 after opening at Rs 137.95 and closed at Rs 150.70. On the following day, the stock surged to Rs 180.80 but slithered thereafter to close at Rs 139.95.         
	The Oberois now hold 32.31 per cent. Besides ITC and RIL, the other major shareholders are the Life Insurance Corporation, which holds 6.36 per cent, and Analjit Singh, who has just under 4 per cent.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Banks rush to raise deposit rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, July 30: A host of private and state-owned banks are raising their deposit rates to attract more resources from investors, following a tightening of the monetary policy by the RBI.        
	Kotak Mahindra, Syndicate, Bank of Baroda (BoB) and the Central Bank raised rates today, while the Union Bank, Bank of India and Axis are likely to follow suit with a 25-100 basis point hike.         
	ICICI Bank, which will announce its first-quarter results tomorrow, may make a similar announcement.         
	Kotak today raised deposit rates by 25-100 basis points. The bank will pay more on deposits attached to certain maturity buckets with effect from August 1.         
	Syndicate Bank has raised deposit rates by 50-75 basis points. BoB said it would offer more on its deposits from August 2, while the Central Bank of India had increased rates in some categories.         
	Kotak has hiked rates by 25 basis points across deposits in the 15-30 day, 31-45 day, 46-90 day, 91-180 day, 181 to 270 days and one year to 389 days maturity periods.        
	For deposits of 271 days to less than one year, the interest rate was raised by 50 basis points to 6.50 per cent. The bank also raised rates for deposits above Rs 15 lakh but below Rs 1 crore by 25-50 basis points.        
	Sources close to the bank said the revisions were on account of the Reserve Bank raising the reverse repo rate by half a percentage point to 4.5 per cent and the repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent. The present liquidity situation also influenced the move.         
	Reverse repo is the rate at which the RBI absorbs excess liquidity from the system, while the repo is the rate at which it provides liquidity to banks.         
	Bankers insist that lending rates are unlikely to move up immediately. They, however, added that the rates could rise after a lag.

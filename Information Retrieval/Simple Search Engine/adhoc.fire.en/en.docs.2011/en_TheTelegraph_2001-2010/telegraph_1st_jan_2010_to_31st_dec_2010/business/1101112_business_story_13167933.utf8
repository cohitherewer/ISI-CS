	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today expressed concern about rising bad loans in the banking system and asked banks to keep an eye on their asset quality.        
	The banking sector needs to support the growth momentum in the economy while giving due attention to asset quality and prudent provisioning to balance emerging returns and risks, said Mukherjee at an industry event.         
	The support of the banking sector is essential as India moves to a 9 per cent growth trajectory, he said.        
	India, with its growth trajectory heading towards 9 per cent or more in the coming years, is placed at a critical juncture. The banking sector needs to support this growth momentum, he said.        
	Though Indian banks have emerged from the global financial crisis successfully, challenges still remain, he said.         
	There was a decline in the profitability of Indian banks in 2009-10 in all the major indicators. Further, the asset quality of banks deteriorated and the coverage ratio of provisions fell at the aggregate level, reflecting a weakening cushion to meet NPA losses.        
	The Reserve Bank of India in a report said, During 2009-10, gross NPA ratio increased to 2.39 per cent. After netting out provisions, there was a rise in the net NPA ratio from 1.05 per cent at the end of March 2009 to 1.12 per cent in March 2010.         
	The finance minister also asked banks to step up efforts towards financial inclusion to help bring the vast population into the ambit of formal finance and boost future economic growth coupled with equity.         
	As regards financial inclusion, India compares poorly with rich nations as well as many of the Asian peer group countries.        
	On price rise, the minister said: I hope this (declining food inflation) trend will continue. It is coming down slowly when compared with last years level, which had a reasonably high base too.        
	Food inflation declined for the fourth week in a row to 12.30 per cent as on October 30. Food prices constitute over 14 per cent of the headline inflation index. It was 12.85 per cent in the previous week and 12.59 per cent this time last year.        
	The minister had earlier expressed concern over increasing prices and said the government was taking a number of anti-inflationary measures to bring down the rate of inflation, which moderated to 8.6 per cent in September from 11 per cent at the beginning of the current financial year.

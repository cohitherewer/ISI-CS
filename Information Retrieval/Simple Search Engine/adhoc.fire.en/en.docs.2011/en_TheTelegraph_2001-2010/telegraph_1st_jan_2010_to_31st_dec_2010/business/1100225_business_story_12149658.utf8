          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Mamata Banerjee today promised a business model that would facilitate greater private investment in the railways without any asset selloff.        
	Banerjee said issues relating to procedural and administrative delays would have to be ironed out to encourage investments. To overcome this (administrative delay) situation, I have decided to set up a special task force to clear proposals for investments within 100 days.        
	A special structure will be created for the new business model, she said. But we will not privatise our railways. Indian Railways will remain with the government.         
	The railways hopes to raise Rs 858 crore from the private sector through the public-private partnership (PPP) schemes for 2010-11. In 2009-10, budget estimates were Rs 100 crore from PPP investments.         
	Banerjee today made a slew of private-partnership proposals.        
	The railways is open to joining hands with private parties in providing rail connectivity to ports in various states and is willing to help states to develop business models to inititate these projects.        
	Ports are expected in Bengal, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.        
	Mamata said six high-speed passenger corridors would be built, and the railways would set up a National High-Speed Rail Authority to monitor the projects.        
	The railways also plans to build multi-level parking complexes at the stations in major cities.        
	It will convert 10 stations  Ambala Cantonment, Bolpur, Ernakulam, Gorakhpur, Jammu, Jhansi, Kharagpur, Kota, Surat and Thane  into world class ones.        
	Moreover, six bottling plants will be set up at Ambala, Amethi, Mal, Nashik, Farakka and Trivandrum.        
	About 15,000 kilometres of optical fibre cables (OFC) will be laid through PPP.         
	This OFC infrastructure will be used to extend broadband services with last mile connectivity to urban and rural areas, said Banerjee.        
	She said the railways already had a network of 37,000 km of optic cables, and work on another 12,000 km was in progress.        
	Hemant Kanoria, chairman and managing director of Srei Infrastructure Finance, said, This years budget embraces private sector participation in a big way and it is very refreshing to note that the minister is keen to ensure that the private investors interest is not compromised.        
	The rail ministry has proposed an axle factory in New Jalpaiguri to achieve self-sufficiency in axle manufacturing.        
	The minister plans to set up automobile and ancillary hubs at 10 locations.        
	Plans are afoot for five wagon units at Secunderabad, Burdwan, Bhubaneswar, Guwahati and Haldia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Claim deduction
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Claim deduction
                                I had invested Rs 4 lakh in the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme with the SBI. When the deposit came for maturity in December 2009, I extended the account for another five years. Will the extension get tax benefit under Section 80C?          Arup Kumar Das, Calcutta
                    The extension of the SCSS deposit will be eligible for tax deduction under Section 80 C as a fresh investment. However, you shall have to show the accrued interest on the previous deposit as income from other sources during the financial year and pay the tax thereon. Only then you can claim the tax deduction.                                  TDS threshold      What is the threshold interest for the deduction of tax at source? When does a bank deduct TDS even after submitting Form 15G?        Pradip Chakraborty, Calcutta
                    TDS is applicable if the interest income from all deposit accounts in a financial year is above Rs 10,000. However, if a depositors annual income, including the interest income, is less than the basic exemption limit, he or she can submit Form 15H, as the case may be, for non-deduction of tax at source and the bank branch will not deduct the tax even though your interest income is above the threshold limit.                                  PAN card status      I am 75 years old. Though I have no taxable income, I have been submitting income tax returns every year quoting my PAN. However, I have not yet got my PAN card as it was not issued to me by my consultant. Now it is mandatory to submit a photocopy of the PAN card with Form 15H. How can I get the PAN card with the same PAN number?        S.N Biswas, Calcutta
                    Your tax consultant is not supposed to issue you either the PAN number or the card. This is done either by the income tax department, or UTI Investor Services Ltd, or National Securities Depository Ltd. You can check out the delivery status of your PAN card by logging onto www.utiisl.co.in. If it has already been delivered and you havent got it, you shall have to apply again at any IT PAN Service Centre or TIN Facilitation Centre.

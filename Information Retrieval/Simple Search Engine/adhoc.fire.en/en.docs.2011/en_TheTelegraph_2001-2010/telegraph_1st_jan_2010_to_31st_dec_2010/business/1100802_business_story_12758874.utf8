                                My husband passed away last year. His returns for the financial year ended March 2009 have not been filed. Prior to his death he was employed and was earning a salary. I am also employed and earn a salary. For the income earned by him during financial year 2007-08 and financial year 2008-09 up to the date of his death how is the return to be filed?           Sabitri Pal, Serampore
                    For both the financial years, return will have to be filed on the income earned by your husband by his legal representative. Under Section 159 of the Income Tax Act, the legal representative will be deemed to be an assessee and will be liable to pay any sum which the deceased would have been liable to pay.                                  Free from tax      I am a housewife. I have a monthly income of around Rs 5,000 that I earn from private tuitions. Out of this income, I invested in shares and earned a short-term capital gain of Rs 80,000. My total income for the year is Rs 1,22,000, including the short-term capital gain. Will I have to pay tax?        Arunima Haldar, Howrah
                    ce your total income, including the short-term capital gains, is less than the basic exemption limit for women below 60 years of age, you will not be liable to pay tax.                                     Value check      I am a student. I have invested in a pure large-cap equity fund. I want to know whether absolute return or NAV is more important to assess an equity fund?        P.K. Sahana, Khiddirpur
                    NAV stands for net asset value per unit of a fund. Growth or decline in NAV over a given period of time gives you the return from investment in that fund at the beginning of the time period. To an investor it should not matter whether one fund has a higher NAV and another has a lower NAV till both the funds are giving the same rate of return. Thus, the rate of return is the more important yardstick than NAV to measure the performance of two funds.

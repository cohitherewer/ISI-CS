          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Planning Commission today said that there should be a sensible definition of no-go areas where mining was prohibited.        
	Something that is called no-go for now does not have to be no-go forever, plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said on the sidelines of a public-private-partnership conclave here today.        
	The criteria that we use to establish what is no-go should be very carefully defined and based on some scientific considerations, Ahluwalia said.        
	He said he had taken up the issue with environment minister Jairam Ramesh, and he is quite willing to be flexible on what the criteria should be.        
	Concerns have grown over the environment ministrys classification of no-go areas, which have hit the projects of companies such as Hindustan Zinc, UltraTech and the Essar group.        
	The ministry of environment has divided mineral bearing regions into go and no-go areas. According to the guidelines, mining is allowed only in the go areas.        
	Recently, the coal ministry had sought the cabinets approval of its proposal that mining be allowed in 90 per cent of coal blocks labelled as no-go areas.        
	As many as 206 coal blocks spread across 4,039 square km in nine coal fields with a production potential of 660 million tonnes have been designated as no go areas.        
	Inflation hope        
	The plan panel today said inflation would be at a comfortable level by the end of this fiscal.The good news (is) that inflation is coming down. By the end of March, overall inflation and food inflation will be at a comfortable level, Ahluwalia said.        
	Overall inflation fell to 7.48 per cent in November from 8.58 per cent in the previous month. However, food inflation rose to 9.46 per cent in the week ended December 4 from 8.69 per cent in the previous week.        
	In the past few weeks, there has been a spike in vegetable prices, especially onion, which have shot up to Rs 80 per kg in retail markets in Delhi and other cities from Rs 35-40 a few days ago.        
	The RBI has said there was an upward risk to its projected inflation of 5.5 per cent at the end of this fiscal.         
	Though inflation has moderated, inflationary pressures persist both from domestic demand and higher global commodity prices, RBI said in mid-quarterly review last week.

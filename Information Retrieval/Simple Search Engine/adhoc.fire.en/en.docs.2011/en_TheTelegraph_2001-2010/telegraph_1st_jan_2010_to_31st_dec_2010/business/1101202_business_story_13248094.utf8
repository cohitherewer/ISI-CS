	Calcutta, Dec. 1: Gold prices for the first time crossed Rs 21,000 per 10 gram today on strong global cues and rising demand from jewellers in a busy marriage season.        
	Silver, also used in jewellery, spurted to a record Rs 43,950 per kg as demand from industrial units and coin makers went up.        
	The prices of 99.9 per cent purity gold shot up Rs 200 to Rs 21,020 per 10 gram in Delhi as stockists and jewellers created fresh positions to meet the marriage season demand, traders said.        
	The price of 99.5 per cent purity gold remained unchanged at Rs 20,935 per 10 gram in the city today, while it shot up to Rs 20,910 in Delhi and Rs 20,710 in Mumbai.

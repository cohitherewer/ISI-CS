The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt pledges gas pricing freedom

          OUR BUREAU                          Sundareshan: Clearing air                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 18: Gas explorers will have the freedom to discover the market price of the energy resource, petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said in an attempt to rekindle interest in the 34 oil and gas blocks that the government is looking to auction shortly.        
	At a roadshow here today, Sundareshan was looking to quell foreign investors concern over the Supreme Court judgment in the Ambani gas dispute in May that appeared to have queered the pitch for concessionaires by treating them as mere contractors of the government, which had asserted its ownership rights to the field and the outflow of gas.         
	The decision of the Supreme Court in the famous case has not been sufficiently understood. What has been upheld by Supreme Court is the marketing freedom for (exploration firm), he said.        
	Under the production-sharing contract, an explorer has the freedom to discover the market price by inviting bids from consumers in an arms length manner. The government does not fix the price. The contractor has the freedom to discover the price, he said, adding that the government only approved the price.        
	Diesel, shale gas        
	Sundareshan said the government had no plans to free diesel prices. In June, oil firms were granted the freedom to fix petrol prices. At that time, the government had indicated that diesel prices would also be freed shortly.         
	The June decision was taken when crude price was at $73-74 a barrel. Since then it has risen to $82-83 a barrel and it will be unfair to think that diesel price will be market determined at these levels.         
	He said the government planned to offer its shale gas assets to explorers by 2011-end, tapping into a seam of opportunities that burst into play worldwide over the past two years with the development of the fracking technology in the US.

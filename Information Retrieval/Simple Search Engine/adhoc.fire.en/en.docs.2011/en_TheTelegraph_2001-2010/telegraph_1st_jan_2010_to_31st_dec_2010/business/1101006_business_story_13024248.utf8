          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 5: The capital market watchdog has decided to crack down on portfolio managers who have been billing clients for performance charges that they havent really earned.        
	A spate of complaints from investors has prompted the Securities and Exchange Board of India to fix a tighter formula for calculating the performance-based charges that portfolio managers can legitimately demand from their clients.         
	The new measures will be applicable to all new client agreements from November 1. In the case of existing clients, the revised terms shall be implemented by January 1, 2011.        
	Sebi has suggested a high-water mark principle to be applied over the life of the investment  while calculating the performance fee that portfolio managers can charge, making it harder for them to jack up charges after a market downturn or a year of middling or poor performance.        
	This essentially means that an investor who had one year of good returns followed by a poor one and blowout returns in the third year would have to pay a performance fee only on the gain he had made vis-a-vis the highest historical value of his portfolio.         
	The market regulator said it had been receiving complaints from clients relating to fees and charges being levied by portfolio managers.        
	It has come to the notice of Sebi that the clauses relating to fees and charges in the portfolio manager-client agreement do not always clearly reflect the fees and charges payable by the client and the manner of computation of the same, it said in a circular issued today.         
	Just over two months ago, Sebi had floated a consultation paper on the subject.        
	According to Sebi, profit sharing or performance related fees are charged by portfolio managers upon exceeding a hurdle rate or benchmark as specified in the agreement with the customer.         
	However there is no uniformity in practice on how the performance related fees of the portfolio are computed.        
	Portfolio managers have now been told that such a performance-related fee should be computed on the basis of high-water mark principle over the life of the investment. The high-water mark is the highest value that the portfolio has reached.        
	Sebi added that the performance fees should not be levied at a frequency of less than quarterly.        
	The regulator said the high-water mark principle would only apply to discretionary and non-discretionary services and not advisory services.        
	In the case of interim contributions or withdrawals, performance fees shall be charged after appropriately adjusting the high-water mark on a proportionate basis.        
	It said in the case of a discretionary portfolio manager, a condition should be included in the agreement specifying that the liability of the client should not exceed his investment with the portfolio manager.        
	To ensure transparency and adequate disclosure, the client agreement should contain a separate annexure listing all the fees and charges payable to the portfolio manager.         
	The fees and charges should be shown for three scenarios  when the portfolio value increases 20 per cent, decreases 20 per cent or remains unchanged.        
	According to the Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Securities Market 2009, there were more than 232 portfolio managers in 2009.

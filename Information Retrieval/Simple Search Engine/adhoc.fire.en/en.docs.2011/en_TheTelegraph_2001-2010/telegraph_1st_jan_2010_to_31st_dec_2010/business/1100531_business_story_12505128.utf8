The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | China-made handsets face quality scan

	New Delhi, May 30: Mobile handsets assembled in China but sold in India under local brand names will have to undergo a security drill for spyware and safety check for radiation.        
	Intelligence agencies have raised a security alarm over Chinese telecom equipment, while consumer groups have repeatedly warned about radiation.        
	Over the last two years the country has been flooded with cheap Chinese handsets sold under Indian brands such as Zen Mobile, Micromax, Karbonn, Intex and Simoco.        
	According to an industry player, the low-cost material and software used in these handsets raise quality issues, which the government wants to address.        
	The government is looking at issuing a certificate for local vendors on the lines of the CE certification in Europe, Vaibhav Shastri, CEO of Zen Mobile, told The Telegraph.        
	In Europe, the CE marking certifies that a product has met the EU consumer safety, health and environmental norms.         
	Global handset vendors such as Nokia, Samsung and Motorola have CE marking, which is accepted in India as the mark of a high-quality product.         
	However, homegrown brands do not opt for CE certification as it is expensive and not mandatory, industry players said.         
	According to officials, the certification will ensure that the handsets are not infected by spywares or viruses, have unique identification numbers and keep radiation at a medically acceptable level.        
	The telecom departments technical arm  Telecom Engineering Centre  will undertake this project.        
	There are around 90-95 Indian brands selling over 50-60 lakh low-cost handsets per month, giving tough competition to global vendors in terms of prices, features, models and services.        
	The phones have become very popular in the countrys hinterlands and smaller cities.         
	According to research firm IDC, homegrown firms that entered the market in early 2008 have captured a 17.5 per cent share of the 100-million market at the end of 2009 from a meagre 0.9 per cent at the end of March 2008.        
	The government is setting up a telecom testing and security certification centre, where all equipment will be scanned.         
	Security agencies are concerned that some vendors may infiltrate telecom networks through remote log-in facilities and spyware.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had allotted resources in the budget to set up the testing centre, modelled along the lines of the China Information Technology Certification Centre.         
	Several countries such as the UK and the US use such facilities to bar the intrusion of external elements in their communication networks.                             
	The CNITSEC operates and maintains national evaluation and certification scheme for IT and telecom security.

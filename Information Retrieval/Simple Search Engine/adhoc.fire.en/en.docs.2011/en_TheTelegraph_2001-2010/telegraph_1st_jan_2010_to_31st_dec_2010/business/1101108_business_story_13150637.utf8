          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Nov. 7: Ratan Tata today said the Tata groups investments in aerospace and defence would be made in Andhra Pradesh. He was in the city to unveil the first India-made Sikorsky-92 helicopter cabin, which will be delivered to Sikorsky Aircraft Corp in the US later this month.         
	The first cabin was produced at the Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL) facility in the aerospace and precision engineering SEZ on the outskirts of Hyderabad.         
	The Tata group chairman said Andhra Pradesh had developed in the recent years and showed immense prospects of growth in the future.         
	Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Ltd has allotted 50 acres in the SEZ for setting up the TASL facility, which will initially cater to the exports market. The main manufacturing unit is spread over 7 acres.         
	The Tatas had sought an additional 70 acres to set up another facility to manufacture aerospace components. But the state government could only provide 40 acres. The aerospace cluster is spread over 350 acres, of which only 250 acres are notified under the SEZ.         
	Apart from TASL, Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation has allotted 30 acres to Nova Integrated Systems, 25 acres to Punj Lloyd, 20 acres to Mishra Dhatu Nigam and 96 acres to Samuha, a consortium of manufacturers, including MTAR Technologies Private Limited.         
	Samuha will invest about Rs 1,500 crore in the aerospace and high-precision meteorological test and measurement facilities. It has been allotted an additional 106 acres outside the SEZ.         
	The Mahindra and Mahindra group has proposed to set up an aerospace project in the SEZ with an investment of around Rs 300 crore.         
	The Sikorsky-92 helicopters will be built for both defence and civil purposes, the Tata spokesman said.         
	Last year, TASL announced that it was joining hands with EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company) to bid for the Indian Armys $1-billion communications system project.

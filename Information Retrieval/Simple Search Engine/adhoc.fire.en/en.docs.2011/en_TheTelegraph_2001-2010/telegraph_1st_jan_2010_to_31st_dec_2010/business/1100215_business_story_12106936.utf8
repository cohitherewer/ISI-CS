The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Zain gives Bharti access to Africa 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Zain gives Bharti access to Africa 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: Kuwaiti telecom group Zain today accepted Bharti Airtels offer to acquire its African assets for $10.7 billion (Rs 49,700 crore).         
	Indias biggest telecom group will pay $10 billion to Zain by mid-April, with another $700 million to be paid by the end of the year, sources said. Bharti did not comment on the deal.         
	The Zain board today unanimously accepted the offer, but the company would require the approval of Kharafi Group and Kuwait Investment Authority  two of its largest shareholders.         
	Kharafi Group, owned by one of West Asias wealthiest families, holds an 11 per cent stake in Zain through a subsidiary, Al-Khair. The Kuwait Investment Authority, the countrys sovereign wealth fund, owns 25 per cent.         
	For Zains shareholders, the transaction would end almost a year-long effort to sell the company as a whole or in parts.         
	Zain bought Celtel International for $3.4 billion in 2005 to expand into 15 African countries, including Kenya and Nigeria.         
	The company has more than 40 million subscribers in Africa, which constitute about 62 per cent of its client base. More than half of its $7.4-billion annual sales in 2008 came from Africa. Zain also has a presence in eight West Asian countries and a total of 70 million users.         
	Analysts said Bhartis acquisition would create one of the largest wireless firms in the emerging market with operations in more than 24 countries. It would also mark the companys third attempt to enter the continent.         
	Bhartis chairman Sunil Mittal, has been seeking to enter Africa, one of the worlds fastest-growing markets, as competition hots up in India. Last year, his company failed to buy South Africas MTN Group for about $23 billion.         
	Zain had been linked to a long list of suitors, including Reliance Communications, France Telecom, the UAEs Etisalat and an Indo-Malaysian consortium led by the little-known Vavasi group.         
	Bharti Airtel had also been spoken of as a potential buyer, but company officials had declined to confirm interest in Zain, only saying that the telecom firm was keen on expansion in emerging markets.         
	State-owned BSNL and MTNL, which were also in negotiations to join Vavasi to buy a 46 per cent stake in Zain at 2 dinars per share, had backed out at the last moment.         
	Last year, Zain had rejected an informal offer from Vivendi, which would have seen the French media and telecom company acquire a majority stake  between 51 per cent and 65 per cent  in Zains African businesses. Vivendi also abandoned its pursuit after deciding the deal was not in the best interest of its shareholders.         
	On August 31, Zains shareholders approved the removal of ownership restrictions, paving the way for foreign or local investors to own a majority stake in the company.         
	Bharti, which has nearly 120 million subscribers, has been looking to enter the emerging markets as tariff cuts and competition from the newbies have been hurting profits in India.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 21: TVS Motor Company today announced a 1:1 bonus share award to its shareholders. The two-wheeler maker from Chennai announced the issue of free stock just a day before the board of directors of its rival Bajaj Auto deliberates on a similar proposal.        
	Auto analysts were expecting companies such as TVS Motor to declare a bonus issue since the sector has seen strong performance over the past few quarters on account of a robust demand. This was reflected in the company declaring a 123 per cent growth in net profits during the quarter.         
	Net profit rose to Rs 40.38 crore from Rs 18.12 crore in the corresponding period last year.        
	The bonus issue and the strong growth in net profits propelled the TVS stock which ended at Rs 128.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, registering a gain of 5.76 per cent or Rs 7 over Tuesdays close. At one stage, the stock hit a 52-week high of Rs 137.20.        
	TVS Motor said two-wheeler sales had surged because of launches and a strong contribution from its existing product portfolio. As a result, revenues surged nearly 41 per cent in the first quarter.         
	The companys revenues grew to Rs 1,392.96 crore from Rs 988.70 crore in the quarter ended June 2009.        
	Total two-wheeler sales of the company grew over 31 per cent in the first quarter to 4.6 lakh units against 3.5 lakh units in the same period last year.         
	Motorcycles sales grew at 31.5 per cent to 2.04 lakh units from 1.55 lakh units and scooter sales grew nearly 42 per cent to 96,000 units.        
	On the other hand, two-wheeler exports registered over 78 per cent growth with sales increasing to 57,000 units, the company said in a press statement today.        
	TVS Motor said its authorised share capital would increase to Rs 50 crore from Rs 25 crore on account of the bonus issue, which has to be approved by its shareholders.        
	The board of Bajaj Auto is meeting tomorrow to consider a bonus issue and like TVS Motor, the Street expects the company to declare a ratio of 1:1.         
	A number of companies have issued free shares to their shareholders this calendar year by dipping into their reserves and converting it into equity capital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas chart China growth plan
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tatas chart China growth plan
                              Muthuraman: Upbeat                             
	Beijing, Dec. 17 (PTI): The Tata group today said it was looking at expanding its businesses in China, which accounted for about 6 per cent of its overall turnover in the previous fiscal.        
	Last year, the Tata groups turnover in China touched $4 billion, amounting to about 6 per cent of its overall business, said B. Muthuraman, chairman of Tata International and vice chairman of Tata Steel, two major subsidiaries of the Tata group, according to China Daily, the official state English language newspaper.        
	Around 50 per cent of Tatas turnover in China was derived from its auto businesses, led by the sales of luxury cars such as the Jaguar and the Land Rover after the acquisition of the brands in 2008, he said.        
	The group is now poised to expand its other businesses in China, he said, adding that it had already ventured into steel, consulting, IT outsourcing and hotels.        
	Tata Consultancy Services has emerged as the largest Indian software business company servicing Chinese state-run groups.        
	Besides the Tatas, a number of other Indian companies based in China are looking to ramp up their business, as the two countries have set a $100-billion target for bilateral trade by 2015 against a record trade worth $60 billion this year.        
	Wen, who concluded a three-day visit to India today, has promised to address the trade imbalance by providing more market access to Indian companies, especially those in the IT, pharma and agro-products space.        
	Muthuraman hoped that China would be more receptive to firms such as the Tatas becoming involved in Chinas economy in the context of Jiabaos visit. He said the Tatas had set up a joint venture with Zhejiang Tea Import amp; Export in 2007 to manufacture and market green tea.        
	He said he believed his company needed to accelerate the pace of development to keep pace with China, as global economic power shifted from the West to the East.        
	India and China represent the future. We will become two of the worlds three top economies over the next 20 years. So there is a need for India and China to understand each other on the business front, he said.         
	The Tata group is one of the first Indian companies to have established business links with China, with founder Jamsetji Tata opening a branch of his uncles company in Hong Kong in 1859.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Remedy for price rise
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Remedy for price rise
          OUR BUREAU                          Basu: Making a point                                  
	March 12: Kaushik Basu, the governments chief economic adviser, today said futures trading in commodities would not fuel inflation.        
	Futures trading is an efficient way of price discovery and important for stakeholders who want to take a position against price risk, Basu said at a seminar in Delhi. Trading should, however, be regulated to avoid foul play.        
	On the impact of high food inflation, Basu said the government needed to improve storage and supply mechanism of foodgrains.        
	We need to give much more thought on foodgrain management to protect the most vulnerable section of the population. I think this mechanism can be improved by bringing in private sector into play, he said.        
	The government should not be the only agent that is trying to take this risk on its shoulders, he said.        
	At a separate event in Calcutta, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Ministers, said food inflation was expected to come down to around 6 per cent in the second half of 2010-11. Prices will soften once the rabi crop arrives in the market.         
	On whether futures trading is one of the reasons behind high food inflation, Rangarajan said there was no clear cut evidence.        
	Though food inflation is a supply-side problem, we need to contain aggregate demand though policy action, he said.        
	The government should release more foodgrains through the public distribution system, he added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          K.K. Bangur in Calcutta on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 28: Graphite India  one of the top five manufacturers of graphite electrodes in the world  plans to set up a 50 mega watt captive power plant in Bengal at an investment of Rs 214 crore.        
	The company will set up the unit next to its plant in Durgapur, chairman K.K. Bangur said today.         
	We have land to build the plant. About 20 acres are needed, he said.        
	Power constitutes one of the major costs of electrode production. The captive unit will reduce cost. The Durgapur facility produces 40,000 tonnes of electrode annually.         
	Graphite has units in Bangalore and Nashik and another plant in Germany.         
	Bangur said the company planned to beef up total capacity to 90,000 tonnes from 78,000 tonnes. This would require an investment of around Rs 180 crore. He said the expansion would cost 30 per cent less than during the boom period.        
	Graphite hopes to utilise only 60 per cent of its capacity this year, but Bangur is confident that its expansion is in sync with demand.        
	The company has about Rs 1,200 crore in cash with zero net debt.         
	Graphite has posted a 117 per cent rise in profit at Rs 63 crore during the quarter ended December 31 from Rs 29 crore a year ago.         
	Gross revenue was up 3 per cent over the year-ago period.

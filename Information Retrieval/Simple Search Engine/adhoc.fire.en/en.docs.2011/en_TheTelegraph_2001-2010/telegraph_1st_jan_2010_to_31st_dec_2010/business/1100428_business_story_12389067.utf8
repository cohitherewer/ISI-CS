The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rating blow to Greece, Portugal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Rating blow to Greece, Portugal
                            
	Athens/ Berlin, April 27 (Reuters): Rating agency Standard and Poors slashed Greek debt to junk status on Tuesday and also downgraded Portugal, as investors worried political pressures could block a multi-billion euro bailout of Greece.        
	Markets in Europe and the United States tumbled in reaction to signs that the Greek debt crisis was spreading to other highly indebted states on the periphery of the euro zone.        
	Its contagion from the Greece crisis which has spiralled out of control, said William Sullivan at JVB Financial Group in Florida.        
	Its like coconuts falling from the tree. Theres a flight from sovereign debt issuers that have suspect national finances.        
	Sullivan said there was outright panic among investors who feared they would lose some of their principal if Greece restructured or defaulted on its 300 billion euro debt.        
	Greece has entered a death spiral of government insolvency, Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, Germanys largest bank, said late on Monday in remarks withheld for release on Tuesday.        
	S amp;P cut its rating of Greek government debt by a full three notches to BB-plus, the first level of speculative status. The outlook is negative, meaning the agency could downgrade Greece again.         
	For Portugal, S amp;P cut its rating by two notches to A-minus, saying the finances were structurally weak.

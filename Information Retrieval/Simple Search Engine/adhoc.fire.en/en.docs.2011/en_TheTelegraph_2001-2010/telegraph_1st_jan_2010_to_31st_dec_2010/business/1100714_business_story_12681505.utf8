	Calcutta, July 13: Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta today said the Centre and the state should jointly set up a venture capital-like fund to provide equity capital to small and medium enterprises.        
	Depending on the performance of the recipient company for three years after the capital infusion, it can get listed on a stock exchange and thereby provide an exit route for the government investment, the finance minister said while addressing a financial literacy campaign organised by Ficci here today.        
	Union corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed, who was present at the function, said he would take up this proposal with the finance ministry, which is the sole authority to provide such a fund.        
	Khursheed said his ministry would look into another proposal by Dasgupta of the Registrar of Company consulting states before allowing persons to set up a firm.         
	According to Dasgupta, many unscrupulous companies flourished because there was a mismatch of supply and demand for investment instruments.         
	Many companies got registration violating provisions of the companies act. These companies then raised money from the public and vanished. When investors came to us, we could only initiate a criminal proceeding against the company. But nothing can be done under the companies code because under section 321 of the companies act, a company cannot be proceeded against unless the RoC launches the allegation, he said.        
	I would request the ministry of corporate affairs to consult the state and its enforcement department before giving registration to a firm, the Bengal finance minister said.        
	I hope well be able to collaborate on the issues suggested by Asim Dasgupta, Khursheed said.        
	He said the government was consider setting up an SME stock exchange. It is Sebis purview. But we are in talks with them.         
	Satyam hope        
	The US market regulator Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) may not impose strict penalties on Satyam.         
	The SEC decided to slap Satyam Computers with huge penalties following the confession of its previous chairman B. Ramalinga Raju of committing a huge fraud.        
	I dont have any formal communication (from the SEC) as yet. But from our informal sources we came to know that there is no cause to worry, quot; Khursheed said.

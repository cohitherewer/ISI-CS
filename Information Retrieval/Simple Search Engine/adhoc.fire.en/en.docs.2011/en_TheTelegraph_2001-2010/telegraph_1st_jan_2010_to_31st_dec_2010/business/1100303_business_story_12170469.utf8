	Geneva, March 2 (PTI): Japans Nissan Motor today unveiled its compact car Micra, which will be manufactured in five countries, including India. The company also plans to assemble imported cars such as sedan Teana and SUV Xtrail at its Chennai plant.        
	Nissan will start producing the Micra in Thailand first and then in India in May, followed by China and Mexico. The location for the fifth plant is yet to be decided.         
	In India we expect to make about 70,000 to 80,000 units in the first year of production, of which only 20 per cent will be for the Indian market and rest will be exported, Nissan Motors executive vice-president Collin Dodge said at the Geneva Motor Show.         
	He declined to comment on the possible pricing of the car.         
	Low-cost car         
	Nissan and partner Bajaj Auto have not managed to find engineering solutions for their proposed low-cost car for India, Dodge said.        
	Nissan and Renault had joined hands with Bajaj Auto in 2008 to manufacture a low-cost car, whose price tag was put at $2,500.         
	Meanwhile, Nissan said it was in talks with Ashok Leyland, among other car firms, to develop a small car for the global market that could be priced around $4,500-5,000.

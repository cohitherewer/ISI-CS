	New Delhi, Nov. 15: The fate of 2G licence holders that were granted mobile permits in 2008 under controversial circumstances has become uncertain after telecom minister A. Raja stepped down on Sunday.        
	Department of telecom (DoT) officials told The Telegraph that an investigation was underway and depending on the outcome, some stand would be taken, including levy of penalty or withdrawal of licence.        
	Officials said the government might revoke the licences or withdraw spectrum allotted to companies that were yet to comply with rollout obligations.         
	However, there may be legal trouble if licences are cancelled for firms that have already rolled out services and have a strong subscriber base or have foreign shareholding.        
	The Telecom Commission, the apex decision making body of the DoT, will study all reports and take a legal opinion before reaching any decision, said officials.        
	Regulator Trai is also expected to submit its report on penalising telecom companies that have not adhered to rollout norms.        
	In January 2008, Raja had granted licences to nine firms: Swan Telecom (now Etisalat DB), Unitech Wireless (now Uninor), Loop Telecom, Datacom (now Videocon Telecom), STel, Allianz, Idea, Aircel and Spice.         
	Idea, Aircel and Spice were already present in limited circles, while the other six were newer players who had no prior experience. Some of these firms immediately sold stakes to foreign companies for huge valuations.        
	Of the six new firms, according to officials, only Uninor and STel have started commercial services in a big way; the other four have just soft-launched in most circles.        
	While Uninor has over 13 million subscribers; STel  which is majority owned by Baharain Telecom  has around 2 million subscribers in five out of the six circles where it has spectrum and has started operations.        
	India has over 600 million mobile phone users, with some new players attracting more than 12 per cent share of the new subscriber additions each month.        
	Norwegian telecom company Telenor has said any move by the Indian government to take retrospective action against Uninor, the joint venture between Telenor and realty firm Unitech, will impact foreign investments into India.        
	Uncertainty in the regulatory framework of the country would definitely be questioned by foreign investors, said the chief of another mobile operator.        
	The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), in a report, has stated that the entities granted mobile licences did not meet the prescribed DoT eligibility conditions.

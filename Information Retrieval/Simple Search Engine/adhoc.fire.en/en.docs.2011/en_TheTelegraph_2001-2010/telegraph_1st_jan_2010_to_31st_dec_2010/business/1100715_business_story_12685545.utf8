The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bonus bug bites Bajaj Auto

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 14: Its bonus season for Indian companies.         
	Pune-based Bajaj Auto Ltd today announced that its board of directors would meet on July 22 to consider a bonus issue of shares.        
	The two-wheeler maker joins a growing list of companies that have been rewarding their shareholders after a torrid 15 months when the markets and the fortunes of investors have gone through a gut-churning, roller-coaster ride.        
	Cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate ITC announced a 1:1 bonus in May to mark its centenary year of operations. In mid-June, state-owned MMTC announced a stock split and a 1:1 bonus.        
	After the announcement, the Bajaj Auto stock catapulted to an all-time high on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The scrip closed at Rs 2,443.90 on Wednesday, an increase of 1.42 per cent over the previous day.        
	Market experts expect that the company will issue bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1. Bajaj Auto is likely to offer one share for every share held, said Vineet Hetamasaria of PINC Research.        
	Hetamasaria predicts that other automobile companies may also chose to reward shareholders shortly. There is an expectation that Maruti Suzuki may soon announce a bonus issue. Market participants also believe that a bonus from Hero Honda is long overdue, he added.         
	The old Bajaj Auto  which now goes by the name Bajaj Holdings and Investment Ltd  had issued bonus issues thrice  1:1 in September 1991, 1:1 in June 1994 and 1:2 in September 1997.        
	Several companies have decided to issue free shares to reward shareholders in the current year.         
	Those that have already issued bonus shares this year include Kansai Nerolac Paints, Sterlite Industries, infotech major Wipro, Rallis India and Engineers India.        
	Others that have made the bonus offer announcement but the record date is still to be announced include Shree Renuka Sugar, Edelweiss Capital, ITC Ltd and MMTC.        
	Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database, however, is not impressed with this trend.        
	Historically, we have seen that after a bonus share issue of say 1:1, the price of the stock gets halved and thereafter goes up. If the company had not issued bonus shares, it is quite likely that the price of the single share would have gone up in any case. Its more about the mental satisfaction of holding more shares that the investor enjoys, he said.

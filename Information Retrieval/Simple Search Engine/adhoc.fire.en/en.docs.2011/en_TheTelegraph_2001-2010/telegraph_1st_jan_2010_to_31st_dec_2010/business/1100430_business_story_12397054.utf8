          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 29: The government expects to earn over Rs 40,000 crore from the sale of third generation (3G) spectrum alone, while wireless radiowaves will bring in additional revenues.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja today said the sale of 3G spectrum was expected to conclude by the end of this week. Auction of wireless radiowaves will commence two days after that.        
	The auction is being held successfully, Raja told Parliament, adding the Internet-based bidding should be completed in one or two days.        
	The pan-India licence price reached a bid of about Rs 9,321 crore today (17th day), up over 166 per cent from the base price of Rs 3,500 crore.         
	Delhi and Mumbai today crossed the Rs 1,400-crore mark against a base price of Rs 320 crore for each circle.        
	Calling the vigorous bidding for 3G licences a matter of national pride, Raja said revenues from 3G alone might exceed Rs 40,000 crore. Earlier, this week, Raja said he expected 3G and broadband wireless access auction together to garner between Rs 50,000 crore and Rs 55,000 crore.         
	Initially, the government had budgeted Rs 35,000 crore from the sale. However, the need for scarce spectrum  radiowaves over which basic mobile calls travel  in metro circles has pushed up the prices, said analysts.

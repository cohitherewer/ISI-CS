          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 10: The Reserve Bank of India is not in favour of fixing an inflation target and tweaking its policies accordingly.        
	Such a strategy is marked by an excessive focus on price control, often at the expense of ignoring measures which promote growth, analysts said.        
	RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn today said he was not in favour of such targets, which were there in some overseas countries. Though the central bank gives an inflation forecast in its monetary policy reviews, the number is not used as a benchmark for policy changes.        
	In its latest policy review, the RBI had raised the forecast for end-March to 8.5 per cent from 6.5 per cent with an upward bias, made earlier.        
	Speaking at a function of economic think-tank Icrier in the capital today, Gokarn said, I have not been in favour of inflation targeting before or after the crisis.        
	Inflation targeting is followed in a few countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Brazil and the UK.         
	Proponents of targeting say it lends more transparency as investors and others can expect interest rate or other changes should actual inflation reach near the target or fall much below the target. Some of the countries also have a tolerance band.        
	A senior banker told The Telegraph that the inflation numbers of the RBI for the year was only a forecast and it was not a goal to be achieved. In India, we do not have an inflation target. The number given by the central bank is set voluntarily based on various factors such as the global trend in commodity prices and the domestic demand-supply situation, he said.        
	Gokarns remarks today come days after he said in a conference call that the central bank would not raise interest rates between two quarterly monetary policies if inflation was within its estimate for the year.        
	Speaking at the function today, Gokarn said the central bank had reasonable tools to tame inflationary expectations which along with the short supply of food items, are fuelling the price rise. We have a reasonable framework for anchoring (inflationary) expectations.

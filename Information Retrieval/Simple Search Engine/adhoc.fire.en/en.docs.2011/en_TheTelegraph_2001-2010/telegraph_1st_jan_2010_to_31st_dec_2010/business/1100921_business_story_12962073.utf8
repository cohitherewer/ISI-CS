The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rally sparks hope of double delight
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Rally sparks hope of double delight
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 20: The sensex and the Nifty came tantalisingly close to two new psychological peaks  Points 20000 and 6000, respectively  sparking hope in the market that they would scale the two heights tomorrow.        
	If they dont make the tryst on Tuesday, the pundits are betting they will surge past them by the end of the week.        
	If there are good global cues when the market starts trading tomorrow, we can see the sensex at 20000 in early trading itself, an analyst said.        
	On Monday, the sensex hit a high of 19927.30 points while the Nifty swelled to 5989.50  levels that havent been since January 17, 2008.        
	The clawback by the benchmark indices signals that Indian equities are firmly back on the radar of foreign investors after 18 months of disenchantment with sputtering rallies and lowball returns.         
	The sensex is now yielding a year-to-date return of 14 per cent, making India the second most important emerging market for global investors after Russia.        
	Todays surge that was led by heavyweights, or large-cap stocks, came again on solid foreign institutional investor (FII) interest. Since January, the FIIs have pumped in over Rs 73,000 crore into the domestic capital markets, 12 per cent short of the record Rs 83,000 crore that they invested in 2009.         
	There is a case for FII flows to continue considering the economic growth forecasts for India and the market performance, Gaurav Dua, head of research at Sharekhan, told The Telegraph.        
	The sensex started the day slightly subdued at 19445.42 but quickly gathered momentum as FIIs swarmed into various counters.         
	Market circles said there was huge interest in the last hour of trading that sent the index to the intra-day high before closing at 19906.10, a gain of over 311 points, or 1.59 per cent.        
	Dealing room circles said a major highlight of the days rally was the buying interest in stocks such as Reliance Industries, ITC, Larsen amp; Toubro, HDFC, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.         
	The Anil D. Ambani group companies  Reliance Commmunications (R-Com) and Reliance Infrastructure  also rose sharply.         
	It may be recalled that R-Com has evoked a lot of buying interest in recent times on expectations that the company could sell a stake to a strategic investor. R-Com was the top gainer in the sensex, rising 5 per cent to Rs 175.        
	The BSE FMCG index led the list of sectoral gainers with buying interest in ITC, which surged 5 per cent, and Hindustan Unilever Ltd. It was followed by realty, auto and the metals pack.         
	Only five of the 30 sensex stocks ended the day in the red.        
	Meanwhile, the rupee continued to rule firm for the fourth trading session today gaining 13 paise against the US currency on dollar selling by banks and corporate houses amid bullish equity markets. At the forex market, the rupee closed 13 paise higher at 45.71.        
	Hectic selling of dollar by banks and exporters amid sustained capital inflows boosted the rupee, dealers said.        
	USE debut        
	The United Stock Exchange (USE) made a spectacular debut today, registering trading volumes that were twice as much the established bourses MCX-SX and the NSE.        
	Volumes on the USE, which has 21 PSU banks, five private ones, the BSE and other firms as stakeholders, stood at Rs 45,485.97 crore on the inaugural day of trading.

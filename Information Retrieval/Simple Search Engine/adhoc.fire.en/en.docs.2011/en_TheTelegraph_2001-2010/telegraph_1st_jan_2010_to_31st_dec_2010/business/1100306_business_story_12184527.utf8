          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Thorat: slow but steady      
	Mumbai, March 5: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today deferred the introduction of a base rate system  the new benchmark lending rate for banks  by three months to July 1.        
	Also, loans given to staff and loans against fixed deposits have been kept outside the base rate ambit.        
	Banks will now implement the base rate system from July 1. Concerns on the base rate have been sorted out, RBI deputy governor Thorat told newspersons after a meeting with top bankers here today.        
	Banks had asked the RBI to postpone the April 1 deadline after they faced technical problems in implementing the new system.         
	The banks also wanted the RBI to permit some loans to be disbursed at a rate below the base rate. These included loans given to the staff and those against fixed deposits.         
	However, the central bank turned down the demand of excluding short-term loans from being benchmarked against the base rate.         
	The new base rate will replace the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) that has been in place since 2003.         
	According to the RBIs draft circular, the base rate will be the minimum rate for all commercial loans, and banks are not permitted to lend below the base rate.        
	The existing model is being restructured as the RBI feels there is no transparency in the way banks treat corporate clients and common borrowers. While banks will have to fix their actual lending rates with reference to the base rate, they will have the freedom to decide base rates.         
	According to the RBI, the new rate will be determined by each banks cost of deposits, adjustments for any negative carry in their cash reserve ratio or statutory liquidity ratio deposits with the central bank, overhead costs and profit margins.         
	At present, BPLR of most banks is 11.75-12.25 per cent, and the base rate for the system is likely to be 8.5-9.5 per cent.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said while loans given to staff and advances against fixed deposits will be outside the purview of the new system, both the base rate and the existing PLR will coexist for some more time.

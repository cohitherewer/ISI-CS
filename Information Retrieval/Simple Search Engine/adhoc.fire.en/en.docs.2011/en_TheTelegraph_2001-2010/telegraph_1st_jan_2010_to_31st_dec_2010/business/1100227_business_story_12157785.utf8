          OUR BUREAU                          Inclusive measure                                  
	Mumbai/ Delhi Feb. 26: The coming years could see new entrants in the Indian banking space. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was considering to give banking licences to some private sector players and non-banking finance companies, a move that could see not only Anil Ambani but also a host of other houses such as the Birlas, Rahul Bajaj and the Religare group expressing interest.        
	There is a need to extend the geographic coverage of banks and improve access to banking services. In this context, I am happy to inform the honourable members that the RBI is considering giving some additional banking licences to private sector players. NBFCs could also be considered, if they meet the RBIs eligibility criteria, Mukherjee disclosed while presenting the budget.        
	Mukherjees statements were immediately greeted with delight by both investors and financial services players. Some of these players such as Reliance Capital and Aditya Birla Financial Services Group indicated that they would apply for a licence with the central bank.        
	Sam Ghosh, CEO of Reliance Capital, the Anil D Ambani financial services company said in a statement that, the move will potentially open exciting new avenues of growth for Reliance Capital in the future. We await further details and guidelines.         
	Reacting to the announcement, Ajay Srinivasan, chief executive  financial services, Aditya Birla Group, pointed out that while Aditya Birla Financial Services Group was already a large non-bank player, occupying a significant position across all its verticals, it will definitely apply for a licence. The Aditya Birla Group is confident that we will meet any eligiblity criteria that might be set, he observed.        
	Later speaking to The Telegraph, Srinivasan said that the group was well positioned to capitalise on such an opportunity. He added that the group was now widespread in the country with 4.5 million customers, 1,700 points of presence and it is present across the entire range of financial services.        
	Capital infusion        
	In a bid to shore up much-needed capital, the government today proposed infusing Rs 16,500 crore into state-run banks and financial entities, to maintain a capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent till March 2011.         
	The move is also expected to provide an impetus to public sector banks to increase lending to infrastructure, agriculture and other priority sectors.         
	Capital adequacy refers to the funds, primarily shareholders equity, which banks have to set aside for every Rs 100 they lend. As per the government of India stipulation, all public sector banks are required to maintain a capital adequacy ratio of 12 per cent.

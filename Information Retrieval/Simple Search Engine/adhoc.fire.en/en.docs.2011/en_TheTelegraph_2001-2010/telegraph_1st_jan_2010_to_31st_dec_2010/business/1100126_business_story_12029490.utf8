          OUR BUREAU                      Taking off                          
	Mumbai, Jan. 25: Naresh Goyal-owned Jet Airways today clawed its way back into profits after five consecutive quarters of losses.         
	The private airline reported a net profit of Rs 105.85 crore in the third quarter ended December 31 against a loss of Rs 249.75 crore in the year-ago period.        
	The airlines net sales, however, declined to Rs 2,722.68 crore from Rs 2,908.87 crore in the same period last year.        
	Just last week, rival Kingfisher Airlines had announced a net loss of Rs 420 crore in the third quarter.         
	Jet Airways was able to slash expenditure by 16.6 per cent year-on-year to Rs 2620.82 crore aided by the sharp fall in fuel costs. It claimed that it had increased its market share to 26.3 per cent.         
	Airline officials told reporters today that Jet Airways would take a close look at the three formats it currently operates  a full-service airline, an economy service that has seen a resurgence, and its no-frills Jet Konnect service  in the months ahead.        
	The fate of Jet Konnect  which currently operates 17 B-737s and 10 ATRs  will depend on the way the air travel business shapes.         
	Jet Konnect is the no-frills service launched with fanfare in May 2009 when the airline industry was struggling to deal with the economic downturn. The airline is planning to turn a few Jet Konnect operations into economy flights.         
	Hero Honda profit jumps        
	Indias largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero Honda today reported a 78.34 per cent jump in its third-quarter net profit at Rs 535.77 crore on million-plus quarterly sales volume.        
	The company will consider raising the capacity of its existing manufacturing plants and evaluate the possibility of a new plant sometime in the near future, said Pawan Munjal, CEO of Hero Honda Motors.

	New Delhi, July 30: A sub-group of the high-profile Prime Ministers Council on Trade and Industry will prepare a road map for farm growth with private sector participation.        
	Having business luminaries such as Mukesh Ambani and Jamshyd Godrej, the sub-group will prepare a draft plan of action within 15 days.        
	Growth in the agriculture sector is lagging behind compared with other sectors. We deliberated on the role of trade and industry in enhancing agriculture production to meet the countrys food security, agriculture secretary P.K. Basu said after the first meeting of the group today.        
	The meeting looked at the agricultural situation from multiple perspectives such as food security, increasing farmers incomes and providing products at reasonable prices to consumers.        
	Indias average farm growth in the first three years of the 11th Five Year Plan (2007-12) is only 2.2 per cent, while the target is 4 per cent for the entire period.        
	Godrej amp; Boyce chief Jamshyd Godrej said todays meeting discussed ways to boost production in the next 10 years, and the role of the private sector.        
	Basu said they discussed the scope of private role in the eastern region, which requires funds for sinking shallow wells and managing flood water, among other areas.        
	M.S. Banga, former CEO of Hindustan Unilever and a member, said: We are trying to push the priority button in agriculture as food demand is expected to increase with the rise in population and rise in the income of the people. Natural resources are scarce, and we need to have an action plan to feed people in the future.

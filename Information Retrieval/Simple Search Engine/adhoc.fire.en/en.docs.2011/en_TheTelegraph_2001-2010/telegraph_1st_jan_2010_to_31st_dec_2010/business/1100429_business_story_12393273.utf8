The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bulk deals make a comeback
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bulk deals make a comeback
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 28: Foreign investors have started scooping some of the gains off the table through bulk deals even as the crisis in Greece sent shivers through the stock markets.        
	AT amp;T International, the biggest telecom player in the US, today sold a 7 per cent stake in Tech Mahindra Ltd for about Rs 656 crore, barely a month after it had acquired the shares.        
	In separate bulk deals transacted on both the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange, AT amp;T sold a little over 86 lakh shares at a price of over Rs 762 apiece.        
	The US company made a neat profit in the transaction. It had acquired 98.70 lakh shares of Tech Mahindra in March through an off-market deal from Mahindra BT Investment Company, Mauritius, at a price of around Rs 162 per share. Both the Mahindras and BT (also categorised as a promoter) have stakes in the Mauritius company.        
	While AT amp;T had been a customer of Tech Mahindra since 2005, the stake purchase was part of an agreement signed between the two companies that gave the US firm an option to purchase shares of Tech Mahindra if it brought business to the company or met revenue targets. AT amp;T exercised the option as it had met the revenue targets.        
	Details of the deal on the BSE website showed that AT amp;T had sold 4,300,455 shares at a price of Rs 762.39 each. Of this, the Life Insurance Corporation bought 3,763,125 shares. Data from the NSE showed that AT amp;T had sold 4,300,000 shares at a price of Rs 762.44 apiece.        
	However, the Tech Mahindra counter reacted negatively to the news with the stock diving 4.34 per cent, or Rs 34.90, to close at Rs 770.05.         
	Market circles said this was on account of speculation that the stake sale by AT amp;T might result in the US company not bringing business to Tech Mahindra.        
	In another block deal on Tuesday, Swiss Finance Corporation (Mauritius)  a foreign institutional investor  sold 19.12 lakh shares in automobile giant Maruti Suzuki at a price of Rs 1,289.49 per share, valuing the deal at Rs 246 crore.         
	An analyst said the bulk deal segment (where the total quantity bought or sold has to be more than 0.5 per cent of the total equity capital of the company) has been active in recent times.         
	Most the deals have seen the participation of domestic entities. With the markets fairly valued at this stage, we may see few foreign investors start to book profits, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti income takes a hit
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bharti income takes a hit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sanjay Kapoor (right), CEO (India and South Asia) of Bharti Airtel, and deputy group CEO Akhil Gupta in New Delhi on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	New Delhi, April 28: Pressure mounted on Bharti Airtel to integrate its $9-billion acquisition of Zain Telecoms Africa assets, with the Indian telecom company suffering an 8.2-per cent fall in its fourth-quarter net profit on hyper-competition.        
	We are in the process of getting all regulatory approvals for the Zain deal and its going on smoothly. We should be able to close the deal as early as next month if we get all the approvals, Akhil Gupta, deputy group chief executive, said.        
	Bharti Airtel reported a decline of 8.2 per cent in consolidated net income (net profit) at Rs 2,055 crore. Net income in the year-ago period was Rs 2,239 crore. The company also announced a capital expenditure of $800 million in Zain Africa.        
	With Bharti suffering its first fall in net profit in three years, the focus is now on concluding the Zain deal so that it can be included in the balancesheet.        
	On when the company would include Zains financials into its balance sheet, Gupta said, Once the acquisition closes, the figures will flow into our financials.        
	Last year, Zain spent $800 million as capex (capital expenditure) for its African operations. I do not expect this year we will spend significantly higher than this amount as capex for Zain Africa, he said.        
	Bharti plans $1.8 billion investments in the current fiscal that exclude expenditure on third-generation licences and the tower business.        
	Gupta said the company would raise equity for the tower business, but it could only be done once the full-year financials of the business were out. We are planning an IPO for our tower business, he said.        
	Dented margins, falling average revenue per user and a decline in call rates were all evidence of intensifying competition.        
	Rahul Jain, telecom analyst with Angel Broking, said, The highlight was the strong 12.7 per cent growth in the minutes of use, which is an encouraging sign and can provide the much required support to the falling revenues in the coming quarters. We are positive on the stock in the long run in view of the Zain acquisition and a strong revenue market share (31 per cent) of the company.

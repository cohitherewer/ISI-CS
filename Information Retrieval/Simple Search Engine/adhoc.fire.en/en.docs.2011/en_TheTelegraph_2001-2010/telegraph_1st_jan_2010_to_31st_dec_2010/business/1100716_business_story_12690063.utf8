          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 15: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)  the countrys largest software maker  beat the Street estimates by posting a 24.3 per cent rise in profit after tax at Rs 1,906.07 crore in the first quarter of 2010-11 compared with Rs 1,533.94 crore the corresponding period last year.        
	On a sequential quarter basis, profit after tax fell 4.7 per cent.         
	The software major reported a total revenue of Rs 8,217.28 crore, which was 14 per cent higher than the Rs 7,206.99 crore in the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenues were up 6.2 per cent.        
	This has been a quarter of complete outperformance, said TCS chief executive and managing director N. Chandrasekaran.         
	He said all the customer verticals had shown excellent growth. In telecom, we saw double-digit growth. The banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and the retail segments also did very well. This has been the companys best performance in terms of revenue since September 2008.        
	Our ability to execute in an optimal fashion through continuing offshore shift and disciplined pricing have mitigated the impact caused by wage and currency headwinds and helped us post a strong margin performance, said S. Mahalingam, chief financial officer and executive director of the company.         
	During the first quarter of the current year, the company added 36 clients and made a gross addition of 10,849 employees. The net addition of employees during the period was 3,271.         
	Like its peers, TCS has had to offer higher salaries to retain talent at a time the market has started to improve with a rise in the attrition rate.        
	TCS has raised its hiring target for this year to 40,000 employees from 30,000.        
	The company sees strong demand for outsourcing services and is pursuing 15 large deals, said Chandrasekaran.         
	While the management said it was aware of the challenges ahead, especially in markets such as Europe, it is bullish on demand in the months ahead like Infosys that also announced its quarterly results earlier this week. We are carefully monitoring the macro-economic conditions, added Chandrasekaran.        
	Unlike TCS, Infosys, the countrys second largest software maker, had surprised markets by posting a 2.42 per cent decline in net profit for the first quarter of this year. The company said it had been hit by business from Europe.

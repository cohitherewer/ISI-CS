          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                           Raja: Troubled times                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: The telecom ministry today said the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) had no jurisdiction to investigate its policy decisions.        
	The CAG, in a report submitted to the President and the finance ministry, has held telecom minister A. Raja responsible for selling second-generation (2G) spectrum at lower than market rates in 2008, causing a loss of over Rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer.        
	In an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court today, the department of telecom (DoT) asserted that licences along with 2G spectrum were given as per law and in keeping with the extant policy and procedures.        
	In the affidavit  which is in response to a petition filed by an NGO over irregularities in the distribution of licences in 2008 by Raja  the DoT also rejected the need to monitor the ongoing CBI investigation into the issue.        
	The DoT said it had throughout acted in public interest on the basis of policy determined by the Government of India, and so no case is made out for monitoring the investigation...or a SIT (special investigation team).        
	According to the DoT affidavit, The legal position is well settled that the courts will not interfere with or monitor investigations except in rare and extraordinary circumstances, where the materials on record would easily establish that witnesses are being threatened, evidence is being destroyed or the investigation is not being done in a proper manner.         
	Since there are no such discrepancies in the investigation, the need for monitoring does not arise .        
	The DoT claimed that allotment and pricing of spectrum fell squarely in the domain of executive policy-making.        
	The Supreme Court had earlier criticised the government for continuing with the same minister despite the allegations levelled against him. The CBI has also been pulled up for making tardy progress in its investigations.

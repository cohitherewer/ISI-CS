          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, April 29: Yes Bank today laid out an ambitious road map to enter a new growth phase over the next five years.         
	Drawn up with the objective of attaining a balance sheet size of Rs 150,000 crore, the plan envisages an advance target of Rs 100,000 crore with deposit base rising to Rs 125,000 crore.         
	The plan called Version 2.0 will be implemented till March 31, 2015 and see the branch network rising to 750 from 150 and the headcount growing to 12,000 from around 3,034.         
	For the fiscal ended March 31, 2010, the banks advances were at Rs 12,193 crore and deposits stood at Rs 26,979 crore. Thus, the bank expects its advances and deposits to jump eight-fold and five-fold, respectively.         
	According to managing director and CEO Rana Kapoor, the bank will follow an effective execution-driven strategy to achieve the five-year target.         
	This will be based on various objectives that include liabilities (deposits) mobilisation, diversified and sustainable revenue generation, risk management, cost control and superior customer service.         
	Version 2.0 is clearly the most stimulating phase for the bank and we are prepared to achieve greater heights, he said.         
	He expects the bank to be successful in its efforts with regard to both advances and liabilities.         
	On the advances front, corporate and institutional banking will continue to be a key business. Commercial business and integrated branch banking, which includes emerging corporates, SMEs and retail customers, are expected to be the growth driver over the next five years.         
	Kapoor said the bank would continue to focus on food and agriculture, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, infrastructure and engineering.

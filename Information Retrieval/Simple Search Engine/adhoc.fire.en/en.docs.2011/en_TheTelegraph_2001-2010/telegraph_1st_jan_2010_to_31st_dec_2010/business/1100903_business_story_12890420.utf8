          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC) plans to increase its refining capacity to 81 million tonnes by 2012, the companys director (refineries) B.N. Bankapur said today.        
	With the economy projected to grow at a rapid pace over the next two decades, demand for oil and gas is expected to increase at an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent in the next two decades, Bankapur said while addressing the companys employees.        
	IOC will expand its Haldia refinery in Bengal by 1.5 million tonnes to 7.5 million tonnes and the Panipat unit in Haryana by 3 million tonnes to 15 million tonnes this year. The companys total refining capacity will, thus, increase to 54.2 million tonnes per annum.        
	The capacity will rise to 80.7 million tonnes by 2012 with the commissioning of the 15-million-tonne Paradip refinery in Orissa.        
	Bankapur said the projects to improve the quality of petrol and diesel at all its refineries were complete, and the units were producing Euro-IV grade fuel. IOC undertook the projects at its Digboi, Haldia, Barauni and Gujarat refineries.        
	We are challenged by strict environmental norms for the emission of greenhouse gases, climate change issues, growing demand for better product quality, emerging technologies and economies of scale for sustainable development, he said.        
	With margins under pressure, it was necessary to integrate refining with value-added products such as petrochemicals, Bankapur said.

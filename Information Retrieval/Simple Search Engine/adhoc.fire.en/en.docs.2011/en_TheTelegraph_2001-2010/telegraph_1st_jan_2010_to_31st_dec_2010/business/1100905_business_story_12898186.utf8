          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 4: Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) has come out with a specialty oil that can protect tea leaves from pests.        
	The company introduced HP Tea Spray Oil in Calcutta this week. The product has its roots in the base oil that goes into the making of lubricant oil.        
	R.S. Rao, executive director (direct sales) of HPCL, said the market size of tea spray oil would be 5,000 tonnes a year.        
	We are kicking off in Calcutta because this is the hub for tea gardens in north Bengal and Assam. Going forward, we will launch in south India, Rao said.        
	HPCL plans to export the oil to tea producing countries such as Kenya and Sri Lanka.

	New Delhi, March 13 (PTI): FMCG firm Godrej Consumer Products today said it would buy Nigerias personal care brand Tura from the Tura Group for an undisclosed sum.        
	The company said the acquisition would serve as a platform for it to enter Nigeria and other west African markets.        
	Tura helps us leapfrog in our endeavour to build a pan-African presence for our core categories such as personal wash and hair care, Adi Godrej, chairman of Godrej Consumer Products Limited, said in a statement.        
	The Tura acquisition is the third one by GCPL in the last two years, after Rapidol and Kinky in South Africa.        
	Established in 1986, Tura is one of the market leaders in the personal care segment in Africa. It manufactures and distributes products, including soaps, moisturising lotions and skin-toning creams.        
	Godrej Consumer Products had recently got board approval for raising Rs 3,000 crore to fund its expansion plans.         
	It has been scouting for acquisitions over the last few years and said it could spend up to Rs 1,000 crore on buyouts.

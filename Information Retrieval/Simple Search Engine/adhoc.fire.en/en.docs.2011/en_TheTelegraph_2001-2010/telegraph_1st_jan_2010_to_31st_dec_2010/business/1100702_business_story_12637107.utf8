	Calcutta, July 1: Manjushree Khaitan, the younger daughter of Basant Kumar Birla, is set to play a crucial role in Kesoram Industries.        
	Birla, the nonagenarian chairman of the company, said Khaitan would manage the company after him with active assistance from Kumar Mangalam Birla, BKs grandson. He suggested that Kumar would be the chairman of Kesoram, the flagship of the BK Birla group, while Khaitan would be the vice-chairperson.        
	Birla did not spring any surprises in the succession tale this year even as he said that most of his things, including Kesoram, would go to Kumar whom he considered even better than himself in business.        
	In the same breath, he added that daughters Jayshree and Manjushree would also get their shares.        
	As of now, Manjushree will play an important role in Kesoram, which she was widely believed to be inheriting till BK changed his succession plan in 2007 and decided to pass on the baton to Kumar.        
	In the annual general meeting of the company today, Khaitan sat next to her father on the dais unlike at a corner as she used to do before.        
	She also read out a vision statement for Kesoram, hinting at a possible diversification into new sectors and also an overseas foray.        
	Asked to comment on the role Khaitan was taking up, Birla said: I am telling her to take active interest. The difficulty is as long as I am active, nobody would do so.        
	Since Kesoram, which makes cement and tyres, has its head office in Calcutta, Manjushree is likely to look after the daily operations of the company unless the base is shifted to Mumbai where Kumar stays. Birla ruled out any such relocation plan.        
	Kesoram today approved a Rs 925-crore expansion plan to increase its cement capacity by 2.5 million tonnes and set up associated power plants.

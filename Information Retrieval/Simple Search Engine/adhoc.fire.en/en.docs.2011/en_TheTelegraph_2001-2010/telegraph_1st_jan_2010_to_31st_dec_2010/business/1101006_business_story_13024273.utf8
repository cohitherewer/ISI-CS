                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      CII alternative to Sinha pill 
          SAMBIT SAHA                          New proposal                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 5: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) wants a companys board and its shareholders to decide on the separation of the posts of chairman and managing director, opposing the recommendation of a mandatory split made by the parliamentary standing committee on the new companies bill.         
	Besides, the industry association is in favour of managers remuneration being decided by shareholders rather than have a ceiling, which has been recommended by the panel.         
	According to the CII, the government should let the management and shareholders decide on such key issues and not make them mandatory through legislation.        
	The standing committee, under former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, has suggested that an individual cannot be chairman and managing director/chief executive officer simultaneously. It has proposed that companies be given a year to separate the posts.        
	Moreover, the committee has argued for a ceiling within which the remuneration should be decided by the remuneration committee of the board or shareholders.        
	The CII said the government might prescribe a ceiling, but that need not be made sacrosanct. If remuneration exceeds ceiling, companies can obtain the approval of shareholders through special resolutions.        
	Another area of contention is fixing responsibility for wrongdoings. Following the Satyam scam, the government has included the managing director, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, company secretary plus whole-time directors in the definition of key managerial personnel, making it easy for regulatory authorities to fix responsibility.         
	However, the CII wants executive directors to be made liable only for specific areas  for instance a finance director should be pulled up only for financial issues.         
	In its report, the committee has supported the ministry of corporate affairs proposal that the appointment of managing directors and whole-time directors should be unanimous.         
	However, the CII believes such decisions should be taken only on the basis of a majority ruling, with the existing safeguard that interested directors will neither participate nor vote on such matters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Promise of relief
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Promise of relief
        The discussion paper on the direct tax code puts to rest many apprehensions, say Kaushik Mukerjee amp; Sushmita Basu                                            
	The discussion paper on the revised direct tax code (DTC) is finally out.         
	Several of the proposals in the original draft which were considered unfriendly by the public in general and by the retired, house owners and salaried employees, in particular, have been watered down.         
	 Retired persons  restoration of the EEE model: The DTC had proposed to usher in the exempt- exempt-tax (EET) regime. Contribution (up to a specified limit) to retirement funds was deductible from income (exempt) and accruals during the tenure of the scheme was also tax-free (exempt). However withdrawals were taxable.         
	This meant that retirees would have to pay huge tax on the receipt of provident and superannuation funds in the year of retirement and subsequently left with a lesser capital base after retirement.         
	The discussion paper proposes to restore the EEE method of taxation for provident funds (public, recognised and government), approved pension schemes, pure life insurance products and annuity schemes.         
	Further, the current EEE benefit for investment in other schemes (which will not be subject to the EEE regime under DTC) will continue till the implementation of the new tax code.         
	Our country does not have a well-defined social security system. These proposals can be viewed as the governments indirect contribution to the society, especially for senior citizens.        
	 Salaried employees: Under the DTC, gross salary (including perks) was to be considered for taxation. For this, perks such as rent-free accommodation was to be valued at market rates.         
	Also, an employers contribution to the provident fund, superannuation fund etc was to be included in taxable salary income. These would have substantially reduced the take-home pay of the salaried employees.         
	The discussion paper has clarified that perks will be valued according to the prescribed rules. This will be beneficial, especially for rent-free accommodation.         
	Valuation at market rate would have put the burden of heavy tax on the employees without commensurate benefit.         
	Given that the current perk valuation rules have been introduced in December 2009, the existing rules are expected to continue under DTC as well. The exemptions for medical benefit/reimbursement will also be retained with increased monetary limits.        
	The DTC proposed to tax severance payments such as voluntary retirement scheme and gratuity unless the receipts are deposited in retirement benefit accounts.         
	Now, the retirement benefit accounts will not be introduced and the receipt of gratuity, VRS, commuted pension and leave encashment will be tax-exempt up to specified limits. The revised proposal is rational and is a continuation of the current scheme of taxation of severance payments. (See table)        
	 House owners  relaxation in house property income: The DTC proposed to tax house owners on a presumptive basis at a minimum of 6 per cent of the rateable value or cost of acquisition of the property, if the rent receivable was lower.         
	Further, there was no deduction for interest in the case of self-occupied property. The adverse effect of these proposals would have been huge for house owners.         
	Partially vacant or self-occupied properties would have been subject to tax without any income. This would have gone against the principle of taxation of real income.         
	The discussion paper has corrected this; vacant properties not let out and/or self-occupied would not be subject to tax.         
	Additionally, in the case of one self-occupied property, interest on loan up to Rs 1,50,000 would be deductible, reducing the tax burden on other income. This would also help property buyers in the backdrop of rising interest rates. However, it is not clear whether the deduction on interest would fall within the calibrated overall ceiling of Rs 3,00,000 for deductions.         
	 Retail investors  capital gains and wealth tax: Unlike in the original DTC, the discussion paper provides that gain on listed shares held for more than one year will be partially exempt through statutory deductions.         
	While this will not bring back the distinction on tax rates for short and long-term capital gains, the benefit of the new proposal can be substantial if the statutory deduction is more than 50 per cent of the gain.         
	Moreover, financial assets like shares will not be subject to wealth tax. These measures should benefit long-term investors.         
	However, there is a dampener  securities transaction tax will be retained. The discussion paper has also dropped the capital gains savings scheme closing the scope for complete tax savings.        
	The discussion paper has provided substantial relief for individual taxpayers.         
	There is an apprehension that the final tax rates will be substantially higher than the indicative ones in the original DTC.         
	However, the finance ministers subsequent assurance of lower tax rates should not only clear the clouds of anxiety created by the original draft DTC but also give reasons to cheer.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 26: The government today decided to speed up the process of appointing merchant bankers for divestment in state-run entities.        
	The cabinet committee of economic affairs will now simultaneously consider the approval for a divestment proposal as well as the appointment of market intermediaries.        
	Retail response to recent public sector share offers had not been encouraging. It is expected that bringing in investment bankers at an early stage will help revive the interest of retail investors in state-owned firms that plan to hit the market later this year.        
	The government has targeted revenues of Rs 40,000 crore from selloffs in public sector undertakings in 2010-11, up from about Rs 25,000 crore a year ago.        
	At present, ministries first seek approval for divestment in a particular PSU and then obtain permission to appoint merchant bankers, leading to delays.        
	The new process will help to plan and time public offerings in a manner that they are spread out evenly and avoid bunching as far as possible to ensure better response from investors, including retail, an official statement said.        
	It is also learnt that the government is planning to pay fees to brokers who sell stock in state-run companies to bolster demand for these offerings. Brokers will get 0.35 per cent of the value of the shares they sell to retail investors and 0.15 per cent of the stock marketed to high net worth individuals.        
	In the current financial year, Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam was the first PSU to hit the capital markets. Other companies in the queue include Engineers India, Steel Authority of India and Coal India.

	Mumbai, June 3: Nimesh Kampani-controlled JM Financial Consultants plans to tie up with South African Rand Merchant Bank to offer mergers and acquisitions (M amp;A) advisory services to Indian and African companies.        
	In a communication to the Bombay Stock Exchange, JM Financial said the company had signed a memorandum of understanding to this effect during the South African president Jacob Zumas state visit accompanied by a trade delegation.        
	The two entities will focus on Indian clients seeking to make investments in South Africa and vice-versa.         
	In recent years, several Indian companies have shown interest in Africa, Nimesh Kampani, chief executive of JM Financial, said.         
	On Thursday, the JM Financial counter also saw a bulk deal in its shares. There has been speculation that Mukesh Ambani may choose to invest in the JM Financial group after the non-compete agreement between the two Ambani brothers was dismantled.        
	JM Financial has, however, denied such a move. Morgan Stanley Mauritius was a buyer of the JM Financial stock on Thursday when it purchased around 1.84 crore shares at Rs 37.06 crore.         
	Tiger Global Limited sold around 1.02 shares, while Citigroup Global Markets Mauritius sold roughly 81 lakh shares.

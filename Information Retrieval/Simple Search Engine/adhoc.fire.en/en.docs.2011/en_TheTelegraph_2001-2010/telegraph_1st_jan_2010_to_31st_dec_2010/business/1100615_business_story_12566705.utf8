The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | May inflation fuels interest rate debate
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      May inflation fuels interest rate debate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 14: Inflation has leapt to a 19-month high in May at 10.16 per cent, prompting some advisers to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to call for an intervention by the Reserve Bank of India even as industry mavens pleaded with the banking regulator not to hinder the recovery process.        
	The RBI policymakers are due to meet on July 27 for the quarterly review of the monetary policy.        
	Kaushik Basu, the chief economic adviser to the finance ministry, pushed for decontrolling fuel prices, while Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia backed former RBI governor C. Rangarajans suggestion that rising inflation and not robust industrial output should guide the RBI. Rangarajan is the chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.        
	Last week, Rangarajan had said the RBI ought to look at May inflation data and not the robust industrial growth figures in April before it decided on its policy response next month.        
	According to analysts, high inflation may prompt the RBI to tighten liquidity. My belief is that fuel prices ought to be decontrolled. If it is done, inflation may increase in the short-term, but six months down the line, it may come down because of a lower fiscal deficit, Basu said.        
	Inflation has shot up to 10.16 per cent from 9.59 in April on the back of costlier iron and steel, raw cotton, sugarcane and jute. The government has revised March data to 11.04 per cent from 9.9 per cent estimated earlier.        
	High inflation is always a matter of concern. Something more needs to be done by the RBI. We are in touch with the apex bank, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said.        
	Inflation, which was so far confined to food items, is spreading to manufactured products. Food inflation in May has moderated to 16.49 per cent from 16.87 per cent in the previous month.        
	Basu said the index for food items stood at 296, which was the same six months back.         
	However, manufacturing inflation has risen 6.41 per cent.

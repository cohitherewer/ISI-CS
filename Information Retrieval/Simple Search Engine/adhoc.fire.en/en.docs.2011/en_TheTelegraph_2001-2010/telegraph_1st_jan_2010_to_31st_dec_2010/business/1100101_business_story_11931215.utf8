          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 31: A Rs 68-crore company with profit of less than a crore has mirrored the remarkable turnaround tale of the bourses in 2009.        
	Shares of little known JMD Telefilms, which has a swanky recording studio on Calcuttas Park Street, zoomed 6000 per cent this year  as unthinkable as the sensexs super show in 2009.        
	At the close of 2008, the global financial crisis had decimated Indian stocks. The sensex had reached a stratospheric high of 21000 in January of that year only to be blitzed by the financial crisis to end the year at around 9650 points.        
	Very few then had the guts to bet on the BSE bellwether for 2009. Yet, the sensex roared and how! It jumped a massive 7817.50 points, or 81 per cent, in over 12 months and ended the year at 17464.81, its best ever showing since 1999. In March 2009, the index had even slumped to 8000 levels.        
	The Nifty rose around 75 per cent, while the BSE Small-Cap index has given a return of 127 per cent. Investor wealth, measured by market capitalisation of the BSE, has doubled to over Rs 60,00,000 crore.        
	Analysts attributed the turnaround to the governments swift response to the financial crisis.         
	On the BSE, the JMD Telefilms stock today closed at Rs 121.50, a gain of 5 per cent. At the beginning of this year, it had ended at Rs 17.40.        
	The huge gain in this stock over the past one year may be right, but it could be due to interest by speculators, a broker said.         
	JMDs gain is actually 598 per cent, but the company had split shares in May that reduced their face value to Rs 1 from Rs 10.         
	An investor who had invested prior to the split could have made a gain of nearly 6,000 per cent.        
	Auto, metals and IT gave the highest returns this year, while FMCG and realty were subdued vis--vis the sensex. Telecom stocks took a beating.        
	Reliance Industries underperformed the sensex  it rose 77 per cent compared with the indexs 81 per cent rise.        
	Experts, however, are advising caution for next year.        
	In 2010, the markets will build on the gains of 2009. The acceleration in economic activity will hasten earnings growth. Further, the strong liquidity inflows are unlikely to die down on the back of strong fundamentals, Dinesh Thakkar, chairman and managing director of Angel Broking, said.        
	KRIS director Arun Kejriwal was more cautious. It will be a year when a large number of companies, both public and private, raise money from the markets. Making money will be more difficult than the previous year.         
	Kejriwal estimates the markets to trade in a broad range of 14500-19500. He is concerned that a large number of IPOs could suck liquidity out of the secondary markets.        
	Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president of Karvy Stock Broking, says the markets are now over-valued and there can be a correction soon.         
	Baliga added that 2010 would also see a rise in interest rates.

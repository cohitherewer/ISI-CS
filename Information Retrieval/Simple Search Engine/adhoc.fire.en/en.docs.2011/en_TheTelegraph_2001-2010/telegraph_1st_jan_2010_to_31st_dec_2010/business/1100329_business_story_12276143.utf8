The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Newbies reluctant to tread 2G auction path
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Newbies reluctant to tread 2G auction path
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Call waiting                                  
	New Delhi, March 28: New telecom operators are lobbying hard with the telecom ministry and the regulator to get start-up spectrum without going through the auction process.         
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is expected to submit a report on the auction of second-generation (2G) spectrum to the department of telecom by this week.         
	According to industry insiders, Trai may recommend selling 2G radiowaves, which can bring in additional revenues if sold through an auction rather than bundling it with a mobile licence.         
	At present, a telecom licence, which costs Rs 1,650 crore, is bundled with 4.4 mega hertz (MHz) of GSM spectrum, which is the minimum amount required to launch services.         
	Following this, operators are awarded an additional 1.8 units, subject to them meeting a certain subscriber target.         
	New entrants in the countrys fast growing mobile services sector, which have rolled out services in a few circles and are waiting for pan-India expansion, contend that according to the licence conditions, they are entitled to 4.4-6.2Mhz of radiowaves.         
	Payment for start-up spectrum was part of the licence cost and the government should ensure that firms dont have to shell out extra for assets they have already paid for, said a senior executive from one of the new firms.         
	Videocon-promoted Datacom, Shyam Telelink, Uninor, Etisalat DB, B.K. Modis Spice Communications and S Tel are the new operators.

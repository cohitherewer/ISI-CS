	Calcutta, March 9: Newby Teas Ltd  the UK-based premium tea company  which entered the estimated Rs 7,500-crore Indian branded tea market in February, plans to open a boutique soon.        
	We will take a call on this depending on the market feedback during the first few months. We will chalk out a detailed road map once we feel the market is ready for such tea boutiques, Newby India chief operating officer Aniruddha Sen said. The company aims to capture at least 15 per cent of the super premium branded tea market in India by March 2011, he said.        
	According to Sen, Newby intends to have a presence in eight major cities during the first year and will expand to 15 cities and towns over the next three years.         
	Initially, we have introduced 50 varieties in India priced between Rs 800 and Rs 25,000 a kg, he said.        
	Globally, Newby sells over 200 varieties. In India, the company will gradually introduce 150 varieties in the next three years.         
	Newby Teas entered the domestic market with a focus on tapping the hospitality, restaurant and catering segments, followed by a foray into retail.        
	There will be a gradual penetration from metros and semi metros to tier II cities.        
	At present, Newby Teas is available in hotels in Calcutta and Delhi, including Oberoi, Hyatt, InterContinental and Claridges.        
	At Newby, we take an additional effort right from the first stage of procurement to the final stages of processing to retain the originality of teas, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Purnendu readies list for HPL top job 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Purnendu readies list for HPL top job 
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Chatterjee: Seeking solution                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 27: The Chatterjee Group has taken charge of the selection process to find a new managing director for Haldia Petrochemicals, with the incumbent Swapan Bhowmik set to retire in three months.        
	Purnendu Chatterjee, chairman of TCG, is holding interviews on his own with probable candidates to head Bengals showcase industrial venture. The post of managing director had been a bone of contention between promoters TCG and the Bengal government for years.        
	In the past, Chatterjee had been critical of Bhowmiks management style even though it was he who was instrumental in getting Bhowmik the top job about eight years ago.         
	The company has appointed head hunter firm Stuart Little to prepare the initial list of candidates. The firm is reporting to Chatterjee, who is interviewing the candidates, said a person in HPL having direct knowledge of the process.        
	The candidates chosen by Purnendu will have to appear for another round of interview before a search panel.        
	The HPL board has constituted the search panel which includes chairman Tarun Das, Bengal government nominee and state industry secretary Dipankar Mukhopadhyay, independent member Jamshyd Godrej and vice-chairman Purnendu Chatterjee himself.        
	But the committee will select the candidate only from the list that Chatterjee is going to provide.         
	So far the vice-chairman of HPL has come up with two recommendations. Both the candidates are over 60. But he has informed the board that he was talking to more people.        
	HPL directors are keen to get someone in their early fifties to the post.         
	Haldia is a complex business and there should be someone who can stay there for a few years to ensure continuity, said a member of the board on conditions of anonymity.        
	However, if Purnendu manages to convince the state government to buy it out  both parties are in talks  he would have full freedom to have his man on the top post.        
	Conflict years        
	TCG and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation had agreed that the post of the managing director would be chosen by private partner Chatterjee as he wanted to run the management.         
	Purnendu had brought in Richard Saldhana as the managing director and thereafter promoted Bhowmik, who was president polymer, to the post of chief executive officer.        
	Bhowmik became managing director in 2005  a tumultuous year for the company as TCG took the WBIDC to court over ownership issues.         
	After the Company Law Board and Calcutta High Court, the matter is now before the Supreme Court, which has completed the hearing and has reserved the judgment.        
	In 2005, the state government offered to hand over the reins of the company to TCG by selling its stake. Purnendu could not arrange funds in time, and the state scrapped the deal. Chatterjee went to the CLB.        
	By 2007, when Bhowmiks two-year stint came to an end, the relationship between Chatterjee and the managing director had soured.        
	He resisted the reappointment but the state government, which was in control of the affairs of the company and the board, got Bhowmik another three-year term.        
	Earlier this year, Bhowmik, 65, got another extension for a year but it was clearly mentioned that there would not be any further extensions and a new managing director would have to be found.        
	The onus is now on the chairman of TCG to place candidates before the search committee so that the new person gets to know HPL before Bhowmik leaves.

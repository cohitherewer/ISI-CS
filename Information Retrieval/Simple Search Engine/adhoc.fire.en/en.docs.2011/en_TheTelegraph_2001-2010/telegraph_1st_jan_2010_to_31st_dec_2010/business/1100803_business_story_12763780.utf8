          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tripathi: Reaping gains                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: Gas transporter GAIL (India) Ltd has registered a 35 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 886.8 crore during the first quarter of this fiscal despite an increase in subsidy burden.        
	The rise in revenue is mainly because of a higher volume of natural gas transmission, increased production of LPG and liquid hydrocarbons and a hike in the price of APM gas and polymers, chairman and managing director B.C. Tripathy said.        
	The kerosene and domestic LPG subsidy burden of the company stood at Rs 445 crore against Rs 75 crore during the year-ago quarter. Total income rose to Rs 7,163.5 crore from Rs 6,119 crore a year ago.        
	The company had posted a net profit of Rs 655.8 crore in the April-June quarter last year. Tripathi said during the quarter there was a 20 per cent year-on-year growth in gas transmission. LPG and gas trading (physical) volumes were up 6 per cent, while liquid hydrocarbon volumes grew 7 per cent.        
	NMDC profit        
	State-run NMDC has posted a 94.3 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 1,504.04 crore for the quarter ended June against Rs 773.75 crore a year ago because of improved sales.

          JAYATI GHOSE                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: The 1999 telecom policy  cited as a bailout of operators by the then NDA government  was instrumental for the explosion of mobile phone use across the country.         
	Companies, which benefited from the shift, maintained that it provided a huge growth momentum. The reduced fees enabled operators to offer connections at a lower cost.        
	In 1999, the telecom ministry moved from a fixed licence fee model  when operators had to pay an annual fee of over Rs 2,000 crore  to a revenue sharing arrangement  when fees ranged between Rs 5 crore and Rs 10 crore.         
	After the changes, the number of subscribers grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 85 per cent to cross 50 million in March 2005 from 1.24 million in March 1999.         
	The move was definitely a favour to commercial interests who had overbid but it helped the telecom market to grow and thus probably helped India in a major way, said telecom analyst Sudipto Bose.         
	At the time the National Telecom Policy 1994 was announced, the countrys teledensity was 0.8 per hundred persons (all fixed lines). By early 2005, the density had increased eleven-fold to 9 per hundred persons.        
	Call tariffs fell to less than Rs 4 per minute in 2005 from Rs 16 per minute for both incoming and outgoing calls in 1999.        
	At present, there are over 700 million fixed line and mobile subscribers with call tariffs as low as 50 paise per minute and the highest average growth rate anywhere in the world of 15 million subscribers per month, said T.V. Ramachandran, resident director of Vodafone.         
	In November 1994, mobile licences were awarded to two operators in each of the four metros. The fees were fixed for the first three years, followed by a variable annual sum levied on a per subscriber basis from the fourth year.         
	For the first year, the operators paid Rs 3 crore; the fee was Rs 6 crore in the second year and went up to Rs 12 crore in the third. From the fourth year, operators were asked to pay Rs 5,000 per subscriber.        
	The auction for the remaining 20 circles in 1995 fetched pan-India rates as high as Rs 20,000 crore to be paid over a period of 10-15 years.        
	Operators, who were making Rs 12 crore a year on an average, found it hard to shell out the money and were ducking deadlines.         
	While these fees were supposed to be paid over the period of licence validity it was still unviable as high tariffs at around Rs 16 per minute for both incoming and outgoing calls, ensured there were not many takers for the service, Ramachandran said.        
	Negative impacts        
	The consequences of the huge licence fee bids were manifested in limited rollouts, high tariffs, not enough subscribers, default in rollout obligations and inability to meet licence fee norms.         
	By the end of 1998, most licensees were on the brink of bankruptcy, and it seemed as if the countrys telecom dream would soon turn into a nightmare.        
	While the government was imposing a penalty on operators for the non-payment of fees, the operators in turn had filed cases against the government for not fulfilling its obligations of granting spectrum, Ramachandran said.        
	Under these circumstances, the telecom ministry came out with the National Telecom Policy 1999, which allowed operators to switch to a revenue sharing arrangement.         
	Operators paid 30 per cent of the total bid value as upfront migration fees (Rs 6,000 crore for mobile licences and over Rs 7,000 crore for fixed line) and moved to paying between 8 per cent and 12 per cent of adjusted gross revenue as annual fees.        
	While NTP 1999 brought down tariffs to Rs 4 per minute, it was in 2003 when only the calling party pays system was introduced that the subscriber affordability increased, leading to higher growth, Ramachandran said.

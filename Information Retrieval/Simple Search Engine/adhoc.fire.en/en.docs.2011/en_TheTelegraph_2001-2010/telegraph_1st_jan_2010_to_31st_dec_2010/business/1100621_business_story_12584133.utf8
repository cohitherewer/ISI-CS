                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Loan concern
                                If I take a loan below Rs 19,000 from my relatives or friends in cash, shall I have to maintain any document? If yes, please let me know what document is accepted? Can I take a loan from a person who does not hold a PAN card?          Md. Shafiqul Haq, Barasat
                    Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act states that no person can receive loan or deposit of Rs 20,000 and more in cash in aggregate in a year. The aggregate loan outstanding on the day of borrowing shall be taken into account for finding the limit. Similarly, you cannot repay any loan or deposit in cash above Rs 20,000. The penalty is 100 per cent of the loan taken or repaid. Therefore, one should always transact through account payee cheque or draft if the amount involved exceeds Rs 20,000. But for transactions less than Rs 20,000, you dont need to be extra careful. If you have taken a loan, just keep the loan agreement handy.                                  Capital loss      Can I set off long-term capital loss on shares or mutual funds against long-term profits on other assets such as property or gold? Can I carry forward the loss in the next financial year?         Sushil Asthana, Salt Lake
                      Under Section 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, long-term capital gain is tax-exempt in case shares are traded through stock exchanges and on which the security transaction tax is paid. This benefit is also available in case of equity-linked mutual funds that invest at least 65 per cent of the fund corpus in shares of domestic companies. Therefore, the long-term loss on sale of shares through stock exchange cannot be carried forward or adjusted with long-term capital gains from any other asset. It has to be set off against long-term capital gains from sale of shares or mutual funds only. However, long-term capital loss on shares of a private limited company sold offmarket or shares listed in foreign stock exchange can be set off against the long-term gains of other assets. Capital losses remaining after set off for a particular year can be carried forward for subsequent eight years. But it can be carried forward only if the income tax return for the year in which it arose first was submitted by due date.

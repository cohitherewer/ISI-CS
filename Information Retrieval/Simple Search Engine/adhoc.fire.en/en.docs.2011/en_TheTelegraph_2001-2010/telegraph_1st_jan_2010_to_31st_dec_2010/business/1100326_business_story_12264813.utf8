          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 25: Indias Bharti Airtel and South Africas MTN  two companies close to tying the merger knot over the last two years  have now turned foes in the battle for market share in Africa with the impending accquistion of the African assets of Zain Telecom by Bharti.         
	Johannesburg-based MTN had twice spurned Bhartis overtures for a merger that would have created one of the five largest phone companies in the world.         
	Bharti in a statement said the due diligence (of Zain) has been completed ... definitive agreements are expected to be signed soon...and it has already secured the entire financing requirement of $8.3 billion for this transaction.        
	Zain and Bharti will complete definitive agreements and sign a deal soon, the Kuwait-based company today said. Upon signing, the parties will move towards getting the required approvals, the statement added.        
	Officials at the department of telecom said Bharti would have to file for regulatory approval once a deal was signed.        
	Zain and MTN go head-to-head in five countries, including Nigeria, the largest African country by subscribers and population. MTN holds the No. 1 position, followed by Zain.         
	Theyve decided to venture into the forest on their own, Phuthuma Nhleko, chief executive officer of MTN, was quoted by agencies. They would have been in a better position if we were holding their hand.        
	Analysts feel Bharti has limited overseas experience compared with MTN. It started operating in Sri Lanka in January 2009. Two months ago, it paid $300 million for Warid Telecom, a company based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, having three million subscribers. MTN operates in 21 countries and more than 80 per cent of its earnings are from the overseas markets.        
	However, some industry experts say the Zain buyout is a simple deal, compared with the complex share-and-cash swap proposal with MTN. It would give Bharti freedom to implement its low tariff-high usage business model.

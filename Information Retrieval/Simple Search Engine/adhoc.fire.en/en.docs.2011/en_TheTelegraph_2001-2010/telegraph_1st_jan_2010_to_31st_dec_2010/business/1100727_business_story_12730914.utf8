The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Royalty shock for Maruti stock
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Royalty shock for Maruti stock
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 26: Shares of Maruti Suzuki Ltd plunged 12 per cent on the stock exchanges today as investors dumped the stock amid concerns over higher royalty payments to its Japanese parent during the first quarter ended June 30.        
	On the BSE, the Maruti Suzuki scrip slumped 12.31 per cent, or Rs 167.20, to close at Rs 1,191.05.        
	Last week, the company had reported a 20 per cent drop in net profits in the first quarter ended June 30, which was blamed on a higher royalty payment and sharp rise in raw material costs.        
	Maruti Suzuki had reported a net profit of Rs 465.36 crore compared with Rs 583.54 crore in the same period last year. The higher royalty expense, put at around Rs 190 crore during the quarter, also led to a raft of downgrades from brokerages, exacerbating the negative sentiment.        
	Maruti Suzuki provided a royalty of 5.9 per cent of its net sales compared with 3.6 per cent in the same period last year. The company said this expenditure included arrears of the previous fiscal amounting to 0.8 per cent. Though the company did not mention the currency in which the royalty will be paid, it is believed that this will be a yen-denominated transaction.        
	Three brokerages  Macquarie, PINC Research and Emkay  downgraded the stock. Calling it a royalty shocker, Vineet Hetamasaria and Nikhil Deshpande, auto analysts at PINC Research, said it was the unexpected increase in the royalty payment that led to a 20 per cent decline in its first quarter profits.        
	While downgrading the stock to a hold, the analysts said they had reduced margin estimates of the company by 200 basis points to reflect the change in policy on royalty payments. As a result, the earnings estimate for 2010-11 and 2011-12 were reduced by around 20 per cent each.

	New Delhi, March 21: Toyota Kirloskar Motors will launch its compact car Etios in December.        
	According to the company, the car will help to increase its market share in India to 10 per cent from 3 per cent.        
	The Etios is designed exclusively for Indian roads and will be available in both the hatchback and sedan variants, with 1.2-litre and 1.5-litre petrol engines in both the segments.         
	The hatchback is expected to be priced between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7 lakh, sources said. The sedan will sport a price tag in the range of Rs 6.75-8.5 lakh.         
	Toyota officials said the company might look to export the car over the next two years.        
	The car will be launched in December. The company has a clear objective of serving the domestic market first, but in a year or two we may start exporting as well. However, the export markets are not yet decided, Sandip Singh, deputy managing director (marketing) of Toyota Kirloskar Motors, told The Telegraph.        
	The hatchback version of the Etios will compete with Marutis Swift, Hyundai i20 and Volkswagens Polo, while the sedan will compete with Marutis DZire and the Tata Manza, said Singh.        
	The Etios will be produced at the companys new facility at Bidadi in Karnataka.         
	While the average local content in Toyota vehicles is 50 per cent, for Etios it will be between 75 per cent and 80 per cent.        
	The initial capacity will be 70,000 units annually. The company has invested around Rs 3,200 crore for setting up this facility near its existing plant at Bidadi. The company has also built a completely new platform for the car, Singh said.

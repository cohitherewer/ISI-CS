The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil duo selloff by fiscal end
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Oil duo selloff by fiscal end
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sundareshan: Set plans rolling                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: The government is likely to divest a 10 per cent stake in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd and 5 per cent in ONGC Ltd in the last quarter of 2010-11.         
	The oil ministry has taken an in-principle decision to sell shares of these two companies. We have to go to the cabinet now, petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan told reporters.        
	In addition, IOC will make a follow-on offer of 10 per cent of its expanded capital. The government holds 78.92 per cent in IOC and 74.14 per cent in ONGC.        
	While IOC shares ended the day at Rs 425.10, up 0.09 per cent, ONGC closed at Rs 1,350.10, up 0.90 per cent.         
	A 10 per cent share sale in IOC will fetch the government Rs 10,334 crore at the current market price, while a 5 per cent stake sale in ONGC will bring in Rs 14,339 crore, analysts said.        
	Divestment secretary Sumit Bose had last month written to the oil ministry to initiate the exercise in both the PSUs so that the proceeds could flow in this fiscal.        
	Energy experts said the government should allow the complete deregulation of diesel and put out the subsidy sharing formula between upstream PSUs such as ONGC, GAIL (India) Ltd and their downstream counterparts such as IOC, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum by December for investors to take a call on these firms.         
	The proposed share sales in IOC and ONGC are part of the governments ambitious divestment programme that seeks to mop up as much as Rs 40,000 crore this fiscal.        
	So far, share sales in Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited and Engineers India have fetched Rs 1,000 crore each.        
	Coal India said last month that its initial public offering, which is expected to raise more than $3 billion and can become Indias biggest ever share sale, was due to start on October 18.        
	ADB keen to quit Petronet        
	The Asian Development Bank has written to the promoters of Petronet LNG expressing its intention to quit the gas trading and distributing company.         
	They (ADB) have made an offer in the past. They have said again. Their policy is to exit after a company is functioning, Sundareshan, who is also the chairman of Petronet, said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal (right) with CIL chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 13: Coal India Ltd (CIL), which is set to hit the capital markets with Indias largest-ever initial public offering (IPO), has created a $1.2-billion cash chest to fund asset buyouts overseas this year.        
	The company will either acquire coal blocks overseas or invest in existing coal mining companies. If it picks the second option, Coal India will look to enter into an offtake arrangement.        
	Coal India  the worlds largest coal producer with a raw coal production of 431.26 million tonnes  is initially scouting for assets in countries such as Australia, Indonesia, South Africa and the US. It also has the largest coal reserves in the world.        
	Coal India chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya told reporters here today that the company would focus on high quality coal when it looks for investment opportunities overseas. CIL has two blocks in Mozambique in Africa.        
	Several domestic power companies have been acquiring coal assets overseas. For instance, Tata Power Company announced in 2007 that it had entered into a $1.1-billion deal to buy 30 per cent stakes in two Indonesian coal companies, and in a related coal trading company, promoted by PT Bumi Resources Tbk.        
	The public offer through which Coal India is offering 63.16 crore shares will open for subscription on October 18 and close two days later.         
	Retail and non-institutional bidders, including employees, have one more day (till October 21) to subscribe to the issue. While the price band has been fixed between Rs 225 and Rs 245 per share, retail investors will enjoy a discount of 5 per cent to the offer price.        
	Many analysts are recommending that investors subscribe to the issue considering that it has been priced reasonably well and given the strong fundamentals of Coal India.         
	Indias coal shortage will only widen, possibly by 2.5 times in 2-3 years and Coal India is a direct play on this theme. Lower earnings volatility, large undeveloped resource base and potential to improve realisations warrant a premium to global peers. The only concern relates to mine delays and environment degradation. Long-term investors can subscribe to this issue, Amar Ambani, head of research, India Private Clients, IIFL said.        
	CIL will also focus on enhancing the component of washed coal that yields more margins. Washed coal (coal with low ash content) now accounts for only 3 per cent of production and is expected to surge to 40 per cent by 2017.        
	Meanwhile, Adani Group has started talks with CIL to take on board the state-owned company as a partner for developing the Australian mines that it recently bought in a Rs 12,600-crore deal, a market source told PTI.

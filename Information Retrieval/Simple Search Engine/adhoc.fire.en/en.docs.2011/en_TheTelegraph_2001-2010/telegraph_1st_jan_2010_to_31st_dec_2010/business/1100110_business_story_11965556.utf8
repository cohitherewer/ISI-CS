          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Quick refill                                   
	New Delhi, Jan. 9: The government today cleared a proposal of US-based PepsiCo Holdings to inject $200 million into its Indian arm within three years.        
	A few months back the company had announced plans to spend the sum on expanding manufacturing capacity, market infrastructure, supply chain and R amp;D.        
	The investment, approved by the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) at its meeting here, would take PepsiCos total investment in the country to $655 million from $455 million. Of the planned $200-million investment, $170 million will be from PepsiCo, while the remaining will come from its bottling partners.        
	Though the approval is for investing the money within three years, Pepsi has plans to spend it within a year.        
	This is by far the largest investment made by the company in a single year since its entry into India, said Sanjeev Chadha, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo India.        
	The $200 million is part of PepsiCos $500-million investment to be spread over three years. Global head Indra Nooyi had announced the plans during her visit to the country last year.        
	PepsiCo, which held its high-profile global board meeting in India in November, had announced that it would triple its business in the country every five years.         
	PepsiCo plans to set up four plants over a period of three years, of which three units will be for the beverages business and one for snacks.        
	It costs $30 million to set up a beverages plant and around $50-60 million for a food unit. The company is identifying locations for these units.         
	In another CCEA decision, the government today allowed Russias Gazprom to carry out exploration work over 18 months to make up for delays in work already allotted.        
	Gazprom was an operator under the Nelp-1 round of auction of oil and gas blocks on the Northeast coast, but its work had run into delays.

          SAMBIT SAHA                          REJIG TIME                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 17: Videocon has changed the contour of its proposed Rs 15,000-crore steel and power project in Bengal after three years of futile wait for land and coal mine.        
	The company has decided to delink the power plant from its steel facility and shift it from Jamuria near Asansol to Maithon on the Bengal-Jharkhand border.        
	Videocon  owned and managed by the Dhoot family  now wants to develop an independent power plant based mostly on imported coal.         
	It has signed an agreement with West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Co Ltd (WBSEDCL) to sell the power.         
	The company plans to tap its mine in Indonesia to fire the plant besides applying for a linkage from Coal India Ltd.        
	The power plant will require around 1,200 acres, which the company wants to acquire on its own. It has zeroed in on a relatively arid plot. The facility will also have an easy access to water with the Maithon dam and reservoir nearby.        
	The company hopes the new arrangement will expedite the steel and power project for which it had signed an agreement with the Bengal government in October 2007.         
	Since then, Videocon had not been able to proceed with its plan.         
	Coal India had objected to the site chosen for the 3-million-tonne steel facility and the 1,200 mega watt power plant, arguing that there was coal beneath the surface.         
	Bhushan Steel, Shyam Steel and Vedanta have also faced the same problem.        
	We feel that by separating the steel and the power projects, the requirement of land will go down in Jamuria. Consequently, we can realign the area for steel plant keeping in mind Coal Indias feedback, Gautam Sengupta, eastern head of Videocon, said.        
	The company had wanted 3,200 acres initially and 4,200 acres in the second phase. After delinking the power plant, 2,000 acres will be sufficient for the first phase.        
	In Jamuria, the company has received the state governments approval to buy and hold ceiling surplus land.        
	Imported coal        
	Bengal had promised Nachan coal block to Videocon once its allocated by the Centre.         
	However, the Centre has not given any block to Bengal since December 2007.        
	By seeking coal linkage directly from CIL and using imported coal for the power plant, Videocon may be able to reduce the level of risk associated with the more lucrative part of the business.        
	It has proposed to sell the entire power to the state grid, which, in turn, will supply to the steel plant when it comes up.        
	Sengupta said Videocon was working on a power purchase agreement with the state government that was expected to be completed within the next two months. A clarity on the price and the quantity of power to be sold will emerge after that.        
	Power plants usually prefer to have two components  low rate fixed tariff with state grid and merchant sale (trading) on spot basis at a higher rate.        
	The company is not dropping its demand for the Nachan block. It may be difficult to survive only on imported coal. We need a captive coal block for long-term survival of the steel and the power plants. What we have done is to salvage Videocons investment proposal in Bengal for the time being, Sengupta said.

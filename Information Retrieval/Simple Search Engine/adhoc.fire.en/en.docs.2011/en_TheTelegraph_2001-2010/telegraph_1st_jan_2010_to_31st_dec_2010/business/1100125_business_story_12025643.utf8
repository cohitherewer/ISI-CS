        Ulips are still not your best bet, either for insurance or for investment, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	With income taxpayers rushing for last minute tax-saving investments, life insurers have started hawking their unit-linked plans (Ulips) aggressively. The first six months saw a significant decline in Ulip sales after the mayhem in the stock markets between September 2008 and March 2009.        
	The tide turned since October last year after the insurance regulator capped Ulip charges and the stock markets returned firmly to the growth trajectory.         
	Companies have been asked to reduce the charges on Ulips launched after October 2009 to comply with the new norms introduced by the insurance regulator. From December, insurers will also have to modify the existing Ulips, launched before October, in compliance with the changed guidelines.        
	This time, life insurers are pitching on two aspects  guaranteed returns and a lower cost structure in Ulips to attract investors.        
	A lower cost structure no doubt improves the investment return for policyholders. Insurers are also offering guaranteed returns to sweeten the offer.         
	More and more investors are now biting the bait. But even after the facelift, Ulips are not smart options either for insurance or for investment. Lets see why.         
	Reduced cover        
	First, well consider the insurance aspect. Ulips are basically life insurance policies which make them eligible for income tax benefit.         
	After the introduction of the new cost structure, insurers have increased the minimum annual premium.         
	SBI Life has increased the minimum annual premium from Rs 6,000 to Rs 12,000, Star Union Daiichi Life Insurance, from Rs 12,000 to Rs 18,000, and Aegon Religare Life Insurance from Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000. The list goes on.         
	Apart from increasing the minimum annual premium, insurers have also capped the policy term in their guaranteed Ulips to 10 years and the maximum sum assured is estimated at five times of the annual premium.         
	In other words, you shall have to pay a minimum annual premium of Rs 20,000 for a Rs 1-lakh policy if you want guaranteed return on a unit-linked plan!         
	However, the insurance cover is not available for more than 10 years. This is because a large part of the premium (70 per cent and more) is invested in debt instruments to ensure a guaranteed return, whether it is the highest net asset value (NAV) or a specified percentage of premium. Since enough debt papers (corporate bond etc) are not available for more than 10 years, the maximum policy term in guaranteed Ulips is kept at 10 years.        
	The new regulations on Ulip charges combined with guaranteed offers not only reduce the insurance cover but also the period for which it would be available. Now, let us turn to the investment aspect.        
	Guarantee riddle        
	Guaranteed return is possible if the minimum investment in equity is 50 per cent and the guaranteed NAV is the highest of the NAV during the entire term of the plan. But no plan can ensure that.         
	Under the guaranteed plans, the minimum investment in equity will be nil and the maximum will be 100 per cent.         
	In other words, the mix of debt and equity in the investment portfolio will be at the discretion of the fund manager, who under the obligation of giving the announced guaranteed return will always try to keep the equity exposure as low as possible.        
	The growth in NAV or fund value (NAV multiplied by the number of units in the fund) wont be much.        
	The investment strategy of these guaranteed plans is basically modelled after the fixed maturity plans of mutual funds.         
	In a fixed maturity plan of a mutual fund, the expense ratio (including the service tax on fund management charge) is 1.25 per cent or less. The expense ratio of a debt-oriented balanced mutual fund is 1.5 per cent.         
	Then, why should one pay a 3 per cent cost in a guaranteed 10-year Ulip that works on the same investment logic? Just for the word guarantee? After the implementation of the new limits on costs, Ulips are still inferior to mutual funds in giving returns.         
	Down the order        
	To illustrate the point, let us take the Shield Plus single premium unit-linked plan recently launched by Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company.         
	The benefit illustration of Shield Plus shows that a 39-year-old person paying a single premium of Rs 50,000 will get a maximum life cover of Rs 2.5 lakh for a policy term of 10 years.         
	On survival of the term, the policyholder will get a maturity benefit of Rs 86,272 assuming that the net asset value of the plan has grown at 10 per cent per annum.         
	At a 10 per cent compounded annual rate of return, Rs 50,000 grows to Rs 1,29,687 in 10 years. This depicts how much money you may lose by investing in a Ulip.         
	In an equity mutual fund with a maximum expense ratio of 2.5 per cent, an investment of Rs 50,000 will amount to Rs 1,03,052, which is still Rs 16,780 more than what you get from Ulips.         
	Now, a term assurance plan of Rs 5 lakh for 10 years will cost a 39-year-old policyholder Rs 16,345 one-time.         
	Thus, a Ulip not only provides lower life cover, it is also inferior when considered as an investment.

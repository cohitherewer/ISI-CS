The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Penalty punch for pesky calls
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Penalty punch for pesky calls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Big bother                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 29: The telecom watchdog plans to impose a hefty fine on telemarketing firms and mobile operators who make unsolicited calls and send text messages to customers. If Trai receives six complaints against a telemarketing firm, the regulator proposes to impose a penalty of up to Rs 2 lakh before blocking the number.        
	Service providers that violate do not call instructions four times face a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh. Under the new Trai guidelines, both telemarketing firms as well as service providers have to ensure that subscribers on the do-not-call list are not harassed by telemarketers. The regulator is expected to announce the measures tomorrow. Trai also plans to introduce a new mechanism to bar these pesky calls from January.        
	Trais plans were first unveiled in a consultation paper, titled Review of Telecom Unsolicited Commercial Communications Regulations, in May. Unsolicited commercial communications are one of the growing concerns of telecom consumers worldwide.        
	In the new system called Customer Call Preference Registration, a subscriber registers for not getting such calls; if a tele-marketer still tries to call the number, the call will be barred automatically.         
	A new number beginning with 700 will be given to tele-marketers so that commercial calls can be clearly identified. Also, commercial calls will be categorised  subscribers can either choose not to get any call or select certain areas where they would like the calls to come from. There would also be an option of information via messages only.        
	As tele-marketers buy bulk text messages from mobile operators, Trai has decided that nobody can send more than 100 messages a day.         
	The government had earlier formed a do not call registry in 2007. However, consumers continued to complain about unsolicited calls.        
	R-Com fine        
	The Supreme Court today upheld the imposition of a penalty by BSNL on R-Com for routing international calls through the state-run firms network as local connections by tampering with calling line identification numbers.        
	The court said under BSNLs agreement with R-Com, the former had the right to levy a penalty on all calls routed by R-Com through its network, including local calls, based on the highest rate slab.        
	By masking international call as local, R-Com has tried to destroy the principles of level-playing field and BSNL has the right to recover its losses, the court said.

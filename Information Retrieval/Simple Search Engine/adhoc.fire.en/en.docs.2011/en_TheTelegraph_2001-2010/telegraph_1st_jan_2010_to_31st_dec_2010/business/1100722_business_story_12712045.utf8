	New Delhi, July 21: A special package for Maoist-affected areas and measures to tackle inflation are likely to hold centre-stage at a meeting of the National Development Council on Saturday.        
	The NDC will approve the governments mid-term appraisal of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12), which has lowered the average growth target to 8.1 per cent from 9 per cent because of the global financial crisis.        
	The Planning Commission is working on a financial package of about Rs 14,000 crore for the 35 Maoist-hit districts in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Bengal.        
	Under the proposed plan, about Rs 5,700 crore will be spent on roads, Rs 1,600 crore on education, Rs 850 crore on health, Rs 835 crore on electrification and Rs 890 crore on irrigation.        
	Sources said the Planning Commissions report on the Maoists would focus on the need for development in areas affected by Left-wing extremism.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had earlier said in dealing with the challenge of Naxalism, we will pursue a policy that genuinely seeks to address the developmental concerns at the grassroots, while firmly enforcing the writ of the state.        
	The NDC will also discuss the broad contours of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, beginning 2012-13, which aims to push the average annual economic growth to 10 per cent.        
	Functioning as the highest decision-making forum on development issues, the NDC has as its members the Prime Minister, chief ministers, lieutenant governors and members of the Planning Commission. It looks at policies on infrastructure, rural development, fund mobilisation, labour, food security, agriculture, environment and regional balance.        
	With inflation in June above double digits at 10.55 per cent, price rise is another issue which is expected to dominate the discussions.         
	The Centre has been criticised by the states for the high prices of food articles and the recent hike in fuel prices. The meeting will give the chief ministers an opportunity to voice their discontent over the rising prices of essential commodities, sources said.        
	Inflation has been in double digits since March; food inflation had touched almost 20 per cent in December.        
	The Reserve Bank is scheduled to review its monetary policy on July 27 and is expected to further hike its key short-term lending (repo) and borrowing (reverse repo) rates.

	Fiscal consolidation is the hallmark of the budget presented by the finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. He has reigned in the fiscal deficit at 5.5 per cent for 2010-11. Most notable in this regard is his promise of a transparent approach and include subsidies (such as oil bonds) into fiscal accounting.        
	The finance minister has gone in for expenditure compression. The non-plan budget expenditure constitutes just 6 per cent of the total. Consequently, the budget is unlikely to fuel inflation.        
	Partial rollback of the stimulus has been on expected lines. An across-the-board hike of 2 per cent in excise duty is reasonable considering that the economy is on a revival path. There has been no rollback of service taxes. It has been maintained at 10 per cent. So, the exit from the fiscal stimulus package has been only partial and to that extent, the budget is growth-centric.        
	In fact, the finance minister has struck a fine balance between the need to achieve fiscal consolidation and the imperative of not hindering the process of economic recovery. He has put money into the hands of the middle class by giving away Rs 26,000 crore by way of direct tax breaks. This is bound to give an added fillip to domestic consumption and aid economic growth.        
	Surcharge on domestic companies has been reduced to 7.5per cent from 10 per cent and MAT on book profits hiked from 15 per cent to 18 per cent. However, this is only to be expected in the light of proposed convergence towards goods and service tax which is likely to be rolled out from April 1, 2011.        
	Extending the interest subvention of 2 per cent on exports by another year is a welcome development in the current global scenario.        
	Innovation and global competitiveness have received a boost with the increase in weighted deduction with respect to expenditure incurred on research and development from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. The increased availability of credit to farmers, interest subvention for timely payment of crop loans and the planned thrust on food processing sector are sure to enhance rural income and sustain food security.        
	The decision to adopt a competitive bidding process and set up of a Coal Regulatory Authority will go a long way in injecting the much-needed transparency in coal mining.

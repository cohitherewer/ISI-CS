          SOUNAK MITRA                                            
	Calcutta, May 16: Tech firms are shifting their focus to the small and medium business segment (SMB), which holds very high growth prospects and is still largely unaddressed.         
	Equipment makers and service providers are even coming up with products specially designed for SMBs, entities employing up to 499 people.         
	Technology spend by the larger enterprises is not growing at the pace it was growing earlier. The SMB market is growing at a very faster rate and the market is hugely under-served, said a technology analyst at a global consulting firm.        
	Companies such as Dell, IBM and Lenovo have already restructured their strategy for the SMB segment, with some setting up dedicated business units.        
	Lenovo strongly believes that SMB will be a key growth area going forward. We have a suite of products aimed at the SMB segment, with plans lined up for many more innovative products. While we are definitely aiming for a substantial increase in our SMB market share, the segments contribution in absolute terms would depend on a multitude of market-driven factors, Adity Ganguly, general manager (SMB business unit- HSB), Lenovo India, said.        
	Dell India has restructured its Indian operations and is bullish on SMBs.         
	According to Ravi Bharadwaj, general manager (SMB) of Dell India, When we entered, our main focus was large enterprises. But we shifted our focus especially after the restructuring.        
	The SME market is, and will remain, a key focus for IBM India. Our vision is all about building a more instrumented, interconnected and intelligent world and this applies to mid-sized firms just as much as it applies to governments and corporate giants, Ramesh Narasimhan, director, (general business), IBM India and South Asia, said.         
	Cisco had recently added energy-efficient switches to its small business series of networking solution. The company is launching a web-based small business university, where partners can find all SMB-related tools and training materials.         
	We see a very good prospect in the SMB segment. We also design the complete networking and communication architecture for SMBs, individually. The company also offers financing facilities for the SMBs, Amit Malik, vice-president (east), Cisco India and SAARC, said.         
	Recently, TCS vice-chairman S. Ramadorai had said the SMB market was largely unaddressed.

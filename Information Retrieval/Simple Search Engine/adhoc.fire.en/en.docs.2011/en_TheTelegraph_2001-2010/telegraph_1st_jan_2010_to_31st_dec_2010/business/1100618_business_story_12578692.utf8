	New Delhi, June 17: Taxpayers will have reason to cheer when the draft direct tax code is placed before Parliament  finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is in favour of a lower tax regime.        
	In the past whenever we have reduced taxes, we have had better compliance, Mukherjee told The Telegraph in an interview.         
	The discussion paper on the direct tax code put out last year had recommended continuation of the three-stage personal tax regime of 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent but had proposed higher slabs making the effective rate lower.         
	Officials have cautioned that the tax slabs given in the discussion paper were merely indicative.         
	The code had proposed that people pay nil tax on income up to Rs 1.6 lakh, 10 per cent on income between Rs 1.6 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, 20 per cent on income between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 25 lakh and 30 per cent on income above Rs 25 lakh. For women, the nil tax slab was to range up to Rs 1.9 lakh, and for senior citizens up to Rs 2.4 lakh.        
	At present, those with a taxable income between Rs 1.6 lakh and Rs 5 lakh pay 10 per cent tax, while those in the Rs 5-8 lakh bracket pay 20 per cent. A 30 per cent tax is charged on all earning of more than Rs 8 lakh.         
	The finance minister said the the draft (tax code) has not been finalised. I am waiting for comments. The tax slabs, officials said, could be finalised before the monsoon session of Parliament next month and are likely to be lower than the indicative slabs but higher than the current ones.         
	Tax incentives for savings were also likely to be hiked from the current maximum of Rs 1.35 lakh.         
	When Mrs Indira Gandhi took over from Morarji Desai in the early 1970s, the highest tax rate was as high as 77 per cent. After C. Subramaniam joined as finance minister and I joined as minister of state in 1974, we reduced the tax rate a little in 1975-76, this yielded better revenue realisation, Mukherjee said.         
	In 1976-77 when we reduced taxes further, the result was again encouraging ... but we must realise there is no magic formula that you reduce taxes by 10 per cent and garner 4 per cent more revenue.         
	The code, which was thrown open for debate by the finance minister last August, may come into effect in 2011 if Parliament passes it in time. Its a simpler tax code and we expect it will usher in better compliance, better tax realisation and far less litigation, Mukherjee said.        
	The code has indicated that savings up to Rs 3 lakh in government approved securities, which are likely to include fixed deposits, small savings, insurance and other savings products, will be treated as tax free.         
	In effect it means that an individual need not pay any tax on the first Rs 4.6 lakh of his income, if he manages to invest Rs 3 lakh in tax-saving funds or deposits.        
	However, officials warned that tax incentives for savings might not be as generous as indicated in the discussion paper on the code, but would still be generous.         
	We cannot say how much but it will be better than current rates. The government wishes to encourage savings, officials added.

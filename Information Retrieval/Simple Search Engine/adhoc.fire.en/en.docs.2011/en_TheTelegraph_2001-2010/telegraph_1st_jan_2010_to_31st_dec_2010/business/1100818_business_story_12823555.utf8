The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | US takes up bill for review
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      US takes up bill for review
                              Crowley: Taking a relook                            
	Washington, Aug. 17 (PTI): The US is examining comments that the new border security bill is not WTO compliant.        
	Yes, we are reviewing a suggestion that this bill is not WTO compliant. I am not aware that weve reached any final judgement, but were not sure that necessarily any WTO issues have been triggered, US state department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.        
	The US is in talks with Indian officials about the bill.         
	The border security bill signed by President Barack Obama into law last week will raise around $650 million to tighten the security along the US-Mexico border by deploying 1,500 national guards and aerial drones among others.        
	About $550 million will be raised by increasing the fee for certain categories of H-1B and L1 visas over the next five years.        
	Commerce minister Anand Sharma has already written to US trade representative Ron Kirk expressing his concerns.        
	Congress (US) has passed the law and the President (Obama) has signed it. Now were trying to understand its potential implications. We will work closely with India as we implement it, Crowley said.        
	As we work to administer this law, we will try to understand fully the potential impact that it has on individual companies in India, he said.

	IT companies saw maximum recruitment, while telecom and pharma also fared well, a survey by job portal naukri.com said.        
	Hiring in IT is back to the pre-recession levels. Key IT players are getting multiple projects from India and overseas, which has led to this boom. Software professionals can look forward to a favourable hiring environment over the next few months, said Hitesh Oberoi, CEO and MD of Info Edge, which owns naukri.com.

	TCS, Infosys and Wipro also plan to give lucrative variable payouts and promotions .         
	Analysts said banks had started recruiting for the current fiscal. At present, about 12,000 positions for officers and clerks have been identified by the state-owned banks. Experts say another 15,000-20,000 vacancies are likely to be filled before the end of this fiscal.        
	K. Pandia Rajan, CEO of Ma Foi Randstad, said there was an increased optimism in hiring across all sectors.

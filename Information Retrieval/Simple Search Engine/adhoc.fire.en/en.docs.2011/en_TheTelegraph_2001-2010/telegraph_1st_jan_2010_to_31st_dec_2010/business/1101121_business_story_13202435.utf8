	Calcutta, Nov. 20: Tea growers have asked the Centre to share half of the social cost borne by the plantation industry.        
	Aditya Khaitan, chairman of the Indian Tea Association (ITA), said the governments cost would not be more than Rs 300 crore if it agreed to share the burden.        
	According to Khaitan, who was speaking at the 127th annual general meeting of the ITA, the tea industry needed to be cost competitive to have an edge in exports.        
	The financial capability of the plantation industry is limited and the burden of our social cost is estimated to be Rs 450 crore. The industry pleads for sharing 50 per cent of the social cost, which, along with other incidentals, would translate to a maximum of Rs 300 crore per annum, Khaitan said.        
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was the chief guest at the programme, however, did not make any commitment. He asked the industry to be self-reliant as the governments support could continue only for a certain period.        
	Khaitan argued that the tea industrys turnover was around Rs 10,000 crore at the farm gate level, which was lower than many individual corporate houses in India.         
	Historically, this labour intensive industry with a workforce of one million has been required to shoulder responsibilities, which other industries do not bear.        
	Roshni Sen, acting chairman of the Tea Board, stressed the need for a replantation scheme under which new bushes will be grown in place of old bushes.

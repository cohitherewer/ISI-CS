          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 23: Coal India Ltd (CIL) may be forced to revise downward its production target for 2011-12 following the forest and environment ministry deciding not to give clearances to projects located in critically polluted areas till March 31.        
	Earlier, the coal ministry had to revise CILs production target for 2011-12 to 486 million tonnes (mt) from 512mt because the companys 17 new projects, estimated to produce 101mt by 2011-12, could not take off in the absence of clearances.        
	The extension of the moratorium period till March for project clearances in areas where the composite environment pollution index (CEPI) is more than 70 will stall all our expansion and new project plans since all the eight coalfields will get affected, CIL chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya said. The extension was announced at the end of October.         
	The effect could be substantial as no new project or expansion can take place. I even wont rule out the possibility of a downward revision of production target (460.5mt) for this fiscal. We are assessing the impact and only after a few days will be able to understand the extent to which our production this year will be affected, he said. According to him, Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd in Orissa will be worst hit by the decision.         
	The company today reported a 29.06 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 4,020.36 crore for the first six months of this fiscal compared with the same period last year. Net sales went up 16.9 per cent to Rs 22,525.53 crore from Rs 19,269.52 crore a year ago.

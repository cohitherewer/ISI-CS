	New Delhi, March 13: British car maker Bentley Motors today unveiled the Mulsanne, priced at Rs 2.9 crore.        
	Bentleys GTC Supersports Convertible is also set to be rolled out over the next six months. The latest model was recently showcased at the Geneva auto show.         
	The Mulsanne was manufactured between 1980 and 1992 before production was discontinued. The new model, however, will be different from the earlier version, the company said.        
	Customers will be able to check out the Mulsanne at the showrooms from next month. The car will be available for sale in India by the end of this year or early 2011.        
	The Mulsanne is our ninth model in India. We are very excited about the growth and potential of the premium car market in India. In the next six months, we also hope to launch our GTC Supersports Convertible, said Chris Buxton, Bentley regional director (India). Sources say the GTC is likely to be priced above Rs 2 crore in India.        
	Handcrafted at Bentleys plant in Crewe (England), each Mulsanne requires 660 man-hours to assemble compared with 5-6 hours for other cars. Each car will be personalised according to the owners requirement. Production will begin in the second quarter of 2010. Buxton said the car had already got bookings from across the globe, but refused to give the numbers.         
	According to Satya Bagla, managing director, Exclusive Motors, the dealers for Bentley in India, the Mulsanne has already attracted 50-60 bookings. The numbers are only expected to go up. We want the allocation for India to be increased, said Bagla.         
	Buxton said the company would produce 600 units of the Mulsanne annually for the global market and the quota for India was yet to be decided.        
	We will offer every car produced and sold all over the world in the Indian market and that too at the earliest, Buxton added. Globally, Bentley produces 5,000 units per annum. Of this, India sold about 25-30 cars in 2009.

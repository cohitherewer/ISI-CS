          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, June 25: Hyundai Motor India Ltd sees exports coming down around 5 per cent during this fiscal.        
	Exports comprised 48 per cent of the total sales of 5.6 lakh cars last year.         
	This year, exports will be around 43 per cent  about 11,000 units less compared with last year  of the total target sales of 6 lakh units, CEO Han-Woo Park said on the sidelines of the launch of the Verna variant here today .         
	According to Park, the decision to cut down on exports is part of Hyundais global strategy. The firm will reduce supplies of the i20 to Europe. Hyundais Turkey plant will try and cater to the demand in Europe. he said.         
	The Turkey facility will manufacture around 40,000 i20s to fill the gap created by the decline in exports from India.        
	Last year, Hyundai exported around 2,68,800 cars, the bulk of which were the i10, i20 and Santro. This year, the company plans to export around 2,58,000 units.                                
	Talking about the companys small car, Park said, The plan is on. We will bring something below Santro. But, it is too early say about the price and expected time of launch. It is reported that the company is li8kely to introduce 800cc hatchback in India soon.        
	Meanwhile, the company has decided to phase out Getz with a target to increase i20 sales.        
	We have already stopped producing Getz, and the stock will be cleared gradually. i20 will replace Getz, Park said.        
	Hyundai launched Getz in 2004 at Rs 4.5 lakh for customers looking to upgrade from entry-level hatchbacks such as Maruti 800, Alto and its own popular Santro. Though packed with performance and quality, Getz wilted against archrival Maruti Swift that was launched in May 2005 with a retro design and a price tag of Rs 4 lakh.         
	At its peak, Getz sold more than 3,000 units a month in 2004, but sales have steadily dropped since. Only around 6,500 units were sold in 2009. The drop continued this year, with an estimated 1,600 units sold during the past six months.         
	Over 5,000 units of i20 a month are being sold against the original target of 2,000, driving the Korean carmaker to turn all its efforts towards the hatchback.

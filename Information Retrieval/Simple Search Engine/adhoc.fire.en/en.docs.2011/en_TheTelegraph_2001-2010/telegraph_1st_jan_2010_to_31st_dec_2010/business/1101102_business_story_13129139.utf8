          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Manmohan Singh in   New Delhi on Monday.   Picture by Rajesh Kumar      
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today asked PSU energy firms to scout for overseas assets to meet the countrys demand for fossil fuels, which is set to soar 40 per cent over the next decade.        
	The demand over the next 10 years will increase over 40 per cent, whereas the increase in supply from the maturing (domestic) oilfields is expected to be around 12 per cent. To bridge the shortfall, the government is encouraging national oil firms to acquire oil and gasfields abroad, he said while inaugurating the Petrotech-2010 oil and gas conference here.        
	He expressed the need to build strong economic partnerships with hydrocarbon-rich countries.         
	Oil and gas today are not seen as mere commodities to be traded freely. They are often used by countries to meet their political objectives, he said.        
	Oil output stood at around 34 million tonnes (mt) in the last fiscal, much less than the consumption of over 138mt, with the gap met by imports.         
	Domestic firms, meanwhile, have stepped up efforts to buy oil and gas assets.         
	Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has received a proposal from investment bankers to purchase Exxon Mobil Corps 25 per cent stake in a deep sea block in Angola.        
	We have been making efforts to acquire interest in upstream opportunities in Angola since 2002. We keep receiving proposals and we are examining one such opportunity, said R.S. Butola, managing director of ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of the PSU explorer.        
	Petropars, a unit of state-run National Iranian Oil Company, said it expected to sign a deal with ONGC next year for the development of the South Pars gasfield.

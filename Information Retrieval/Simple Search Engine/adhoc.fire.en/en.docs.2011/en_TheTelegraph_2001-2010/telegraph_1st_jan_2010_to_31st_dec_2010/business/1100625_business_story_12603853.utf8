	Mumbai, June 24: HCL Corporation, promoted by Shiv Nadar and family, today sold 2.5 per cent of HCL Technologies  close to 1.67 crore shares  for Rs 585 crore.         
	The sale proceeds will be donated to Shiv Nadar Foundation to be used for philanthropic initiatives.         
	Citigroup Global Markets Mauritius bought 34.38 lakh shares at a price of Rs 347 apiece. The block deal on the Bombay Stock Exchange resulted in HCL Technologies topping the turnover charts in the A group, though the scrip reacted negatively to fall around 4 per cent to Rs 358.85. It had opened lower at Rs 364.65 on news of the sale and hit a low of Rs 347.         
	The A group of the BSE comprises the most frequently traded scrips.        
	According to HCL Corporation, Shiv Nadar Foundation, to which the sale proceeds will be donated, is working on creating educational institutions that provide meritorious students the opportunity to benefit from quality teaching. The Shiv Nadar Foundation had set up the SSN Institutions in 1996, comprising the SSN College of Engineering and others. It now proposes to set up the Shiv Nadar University on a 286-acre campus near New Delhi.        
	Besides HCL Technologies, the Kotak Mahindra counter also witnessed heavy trade.        
	The Netherlands-based financial services major ING today reportedly exited private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank by selling its entire 3.06 per cent stake in a block deal for Rs 801.1 crore.        
	ING sold the stake at an average price of Rs 750.7 per share, according to data available with the National Stock Exchange.         
	However, the Kotak Mahindra scrip reacted negatively to the development and fell 2.69 per cent to close at Rs 762.15 on the BSE today. The sale comes just days after Rabobank sold a part of its stake in private sector lender Yes Bank. ING Banks Singapore branch has sold 1.06 crore shares to more than one investor.         
	On the reasons for exiting Kotak Mahindra, a spokesperson for ING said, The stake sale is in line with INGs back-to-basics strategy, which was announced last year.        
	After being hit by the global financial meltdown, ING had unveiled a business strategy based on the back-to-basics concept. According to the plan, the entity will look at cutting down costs and reducing operational complexity.        
	Our governance model will be adapted to our strategy, with rigorous business performance reviews and reinforced accountability, INGs then CEO-designate Jan Hommen had said in April last year.

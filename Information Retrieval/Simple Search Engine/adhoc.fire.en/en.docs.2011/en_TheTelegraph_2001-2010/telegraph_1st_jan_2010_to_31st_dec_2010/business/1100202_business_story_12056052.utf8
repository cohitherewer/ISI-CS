The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Subir Raha passes away
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Subir Raha passes away
                                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 1 (PTI): Subir Raha, former chairman of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, died of cancer today. He was 62.        
	Raha, who was diagnosed with lung cancer last year, fell ill a week back and was undergoing treatment at a private hospital here.         
	Raha single-handedly drove ONGCs vertical integration by acquiring Mangalore Refinery and aggressively pursued overseas forays.        
	During his tenure as chairman and managing director from 2001 to 2006, ONGCs market capitalisation increased more than 10 times to Rs 200,000 crore, and it became the leader among all public and private sector firms in India in terms of net worth.        
	Prior to ONGC, Raha served as a director at Indian Oil where he had begun his career as a management trainee in 1970.         
	In 2006, when Raha was denied an extension, ONGC lost its position as the countrys most valuable firm.

  - Spectrum allocation begins; service rollout by early next year        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Exciting times                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Consumers itching for high-speed Internet services on their mobiles through 3G have reason to cheer  operators should be in a position to commence services by early next year with the government starting the process of allocating spectrum from today.        
	Operators had already started amassing 3G content and procuring equipment and they were only waiting for the government to release spectrum, for which they had paid a massive Rs 68,000 crore through an auction in AprilMay.         
	3G allows operators to provide numerous value-added services such as mobile commerce and video calling.         
	Seven operators  Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Tata Teleservices, Reliance Communications, Idea Cellular, Aircel and S Tel  will provide the service, though none of them have the right to offer the service across the whole country. Vodafone, Reliance Communications and Aircel are the 3G operators for Calcutta.        
	Along with the spectrum, the department of telecom (DoT) today amended the 3G licence agreements.        
	Operators hold the licence to offer 3G services for 20 years and will continue to enjoy the right even if their 2G licences expire.        
	The government has also imposed a rollout obligation, under which the operators have to cover at least 90 per cent of the metros within the next five years.         
	Failure to meet rollout obligations would lead to financial penalty and withdrawal of 3G licence, said DoT officials.        
	Operators need to pay a spectrum fee to the government ranging between 2 per cent and 8 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue, depending on the spectrum held.        
	In case of merger between two operators, only one slot of spectrum can be retained.         
	Tata Teleservices has awarded its 3G network contract to Nokia Siemens Networks and plans to launch services by the end of the year.         
	Reliance Communications (R-Com), which has tied up with Universal Music for songs, expects to launch 3G before the year ends.        
	By releasing the 3G spectrum, the government has paved the way for the next revolution in mobile telecommunications. Reliance Communication is fully geared to bring alive this superior 3G experience to all its consumers, said Syed Safawi, CEO-Wireless Business, R-Com.        
	Stocks on fire        
	Telecom stocks were on fire today led by R-Com, which surged about 5 per cent on the BSE. The R-Com stock rose 4.94 per cent to Rs 163.70. Bharti Airtel zoomed 3.10 per cent to close at Rs 337.30.

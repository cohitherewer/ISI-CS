	New Delhi, Oct. 23: India and Bangladesh today agreed upon a slew of trade measures, including deals on opening border markets and allowing Bangla truckers to enter Nepal through India. A pact for the duty-free import of 8 million Bangladeshi garment pieces will also be renewed.         
	Truckers from either side will now be allowed to enter up to 200 metres of each others territory and exchange goods at the container terminals.        
	We are not only neighbours, we are brothers and good friends, said Bangla commerce minister Faruk Khan after signing the deals with commerce minister Anand Sharma.         
	Under the deal on border haats, India will set up markets in Meghalaya, while shops on the other side will come up in Sunamganj and Kurigram districts. The haats will be held weekly, encouraging locals from both countries to buy and sell goods.        
	The Bangla team did some tough talk on non-tariff barriers, which delayed consignments and added to trade expenses.         
	Khan, who is in India along with a delegation of Bangla business leaders, pressed for a quick decision on the demand for duty concessions on 61 more products and a free trade pact.        
	The Bangla business team included A.K. Azad, a top garment exporter and president of a Bangladesh industry association, tea planter Ardashir Kabir and Abdul Matlub Ahmed, Tata Motors partner in Bangladesh.         
	Tea planter Kabir said the businessmen had proposed a special economic zone in the Northeast where they would set up processing factories for export to Bangladesh and other third-world countries.

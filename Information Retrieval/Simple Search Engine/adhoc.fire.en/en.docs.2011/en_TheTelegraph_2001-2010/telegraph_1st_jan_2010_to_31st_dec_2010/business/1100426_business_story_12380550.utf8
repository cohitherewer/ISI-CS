The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Recovery on uneven track
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Recovery on uneven track
                            
	Washington, April 25 (PTI): Economic recovery in many developing countries is still in the initial stages and not evenly spread, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said here today.        
	The last two years have been a difficult one for the global economy. The economic crisis has severely affected economic growth in developing and developed countries. While recovery has begun in many developing countries, the shoots are still tender and the recovery uneven, Chawla said while addressing the IMF-World Bank Spring meeting here.        
	Chawla said the recovery could be easily upset by minor shocks and fluctuations, adding that the altered financial landscape has adversely affected growth potential of developing countries.        
	Costlier and more scarce finance will reduce annual growth rates by a few points. This is a permanent change in growth patterns. While the macro-effects of this need to be observed, it is certain that poverty reduction efforts and achievement of MDGs (Millennium Development Goals) will see a setback, Chawla said. There has been a perceptible rise in poverty as a result of the crisis which has had a disproportionate impact on poor households, he said.         
	The long lasting effects of the crisis will be felt through delayed escape from poverty, higher infant mortality rates, lower school enrollments and poorer nutrition levels, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL to bid for 3 power plants
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RIL to bid for 3 power plants
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Charged up                                  
	Mumbai, June 16: Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries plans to bid for three mega power plants of 4000MW each in Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Tamil Nadu.         
	Bids for the Chhattisgarh plant are expected to be in by July 5, while bids for Orissa have a deadline of July 30. The date for submission of bids for the Tamil Nadu project will be announced shortly, sources said.         
	The government is planning to set up nine such mega projects across the country to meet the countrys growing power need.        
	Four projects have already been awarded, of which Anil Ambanis Reliance Power has won the contracts for Sasan in Madhya Pradesh, Krishnapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and Tilaiya (Jharkhand). Tata Power has won the bid for the Mundra project in Gujarat.        
	If Reliance manages to clinch the three mega projects, six of the nine such proposed plants will be with the Ambani brothers.        
	The two other mega power projects will be in Maharashtra and Karnataka.        
	Anils ADAG cannot bid for any more projects till the three it had won take off. Tata Powers project is currently under construction.        
	Soon after RIL and ADAG announced their decision to scrap the non-compete agreement on May 23, analysts had been expecting RIL to make an effort to bag a mega power project  expected to cost around Rs 16,000 crore per plant.        
	The decision allows RIL to enter all the areas of business that ADAG has so far been operating, except gas-based power plants till 2022.        
	RIL, which is sitting on a cash pile of $5 billion, is looking to invest in capital intensive projects where its execution capabilities can be put to good use.         
	A spokesperson for Reliance declined comment on the development.         
	An announcement on Reliance Industries decision to compete for the power projects is expected at the companys annual general meeting on June 18.         
	Chairman Mukesh Ambani may also announce the revised gas pact with brother Anil the same day. The Supreme Court had directed the two to renegotiate the agreement by June 21.         
	The Reliance scrip closed a little less than a per cent lower today at Rs 1,057 on the BSE.

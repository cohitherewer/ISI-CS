          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 9: Car sales zoomed 25 per cent in 2009-10, signalling that the worst of the slowdown is over and consumers are ready to make big-ticket purchases.        
	In the wake of global recession, growth in India had slipped to 6.6 per cent in 2008-09. The car sales figure indicates that the governments stimulus measures have worked.        
	The government is now expecting an uptrend in growth  from 7.2 per cent in 2009-10 to more than 8 per cent in this fiscal and 9 per cent in 2011-12.         
	Car sales in the last fiscal rose to 1.53 million units from 1.22 million in the previous year. This is the biggest percentage gain since a 29 per cent growth in 2004, data issued by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) showed.         
	For the month of March, sales rose 20.05 per cent to 155,600 units from a year earlier, while motorcycle sales climbed 35.7 per cent to 708,349 units.         
	Commercial vehicle sales  another key barometer of economic activity  soared 61.16 per cent in March to 67,362 units.        
	Automobile sales in India, which include cars, motorcycles and trucks, rose 26 per cent in the past year to 12.29 million units.        
	Besides the government stimulus, lower borrowing costs and the introduction of new models have helped to boost the demand for cars.        
	Siam president Pawan Goenka said the exceptionally high growth for the last fiscal could be attributed to the low base figure of the previous year.         
	Over the past decade, automobile sales have risen by an annual 10 to 14 per cent and the automobile association expects similar growth in the current financial year to March 2011, he said.         
	However, price rises announced by car makers to cover production costs to make vehicles compliant with the new environmental emission norms, higher raw material costs and a rise in excise duties can temper the demand in the current year, said analysts.         
	According to Goenka, sales of passenger vehicles, which include cars and utility vehicles, are expected to rise to 4.5 million units by 2015-16 when the total value of the auto industry will be worth $145 billion.

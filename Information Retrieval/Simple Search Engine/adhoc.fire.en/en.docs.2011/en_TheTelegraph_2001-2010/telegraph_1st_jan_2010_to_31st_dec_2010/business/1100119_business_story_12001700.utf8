The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court tiff jams DPSC selloff
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Court tiff jams DPSC selloff
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 18: The share sale of Bengal-based power generator DPSC Ltd has landed in court with highest bidder Srei alleging asset stripping by the incumbent management.        
	In a petition, Srei has asked for the removal of DPSC managing director S. Radhakrishnan, appointment of a special officer and a speedy conclusion of the stake sale process.        
	The matter came up for hearing last week in Calcutta High Court and is expected to be heard again this week.        
	Srei was the winner in an auction to acquire 57.17 per cent in DPSC from Andrew Yule and insurers LIC and GIC on November 20 with a bid of Rs 710 per share.        
	Descon, the largest shareholder of DPSC with a 32 per cent stake, had bid Rs 705 per share. Radhakrishnan is the managing director of both DPSC and Descon.         
	Nearly two months have passed since the selloff, but Srei is yet to get the DPSC shares, fuelling speculation that the LIC and GIC may not offload their cumulative 42 per cent stake.        
	However, the trigger to approach the court was DPSCs stake sale in Tide Water Oil.         
	We found out that the company (DPSC) sold nearly Rs 8 crore worth of Tide Water Oil shares after the auction. This is asset stripping. We moved court to stop any further asset sale, Hemant Kanoria, managing director of Srei, told The Telegraph.        
	A filing with the BSE shows that DPSC has sold 11,950 shares in the October-December quarter that has reduced its stake by 1.37 per cent. Tide Water is an Andrew Yule associate company like DPSC.        
	Kanoria said Srei and its partner Indian Power Company had quoted Rs 710 per share for DPSC to gain majority control knowing it had certain assets such as the Tide Water shares.         
	For a company with little over Rs 4 crore paid up capital, Rs 8 crore is big amount I dont know why the LIC, the GIC and Yule are taking so long to part with their shares, Kanoria said.        
	When contacted, DPSC managing director Radhakrishnan defended the Tide Water sale.        
	The decision to sell the stocks were taken by the DPSC board in 2007. The money has been kept in a fixed deposit. We intend to use the fund to buy land for the 500 megawatt power plant, he said.        
	Radhakrishnan said most of the shares were sold before the auction took place on November 20.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | NTPC suffers from project lag
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      NTPC suffers from project lag
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      POWER PUNCH                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (NTPC) has suffered a notional loss of Rs 40,519 crore because of inadequate planning and delay in the commissioning of projects, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India said.        
	NTPC will lose the opportunity of generating 169,440 million units involving Rs 40,519 crore in revenue because of a delay in realising capacity addition, the report said.        
	The capacity addition programme suffered because of a lack of scientific approach to planning, inordinate delays from conceptualisation to investment approval, the report presented before Parliament said.        
	NTPC actually took 10-102 months from identification or conceptualisation to investment approval for its projects, it said.        
	NTPC will be able to add 9,220-mega-watt (MW) capacity within five years ending March 2012, falling short of a target of 22,430MW from 24 projects. According to the report, all ongoing NTPC projects are likely to be delayed by at least 44 months.        
	It said NTPC should consider adopting super-critical technology more frequently, as it was cost-efficient and environment-friendly.        
	The PSU used super-critical technology in only three out of 18 projects. Supercritical plants use less coal and save on operational cost. The audit report recommended that NTPC should consider alternative sources of procuring equipment to get competitive rates.        
	It praised the company for tying up its finances well, which prevented all its projects from suffering for lack of funds.         
	Despite significant time overrun of 9-33 months, three projects were completed within approved cost although there was 61 per cent and 76 per cent increase in process of steel and cement respectively, the report said.        
	NTPCs generation capacity stands at around 32,000MW per annum, and it plans to augment this to 75,000MW by 2017.

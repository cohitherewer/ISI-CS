          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 24: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today stressed the need to devise a new measure of consumer inflation that takes into account a more varied and representative basket of commodities and services.        
	For a realistic assessment of inflation conditions, there is a need for a more representative national level measure of consumer inflation that covers the consumers across all sections of society and also includes mass consumption services, the RBI said in its annual report for 2009-10.        
	The call for a new index comes at a time inflation-fighting has become the most important task for the central bank.        
	India currently uses the wholesale price index (WPI) and four measures of the consumer price index (CPI) to make an economy-wide inflation estimate.        
	The most widely-accepted rate of inflation  the one that the government uses in all its official pronouncements  is based on the wholesale price index. It is currently at a little over 10 per cent. In July, the RBI projected that it would hover at 6 per cent by March next year.        
	In the past, too, the RBI has favoured a national measure of inflation as it found that the divergence between the different inflation measures complicated the conduct of monetary policy.         
	RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao and his predecessor Y.V. Reddy  have in the past called upon the need to bring about improvements in the measurements of inflationary conditions.         
	Reddy had stressed the need for a new inflation measure back in 1999 when he was the deputy governor at the central bank, stressing that the selected measure of inflation should broadly capture the interplay of effective demand and supply forces in the economy at frequent intervals.        
	The central bank today again reiterated this call when it said that with services accounting for the largest share of the countrys GDP and increasing proportion of disposable income of the people being spent on services, the prices of commonly used services have become important from the standpoint of assessment of consumer welfare.        
	While prices of certain services like telecommunications have declined considerably, the prices of other services like private education and health care have gone up significantly, though part of that may reflect premium for improving quality of services, the bank noted.

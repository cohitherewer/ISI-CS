          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          John Peace in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, June 11: The countrys first Indian Depository Receipt (IDR)  floated by Standard Chartered Plc (StanChart)  made a tepid debut on the bourses today as it opened at Rs 105 per IDR and dipped at the close to Rs 103.05 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).        
	The issue price for the IDR was Rs 104.        
	Broking circles cited various reasons for the sedate start. While insurance companies are not allowed to invest in IDRs, regulations on long-term capital gains tax are also said to have deterred active participation from retail investors.         
	Moreover, the IDR price is linked to StanChart Plc on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).         
	On the LSE, trading in StanChart shares were lower by 1.49 per cent at 16.24 in morning trade.        
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, though the IDR hit an intra-day high of Rs 108, buying interest was not sustained thereafter and it closed at a discount to the offer price.        
	According to Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, Large investors like insurance companies, who take a long term view cannot invest in the IDR. Further, tax treatment of gains from IDR are not treated as shares and hence subject to tax at business rates.        
	Speaking at the listing ceremony, Standard Chartereds chairman John Peace said the bank did not have any specific plan on how to deploy the issue proceeds.

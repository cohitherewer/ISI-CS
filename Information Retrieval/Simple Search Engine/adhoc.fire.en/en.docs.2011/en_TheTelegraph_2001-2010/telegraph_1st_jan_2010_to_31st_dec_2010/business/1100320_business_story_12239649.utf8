	New Delhi, March 19: The government today cleared an investment of $2.18 billion by the ONGC-led consortium in a Venezuelan oil field, which will secure an annual supply of 3.6 million tonnes of crude for India.         
	The cabinet also gave the green signal to the 33 oil and gas blocks won by bidders in the eight round of auction under New Exploration Licensing Policy, in which 17 blocks were won by ONGC and its partners.        
	ONGC Videsh Ltd will invest $1.3 billion between 2010 and 2015 in the 400,000-barrels-per-day Carabobo-1 project. Indian Oil Corporation and Oil India will invest $454 million each.         
	The Carabobo-1 block in the Orinoco belt will involve a total investment of around $21 billion over 25 years.

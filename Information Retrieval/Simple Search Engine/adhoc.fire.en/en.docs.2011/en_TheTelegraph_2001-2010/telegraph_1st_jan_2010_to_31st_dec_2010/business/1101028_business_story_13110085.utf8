	Calcutta, Oct. 27: The huge success of the Coal India IPO may not be repeated in other PSU divestments, say fund managers.        
	The Coal India offer was subscribed 15.28 times, receiving bids of more than Rs 2,34,000 crore.        
	Coal India was a unique story that attracted many new investors, both institutional and individual, said Swati Kulkarni, vice-president and a senior fund manager at UTI Mutual Fund, the countrys oldest asset management company.        
	The Coal India IPO is unique in the sense that it is the largest coal producer in the world and it doesnt have a peer listed on the domestic stock exchanges. The issue, unlike other recent public offerings of PSUs, was rightly priced.        
	Coal will be the prime source of energy in India over the next 50 years. So, Coal India has good prospects of increasing its profitability, according to Kulkarni.        
	On the forthcoming issues, Kulkarni said, A number of PSUs lined up for divestment over the next few months are either already listed or dont have a similar story as Coal India. There are many FIIs first time in India investing through Coal India. They were fascinated by the Coal India story and may not come again in public offerings of other PSUs. This success of Coal India IPO may not be repeated in other public offerings of PSUs lined up for the next few months, Kulkarni said.        
	Kulkarni did not specify the amount put in by UTI Mutual in the Coal India IPO but said we have invested quite a good amount of money.        
	Reliance Mutual Fund, the countrys largest fund house, is bullish about the listing of the Coal India shares. However, it did not invest a big amount as it was not sure of getting full allotment. As institutional investors, we had to invest 100 per cent of the application money. We didnt want to take the risk of refund, said Sunil Singhania, head (equities), Reliance Capital Asset Management Ltd, which manages Reliance Mutual Fund.        
	The huge oversubscription in Coal India IPO by qualified institutional bidders reflects the easy liquidity situation abroad, said Dharmesh Mehta of Enam Securities.

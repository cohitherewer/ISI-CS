	Calcutta, Dec. 27: Inflation is expected at 6-7 per cent at the end of this fiscal, according to the governments chief economic adviser Kaushik Basu. Inflation, therefore, could be higher than the official projection of 5.5 per cent by March 2011.         
	Inflation is in a better position than it was a year ago, Basu said at a session of the Merchants Chamber of Commerce.         
	According to Basu, there are two factors affecting inflation  international food prices are on the rise and there are fewer barriers to the flow of money between countries.         
	Russia has imposed a ban on the export of wheat and barley and events such as these cause international food prices to increase, said Basu. Given this situation, Inflation will go down but more slowly.

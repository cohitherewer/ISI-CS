The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel costlier after duty hike
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Steel costlier after duty hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pricey proposition                                  
	New Delhi, March 3: State-owned SAIL and other steel firms have raised prices by up to Rs 600 a tonne because of an excise duty hike in the budget.        
	Yes, there is a price increase of about Rs 500-600 a tonne because of the excise duty hike. The price increase is effective from March 1, S. K. Roongta, chairman of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), told reporters on the sidelines of the All India Induction Furnace Associations meet here.        
	Partially rolling back the fiscal stimulus in budget 2010-11, the government raised the excise duty to 10 per cent from 8 per cent. Other steel makers to hike prices are JSW Steel, Essar Steel and Ispat Industries.         
	Before the price hike, prices of long products used in construction ranged between Rs 27,000 and Rs 29,000 a tonne. The price of flat products used in the automobile sector was Rs 34,000-36,000 a tonne.        
	After the global financial crisis, the government had initiated massive spending programmes and slashed duties from December 2008 in three stages to spur economic activity.        
	Steel secretary Atul Chaturvedi, however, said the price rise was not alarming. If we see steel prices in the last 30 months, the current scenario is not alarming. Chaturvedi said steel demand was likely to increase 10 per cent in the next fiscal because of higher spending on infrastructure.        
	We expect about a 10 per cent increase (in steel demand) from the current years level. Demand will continue to rise because a lot of emphasis has been put on infrastructure development, he said. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has proposed to invest Rs 1.73 lakh crore in infrastructure.

	Calcutta, Jan. 9: The Union government has asked states to offer land for setting up budget hotels, while the Centre will provide incentives and tax sops to the developers.        
	We are encouraging public-private partnership for setting up budget hotels in the country. In such ventures, the states will offer land and the private partner will pump in the money, minister of state for tourism and culture Sultan Ahmed said on the sidelines of a business summit organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	There is a shortage of about 1.5 lakh rooms in the country. States with tourist spots need to join hands with private partners to develop infrastructure, the minister said.        
	We are getting proposals from across the nation, including states in the northeastern region. These hotels will be developed as a PPP model and will be offered special incentives and sops, Ahmed added.        
	Earlier, the minister had said tourism was likely to get an industry status in the forthcoming budget.         
	The finance ministry is examining the proposal, Ahmed added.

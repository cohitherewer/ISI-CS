The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax on arrear
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Tax on arrear
                                I am 80-years-old. The pension arrears for January 2006 to January 2010 have been credited to my bank account on April 14, 2010. Should I calculate the tax on the arrears according to the respective assessment years or the current assessment year?          R. Das, Calcutta
                    According to the Income Tax Act, when a person receives pension arrears, he is liable to be taxed in the year of receipt. He is however, entitled to relief under Section 89(1). By claiming benefit under this section, incidence of tax can be restricted to the amount which would have been payable, had the income in question been taxed on an accrual basis in the year in which it actually became due.                                    Deduction dilemma      I had deposited Rs 50,000 in a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme with a public sector bank. When I submitted my investment declaration with the pension department of my ex-employer, the official told me that deductions under Section 80C is allowed if the SCSS account is opened with a post office but deductions will not be available if the account is opened with a bank. Is this true?        Shyamal Gangopadhyay, Salt Lake
                    Deduction of investment in SCSS up to Rs 1 lakh is available under Section 80C, irrespective of whether the account is opened with a post office or a bank. The directive from the income tax office didnt differentiate between a post office and a bank in this regard.                                  Eligible senior      My date of birth is March 1, 1946. Shall I be considered a senior citizen for the purpose of income tax during the financial year 2010-11 (assessment year 2011-12)?        Pradip Chandra Roy, Calcutta
                    According to the Income Tax Act , a person is a senior citizen if he has attained 65 years of age or more in the previous year. The previous year here refers to the financial year immediately preceding the year of assessment. You shall be 65 before March 31, 2011. So, you can claim basic exemption limit allowed for senior citizens in the assessment year 2011-12.

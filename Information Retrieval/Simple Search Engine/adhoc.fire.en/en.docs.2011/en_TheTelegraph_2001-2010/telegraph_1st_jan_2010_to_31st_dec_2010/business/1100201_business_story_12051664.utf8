        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay shows how to make money on tax-saving investments                                            
	If you have so far been sleeping over your tax-saving investments, you may now be losing your sleep over it.         
	Salaried people, in particular, must have by now got the final call from the accounts department to submit the details of their investments in tax-saving instruments so that suitable deductions are made from their salaries for the remaining months of the current financial year.         
	As the last minute rush for investments to save income tax begins, you might unwittingly become a victim of flawed decisions and realise it when its too late.        
	Seventy-year-old Ashok Ganguly was a senior bank official. What he did to save tax is similar to what many personal income taxpayers do even now.         
	He bought three life insurance policies for his only child, three policies for his wife, a couple of them for himself, besides buying half a dozen National Savings Certificates. While he could save taxes on his income, these investments created little wealth when he needed it the most  after retirement. Where did Ashok go wrong?         
	He bought too many life insurance policies, paid hefty sums towards premium and yet he remained under-insured. Besides, he has also kept a lot of money in fixed-income assets where the post-tax return is abysmally low.        
	Save or invest?        
	We tend to think of saving tax first and investing later. Here lies the importance of financial prudence.        
	People have the habit of keeping their tax-saving investments pending till the last quarter of the financial year instead of starting out from the beginning of the financial year. In this way, they end up losing on the returns on investments for the better part of the year. Then, in a rush to make investments over a limited period of time, taxpayers overlook the cost benefit as well as risk-reward profile of instruments in which they are investing their hard-earned money. Convenience rather than suitability guides those who wake up late.        
	The first question a taxpayer should ask himself: Am I ready to part with Rs 1 lakh for a minimum of three years from my annual income to save Rs 30,000 towards tax outgo? This is important because all tax-saving instruments come with a lock-in period varying from three years to 15 years or more. So, when you go for a tax-saving plan, you have to compromise with the liquidity of your investment  you cannot withdraw any money within the stipulated lock-in period.         
	The table shows the illiquidity of various tax-saving investment options available.         
	It also shows that your post-tax return from fixed income instruments, except PPF, will be too low to balance the rate of inflation (here by inflation I mean consumer price inflation which is much higher than the wholesale price inflation).         
	Still, people make a beeline for fixed income investments to save tax with a preconceived apprehension about risks involved in equity-linked instruments. They forget that they are locking their funds for five years or more.         
	Risky but healthy        
	If we calculate the probability of suffering a loss by investing in equities on a five-year rolling basis, it works out to be 6.25 per cent, or one in 16 cases for the BSE 200 index. The average annual compounded return is 13.12 per cent. It can, thus, be seen that equity investment is not as risky as it is perceived. On the other hand, the return rate (tax free since there is no long-term capital gains on equities) is much higher compared with fixed income options.         
	The New Pension Scheme also offers a better deal for tax saving than fixed income instruments as it provides for up to 50 per cent equity exposure through index mutual funds. However, an investor cannot withdraw from NPS before 60 years of age. Moreover, the maturity amount is also taxable if not used to buy annuities from a life insurance company. Annuity income, like pension income, is again taxable in the hands of the annuitant. Thus, NPS is neither very tax-efficient nor liquid enough. After all, NPS is for retirement planning.        
	Balanced view        
	If you are among those for whom safety comes first followed by the return, you can work on the following investment plan.         
	On tax-saving bank or post office fixed deposits, you now get a maximum interest of 7.5 per cent per annum. However, the interest is credited on quarterly compounding basis in banks. Thus, if you deposit Rs 70,000 in a tax-saving bank fixed deposit for five years, the maturity amount will be Rs 1,01,496 at an annual interest rate of 7.5 per cent.        
	To exhaust your investment limit of Rs 1 lakh available under Section 80C of the income tax act, invest the remaining Rs 30,000 in a tax-saving mutual fund. ELSS as an investment category has given a return of 19.41 per cent compounded annually over the past five years. At this rate, Rs 30,000 will grow to Rs 72,832.        
	So, your tax saving investment of Rs 1 lakh grows to Rs 1,74,328 in five years which is much better than what you can get from a fixed income investment. This is tax efficient too, because you dont have to pay any tax on ELSS.        
	Pros and cons        
	The risk of loss in equity investments gets reduced almost to nil over a long period of time. From this perspective, ELSS and Ulips are better tax saving options.         
	However, Ulips have higher costs than ELSS. Besides, investment in Ulips requires a long-term commitment for regular annual payment of premium. Even the lock-in period is higher for Ulips.         
	While you can withdraw partially from your Ulip fund value, you cannot fully withdraw the investment before five years without a penalty. In the case of ELSS, the lock-in period is three years  the least among all tax-saving investment options.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Derivative delivery rules by month end
          OUR BUREAU                          C.B. Bhave in Mumbai on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, July 8: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) expects to come out with guidelines enabling physical delivery-based settlement in the derivative segment by the end of this month.        
	The issue of enabling physical delivery-based settlement is (being) discussed between the market regulator and stock exchanges and we expect to reach a conclusion by the end of this month, Sebi chairman C. B. Bhave told reporters on the sidelines of a function here today.        
	In March, Sebi had decided to allow physical delivery in the equity derivatives segment to bring down speculation in the stock markets and had said it would hold talks with the stock exchanges and work on the system.        
	Bhave said Sebi was considering whether distributors of financial products needed to be regulated. We are looking at the issue and once we decide on it, we will bring out a consultative paper.        
	On the slow progress of the mutual fund trading platform launched on the stock exchanges, Bhave said, the process was new and would take time to build up.         
	We want to talk to stock exchanges...we want to give sufficient time, before arriving at any conclusion as to why there are not sufficient volumes, he said.        
	The market regulator is also looking at launching options trade in the currency derivative segment fairly soon.         
	The Reserve Bank in its policy has said that currency options will be permitted. The technical group between the RBI and Sebi is working on this and we expect a decision soon, Bhave said.         
	Sebi is also considering the issue of the listing of exchanges. We have referred (the matter) to a committee under the chairmanship of former RBI governor Bimal Jalan. There were issues relating to the infrastructure institutions in the market that is stock exchanges, depositories and clearing corporations, Bhave said.        
	The question was that can these infrastructure institutions be driven purely by profit and what kind of conflicts could arise out of that, he said.

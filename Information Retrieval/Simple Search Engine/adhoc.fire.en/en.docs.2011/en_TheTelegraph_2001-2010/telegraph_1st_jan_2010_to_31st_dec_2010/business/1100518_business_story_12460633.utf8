          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 17: China wants India to have an open, fair and transparent business environment.         
	Reacting to Indias stringent rules on importing mobile equipment, Yao Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese ministry of commerce, said, Any rule should be fairly applicable to all companies, including Indian, Chinese and western companies.        
	Indias department of telecom (DoT) has recently issued a directive asking all telecom service providers to get security clearance before procuring equipment and software from foreign companies.        
	While the Indian government claims there is no blanket ban on the import of telecom equipment and networks from China, companies such as Huawei and ZTE said the DoT had not approved any contracts that the local operators had signed with them since February.         
	We hope the two nations increase consultations and co-operation to address problems, said Yao, adding that existing contracts won by Chinese companies in India should be allowed to proceed.        
	Top executives of both Huawei and ZTE recently met officials in Indias home, communications and commerce ministries.        
	Both the companies have been given a month to disclose the details of their ownership, strategic partners and clients across the globe. The final decision will depend on how satisfied Indian security agencies are with the companys responses.         
	Shenzhen-based Huawei and ZTE Corp have taken on global leaders such as Ericsson, Nokia Siemens Networks and Alcatel Lucent in recent years to win major contracts in both emerging and developed markets.        
	Industry players said Chinese telecom equipment was 30 per cent cheaper than that of many other foreign vendors.        
	Huawei and ZTE sold over $3-billion worth of equipment in India last year, constituting 15 per cent of their sales.        
	They plan to set up units in India and hire domestic talent to get a local identity.

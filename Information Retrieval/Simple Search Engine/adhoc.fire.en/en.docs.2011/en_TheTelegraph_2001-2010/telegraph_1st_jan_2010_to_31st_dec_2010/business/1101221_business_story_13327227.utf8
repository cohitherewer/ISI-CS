          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 20: Sajjan Jindal-controlled JSW Steel, the countrys third-largest steel maker, is in advanced discussions with the promoters of Ispat Industries to buy a controlling stake in the latter.        
	Negotiations were on till late Monday evening between the managements of the two companies on the price that JSW Steel would have to pay for the stake.        
	The JSW Steel spokesperson said no deal had been concluded on Monday and, if it did materialise, the announcement would be made in a day or two.        
	The markets expect JSW Steel to pick up a 45.5 per cent stake in Ispat Energy for a price of Rs 2,157 crore. However, no confirmation was available on this number.        
	Reports indicated that the Jindals and Pramod and Vinod Mittal, the promoters of Ispat Industries and brothers of Laxmi Mittal who heads ArcelorMittal, were working on a deal that would result in the issue of fresh equity followed by an open offer for Ispat Industries shares.        
	The markets were also expecting an announcement to be made after JSW Steels board meeting on Monday.         
	The AGM of Ispat will be in Calcutta tomorrow.         
	Tata Steel, ArcelorMittal and SAIL were in the race for debt-laden Ispat Industries.         
	Ispat has roughly Rs 6,500 crore debt on its books, and is undergoing a corporate debt restructuring programme. The company owns a blast furnace and a hot rolled coil plant with a capacity of 3 million metric tonnes near Mumbai.        
	Ispat has also been in talks with its lenders to map out ways to bring in more cash into the company to bring down its massive debt. The company has been posting losses for the past five years except in the year ended March 31, 2008.        
	Shares of Ispat Industries shot up on Monday and the scrip closed higher by 11 per cent at Rs 24.95 on speculation that the sale would be struck at Rs 36 per share. Shares of JSW Steel closed higher by 2 per cent at Rs 1,185 on the BSE.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | UTI most favoured by mutual fund investors
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      UTI most favoured by mutual fund investors

	Calcutta, Jan. 10: UTI Mutual Fund has the most number of investor accounts across its schemes.        
	At the end of December, UTI has garnered more than one crore accounts  nearly 24 lakh more than its closest competitor Reliance Mutual Fund. It accounts for 20.98 per cent of the total mutual fund folios (4,78,81,023) in the country.        
	The fund house had added 1,92,420 accounts, or folios, in December alone when most others found it difficult to attract investors or retain existing ones.         
	Data of the Association of Mutual Funds of India show investors coming in large numbers to UTI. On the other hand, Reliance Mutual Fund has lost nearly 70,000 accounts (see table).         
	Though HDFC, ICICI Prudential and some others were also able to increase their investor base in December, none could match UTIs scale.         
	In terms of assets under management, Reliance is the leader followed by HDFC, ICICI Prudential and UTI.        
	After August, acquiring new businesses has become difficult for fund houses because the market regulator has banned them from charging any entry load (from which fund houses pay agent commissions and marketing expenses) on the sale of schemes.         
	This led agents and distributors to sell more life insurance plans instead of mutual funds to get higher commissions.        
	Between September and December, the total number of mutual fund accounts have actually decreased to 4,78,81,023 from 4,79,66,254.         
	The growth in the number of accounts in UTI MF shows that we are a preferred fund house for retail investors, said chief marketing officer Jaideep Bhattacharya.         
	We are the first fund house in the country to have more than one crore investor folios, he said.        
	UTI MF was created in December 2003 when the erstwhile Unit Trust of India was dissolved and some of its assets and accounts transferred to the new entity. The fund house had inherited 82.8 lakh accounts.         
	Franklin Templeton had 8.8 lakh accounts, and ICICI and HDFC mutual funds had 6.5 lakh each.         
	While UTI MF added around 12 lakh accounts in the last six years, HDFC Mutual Fund added about 30 lakh and ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund more than 23 lakh.        
	According to Bhattacharya, the recent success in regaining investors confidence is attributable to marketing initiatives.         
	We took a special drive for systematic investment plans and in the last couple of months we added nearly two lakh investor folios, he said.         
	Besides, UTI MF already has a very wide network across rural, semi-urban and urban areas and a presence across all strata of investors from corporations and high net worth individuals to retail investors.         
	However, almost all the fund houses, including UTI, had witnessed a reduction in their assets under managements as retail investors continued to redeem their mutual funds taking advantage of a buoyant stock market.         
	Institutional investors, too, sold their investments to pay advance taxes in December.

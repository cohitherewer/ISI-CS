          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karl Slym in Calcutta on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 14: General Motors India, along with its joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industries Corporation (SAIC), will launch light commercial vehicles in India by the end of 2011, Karl Slym, president and managing director of GM India, said.         
	We will start selling LCVs by the end of next year and passenger cars and multi-utility vehicles from SAICs portfolio by 2012. The one-tonne trucks will be made at the Halol plant, which will continue to manufacture GMs current portfolio of passenger cars, too. We have a flexible production line and the Halol plant will be able to produce both the LCVs and the current passenger cars, Slym said on the sidelines of the launch of the Beat in Calcutta on Thursday.        
	The company will make additional investments at the Halol plant in Gujarat, which operates in two shifts, he added.         
	GM will develop a separate network of dealerships for its LCVs and increase its passenger car dealerships by 30 per cent this year.        
	Launching the Beat in Calcutta, Slym said, Since we have the largest number of Spark customers in the east, we have great expectations for the Beat here too.         
	A diesel Beat from the Talegaon plant near Pune will roll out in December when the powertrain facilities are ready.         
	The powertrain plant will manufacture both petrol and diesel engines which in the first phase has a capacity of 1.6 lakh that will rise to 3 lakh in the second phase, Slym said.         
	The Beat is priced at Rs 3.34 lakh for the base model and Rs 3.94 lakh for the top variant. It will cost more after 60 days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pulses support price up
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Pulses support price up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 10: The government today hiked the support price of pulses to encourage farmers to grow more, thereby bringing down the price of the commodity in the retail market.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram said, The CCEA increased the support price of arhar or tur dal more than what was recommended by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. We have increased the support by another Rs 200 to encourage farmers to sow more pulses.        
	The minimum support price (MSP) for arhar is up 23 per cent at Rs 3,000 per quintal. MSP for moong and urad have been raised 14.8 per cent and 15.08 per cent, respectively, to Rs 3,170 and Rs 2,900 per quintal, respectively.        
	India is a major importer of pulses and the sharp rise in prices is because of higher rates globally.        
	Officials said a higher procurement price was aimed at raising domestic production.         
	Last year, drought in some parts of the country added to the shortfall, which led to a spurt in imports and the consequent spike in prices.        
	Unlike paddy and wheat, the government does not directly procure pulses from farmers but intervenes if the prices fall below MSP. The government had also eased import norms to cool prices.        
	The support price for paddy (common variety) has been increased by a meagre Rs 50 to Rs 1,000 a quintal for crop year 2010-11. The rate for grade A variety will be Rs 1,030 a quintal.        
	Pushed by the prices of fruits, pulses and milk, food inflation rose for the second consecutive week to 16.74 per cent during the last week of May, prompting speculation that the Reserve Bank of India might tighten money supply at its July policy meet. Prices of pulses shot up 31 per cent, while milk was dearer by 21.1 per cent and fruits cost 18.7 per cent more.

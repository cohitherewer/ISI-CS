          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 4: Kirit Parikhs radical recommendations on fuel pricing may not fully find favour with the government, which is under fire over rising prices.        
	An indication of the governments dilemma came from junior oil minister Jitin Prasada.         
	The government will ensure that the least burden is passed on to the poor and common man... while also ensuring that the financial health of (PSU fuel retailers) is protected, the minister of state for oil and natural gas said today.        
	Prasadas senior colleague Murli Deora said the cabinet was expected to take a decision very soon, may be before the budget itself.        
	Parikh, a former Planning Commission member, in his report on sustainable fuel pricing that was submitted yesterday, had suggested freeing petrol and diesel prices and hiking cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene prices.        
	His recipe may be good news for the three state-owned oil marketing companies  oil and gas stocks did relatively well on the bourses today  but its impact on the common man is likely to make the government flinch from accepting the recommendations in their entirety.        
	To make the governments task tougher, food inflation is displaying an uptrend. It rose for the second consecutive week and stood at 17.56 per cent for the seven days ended January 23.         
	Potatoes were costlier by 44.9 per cent, the price of pulses jumped 44.4 per cent, milk prices rose 13.95 per cent and wheat costs increased 15.9 per cent.         
	We believe the suggestions are too aggressive to be implemented in their current form, given inflation concerns, implementation issues and political considerations. A one-time hike in gasoline and diesel prices is all that might happen, in our view, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note.        
	D.K. Joshi, an economist with rating agency Crisil, said, What is most likely is petrol (price going up), because petrol is perceived to be consumed by the rich classes. I think second in line would be diesel to some extent, and maybe some token increase, if at all it happens, in LPG and kerosene.        
	We believe that while there exists a possibility of deregulation of the petrol prices, chances of deregulation of diesel prices are fairly slim on account of its impact on inflation given that 15 per cent of the total diesel consumption is for agricultural purposes, Deepak Pareek, oil and gas analyst at Angel Broking, said.        
	Stock show        
	Oil scrips fared well on Parikhs recommendations. On a day when the benchmark BSE sensex crashed 271.10 points to 16224.95, with most of the sectoral indices collapsing 1-4 per cent, the BSE oil and gas index saw a marginal fall of 0.73 per cent.        
	Indian Oil Corporation ended at Rs 316.80, a gain of 0.16 per cent, while Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd rose 0.35 per cent to Rs 582.50. Hindustan Petroleum, however, fell 0.84 per cent.        
	Tata Motors and Mahindra amp; Mahindra fell in trading following the panels recommendation of additional duty on diesel vehicles.

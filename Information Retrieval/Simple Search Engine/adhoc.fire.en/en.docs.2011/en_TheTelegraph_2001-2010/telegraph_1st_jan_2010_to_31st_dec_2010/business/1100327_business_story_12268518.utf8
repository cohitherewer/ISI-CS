	New Delhi, March 26: Nissan Motor India hopes to sell one lakh units a year from 2013. The company is also planning to tie up with Ashok Leyland to manufacture small cars.         
	In the passenger car segment, we have announced plans to sell a Nissan-badged Micra and an ultra low-cost car in partnership with Renault and Bajaj. But we think there is a possibility of having another small car between these two segmentsthere is a huge potential and market for these cars, said Kiminobu Tokuyama, managing director and CEO of Nissan Motor India.         
	We are talking to a number of companies. There is a probability of a tieup with Ashok Leyland. We are very seriously considering them, he said.        
	The small car will compete with the Alto and the Estilo, said a company spokesperson.         
	However, Ashok Leyland maintained it would not like to comment on anything that was not finalised.         
	Tokuyama was speaking at the launch of the companys 10th dealership in the country. The company will increase its outlets to 82 by 2013.        
	Nissan currently imports two models and retails them in India for about Rs 21 lakh each  the X-Trail and the Teana. The company today started selling its sports car 370Z.        
	A company spokesperson said Nissan hoped to sell a total of 350 units of the X-Trail and Teana in 2009-10.        
	Tokuyama said its alliance with Renault was yet to sign an agreement with Bajaj Auto for producing an ultra low-cost car, over four months after announcing the broad roles of partners in the project.        
	In November last year, Renault-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn had said that the alliance would be responsible for selling and marketing the ultra low-cost car, while Bajaj Auto would design, develop and manufacture the car.        
	The details of the small car project with Bajaj will be announced in due course of time...we have announced that the car will be launched sometime in 2012, said Tokuyama.

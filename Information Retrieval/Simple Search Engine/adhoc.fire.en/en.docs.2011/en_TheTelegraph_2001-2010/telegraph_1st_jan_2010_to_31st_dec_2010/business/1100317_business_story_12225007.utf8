	Calcutta, March 16: NYSE-listed Genpact Ltd will handle the IT operations of Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Ltd (BAPL).        
	According to the terms of the agreement signed today, Genpact will provide the services for five years to all BAPLs projects in India.         
	Besides the proposed Rs 10,000-crore Aerotropolis project at Andal in Burdwan, BAPL is setting up an airport city in Ludhiana.         
	The Bengal project is expected to be operational by 2011-12. Changi Airports International of Singapore has taken a 26 per cent stake in BAPL.        
	The functionality of our solution, which involves the design and implementation of a financial and land management SaaS (software as service) based business platform for BAPL will enable a faster time-to-market and lower maintenance costs. This would help BAPL to effectively manage its operations and focus on its core business, Harpreet Duggal, senior vice-president and head of Genpacts India business, said.         
	Genpact will also develop a pay-as-you-go business platform based on Oracles R12 that will provide BAPL with land management, sourcing and financial management functionalities.         
	We believe that Genpacts business process and IT expertise will allow us to focus on our core business and also give us the flexibility to rapidly scale up our operations, Subrata Paul, chief executive officer of BAPL, said.

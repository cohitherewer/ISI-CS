          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 24: Calcutta High Court today allowed Birla Corporation to go ahead with its annual general meeting, which was stalled yesterday following a district court order.        
	Justice Prasenjit Mandal set aside the order of Alipore Court judge Kalpana Dey and directed that Birla Corporation was free to hold its AGM for 2010 as required under the Companies Act.        
	Shareholder Prabhat Kumar Sureka had obtained a stay on the AGM on June 22.        
	The annual general meeting is now scheduled to be held on June 29 provided no fresh legal surprises spring up in the meantime.        
	According to Justice Mandal, an AGM is held after observing several formalities. It cannot be stayed in the manner as passed by the learned district judge, Justice Mandal observed in his order.        
	Birla Corporation is under Harsh V Lodhas control.        
	Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm for the Lodhas, said Birla Corps application to the high court against the lower court order mentioned that the order was based on suppression of facts, mala fide, in abuse of process of court and by practising fraud on court.        
	Debanjan Mandal, partner of Fox amp; Mandal, said: Todays order is a vindication of the clients stand. The obstruction to the AGM has been removed and the company hopes to hold its AGM as scheduled.        
	Birla Corporation in a statement said it was shown in the high court by its counsel that Sureka was the son of a director of a few Birla firms. He and his father Dewki Prasad were consenting shareholders in the petition filed against the company by the Birla Education Trust at the Company Law Board (CLB), indicating that Sureka acted on behalf of the Birlas.        
	Birla Corporation said the Trust had challenged the CLB order that did not stay the AGM.        
	However, Niloy Pyne, partner of Amarchand Mangaldas, the solicitor firm for the Birla Education Trust, said: The appellants (Trust) in the said proceedings have no connection whatsoever with the Alipore Court proceedings initiated by one Prabhat Sureka, which he has done according to his wisdom. We never had any knowledge of such proceedings and are in no manner connected with those proceedings.

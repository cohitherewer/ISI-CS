          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 12: Bankers believe their net interest margins are likely to remain stable in the coming months even after jacking up deposit rates, soothing investors who have been selling bank stocks over concerns on margins.        
	Net interest margin (NIM) is the difference between the cost of funds and the interest earned on funds.         
	Recently many banks had hiked their deposit rates anywhere between 15 basis points and 150 basis points, leading to worries on their inability to completely pass on the higher costs, while banking stocks took a beating.         
	Banks have been forced to raise lending rates as liquidity is tight and deposit mobilisation has been falling behind loan growth. Though the BSE Bankex closed higher on Friday because of better-than-expected industrial output numbers, the index dropped 7.5 per cent during the week compared with the sensex, which fell 2.3 per cent.         
	Among the banking stocks, the State Bank of India (SBI) lost 11 per cent during the week, HDFC Bank 7 per cent, Punjab National Bank 6.5 per cent, ICICI Bank 5.5 per cent and Axis Bank nearly 6 per cent.        
	However, bankers are of the view that the margin picture continues to remain positive. There may be some moderation in NIMs because of the deposit rate hikes, but it may be of a few basis points. Overall, margins are likely to be maintained around the current levels over the next few months, says a senior official from a leading private bank, which recently jacked its deposit rates.        
	Rupe Rege Nitsure, chief economist at the Bank of Baroda, said margins would not be affected sharply because banks had raised their lending rates too. Already few banks have started raising their interest rates. Over the next few days we may see more banks doing so. While the impact of a deposit rate hike comes with a lag, the effect of an increase in lending rates is almost instantaneous. Punjab National Bank, Development Credit Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have raised their lending rates.        
	Saday Sinha, banking analyst at Kotak Securities, said though banks were likely to witness some compression in their margins, the impact would vary across the sector. He said banks with a relatively lower share of current and saving accounts deposits to their total deposits would be impacted.

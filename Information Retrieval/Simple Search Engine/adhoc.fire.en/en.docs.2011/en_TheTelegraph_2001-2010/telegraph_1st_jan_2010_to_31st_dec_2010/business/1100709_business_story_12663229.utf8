          A STAFF REPORTER                          Game for more                                  
	Calcutta, July 8: Kishore Chhabria-promoted Allied Blenders amp; Distillers plans to enter the premium whisky segment by the end of this year.        
	We are planning to launch at least one whisky brand in the premium range in the next six to eight months, director (sales amp; marketing) Roopak Chaturvedi said.         
	The company plans to introduce three to four brands of whiskies and vodkas over the next two years. The companys flagship brand Officers Choice contributes over 85 per cent to volume sales and is growing at over 30 per cent annually. Last year, we sold 12 million cases and the target is to cross 15 million cases this year, he said.         
	Earlier this month, the company entered the premium dark rum segment with Jolly Roger. Last year, total sales stood at 12.5 million cases.         
	The company is considering offloading 5-10 per cent equity to private equity funds followed by an IPO in the middle of 2011. It is in talks with three to four foreign PE firms.         
	Allied has firmed up plans to set up a 100-kilo-litre-per-day distillery in Bengal at an investment of Rs 120 crore. However, it is yet to get the licence and arrange funds. It has applied for the licence nine months back, and the government has offered 50 acres in Haldia for the distillery. It also plans to set up a bottling plant and a distillery is Andhra Pradesh.        
	Allied Blenders amp; Distillers needs around Rs 250 crore for expansion, which include setting up of bottling plants, distilleries and rolling out new brands.         
	It plans to raise nearly Rs 50 crore from PE funds. At present, the company has 31 bottling units across the country, of which three are company-owned.         
	Ideally 40 per cent of our bottling plants should be company-owned, while the remaining 60 per cent outsourced. We hope to reach there over the next five years, the company said.        
	The company targets to expand business by 25-30 per cent annually.

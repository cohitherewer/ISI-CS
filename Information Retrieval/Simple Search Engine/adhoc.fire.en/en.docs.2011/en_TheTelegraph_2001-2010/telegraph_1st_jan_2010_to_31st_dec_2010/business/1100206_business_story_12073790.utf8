The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL sniffs Value in Canada
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RIL sniffs Value in Canada
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 5: Reliance Industries has submitted a $2-billion expression of interest for troubled Canadian oil sands lease holder Value Creation Inc (VCI), less than a month after submitting a revised offer for bankrupt Dutch chemicals company LyondellBasell.        
	In its pursuit of global assets that have been facing rough weather, the Mukesh Ambani company has approached privately held Alberta-based Value Creation Inc in the last fortnight, sources said.         
	Commenting on the potential deal, a Reliance spokesperson said, We are looking at global assets on an ongoing basis, while clarifying that talks may not necessarily result in a transaction.        
	Oil and gas experts said that VCI would offer Reliance access to a vast acreage of oil sands and earth as well as the necessary technology to extract oil from this non-conventional source.         
	Extraction of oil from oil sands is extremely viable in high oil price scenarios. This type of terrain is not found in India whereas countries like Canada have large areas of sand and earth from which oil can be extracted, said a director with a leading consultancy.        
	VCI, on its part, is facing troubled times at home. A VCI subsidiary BA Energy Inc  where it is the majority shareholder  had approached bankruptcy courts last year as it was finding it difficult to repay a loan to the parent.         
	Lenders are also putting pressure on VCI. The Canadian company is keen to settle with its lenders and therefore is in talks with potential buyers, said a source close to the development.        
	Early last year, Canadian oil and gas companies were struggling for survival as global recession took a toll and oil prices collapsed.        
	RIL is still in the race for LyondellBasell, one of the largest chemical companies in the world, and has reportedly put in a $13.5-billion non-binding offer for the latter.         
	Its next move will be determined in April. A US bankruptcy court has given the existing management of Lyondell exclusive rights to present a reorganisation plan by then.         
	RIL has sold treasury stock in three tranches over the past few months to raise over $2 billion that will add to its kitty of cash and cash equivalents to make overseas acquisitions.         
	The Mukesh Ambani flagship has reported a 15.8 per cent higher net profit at Rs 4,008 crore in the third quarter ended December 31. It had reported a net profit of Rs 3,462 crore in the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected RIL to post net profit in the region of Rs 3,500 crore to Rs 3,900 crore. Turnover during the period spurted nearly 93 per cent to Rs 58,848 crore over Rs 30,537 crore in the same period last year.        
	The companys scrip plummeted nearly 4 per cent today on the Bombay Stock Exchange to close at Rs 981.30.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | China sale to fetch 4.3bn
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      China sale to fetch 4.3bn

	London, Sept. 8 (Agencies): Vodafone today said it would offload its entire 3.2 per cent shareholding in China Mobile Ltd, a divestment that will fetch the British telecom major about 4.3 billion.        
	In a statement, Vodafone said a major chunk of the proceeds from the stake sale would be returned to the companys shareholders by way of a share buyback.        
	There have been reports of the British entity looking to sell its minority shareholding in many countries. Vodafone has minority stakes in its operations in Poland and France, among other countries.        
	The British entity will sell its 3.2 per cent stake in China Mobile, but both companies will continue with their commercial and technology co-operation. Vodafones 3.2 per cent shareholding amounts to 642,868,587 shares.        
	Vodafone expects the cash consideration to be approximately 4.3 billion before tax and transaction costs, the statement noted.        
	According to Vodafone, 70 per cent of the deal proceeds will be utilised for a share buyback, while the remaining amount will be used to reduce the groups net debt.        
	In 2000, Vodafone had bought a 2.18 per cent stake in China Mobile and two years later, the shareholding was increased to 3.2 per cent.        
	Todays transaction achieves a near doubling of Vodafones original investment in China Mobile and combines our stated portfolio strategy with ongoing co-operation with Chinas leading telecommunications company, Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao said.        
	Both companies will continue this co-operation in areas such as roaming, network road map development, multinational customers and green technology, Vodafone added.        
	China Mobile shares fell as much as 4.1 per cent and closed down 3.8 per cent, its biggest single day drop in more than a year. But analysts expect the stake sale to have no major impact on the Chinese firm. We see a short-term impact on the stock but in the longer term it removes the overhang, said Kelvin Ho, an analyst at Yuanta Securities.

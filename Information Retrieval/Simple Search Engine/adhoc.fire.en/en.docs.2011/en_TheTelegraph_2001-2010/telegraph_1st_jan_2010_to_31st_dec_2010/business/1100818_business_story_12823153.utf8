	Calcutta, Aug. 17: At least six industry associations today demanded immediate relief from the state government against a steep hike in power tariff, which may force many units in Howrah and Hooghly to down shutters.         
	The net effective power tariff for industrial users (at 33 kv lines) in West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltds (WBSEDCL) operational area has been increased 42 per cent to Rs 5.67 per unit in 2010-11. This is the highest hike in the history of the power sector in the country. Small industrial units cannot absorb such a hike and may have to close down soon if the government doesnt intervene, said Sandeep Poddar, president of the Hooghly Chamber of Commerce and Industries. We had met state power minister Nirupam Sen a week ago and sought the governments support in the form of a subsidy but the government has not yet done anything, he said.        
	According to Poddar, in WBSEDCLs operational area there are about 25,000 industrial units consuming about 2,500 million units. The average electricity bill vary between Rs 50,000 and Rs 2 lakh per month. Till 2010-11, the hike in effective unit charges used to be in the range of 20-30 paise per unit. If the government gives a subsidy of Re 1 per unit to users, it will cost the government Rs 250 crore. The government gets Rs 960 crore from WBSEDCL as profit, Poddar said.        
	According to P.K. Patodia of Eastern India Textile Mills Association, five power utilities  WBSEDCL, CESC, the Damodar Valley Corporation (DPC), Durgapur Projects Ltd and Dishergarh Power Supply Company Ltd  have different tariffs. Among these, WBSEDCL, DPL and the DVC cater to industrial users. WBSEDCL has always charged a little more, but the difference has widened after the rate revision.         
	The production cost of a mini steel ingot plant in WBSEDCLs area will go up by Rs 1,600 per tonne compared with non-WBSEDCL areas. Even after factoring in the transport cost of Rs 200-300 per tonne, manufacturers in Howrah and Hooghly will be unable to compete with those in the DPL and DVC areas, Poddar said.         
	The net effective power tariff per unit (industrial use) stands at Rs 5.67 for WBSEDCL, Rs 3.51 for DPL and Rs 2.94 for the DVC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Auction spells Raja doom

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 15: Telecom minister A. Rajas exit is perhaps the result of a stand that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took three years back on auctions being the best way of selling scarce resources.         
	Singh has long been in favour of auctioning scarce resources such as spectrum (air waves that carry mobile calls).         
	On November 2, 2007, Singh wrote a letter to Raja, which said, In order that spectrum use efficiency gets directly linked with correct pricing of spectrum, consider (i) introduction of a transparent methodology of auction, wherever legally and technically feasible, and (ii) revision of entry fee, which is currently benchmarked on old spectrum auction figures.        
	The implication of the advice was obvious  do not go ahead with your plans to sell licences based on prices fixed some six years back; auction them to the highest bidder in a transparent way.        
	Sources in the PMO said Singhs views were influenced by Paul Klemperers telecom spectrum auction model.        
	Klemperer, who teaches at Nuffield College, Oxford, where Singh studied for his doctorate in economics, designed a successful auction process in 2000 that eliminated any possibility of bidders colluding to keep prices down. This earned UK a whopping 22.5 billion from the auction of 3G spectrum.         
	Since then, Klemperer has been advising formally and informally many a government on how to go about using his theory in fields as diverse as spectrum to treasury bill sales.        
	Raja chose not to take the Prime Ministers advice. He sent a convoluted reply in officialese and then went silent on the entire issue.         
	He later sold pan-India licences in January 2008 to nine firms, many of them newcomers, at 2001 rates on a first come, first served basis for Rs 1,658 crore along with 4.4Mhz start-up spectrum.         
	The money raised from the arbitrary sales was a mere Rs 8,987 crore. The licensees later sold their stakes at a huge premium to others. Unitech sold a 67 per cent stake to Norways Telenor for Rs 6,000 crore, while Swan Telecom sold 45 per cent of its shares to Etisalat of the United Arab Emirates for Rs 4,100 crore.        
	However, Singh set his foot down during the 3G spectrum sale, and with the help of finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who heads the group of ministers on telecom, forced Raja to accept the auction route for 3G licences.         
	The methodology followed closely resembled Klemperers format for the British telecom auction, said finance ministry officials.         
	The finance ministry earned an unprecedented Rs 67,000 crore from the auctions. Based on the revenue generated from the 3G auctions, a 45-page CAG report estimates total losses to the exchequer from 2G spectrum sale to be Rs 1,76,379 crore.

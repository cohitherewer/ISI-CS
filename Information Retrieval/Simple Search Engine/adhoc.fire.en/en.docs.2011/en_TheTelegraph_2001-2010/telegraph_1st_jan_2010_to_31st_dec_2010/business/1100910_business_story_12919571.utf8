The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Orissa to limit land for firms
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Orissa to limit land for firms
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 9: The Orissa government has asked private investors, especially in metal and energy, to cut down on their demand for large areas of land.        
	The state had asked consultants Mecon and Dastur to assess the land requirements of metal companies. Based on their report, the government told steel majors such as ArcelorMittal, Posco and Tata Steel to come up with a revised land use plan within six months.         
	Orissa wants industry to leverage technology and limit land use.        
	The disclosure comes on a day UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi called for a balanced approach to acquisition by avoiding fertile land.        
	C.J. Venugopal, chairman and managing director of Industrial Promotion amp; Investment Corporation of Orissa Ltd (Ipicol), said companies had six months to come up with a new plan.         
	Everyone will have to comply. It will include those who have asked for land and also those who have got them partially or in full, Venugopal said.        
	ArcelorMittal wants 7,750 acres for its proposed 12-million-tonne plant, while Posco is demanding around 4,000 acres for a unit of the same capacity. Tata Steel requires about 2,000 acres for a 6-million-tonne unit.         
	Tatas have managed to get a part of the land, but the other two are yet to make any headway.         
	Venugopal said the Orissa government could even take back land if the companies had acquired more than they needed.        
	We have done that already in some cases. We dont want to take up legacy issue such as the Rourkela Steel Plant, which has huge tracts of unused land, but the rest have to comply, he said.        
	According to a study by Ernst amp; Young, Orissa has signed 49 agreements in steel alone.        
	Venugopal said the government had employed the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) to carry out a land study in power. Earlier, investors used to set up units of 250 mega watt (mw) each. Now 660mw plants are becoming regular. They now need less land. Consequently, the requirement should come down, he said.        
	Bengal has also constituted an expert committee to examine the demands made by investors for natural resources such as land, mines and water.         
	While the state has initiated a discussion with investors to bring down land demand, it has not taken back land.        
	The Orissa move comes amid perceptions about companies seeking land much more than their requirements. As a result, very little progress has been made on the ground.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gas crunch scuppers Tata plan
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Gas crunch scuppers Tata plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukundan: Disappointed                                   
	New Delhi, Nov. 22: Tata Chemicals has put on hold the Rs 3,800-crore expansion of its urea manufacturing unit at Babrala, Uttar Pradesh, because of the non-availability of gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	We have been waiting for the gas allocation for our second phase of urea expansion plan at Babrala unit, which was scheduled for October-November this year. As we have not received gas, we are holding our plans, managing director R. Mukundan said.        
	An empowered group of ministers headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee was slated to meet early this month to discuss the KG gas allocation, but the meeting was postponed and a new date was yet to be worked out.        
	We will be completing the first phase by the end of this month. We are awaiting an additional 2.2mBtu (million British thermal unit) gas allocation for the second phase of expansion, he said. The proposed expansion at Babrala would have raised the annual urea capacity by 1.2 million tonnes.        
	Without KG gas, we will not be able to raise debt as it is the precondition from our debtors. Imported LNG (liquefied natural gas) will put financial pressure on the plant and will make it economically unviable, he said. The Babrala second phase would take 18 months.        
	Reliance is expected to produce 80mmscmd (million metric standard cubic metres per day) of gas at its KG fields by 2013. It produces about 57-58 mmscmd as opposed to 64 mmscmd allocated by the government to urea manufacturing units, power plants, LPG units, city gas projects, steel plants and refineries.        
	ONGC is expected to produce around 9mmscmd more gas in 2011-12. Another 8mmscmd is expected from GSPCs KG fields in 2012-13.        
	Fertiliser launch        
	Tata Chemicals today launched fertiliser Paras Farmoola, which was designed to contain macro and micro nutrients based on the requirements of a specific region and required a comprehensive land survey.

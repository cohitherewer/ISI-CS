          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 24: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will invest $1.3 billion to acquire a 45 per cent interest in US-based Pioneer Natural Resources shale gas assets in south Texas.        
	The deal, inked today, is expected to close next week and will give Reliance Eagleford Upstream LP  an RIL subsidiary  access to around 1,18,000 acres in Eagle Ford Shale.        
	RIL executive director P.M.S. Prasad said, Reliance is pleased to establish a long-term partnership with Pioneer. This transaction represents another significant milestone in Reliances efforts to grow its North American shale gas operations.        
	This is RILs second transaction in shale gas this year. Earlier, it had formed a joint venture with US-based Atlas Energy.        
	The deal with Pioneer will involve an upfront cash payment of $263 million and deferred payments of $1.052 billion, said an RIL statement.         
	Pioneer and Newpek LCC, Pioneers current partners in Eagle Ford, will hand over 45 per cent of their respective interests in the region to Reliance.         
	After the deal, Pioneer, Reliance and Newpek will hold 46 per cent, 45 per cent and 9 per cent interest, respectively.         
	RIL said Pioneer expected the property with a 10 trillion cubic feet of resource potential to support the drilling of over 1,750 wells.        
	Under the joint venture agreement, Pioneer will continue to acquire leasehold in Eagle Ford, while Reliance will have the option of taking a 45 per cent share in a fresh acreage that is acquired.         
	Reliance and Pioneer are also forming a midstream joint venture that will service the gathering needs of the upstream joint venture. Reliance Eagleford will pay $46 million for a 49.9 per cent stake in this venture, RIL added.        
	RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani is betting on shale gas as the energy source of the future that is likely to overtake both conventional gas and liquid fuel.        
	The Reliance scrip closed 0.69 per cent lower at Rs 1,015.30 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

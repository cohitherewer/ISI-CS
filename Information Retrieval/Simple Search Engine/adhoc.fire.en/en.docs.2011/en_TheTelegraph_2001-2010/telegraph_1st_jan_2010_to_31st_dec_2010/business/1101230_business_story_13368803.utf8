          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Message pending                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: Telemarketing calls and text messages, supposed to stop from January 1, will continue to bother mobile and landline customers well into the next year.         
	Industry players said the lack of technical upgradation by operators and lobbying by telemarketing firms were likely to push the actual execution by at least six to eight months.         
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has extended the first official deadline for imposing curbs on pesky calls by a month till February 1.        
	We have a strong Rs 11,000-crore a year telemarketing industry, which is resisting the new rules imposed by the regulator. Moreover, operators have said they need another four to six months to upgrade and install equipment to implement the new system. Under such circumstances, delays are inevitable, an industry player said.        
	Trai and the department of telecom (DoT) have so far been unsuccessful in stopping pesky calls.         
	The earlier system of registering to a do not call list was not effective because of complications in the registering process and other glitches.         
	The new set of rules have got embroiled in technical flaws and regulatory hurdles.        
	Trai and the DoT are at loggerheads over who has the authority to register telemarketing firms.         
	While Trai, under the new rules, has made it mandatory for all telemarketeers to register themselves with the regulator, the DoT maintains it is the licensors function.         
	Analysts contend that besides implementing the new rules, a stronger data privacy policy is required as the sale of mobile phone numbers to telemarketing firms is the root cause behind millions of spam text messages and calls.        
	On December 1, Trai had come out with new rules, supposed to be effective from January 1, to ban pesky calls.        
	Under the new rules, a customer can dial or send an SMS to toll-free number 1909 and choose to block all calls and messages, or get select messages from any of the seven categories  banking/credit cards, real estate, education, health, consumer goods/auto, entertainment, and tourism.        
	The new rules also state that telemarketeers will be issued a distinct numbering series starting with 70 to help users spot calls.         
	Moreover, they will not be allowed to send any commercial communication between 9.00pm and 9.00am.        
	Trai will impose a penalty of up to Rs 2.5 lakh on errant firms. Earlier, it was Rs 500-1,000.         
	The regulator has asked operators to install softwares to track violations by telemarketing firms that have multiple connections from different service providers.        
	Rajan S. Mathew, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, had recently said the operators had approached Trai for more time to comply with the security concerns and to set up the infrastructure to filter unsolicited calls.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Charged up                                  
	New Delhi, March 16: State-owned Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFC) is keen on picking up as much as 26 per cent equity in power projects.        
	Right now we are working on a policy to pick up equity stakes in power (generation) projects. We will prepare a framework and any company which fits the criteria will be approached, chairman and managing director Satnam Singh said. PFC arranges funds for power projects.        
	It has set a target of sanctioning loans worth Rs 68,000 crore to various generation, transmission and distribution projects in the country during 2010-11.         
	PFC will disburse loans worth Rs 29,000 crore during the same period.         
	Loans sanctioned by the company during the current fiscal, so far, amount to Rs 60,000 crore, of which Rs 20,000 crore have been disbursed.         
	The disbursement target for this fiscal is slightly higher at Rs 23,000 crore, which the company hopes to achieve even though the fiscal is coming to an end.         
	The (financial) year is yet to get over. We would be able to meet our (disbursement) target, Singh said.        
	PFC will raise $300 million (Rs 1,400 crore) from the State Bank of Indias London branch under the external commercial borrowing route.        
	The company has received the Reserve Bank of Indias approval, which will expire on March 31.

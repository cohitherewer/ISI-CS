	New Delhi, July 3: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today inaugurated the new terminal T3  the fifth largest in the world  that will double capacity at New Delhi airport and ease travel to the worlds second-most populous country.        
	A good airport will signal the arrival of a new India, said Singh, adding that regulatory and policy framework needed to be aligned with requirements of the civil aviation industry to encourage serious investment in a sector that could absorb up to $120 billion by 2020.        
	We need to create safe, secure, efficient and environment-friendly systems conducive to healthy growth of the civil aviation sector, Singh said.        
	The state-of-the-art hub, which cost nearly $3 billion, was built in just 37 months well in advance of the New Delhi Commonwealth Games in October.         
	Spread over 5.4 million square feet, T3 has 78 gates, 97 automated walkways, 95 immigration counters, 20,000 square metres (215,000 square feet) of retail space and parking for 4,300 cars.         
	The facility, which will begin handling international flights on July 14, will boost the airports total capacity to 60 million passengers a year. Domestic flights will start from the month end.        
	The new terminal can cater to 34 million passengers annually. It also promises to redefine air travel in India and boasts of an in-line baggage handling system with a capacity to handle 12,800 bags per hour.        
	The facility will be run by a group backed by Bangalore-based GMR, state-run Airports Authority of India, Frankfurt-based Fraport and Malaysia Airports Holdings.        
	Delhis Terminal 3 and another planned in Mumbai are part of an infrastructure push designed to attract overseas investment and support travel demand.         
	The new terminal in Mumbai is due in 2012. The government has also approved plans for the construction of seven more airports.        
	Domestic carriers need to take advantage of the new terminal to develop New Delhi as a hub for both domestic and international travel, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.        
	The ministry of civil aviation will pursue other government departments and state administrations to lower taxes on aviation turbine fuel and ease transit visa rules to facilitate development of Delhi as a hub, Patel added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Export growth maintains momentum
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Export growth maintains momentum
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Exports are estimated to have grown  for the third month running  by about 8 per cent to $14 billion in January, prompting the government to hint at the withdrawal of some of the stimulus measures.        
	In January, I expect exports to be $14 billion, a growth of about 8 per cent, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said.        
	You (industry) should be ready for some cutback, he said, indicating that finance minister Pranab Mukherjee could announce the rollback of certain stimulus measures provided to exporters.        
	Exports, which came under pressure after October 2008, had been a shade lower than $13 billion in January 2009. After contracting for 13 months, exports started recovering from November.        
	However, because of a sharp decline till October, the April-December shipments showed a contraction of about 20 per cent to $117.6 billion from $147.6 billion a year ago. Official data for January are yet to be released.        
	Officials said the positive signal had instilled hope about exports touching $165-175 billion this fiscal. This would be, however, lower than last fiscals revised figure of $185 billion.        
	Commerce minister Anand Sharma said stimulus should be withdrawn cautiously and in a calibrated manner as exports of certain items were yet to pick up.         
	We can consider withdrawal of stimulus in (export) sectors that have seen robust growth. While exports have recovered, the revival is not uniform. Some sectors such as engineering, leather and textile are still facing tough terrain in the US and Europe. We are not for an abrupt withdrawal, Sharma said.        
	Trade ministry plea        
	The trade ministry has asked the finance ministry to continue providing incentives till exports recovered completely, minister of state for commerce and industry Jyotiraditya Scindia said in Calcutta.         
	We have requested the finance minister for cheaper dollar credit at 1 per cent over Libor (London inter-bank offered rate), against 3.5 per cent, he said.         
	The commerce ministry has also requested the extension of the interest rate subvention scheme.         
	Specifically we have looked at three to four areas in terms of getting cheaper dollar credit for exporters, extending the export oriented units benefits and the interest subvention scheme, he said.         
	Tax reforms        
	The government may announce measures on tax reforms, divestment in PSUs and infrastructure investments, besides stepping up efforts for fiscal consolidation in the upcoming budget, Stephen S. Roach, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, said in Mumbai.

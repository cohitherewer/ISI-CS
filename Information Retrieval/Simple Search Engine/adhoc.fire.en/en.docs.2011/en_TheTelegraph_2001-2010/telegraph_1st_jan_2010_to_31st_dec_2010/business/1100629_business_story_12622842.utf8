          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 28: Reliance Industries today made its seventh oil discovery in Gujarats         
	Cambay basin, that increases the potential of these exploratory blocks.         
	The current flow is 410 barrels of oil per day. The potential commercial interest of the discovery is being determined, RIL said in a statement.        
	The block was awarded to the company under the fifth round of the New Exploration and Licensing Policy. Earlier this month, RIL had made the sixth oil discovery in the basin.        
	The discovery is significant, as it is expected to open more oil pool areas leading to better hydrocarbon potential within the block. RIL, as the operator, holds 100 per cent participating interest in the block and is continuing further exploratory drilling efforts, the company said.        
	The block covers an area of 635 sq km in two parts. Of the 17 exploratory wells drilled by RIL so far, 13 are located in Part A and the remaining four in Part B of the block. This discovery, named Dhirubhai50, has been notified to the government and to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, the statement added.        
	Last year, RIL had started pumping gas from its block in the Krishna Godavari basin, where it made the countrys largest gas find.

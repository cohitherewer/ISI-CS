	Mumbai, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Toyota Kirloskar Motors, the Indian unit of Toyota Motor Corp, expects to double its sales in the next five to seven years, powered by its Etios cars that will be launched at the end of this year, the units managing director Hiroshi Nakagawa said.         
	He also said Toyotas recent recall of 7.5 million cars had absolutely no link to India, where it had not recalled any of its cars.         
	The Etios is a compact car, developed by Toyota specifically for India. It was showcased at the Delhi Auto Expo last month.         
	In 2010, the company expects its sales to grow more than 15 per cent from 2009, when it had sold 55,497 cars.        
	For us to become a significant player in the volume market segment, we need at least 10 per cent market share and we expect to achieve that in the next five to seven years, Nakagawa said.         
	Toyota has a 3 per cent share of the local automobile market, and sells brands such as the Innova, Fortuner, Corolla Altis and the Camry.

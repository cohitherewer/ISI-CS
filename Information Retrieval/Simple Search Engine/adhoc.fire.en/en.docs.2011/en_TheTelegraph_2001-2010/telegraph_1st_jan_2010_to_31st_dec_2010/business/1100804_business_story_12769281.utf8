	Calcutta, Aug. 3: Aditya Birla Minacs, the BPO arm of the AV Birla group, is keen to set up a facility in Latin America to serve its US clients. The US contributes around 65 per cent to the companys total revenues.        
	We have already shortlisted three locations in the region, and our 26-member team is undertaking locational studies. It (the facility) will primarily cater to our US clients and most of it will be voice (solutions), Milind Godbole, president (Asia pacific) of Aditya Birla Minacs, said here today.        
	The firm was looking for countries that could provide better voice solutions to suit client requirements in the US, he said. He refused to divulge any more details on the proposed investment.         
	The company also plans to expand its operations in the Philippines this fiscal.

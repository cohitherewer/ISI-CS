          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 1: An uncharacteristic glitch stalled trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange for close to two-and- a- half hours today.        
	Trading on the BSE was halted on a day investor sentiment was bullish, buoyed by positive overseas cues and a steady stream of good corporate results.        
	Brokers complained about the technical glitch in the morning when they saw that trades executed on the BSE Online Trading System (BOLT) were not being confirmed after being punched in.        
	After the market opened at 9.15am today, it was observed that trade confirmations were not being received by members using the BOLT. The problem was because of technical difficulties faced in the trading system, the BSE said in a statement.        
	To identify and resolve the technical issue, the BSE decided to temporarily halt the market between 10.45am and 10.55am. However, the problem persisted and the timing was extended. Trading was halted from 12pm to 1pm, initially. This was subsequently extended to 1.30pm and eventually to 2.30pm.        
	According to the BSE, engineers who worked to resolve the issue since 9.15am were able to identify and resolve it at around 1.20pm.        
	The exchange added that a decision was taken to resume the normal trading session at 2.30pm to provide sufficient time to members to log in and download their order and trade positions to facilitate providing information to the customers and taking appropriate action later on.        
	When the market reopened for trading at 2:30pm, the sensex spiked to 20600  a sudden 200-point vault from its last traded level and 400 points from the days open  but tumbled soon thereafter. The sensex closed up 323.29 points at 20355.63 points.        
	The broad-based Nifty of the NSE finished the day nearly 100 points higher at 6117.55.        
	While the BOLT system was launched in 1995, it has been developed by CMC Ltd, which provides the maintenance, operations and continual development support since the beginning. The BOLT handles more than 2.5 million trades every trading day and more than 18 million orders per trading day.        
	On January 22, 2008 trading was halted on the BSE because of technical issues in its derivatives segment.        
	The stoppage evoked mixed reactions among marketmen. A market participant, who did not wish to be identified, said the BSEs image had taken a beating and that players could shift to the NSE. Others just shrugged off the incident saying that glitches could occur anytime.        
	It was good that the BSE halted trading as it was leading to a lot of confusion. Technical glitches can happen anywhere, said one broker.

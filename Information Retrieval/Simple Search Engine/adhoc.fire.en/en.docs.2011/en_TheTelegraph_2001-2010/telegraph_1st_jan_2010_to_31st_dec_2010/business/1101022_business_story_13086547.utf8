          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 21: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) beat Street estimates by reporting a 32 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 2,169 crore in the second quarter of 2010-11 compared with Rs 1,642 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.         
	Net profit for the quarter ended September 30 was 14 per cent higher than that in the first quarter of this fiscal.         
	Analysts had expected profit to rise between 6 per cent and 10 per cent sequentially in this quarter.         
	Revenues crossed the $2-billion-mark in the quarter, rising 25 per cent to Rs 9,286 crore. Revenues were 13 per cent higher on a quarter-on-quarter basis.         
	It was a quarter of superior performance across the board, driven by volume growth of over 11 per cent. In uncertain economic conditions, our results are a milestone on the path to strong demand recovery, N. Chandrasekaran, chief executive officer and managing director of TCS, said.         
	TCS hired 30,000 employees in the first half of 2010-11. It expects the hiring target for the year to exceed 50,000. At the end of the second quarter, total employee strength was 1,74,417.         
	We have had the highest quarterly gross and net addition of employees in the companys history and given the recovery in business demand, we will exceed the hiring target for this fiscal, said Ajoy Mukherjee, head of global human resources of TCS.         
	The attrition rate stood at 14.1 per cent, while utilisation was 83.8 per cent (excluding trainees).         
	Chandrasekaran said the company had outperformed on parameters such as volume growth, revenue growth, operating profits and margins. Key markets for the company grew in double digits, including Europe, while its North America revenues crossed $1 billion. TCS added 30 customers and bagged eight major deals.         
	The TCS scrip closed at Rs 983.85 on the BSE, up 2.03 per cent from its previous close of Rs 964.30.

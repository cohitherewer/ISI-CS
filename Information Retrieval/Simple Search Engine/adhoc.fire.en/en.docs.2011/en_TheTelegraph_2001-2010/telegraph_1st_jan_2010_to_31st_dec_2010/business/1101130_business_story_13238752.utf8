          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Telecom minister Kapil Sibal (left) with deputy Sachin Pilot in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                         
	New Delhi, Nov. 29: The government today decided to crack down on a bunch of corporate carpetbaggers who cornered telecom licences through an unfair selection process in January 2008 and then failed to meet rollout obligations.        
	Telecom minister Kapil Sibal said his ministry had decided to send out showcause notices to 85 licensees who failed to meet the minimum eligibility criteria to offer telecom services.         
	Another set of showcause notices will go out to 119 licensees  81 of these received the licences in Andimuthu Rajas infamous mela in January 2008 and are also on the list of 85 who did not meet the eligibility criteria  who failed to roll out telecom services in terms of the obligations outlined in the licences.        
	In a single day  January 10, 2008  Raja had issued 121 licences to 16 companies.         
	Sibal said the showcause notices were being issued after an independent inquiry by his ministry.        
	The comptroller and auditor generals report on November 16 had sparked off a storm and led to Rajas unceremonious exit from the telecom ministry.         
	Thirty-eight other licensees, who were granted approvals in 2006, were also being pulled up for their tardiness.        
	Sibal said the case of Swan Telecom  an entity that had the most opaque shareholding pattern  had been lobbed to the ministry of corporate affairs which would look deeper into its antecedents.        
	The CAG report had said Swan Telecom (now renamed as Etisalat DB Telecom) that submitted its first application in March 2007  long before the mad scramble in September 2007  was originally a front for Anil Ambanis Reliance Telecom. Anil Ambani disappeared from its list of shareholders by December 2007 when a motley group of shareholders led by a Mumbai-based realty group called DB Realty appeared on the scene.        
	A spokesperson for Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications said that we welcome the MoCs statement on referring the capital structure and ownership of Swan Telecom for independent examination by the MCA (ministry of corporate affairs).        
	Sibal said the 85 licensees had stumbled at the very first corporate governance hurdle: their shareholders had not approved resolutions permitting the companies foray into telecom.         
	The telecom minister said a scrutiny had revealed that the articles of association  the broad template that sets out a companys footprint  did not specify telecom services as an area of interest by the cut-off date of September 25, 2007.        
	Besides, they did not have the requisite net worth stipulated by the DoT at the time of application.        
	Each case would be studied separately and a decision taken on a case-by-case basis depending on the response we obtain from the companies, said Sibal.         
	All companies under the ministrys scanner have been given 60 days to respond to the showcause notice.        
	The comptroller and auditor general, in its report, had asked for the cancellation of licences of ineligible applicants stating, companies created barely months ago, deliberately suppressed facts, disclosed incomplete information, submitted fictitious documents and used fraudulent means for getting telecom licences and thereby access to spectrum.        
	Some of these alleged ineligible applicants have also formed joint ventures with foreign telecom operators and have started full-fledged services. Cancellation of licences may not be the optimum solution as it will impact the growth of the industry, said Romal Shetty, telecom expert with consultation firm KPMG.        
	Rollout norms        
	On rollout obligations, DoT officials said depending on the status of the rollout either a penalty would be charged or licence could be cancelled.        
	Among those under the scanner for failing to meet obligations are older operators Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices, Idea Cellular and Aircel.        
	Under the licence conditions, the DoT has the powers to impose a fine of Rs 5 lakh a week for the first 13 weeks of delay, Rs 10 lakh for the next 13 weeks, and thereafter at the rate of Rs 20 lakh for delays up to 26 weeks. If any operator fails to fulfil the obligation even after 52 weeks of delay, the DoT has the power to cancel the licence.        
	According to industry data, Uninor, Aircel, Sistema and Videocon have made progress in rolling out services in most circles. Loop Telecom has services only in one circle and Etisalat DB does not have any commercial operations in any circle.        
	The DoT had earlier proposed to slap a penalty of Rs 477 crore (which was later reduced to Rs 135.60 crore) on old operators, including Bharti Airtel, Tata Teleservices, R-Com and Aircel.         
	The penalty was lowered after several representations by the old operators, who said rollout obligations should come into effect only from the date of allotment of spectrum.

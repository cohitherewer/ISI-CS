The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rules must take into account specific features of schemes
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Rules must take into account specific features of schemes
										                              
	The recent controversy over unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) has created a huge discomfort among investors, both existing and future.         
	The trail of events started with Sebis order on April 9, asking 14 life insurance companies not to collect money under Ulips. Both existing and new policies were covered in the circular. This was followed by the IRDA telling insurance companies to disregard Sebis directive. Subsequently, the two regulators were asked to refer the matter to court for a legal interpretation with the judgement being binding on them. These events have had ample media coverage.         
	More drama is set to follow. The clarification given by Sebi while withdrawing the order, asking these companies not to launch schemes without its prior approval has only added fuel to the fire. Why this extreme hurry to change a 10-year-old order of things involving only 14 companies is a mystery.        
	The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was excluded, maybe because it plays a huge stabilising factor in the Indian equity market. Any uncertainty will obviously hurt the markets under the regime of Sebi and the capital markets division. It is all the more strange in view of the fact that the LIC controls more than 60 per cent of the total premium income of the industry.        
	The whole idea stems from the belief that high commissions under Ulips are driving customers away from mutual funds so-called load-free structure. Earlier, the Swarup committee also made similar recommendations and a regime of issuing consultative paper late in the evenings with calls to the media. Half-baked and disjointed facts were advanced to create an adverse environment for Ulips.         
	The New Pension Scheme (NPS) at that time was under the administrative control of the capital markets division of the finance ministry. The media blitz unleashed then and now has completely ignored the fact that charges have been capped under individual plans at 2.25 per cent for policies above 10 years and at 3 per cent for plans up to 10 years of maturity.         
	The charges under Ulips are quite comparable with what the customer pays under the load-free structure of mutual funds. These limits are applicable not only to new products but also the existing ones (as on October 1, 2009). This fact was presented before the Swarup committee after the consultation paper was issued but well before the release of the final report.         
	Moreover, over Rs 1,25,000 crore have been collected by life insurers in the last four years at a commission of less than 2 per cent (less than the prevailing entry load of mutual funds). It is surprising that the final report did not even mention this and some other relevant facts.        
	There are other factors that make insurance different from mutual funds and NPS. First, the insurance business requires huge capital. Private companies have brought in around Rs 28,000 crore for assets under management of Rs 2 lakh crore.         
	Will this not impact costs? The cost of capital adequacy itself is 15 basis points for a Ulip product. Mutual funds collect huge amount from the public with a capital of Rs 10 crore only. In fact, this capital structure has not allowed them to create any retail distribution.         
	During the recent crisis in fixed maturity plans, the industry had to scamper to the Reserve Bank to seek liquidity support because they did not have the capital commensurate with the size of funds they had collected and the kind of risks they had taken.         
	Life insurers did not require any support and were able to alter their product range to meet the changing mood of investors with a large part coming at a commission of less than 2 per cent.        
	One also needs to ask how adversely the capital markets would have been affected if the insurance companies had not been net buyers worth Rs 51,000 crore, while FIIs withdrew 47,000 crore from the market in 2008-09?        
	Another factor which is deliberately being overlooked is the inclusive growth. Of the new policies sold, 18 per cent have to be in the rural centres (population of 5000 or below). The obligation to sell in the rural areas starts from the first year of operations of a company.         
	Inclusive growth costs money. Either the tax payers pay it through spending by the government or the corporate sector pays with the burden being shared by the customers of the product. Life insurers have created large employment opportunities in the rural and semi-urban centres by opening over 8,000 offices in the rural/suburban pockets. This impacts costs.        
	Mutual funds collect money from urban centres and from corporates. Over 70 per cent of the MF assets are from the top eight cities. How come the ministry of rural development and the Planning Commission, who are always cajoling the private sector for inclusive growth, are not concerned about this since general insurance, banks and other players in the financial sector have substantial social and rural obligations to fulfil?        
	There is also the burden of stamp duty on insurance contracts which customers have to pay. Collections from other services are not subjected to stamp duty.         
	The NPS is supposed to be a low-cost scheme. On that logic it should have succeeded. We must realise that long-term products are not sold off the shelf. This is something that the architects of the scheme should have realised. The current controversy is nothing but an offshoot of this and the abrupt introduction of load-free model of mutual funds without taking into account the distribution issues.         
	Any regulatory framework which does not take into account the differentiating features of each segment is bound to do disservice to the investors. If investment in capital market is the sole basis of deciding regulatory oversight, then practically all players in the financial sector, including EPF, NPS and maybe banks, will be regulated by Sebi.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Flight delayed? Ask for a free meal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Reason to cheer                                  
	New Delhi, June 21: Airlines must refund tickets, provide meals and give free hotel accommodation in case of long delays and cancellation of flights, the civil aviation regulator has proposed. It has invited comments on the draft rules that will be binding on low-cost carriers as well.        
	The draft rules ask airlines not to arbitrarily offload passengers after having overbooked flights and instead, offer incentives and alternative bookings to those willing to give up their seats.         
	Top civil aviation officials said, We are trying to align our rules to international best practices and to a regime which is more consumer-friendly.         
	The government will finalise the rules within a month after receiving comments from the public.         
	The directorate general of civil aviation said it came up with the rules in view of the rapid expansion of air services within India and on international routes to protect travellers in case of flight disruptions and, in particular, (if they are) denied boarding, flight cancellations and delays without due notice.        
	According to the draft, airlines must inform flyers of flight cancellations as far in advance as possible of the scheduled time of departure through text messages, phone calls or emails.        
	To those who have been informed about the cancellations in advance, the airlines will have to provide compensation, refund ticket prices or give alternative bookings, besides providing meals and hotel stays, if needed.         
	The airlines will also have to give adequate facilities to the passengers who elect to travel to their destination on an alternative flight.         
	However, no monetary compensation shall be payable to passengers who have not given adequate contact details.         
	Under the draft rules, if departures are delayed by more than 24 hours, the airline shall compensate passengers by paying Rs 2,000 or the value of the ticket, whichever is less, for flights up to 1-hour long; Rs 3,000 or the value of the ticket, whichever is less, for flights of more than an hour and up to two hours.         
	For flights of more than two hours, the compensations will be Rs 4,000, or the value of the ticket, whichever is less. This compensation will be on top of the alternative arrangements and the free meals and hotel bookings.         
	U.K. Bose, former chief executive of Sahara Airlines, said, These rules were long overdue. Airlines rarely delay flights by 24 hours. However, there are cases and passengers need to be taken care of and airlines punished monetarily. We welcome the move.         
	Airlines are, however, not expected to pay compensation for situations beyond their control such as a natural disaster, civil war, insurrection and air traffic control decisions.

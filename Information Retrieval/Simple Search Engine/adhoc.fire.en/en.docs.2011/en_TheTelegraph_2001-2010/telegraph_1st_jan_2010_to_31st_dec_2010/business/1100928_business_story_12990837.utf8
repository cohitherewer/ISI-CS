	Calcutta, Sept. 27: Asim Dasgupta, finance minister of Bengal and chairman of the empowered committee on goods and services tax, today said differences persisted among a few states on the scope and powers of the proposed GST dispute settlement authority. He hoped that a consensus on the constitutional amendment draft for the implementation of GST would be reached at the next meeting of states on October 27, leading to the draft bill getting tabled in Parliament during its winter session.        
	Significant progress was made at the last meeting on September 20. But still, not more than five states have different opinions on various clauses and the scope and power of the GST dispute settlement authority. I hope a full consensus will be achieved soon and the draft bill will be tabled before Parliament during the winter session, Dasgupta said at the annual general meeting of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.         
	He said that a great deal of apprehensions among states on the proposed GST council and its functioning had been removed.

	New Delhi, March 30: Airtel has launched a 3G-enabled smartphone  HTC Smart  in collaboration with Taiwan-based handset maker HTC and wireless chip maker Qualcomm.         
	Airtel expects the smartphone, which is priced at Rs 9,990, to give a fillip to its 3G strategy.         
	Airtel is ready to launch 3G services within six to eight months of the completion of the bidding process, said Sanjay Kapoor, CEO (India and South Asia), Bharti Airtel.        
	The number of customers who use 3G devices needs to increase, said Kapoor.        
	Earlier this month, the company had signed a deal with Apple Inc to sell the iPhone 3GS in India.        
	The HTC Smart is powered by Qualcomm Brew mobile platform operating system and comes loaded with HTC Sense user interface, which allows the integration of different applications in a single view.        
	The Brew single processor chip has helped in keeping the price point low for HTC Smart, said Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm.

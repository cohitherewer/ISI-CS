          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 12: Ranbaxy Laboratories Japanese parent Daiichi Sankyo today said the companys problems in the US should be over in another two years.        
	Outlining its two-year business plan in Tokyo, Daiichi president Takashi Shoda also said Ranbaxys contribution in its earnings would jump to 23 per cent in 2012 from 15 per cent now.        
	The American drug regulator had barred Ranbaxy in September 2008 from selling about 30 drugs in the US after it found manufacturing defects at its Paonta Sahib and Dewas manufacturing facilities in India.        
	Daiichi now expects the restrictions would be removed by 2012. The Japanese company had acquired Ranbaxy in 2008. Both Daiichi and Ranbaxy have been addressing the concerns expressed by the US Food and Drug Administration, Shoda said. Daiichi said that over the next two years its business model would not only concentrate on innovative products but also on vaccines, generics and OTC products.        
	Daiichis said that Ranbaxy would be one of the key contributors in pushing its net sales to 1150 billion yen by 2012 from 960 billion yen forecast for the current fiscal. Ranbaxys contribution is expected to rise to 270 billion yen from 148 billion yen. Daiichis operating profit at the global level is expected to jump to 180 billion yen from 96 billion yen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Prop for insurance IPO rules
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Prop for insurance IPO rules

	Calcutta, April 14: The insurance regulator has reduced the waiting period for an insurance company to make an initial public offering (IPO) to five years after starting operations from 10.        
	The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has finalised its IPO guidelines and has sent them to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), sources said.         
	Sebi will club IRDAs recommendations with its general guidelines on IPOs for any company that wants to raise money from the public through equity shares. After that a formal announcement of the final guidelines will be made.        
	Among the IRDAs guidelines is the one allowing insurance companies to seek approval for an IPO after completing five years. Earlier, IRDA regulations required an insurance company to be in the business for a minimum of 10 years before it could seek the regulators approval for listing.         
	However, after insurers such as Reliance Life Insurance Company evinced keen interest to list, the government proposed to ease the norm. Accordingly, the IRDA had incorporated it in its final recommendations.        
	Prior to sending its final recommendation to the capital market regulator, the IRDA had to seek the permission of the Indian Institute of Actuaries for its norms on valuing companies.        
	A wide range of risk factors related to credit, market, insurance, liquidity, operational and asset and liability management need to be disclosed clearly by the insurers, accompanied by a report from an independent external actuary on the reasonableness of the methodology adopted and assumptions made to determine valuations.         
	The recommendations also lay down disclosure of data on various parameters such as the calculation of economic capital, surrender and lapse experience of business and expense patterns for a five-year period.         
	Insurance companies intending to go public would also need to disclose required and available solvency margins for five years, capital structure and details of investment performance.         
	However, the recommendations have come at a time when Sebi and the IRDA are involved in a turf war over unit-linked life insurance policies. The two regulators will now have to approach the court of law.        
	The standoff is expected to delay the announcement of the final guidelines. Four to five insurers, including ICICI Prudential Life, SBI Life Insurance Company and Reliance Life Insurance Company, are planning to tap the capital market with their maiden equity offerings.        
	Earlier this year, the IRDA had made it mandatory for companies to disclose the remuneration of independent directors as part of its steps towards improving corporate governance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Vedanta sews up Cairn cash 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Vedanta sews up Cairn cash 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Loan deal                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 19: A consortium of eight banks has agreed to lend $6 billion to Vedanta Resources Plc for picking up to a 60 per cent stake in Cairn India Limited.        
	Vedanta in a statement said the consortium comprised Barclays Capital, Citi, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered. The Anil Agarwal firm plans to acquire 51-60 per cent in Cairn India for $8.5-9.6 billion.         
	The financing announced today provides the group with funding flexibility. We are delighted to announce $6 billion of commitments from leading international banks, Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal said.        
	In August, Vedanta entered into an understanding with Cairn Energy Plc for acquiring a majority stake in subsidiary Cairn India.        
	Both Vedanta Resources and Sesa Goa  another Anil Agarwal firm  will hold stakes. Vedanta will directly hold 31-40 per cent of Cairn India, which will be bought from Cairn Energy Plc, while Sesa will make an open offer for another 20 per cent.         
	Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy will make up for any shortfall in the open offer of up to 11 per cent so that Sesa Goas holding touches 20 per cent.        
	However, the transaction has been fraught with controversies. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has claimed pre-emption rights, or the right of first refusal, on Cairn Indias assets. ONGC holds 30 per cent in Cairn Indias main oil asset in Rajasthan.         
	Oil secretary S. Sundareshan today said the government would consider Cairn Energys proposal to sell the stake only if it seeks permission for all its 10 properties in the country.         
	Cairns current application seeking permission has left out its three producing properties, including the Rajasthan fields.        
	The Sesa Goa open offer is yet to receive the approval of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.        
	Mike Watts, deputy chief executive officer of Cairn Energy Plc, had recently said that he was confident of getting the approvals. He, however, went on to indicate that the stake sale was not guaranteed.

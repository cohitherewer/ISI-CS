The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stakes high for telecom trio in 3G auction
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stakes high for telecom trio in 3G auction
          JAYATI GHOSE                                            
	New Delhi, April 11: Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Reliance Communications are likely to bid aggressively for pan-India 3G spectrum given their huge demand for this scarce resource.        
	Each of them has to accommodate over 100 million subscribers in their networks at a time the government is not allocating any additional 2G spectrum.        
	Other players such as Idea Cellular, Tata Teleservices and Aircel will only bid in circles where they have an established 2G market, analysts said.        
	Idea and Tata Teleservices may not be interested in Assam, the Northeast and Jammu amp; Kashmir, and Aircel is likely to stay away from major circles such as Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.        
	Most of the 3G spectrum will be utilised to augment existing capacity to carry voice traffic. After the launch of GSM services by Tata Tele and R-Com, networks are rapidly reaching capacity limits, particularly for Bharti, Vodafone and Idea, Shubham Majumdar and Kisalaya Singh, telecom analysts at Macquire Group, said in a report.        
	In 17 circles, including Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai, three 3G slots are being auctioned, while in the rest, four slots are available.        
	The government is auctioning 5 megahertz (MHz) of 3G spectrum in each circle. While the spectrum will be allocated in October, the rollout of data services will take another 3-6 months, even in the metros.        
	On an average, non-voice services comprise only 9-10 per cent of the revenues of domestic operators.         
	We will invest heavily in buying 3G spectrum, so it makes more business sense to direct it in areas like voice where it can start generating revenues immediately, said an executive of a top telecom firm.        
	Though the Tatas, Idea and Aircel have  like Airtel, R-Com and Vodafone  applied to bid for pan-India spectrum, it is not binding on them to buy spectrum for all circles.        
	Besides these six, three more are in the fray  Videocon Telecom, S Tel and Etisalat DB Telecom which have bid for select circles.        
	At present, all mobile services in India are offered through 2G airwaves. Allocations of 2G spectrum beyond the start-up 4.4 MHz were stopped in March 2009.         
	The government is awaiting recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on the issue. Trai was supposed to submit its report last month.        
	The launch of high-speed services will help to decongest mobile services networks, especially in metros and urban areas, Naveen Mishra, lead analyst (telecom research) at IDC India, said.        
	3G services, seen as the next growth driver for Indian telecom sector, allow users to surf the Internet or download content, including music and video, at speeds faster than current technologies.        
	The allocation of 3G spectrum will also help telecom firms to launch data services and open up revenue streams, Mishra said.        
	3G services were originally due for launch in India in 2007 but had repeatedly been deferred amid troubles over vacating airwaves and setting bid prices.

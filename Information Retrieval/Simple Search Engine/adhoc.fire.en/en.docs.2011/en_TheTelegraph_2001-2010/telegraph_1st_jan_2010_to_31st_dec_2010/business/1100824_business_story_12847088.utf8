	Mumbai, Aug. 23: Mahindra amp; Mahindra Ltd (M amp;M) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to acquire a majority stake in troubled South Korean automobile maker SsangYong Motor Company.        
	SsangYong had picked the $7.1-billion Anand Mahindra-controlled M amp;M as the preferred bidder on August 12.         
	M amp;M president (automobile and farm sector) Pawan Goenka said, We are committed to leveraging SsangYongs strong competencies in R amp;D and technology by investing in a new SsangYong product portfolio which will help us to gain momentum in global markets.        
	Mahindras focus on alternative fuels and electric vehicles with the acquisition of Reva, will further strengthen SsangYongs brand value and take it to new geographies, he added.         
	M amp;M acquired a majority stake in Reva Electric Car Company in May.        
	Financial details of the SsangYong transaction are still not available. Goenka, however, told reporters in Seoul that the company expected to invest roughly $2 billion over the next three years for product development, plant expansion and acquiring a majority stake in SsangYong.        
	The MoU with SsangYong Motors will be subject to due diligence and finalisation of definitive agreements, an M amp;M press release said. The transaction is likely to be wrapped up by November. M amp;M intends to let SsangYong function as an independent entity with Korean management, the release added.         
	Rothschild and Samsung Securities are the advisers to M amp;M. SsangYong, which has SUV models such as Rexton, Kyron and Actyon in its portfolio, may build new cars with M amp;M.

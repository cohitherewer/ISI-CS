	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Fertiliser minister M.K. Alagiri wants the proposed nutrient-based subsidy scheme to be deferred by at least a year.         
	Fertilisers are now sold at government-fixed prices, which are lower than their cost of production or import. Firms are compensated for selling below costs through subsidy.        
	However, under the new regime, farmers will get the subsidy after ascertaining the best mix of nutrients for their land.        
	Since the fertiliser industry has not given any assurance on maintaining the current price line, Alagiri fears the new regime can push up prices.        
	He also demanded that urea prices should not be increased for at least a year, sources said.        
	A group of ministers on fertiliser had on January 20 decided to implement the new scheme from April.        
	However, its implementation was subject to a written assurance from the industry that current prices would be maintained.

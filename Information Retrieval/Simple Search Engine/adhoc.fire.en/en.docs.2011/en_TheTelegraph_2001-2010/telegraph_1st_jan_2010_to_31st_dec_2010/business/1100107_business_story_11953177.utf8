The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dunlop scrip to resume trading on BSE from Jan 12
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Dunlop scrip to resume trading on BSE from Jan 12
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 6: Dunlop India is set to return to the bourses after a gap of about eight years.         
	The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has revoked the order suspending trading in Dunlop shares and the scrip will resume trading from January 12. The news will bring cheer to the 35,000 small shareholders of Dunlop.        
	Dunlop, once a favourite of investors across India, had last traded on the BSE on April 15, 2002 . It was quoted at Rs 6.60, below the par value of Rs 10.        
	Trading in Dunlop was suspended as the erstwhile Chhabria management did not pay listing fees.        
	Pawan Ruia, chairman of Dunlop, said he was relieved by the decision of the BSE. The shareholders had been demanding it for many years. I am happy to fulfil the commitment after many hardships, he told The Telegraph.        
	Dunlop shares are listed on the bourses in Calcutta, Chennai, Delhi and Ahmedabad as well.        
	Once trading begins on the BSE, it can also start on these exchanges, even if in a small way.        
	Promoters hold a 74 per cent stake in Dunlop, while the LIC owns about 12 per cent. The rest is with small shareholders, mostly from Calcutta and other parts of Bengal.        
	Experts hope volumes will grow once trading picks up. Many of the shareholders are yet to demat the shares and still hold them in a physical form.        
	However, the BSE has barred transaction in shares issued in a rights offer three years back because of a case pending in Delhi High Court.         
	Trading in 2,69,93,578 shares having a distinctive number between 45059298 and 72052875 will constitute a bad delivery, the BSE notice said.        
	Ruia said he was trying to sort out the issue with Sebi. The market regulator had opposed the process of the rights issue, which, Ruia says, was done according to a BIFR order.        
	The resumption of trading in Dunlop shares comes when the Ruia management has begun production at both the Sahagunj and Ambattur plants in Bengal and Tamil Nadu, respectively.         
	However, capacity utilisation continues to remain low. It will take some time to stablise production and increase from the present 30-tonne-a-day level, Ruia said.

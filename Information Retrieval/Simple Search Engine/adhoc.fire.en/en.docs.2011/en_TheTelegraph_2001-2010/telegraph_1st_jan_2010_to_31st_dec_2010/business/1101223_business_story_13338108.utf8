          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Kapil Sibal in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The government will try to create a level-playing field in spectrum allocation among all telecom firms.        
	Communications minister Kapil Sibal, who yesterday met the industrys top three Indian promoters  Ratan Tata, Anil Ambani and Sunil Bharti Mittal  said, I was very happy that the three captains of the telecom sector that I met were extremely constructive about their approach and they appreciated the fact that an assurance was being given for a level-playing field.        
	Sibal is expected to hold similar talks with other telecom players and get their views on a wide range of issues.         
	The real problem is that there is a scarcity of spectrum. We need to increase the amount of spectrum that can be distributed because this is the vehicle through which the people of India will be empowered, the minister said.        
	At stake now is a policy on additional spectrum for those who are already providing services. The government is considering moving away from subscriber-based criteria for giving radiowaves beyond start-up spectrum.        
	Without elaborating, Sibal said, The road ahead will be a level-playing field road, a non-discriminatory road, the road that will help the economy move forward.         
	The government also has to decide on cancelling the licences of firms that have not yet rolled out services and charging money for excess spectrum allotted to a few companies. The telecom regulator has already asked the government to charge additional spectrum beyond the start-up 6.2MHz at the rate at which 3G radio waves were auctioned.        
	Sibals shift to the sensitive telecom ministry and his meeting with the industry leaders come against a backdrop of A.Raja being forced to resign following allegations of favouritism in spectrum allocation two years ago.

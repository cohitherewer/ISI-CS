The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maran on wait list for SpiceJet seat
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Maran on wait list for SpiceJet seat
          PIYA SINGH                                            
	Mumbai, April 1: Kalanithi Maran will have to negotiate several air pockets before he can hope to grab control of budget airline SpiceJet.        
	Maran, the founder of Sun TV Network Ltd, is reportedly keen to buy a majority stake in the low-cost carrier. But the trouble is that he will have to contend with the demands of three key shareholders and the circumstances surrounding them if he wants to land the airline.         
	Ajay Singh, who holds 12 per cent along with his associates, has said he isnt interested in selling out at this point.        
	I will not sell my stake. In the airline business, everybody talks to everybody. The aviation sector has recovered from the slump and I would rather wait for a better valuation if I do decide to sell my stake eventually, says Singh.        
	The Kenya-based Kansagra family that holds a 12.89 stake in the carrier may also be restrained from partnering Maran or any other suitor.         
	The reason: most of Kansagras shareholding has been pledged against loans.         
	Data available with the Bombay Stock Exchange show that in December 2009, 12.85 per cent out of 12.89 per cent  or 99. 69 per cent of the stake held by Royal Holding Services Ltd, a Kansagra company  has been pledged.        
	A questionnaire sent to Bhulo Kansagra, a director of the airline and member of the promoter family, to confirm whether these shares are still encumbered remained unanswered.         
	Sources, however, say the shares are still pledged and the Kansagra family cannot sell out soon.        
	Finally, there is the American billionaire Wilbur Ross who invested $68 million in the carrier through convertible bonds. These bonds can be converted into shares at a price of Rs 35 by the end of this calendar year which will then give him a stake of around 31 per cent in the carrier if these are eventually converted.        
	Agencies reported on Thursday that Wilbur Ross had confirmed that offers to invest in SpiceJet were under consideration. Still, the conversion is due only in late November-December, and Ross will either have to cobble together support from other shareholders to offer a majority to Maran or any other buyer.         
	In any case, Maran will then have to come up with an open offer for another 20 per cent stake from minority shareholders.        
	Sources said the deal might also face some opposition from a section of shareholders over differences around the price at which the deal can be struck. Media reports suggest that Maran is willing to pay between Rs 39 and Rs 41 per share compared with Thursdays closing price of Rs 57.90.         
	Considering that the conversion price for convertible bonds held by Ross is Rs 35 apiece, Maran may be using that price as a benchmark for the deal.         
	Maran may not just have to up the price but also wait until the bonds held by Wilbur Ross come up for conversion or a stage where the other shareholders are persuaded to sell their respective stakes.

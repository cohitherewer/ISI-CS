The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Carrefour wholesale debut
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Carrefour wholesale debut
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: French retail giant Carrefour today opened its first wholesale cash-and-carry store in India as the worlds second-largest retailer seeks to overcome margin pressures at home by expanding in the emerging markets.         
	Opening of this store marks Carrefours entry into India and will be followed shortly by the opening of other cash-and-carry stores, said Lars Olofsson, chief executive of Carrefour.         
	The new store  Carrefour Wholesale Cash amp; Carry  in the Seelampur area of New Delhi is spread across 5,200 square metres and will house over 10,000 stock-keeping units to cater to professional businesses, institutions, restaurants and local retailers.         
	The $140-billion retail group, with a presence in 34 countries and 475,000 employees, operates in four retail formats  hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discount outlets and convenience stores.         
	Carrefour cut its 2010 profit forecast for the second time in two months in November, citing increased writedowns in Brazil and lower-than-expected demand in Europe. The retailer also lost market share in France since September as competitors added new stores.        
	Multi-brand retail        
	The worlds second largest retailer is also keen to enter the multi-brand retail segment and is understood to be in advanced talks with Kishore Biyani-promoted Future Group for some sort of franchise agreement as rules do not allow foreign investment in multi-brand retail.        
	This first step is essential to allow the Carrefour team to fully understand the Indian market and then build our presence in other formats, added Olofsson.         
	With the government reviving the debate on opening up foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail, foreign firms, including Carrefour, are optimistic about India easing restrictions.        
	In November, Wal-Marts global chief executive officer Mike Duke had said that discussions with government officials had been very positive and the worlds No. 1 retailer was optimistic on India opening up the segment.        
	At present, India allows 100 per cent foreign investment in cash-and-carry operations and 51 per cent in single-brand retail.         
	Foreigners are barred from multi-brand retail to protect local grocers.

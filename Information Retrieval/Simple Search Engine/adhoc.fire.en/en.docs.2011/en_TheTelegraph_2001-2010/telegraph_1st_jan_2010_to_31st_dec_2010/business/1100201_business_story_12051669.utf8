          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Jan. 31: Oil India Ltd is pressing for greater freedom in deciding on its investments as it scouts for more exploration acreages, discovered blocks and producing properties overseas in a bid to enlarge its portfolio.         
	At present, an empowered committee of secretaries (ECS), comprising representatives of various ministries and departments, approves proposals for overseas exploration and development properties that involve an investment of over $75 million or Rs 300 crore, whichever is less.         
	In other words, oil companies have to approach this committee for every proposal that is above this threshold.         
	Although oil companies admit that the approval process through the committee has not impeded any proposal, they want their boards to be granted the power to clear proposals involving investments of Rs 1,000 crore so that decisions can be speeded up.         
	Sources say OIL has recently approached the joint secretary at the ministry of petroleum and natural gas asking it to consider enhancing the powers delegated to the board to Rs 1,000 crore for individual projects.         
	This is not the first time that a state-owned oil company is pressing for an increase in the investment limit.         
	Back in 2005, ONGC Videsh Ltd and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) were also understood to have sought a review of the investment powers available to their boards for exploration and production projects overseas.         
	Global ambitions        
	In international exploration, OIL had signed a memorandum of understanding with IOC in 2004 to explore opportunities for joint participation in upstream opportunities.         
	Along with other consortium members, OIL has obtained participating interests in 17 exploration and development blocks in Egypt, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Yemen and Timor Leste.         
	OIL and IOC have also completed the construction of a product pipeline in Sudan.         
	OIL wants a review of the limits set on board-approved investments in the case of joint ventures, which is capped at $75 million or Rs 300 crore, whichever is less. It wants the board to be granted the freedom to clear investments up to Rs 600 crore in the case of joint venture projects.         
	Sources said the company felt that a Rs 300-crore ceiling for board approvals in the case of joint venture projects was too restrictive since it capped each partners share at Rs 150 crore, which made it impossible to close deals quickly.         
	The plea comes at a time when the OIL-IOC consortium is learnt to be looking at acquiring more producing assets overseas in order to accelerate the crude oil or natural gas output.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Big blow to Reliance bid for Lyondell 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Hopes dashed                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 16: Reliance Industries suffered a huge setback in its bid to acquire LyondellBasell after the management of the ailing Dutch petrochemicals maker struck a deal with truculent unsecured creditors who had been blocking its attempts to emerge from bankruptcy.        
	The proposed agreement  which is subject to court approvals  between the unsecured creditors of LyondellBasell and the companys management increases the amount that will be paid out to holders of general unsecured claims by $150 million.        
	Under the new agreement, an amount of $450 million will be distributed to the holders of general unsecured claims, millennium bonds and 2015 notes compared with an earlier offer of $300 million. This additional $150 million will be paid in the form of reorganised equity.         
	LyondellBasell has also clarified that the new agreement is not based on the success of any particular proposal to raise new capital for the company after it emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.        
	The company is working on a reorganisation plan under which around $18 billion of senior and bridge debt will be converted into equity. Differences between the creditors and the Lyondell management had put the restructuring plan on hold with the prospect of a long-drawn legal battle.        
	Tuesdays proposed agreement is considered as a major development in Lyondells future as it is expected to expedite the reorganisation.        
	A spokesperson for RIL declined to comment on the development.        
	Sources said the new agreement did not bar another company from being included in the plan.        
	RIL may, however, draw some comfort from US bankruptcy judge Robert Gerbers comment on February 11 while hearing a petition in connection with the settlement with Lyondells creditor Bank of New York Mellon Corp.        
	If a Joe Smith were to come down the road and make a cash offer for the estate that might require abandonment of the existing plan, the company shouldnt be prejudiced to consider the offer, media reports quoted Judge Gerber as saying.        
	In early January, RIL had raised its price for a controlling stake in Lyondell that put an enterprise value of $13.5 billion on the chemicals maker.        
	RIL has raised a war chest of Rs 25,000 crore through the sale of treasury stock in three tranches in the past few months to fund the deal.

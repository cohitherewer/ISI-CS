          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          S.K. Goel in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 6: Uco Bank has clocked a 22.05 per cent year-on-year growth in advances at Rs 74,300 crore as on December 31, 2009. The credit offtake for other banks has been tepid.        
	At a conference on the banks 67th anniversary, Uco chairman and managing director S.K. Goel said business in the current financial year till December grew 20.70 per cent to Rs 1,78,300 crore. While deposits grew 19.77 per cent to Rs 1,04,000 crore, advances rose 22.05 per cent to Rs 74,300 crore.        
	The credit growth came on the back of increased demand from infrastructure, real estate, road, power, telecom, hospitality and rural sectors, Goel said.         
	However, retail demand for advances, including housing loan, remains subdued, Uco executive director V.K. Dhingra said. The bank is targeting a business of Rs 2,02,000 crore in the current financial year.         
	Dhingra said disbursals have picked up, as well.         
	Earlier, companies didnt pick up the money after getting their loans sanctioned.         
	With indications that the RBI would put the squeeze on liquidity, resulting in higher rates, firms were now in a hurry to pick up the loan money.        
	Uco aims to bring more than 2,100 branches under core banking by the end of the current financial year.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kapil Sibal in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Telecom minister Kapil Sibal today said the government would take quick action to resolve security concerns over third-generation (3G) services.        
	Security agencies are unable to monitor 3G video calls on a real time basis. At present, the calls can be monitored with a lag of 5-8 minutes.         
	The security concerns will be resolved soon, said Sibal at an industry event today.         
	The telecom department has put a ban on 3G video calls till an efficient monitoring system is in place.        
	Tata Teleservices and Reliance Communications have told Sibal that the ban is discriminatory as state-owned MTNL and BSNL are also offering the service with the same monitoring facility.         
	Spectrum release        
	Sibal today reaffirmed the need to release more radio waves for civilian use.        
	The real problem is that in India we have the lowest volume of spectrum available to the public and the civil community, so we need to increase the amount of spectrum.        
	The ministers comments highlight a long-standing tussle between the telecom ministry and the defence forces over the release of radio waves.        
	Yesterday, the minister had said growth in telecom depended on adequate spectrum availability, assuring that the government will make all efforts to provide the required air waves to the industry.        
	Industry talks        
	The telecom minister today had a meeting with Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the Aditya Birla group and the promoter of Idea Cellular.        
	Birla is understood to have expressed concern over the shortage of spectrum. Sibal will also meet Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao.

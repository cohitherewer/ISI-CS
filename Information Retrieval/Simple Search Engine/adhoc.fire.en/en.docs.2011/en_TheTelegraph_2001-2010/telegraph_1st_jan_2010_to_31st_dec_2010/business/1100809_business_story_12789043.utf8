          R. SURYAMURTHY                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The environment ministrys restriction on coal mining has held up bidding for two 4,000MW power projects in Orissa and Chhattisgarh.        
	Power Finance Corporation  the nodal agency for the mega power projects  had invited pre-qualification bids for the Bedabahal project in Orissa. The last date for submitting the applications was July 30.        
	The deadline has been extended by two months as there is no clarity on the status of the captive coal block, a senior PFC official said.        
	The official said almost half of the coal mines allocated for the Orissa plant had been classified as a no-go zone by the environment ministry, which meant mining would not be allowed in these areas. The ministry has divided forest areas into go and no-go areas, depending on the tree cover.         
	As of now, we have not heard from the power ministry whether or not we will get environment clearance for the coal mine, the PFC official said.         
	Of the three coal blocks for Bedabahal  Meenakshi, Meenakshi B and Meenakshi dipside  two are in the no-go zone, said an official in the power ministry.        
	The Chhattisgarh power project is also facing a similar dilemma as the Hasdeo Arand coalfield has been declared a no-go land. The deadline for submitting the qualification bid has been extended twice, and the new date is September 6.        
	Each of the 4,000MW project requires an investment of Rs 16,000-20,000 crore.        
	Sources said the environment and coal ministries were jointly exploring the possibility of relaxing the criteria for demarcation in certain areas, following orders from the Prime Ministers Office and the finance minister. A solution was likely by early September, the sources added.        
	The coal ministry is now pushing for a revised classification of forest land into go, no-go and may-go areas. While mining will be prohibited in the no-go areas, access to the may-go zones will be given after proper evaluation, the officials said.        
	After studying nine major coal mining areas, the environment ministry had concluded that over 35 per cent of the area under study could not be used for mining.         
	The environment blow comes at a time the country is likely to miss the generation target for the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12). Against a target of 62,000MW, the addition to capacity is estimated at 45,000MW.        
	It is anticipated that an additional power generation capacity of 45,234MW can be commissioned during the remaining period of the Eleventh Plan, noting that 19,207MW capacity was added till December 2009, the Planning Commission had said in its mid-term review. The current installed generation capacity is over 155,000MW.        
	The power ministry had planned to set up nine mega projects, with four at pithead and five at coastal locations (with imported coal), to help to meet the generation target of 1,00,000MW by the Twelfth Five Year Plan period (2012-17).         
	However, it is unlikely the government will be able to allot coal to all the projects.         
	The government has awarded four mega power projects, with Anil Ambanis Reliance Power the most successful bidder.        
	RPower has bagged Sasan in Madhya Pradesh, Krishnapattnam in Andhra Pradesh and Tilaiya in Jharkhand. The Mundra project in Gujarat has gone to Tata Power.

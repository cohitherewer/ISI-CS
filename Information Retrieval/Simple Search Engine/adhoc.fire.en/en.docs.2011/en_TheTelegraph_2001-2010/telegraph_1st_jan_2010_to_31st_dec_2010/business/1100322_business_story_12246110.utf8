          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	New Delhi, March 21: Bharti Airtel today said it had raised $8.3 billion for the proposed acquisition of Zain Telecoms African unit.         
	The telecom entity will get $7.5 billion from a group of banks led by Standard Chartered and Barclays.         
	The financing was oversubscribed with major international banks committing to underwrite the total amount, the Delhi-based company said in a statement.        
	While the $7.5 billion will be dollar denominated, the remaining $1 billion will be a rupee loan from the State Bank of India that will also cover transaction costs.        
	Australia amp; New Zealand Banking Group, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole CIB, DBS Group Holdings, HSBC Holdings, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp are the other financiers.        
	Global Investment House KSCC is the regional financial adviser.         
	Bharti intends to make a formal offer this week of $9 billion for the African assets of Zain, Kuwaits biggest phone company, according to sources.         
	On Saturday, the Bharti Airtel board approved a plan to spend $9 billion for the buyout.        
	Exclusive talks between Bharti and Zain will expire on March 25, and the Indian company wants to ensure that its third attempt to enter the African market is successful.         
	Bharti had twice failed to buy out Africas largest operator MTN.         
	Talks floundered after the South African government refused to agree to the proposed deal structure.        
	Bharti is on the prowl for new markets overseas as intense competition and a fierce price war are hurting its margins in India.         
	The Sunil Mittal firm had earlier said Zains enterprise value of $10.7 billion was likely to result in a payout of about $9 billion, based on estimated net debt of about $1.7 billion as on December 31, 2009.         
	At $10.7 billion, Bharti will be paying about $250 for each of Zains 42 million African customers, excluding Sudan and Morocco.        
	Sources said Bharti might ask Zain to provide legal protection against an ownership dispute in Nigeria.         
	Econet Wireless Holdings, based in a suburb of Johannesburg, is contending Zains plan to sell its 65 per cent stake in the Nigerian operations to Bharti. Bharti has said the Nigeria dispute is a sellers issue.        
	Broadband upgrade        
	Bharti will upgrade the speed of all its existing broadband connections to a minimum of 512 Kbps, without any additional cost.        
	Existing customers using connections with 64, 128 or 256 Kbps speeds will have their schemes upgraded to a minimum speed of 512 Kbps.         
	Those on 512 Kbps and 1 Mbps plans will have the speed doubled to 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps, respectively, the company said in a statement.

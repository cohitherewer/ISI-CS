          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Roy: Harsh reality                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 24: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today barred Sahara group supremo Subrata Roy and two entities of the group from raising money from the public.        
	The two Sahara group entities are Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd (SIRECL) and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation Ltd (SHICL).         
	The decision was taken after the market regulator received complaints about disclosures made by Sahara Prime City Ltd, a company that wanted to come out with an initial public offering.        
	A complaint received from the Professional Group for Investor Protection alleged that SIRECL was issuing convertible bonds to the public throughout the country for several months, a fact that had not been disclosed in the draft red herring prospectus.        
	The lead managers to the offering told Sebi that SIRECL and SHICL had issued optionally fully convertible debentures (OFCDs). When Sebi had sought further information on the debentures, it was told that they were outside its purview. The companies also said the issues were being made on a private placement basis.         
	However, Sebi contested this view saying that as the issue was made to more than 50 investors, it meant that they were intended to be offered to the public. Under the Sebi Act, companies offering OFCDs to the public must make a listing application to the stock exchanges. However, the Sahara group companies had failed to make this application.        
	According to Sebi, The OFCD issuances by the companies seem prima facie characterised by lack of transparency on their part.         
	As inordinately large amounts have been received as subscription for OFCDs issued by the companies, it is imperative to find out the source from which the funds have been obtained as a means to ensure that the interests of investors providing such funds are protected.         
	However, the companies have deliberately not provided the information. (We intend to) probe how the companies could have raised huge amounts of money running into thousands of crores without conforming to prudent disclosure norms that govern public issues.        
	It added that considering the quantum of money solicited by them, it is only to be presumed that prima facie violations have taken place with the connivance of promoters.        
	Sebi prohibited the promoters mentioned in the prospectuses of these two companies  Subrata Roy, Vandana Bhargava, Ravishankar Dubey and Ashok Roy Choudury  from issuing prospectus or advertisement soliciting money in any manner from the public till further directions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spectrum fear fuels 3G craze 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Spectrum fear fuels 3G craze

	New Delhi, May 18: Fears over the availability of 2G spectrum in the future, which could jack up its cost, have led telecom operators to bid over Rs 70,000 crore for third-generation (3G) spectrum in the ongoing auction.        
	Though the spectrum payout may put a significant strain on their resources, most operators are willing to take on additional debt or dilution of stake for assets, which will provide long-term returns, analysts said.        
	The telecom ministry has banned the allocation of 2G spectrum, or radio waves through which voice and data travel, till it finalises a mechanism for pricing the resource. Allocation also depends on the vacation of spectrum by the defence authorities, who have been promised an alternative communications network, already delayed by over two years.        
	Trai has proposed that all future allocations of 2G spectrum beyond 6.2 megahertz should be linked to 3G prices. Some are of the opinion that 2G spectrum, too, should be auctioned.         
	India does not have a long-term spectrum availability and pricing road map. Operators are not sure of getting additional radiowaves for the next three to four years. They are also unsure of the pricing mechanism of these resources in the future and are willing to pay high rates for the asset, Romal Shetty, telecom expert at KPMG, told The Telegraph.        
	A single provisional bid for pan-India 3G spectrum today touched Rs 16,531 crore, beating all analyst estimates. So far, the government has earned Rs 66,802 crore, around 91 per cent more than the Rs 35,000 crore it had hoped to garner by auctioning 3G and broadband wireless spectrum. The Delhi circle received the highest bid of Rs 3,284 crore followed by Mumbai at Rs 3,183 crore.         
	According to Crisil Research, operators with a 12-15 per cent 2G and 3G combined market share will have an internal rate of return of 15 per cent over 10 years.

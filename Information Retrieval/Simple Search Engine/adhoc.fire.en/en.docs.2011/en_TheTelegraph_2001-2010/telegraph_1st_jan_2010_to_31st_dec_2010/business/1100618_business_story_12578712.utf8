The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hint of early rate hike

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chakrabarty: Weighing options                                  
	Mumbai, June 17: The Reserve Bank of India is poised to take some inflation-busting measures with policymakers expressing growing disquiet over the latest stream of numbers that clearly indicate that the spectre isnt showing any desire to disappear any time soon.        
	Back in January, the RBI had forecast inflation at 8.5 per cent by the end of March. But when that prediction went haywire, policymakers soothed concerns by saying that inflation would abate by June.        
	It hasnt: food inflation has stayed above 16 per cent for eight straight weeks and overall inflation (as of May) surged into double digits at 10.16 per cent.        
	This has rekindled talk of an imminent hike in short-term interest rates  a view that acquired some legitimacy with C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council, reiterating today that the central bank ought to take steps to control inflation.        
	RBI deputy governor K.C. Chakrabarty told reporters that the RBI was deeply concerned about tearaway inflation and its policy action depended on the environment.         
	Speaking on the sidelines of the 23rd Skoch Summit, Rangarajan said inflation has reached very uncomfortable levels and could no longer be treated as purely food inflation. The manufacturing sector is also showing a reasonably high degree of inflation. Therefore, some action on the demand side is called for.        
	Chakrabarty, who was also present on the occasion, said double-digit inflation was a bigger cause for worry than external factors.        
	It is not out of our estimates. If things change fast, there will be more measures depending upon the environment... We are moving from an accommodative policy. I cannot say when this will happen, he said.        
	Asked whether the European financial crisis would weigh on the RBIs policy decisions, Chakrabarty said although external shocks could have some adverse impact on the economy, the RBI was more focused on containing high inflation.        
	Their comments buttressed expectations that the RBI could raise the reverse repo and the repo rate ahead of its monetary policy on July 27 with the possibility of a 25 basis point hike in the two rates. Bond prices swooned after a brief rally in the morning.The RBI has raised the two short-term rates by 50 basis points since January and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 100 basis points.         
	While the repo and the reverse repo stand at 5.25 per cent and 3.75 per cent, respectively, CRR is at 6 per cent. CRR is that portion of bank deposits that must be maintained with the RBI. The reverse repo is the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity while the repo is the rate at which it provides liquidity        
	Food prices        
	Food inflation dropped marginally to 16.12 per cent for the week ended June 5. The rate dropped 0.62 percentage points over 16.74 per cent in the previous reporting week. Food inflation declined mainly because of lower prices of fruits, vegetables and tea.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to put an end to visa row
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bid to put an end to visa row
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Khullar: Mood to talk                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: India and the US hope to resolve the visa fee row amicably. The recent hike in visa fee by the US is likely to hurt the competitiveness of the Indian software industry in America.        
	The officials of the two countries have held talks after New Delhi termed the visa fee hike as protectionist and threatened to drag the US to the World Trade Organisations dispute panel.         
	I think everybody (in India and the US) is looking for a reasonable way to have this matter resolved amicably. Nobody wishes to have this (visa row) fostering as a wound, specifically because there is a trade policy forum meeting in less than two weeks from now and then there is President Barack Obamas visit, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar told reporters here today.        
	Obama is scheduled to visit India in November.        
	Khullar said several US officials, including deputy trade representative Michael Punke and Florida senator George Lemieux, had discussed the issue with him recently.        
	Lemieux will speak for India as he has a better understanding of why we are distressed by the move. He will get that message conveyed to his colleagues in the Senate as well as other policy makers in Washington, Khullar said.        
	The fee hike is expected to cost IT outsourcing firms such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro and Mahindra Satyam about $200 million annually.        
	US President Barack Obama had signed the controversial proposal to fund increased border security expenses by charging companies hiring from abroad after the US Congress cleared the hike.        
	Under the Emergency Border Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010  popularly called the Border Security Bill  the US has hiked the fee for certain categories of H-1B and L1 visas by at least $2,000 for the next five years.        
	The US said the hike would help it to pay nearly $550 million of the proposed expenditure of $650 million to increase security along the US-Mexico border.        
	Commerce minister Anand Sharma and Khullar are likely to visit the US soon and may take up this issue.         
	Cotton export        
	The government plans to revisit the export ceiling of up to 55 lakh bales on cotton, effective from October 1, in mid-November based on the production numbers. For now, up to 55 lakh bales can be exported (in 2010-11 season). This decision will be subject to review, which will be held on November 15, Khullar said.        
	According to conservative estimates, production in 2010-11 is likely to be 325 lakh bales (of 170 kg each). However, the ministry of agriculture expects the yield to touch 335 lakh bales. The moment you (exporters) hit the ceiling (fixed at 55 lakh bales from October 1) a prohibitive export duty will kick in, he said.

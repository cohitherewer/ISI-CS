	Brussels, Feb. 10 (Reuters): ArcelorMittal, the worlds top steel maker, cautioned its markets would only recover slowly as it forecast higher shipments but lower selling prices in the early months of 2010, putting pressure on core profits.        
	The firm, which has about 8 per cent of the global market and capacity some three times greater than nearest rival Nippon Steel, said on Wednesday it expected core profit or EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion in the first quarter.        
	The figure compared with an average forecast in a Reuters poll of $2.6 billion, albeit with a wide range of estimates, and with a fourth quarter result of $2.1 billion.        
	Chief executive Lakshmi Mittal said 2010 would continue to be challenging, although capital expenditure would rise by 43 per cent to $4 billion this year.         
	We, therefore, start the year in a good position to benefit from the progressive, albeit slow, recovery that is under way, he said in a statement.         
	ArcelorMittals shipments were expected to be higher in the first quarter of this year than at the end of 2009, but it would face lower average selling prices and increased costs.

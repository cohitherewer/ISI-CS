The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks still in shock
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stocks still in shock
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 27: The stock markets sank on Wednesday  the sixth straight trading session slump  as investors were spooked by talk of a tighter regulatory leash on banks in the US and China. It sparked fears that the policymakers at the Reserve Bank of India would also take tough decisions on Friday when they hunker down to review the credit policy.        
	Stocks were hammered across Asia and the cues fed into a skittish market in Mumbai. The sensex tumbled 491 points, or 2.92 per cent, to close at 16289.82  its sharpest fall this year. The broader 50-stock Nifty of the National Stock Exchange, too, collapsed 154.80 points, or 3.09 per cent, to finish at 4853.10.        
	When trading resumed after the Republic Day break, there was a string of negative cues from overseas markets. Investors continued to be rattled by US President Barack Obamas proposal to place restrictions on proprietary trading by powerful banks there. Chinas direction to its banks to curtail lending fuelled fears that demand for commodities from the worlds fastest-growing economy would now start to shrink.        
	The Asian indices closed in the red with Japans Nikkei dipping 0.7 per cent lower to a five-week low, while the Hang Seng Index ended down 0.38 per cent. The Chinese Shanghai composite index fell 1.09 per cent to a three-month closing low.        
	There was growing concern that the RBI might reverse its easy money policy beginning with a hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) on Friday. CRR is that portion of bank deposits that banks must keep with the RBI.        
	These factors saw the benchmark index opening lower at 16708.60 and slipping further into the negative territory as Asian markets continued to fall and European bourses opened weak. With foreign institutional investors also in a sale mode, there was complete absence of any worthwhile buying support.        
	The index tried to bounce back but it was nixed as investors scooped profits at the first sign of gains. The selling exacerbated in the last 30 minutes of trading when the sensex slipped to a low of 16230.85 before nudging up almost 60 points at the close.        
	Investor wealth as measured by market capitalisation fell Rs 2,22,234.8 crore to Rs 58,80,074.18 crore. The overall market breadth was sharply negative with 2,581 losing ground while just 338 ending with gains on the BSE.        
	Over the past six sessions, the sensex has lost 6.64 per cent, or 1171.26 points.

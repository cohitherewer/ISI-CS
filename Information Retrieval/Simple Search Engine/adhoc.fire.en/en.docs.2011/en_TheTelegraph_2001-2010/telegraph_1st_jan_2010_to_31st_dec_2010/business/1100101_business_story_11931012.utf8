                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Local firms go global

	New Delhi, Dec. 31: Indian companies are stepping out of their homes to try their luck on foreign shores.         
	Corporate India invested $2.7 billion abroad in the first quarter of 2009-2010 on top of $15.9 billion in 2008-09.         
	Though the first-quarter investment was 15 per cent lower than what was invested in the same period last year, merchant banker Sudipto Bose said, It marks a confidence in a new world order where Indian businesses see themselves as equal to global players.        
	According to analysts, confidence in global recovery, cheap corporate buys abroad and easier rules governing investment overseas had spurred flow of capital and could see total investment abroad top $12 billion this year and rise to $18-20 billion next fiscal.         
	For example, Titagarh Wagons plans to expand abroad on the back of the proposed Asian railroad project.        
	We plan to travel all around the world with the growth of the railroads, said Umesh Chowdhury of Titagarh Wagons.        
	India is full of opportunities, but we are all also looking at picks abroad, said Gautam Mitra, managing director of Indian Structurals Engineering Company.         
	Mitra plans to open a holding company in Switzerland to take his business in structurals to other Asian and African countries.         
	Indian companies created 3 lakh jobs in the US, while contributing $105 billion to the US economy between 2004 and 2007, according to commerce ministry statistics. During 2008-09, Singapore, the Netherlands, Cyprus, the UK, the US and Mauritius together accounted for 81 per cent of the total outward investment.        
	Bose said, And not all of it is organic growth. Much of our investment abroad reflects takeovers and acquisitions.         
	In the last two years, Suzlon acquired Portugals Martifers stake in German REpower Systems for $122 million. McNally Bharat Engineering has bought the coal and minerals processing business of KHD Humboldt Wedag. ONGC bought out Imperial Energy for $2 billion.         
	Indias foreign assets and liabilities today add up to more than 60 per cent of its gross domestic product. By the end of 2008-09, total foreign investment was $67 billion, more than double of that at the end of March 2007.

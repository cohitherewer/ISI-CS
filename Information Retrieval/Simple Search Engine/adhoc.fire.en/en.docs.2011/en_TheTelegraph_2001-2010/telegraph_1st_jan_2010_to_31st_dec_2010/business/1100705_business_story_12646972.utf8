	Calcutta, July 4: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today refused to roll back the fuel price hike. There will be no roll back of fuel prices, he said, speaking on the sidelines of a seminar organised by Assocham here.         
	On June 25, the government hiked diesel and LPG prices and deregulated petrol prices. Petrol prices will now vary in sync with the international markets. Following this, prices of diesel rose by Rs 2 per litre, petrol by Rs 3.50 per litre, kerosene by Rs 3 per litre and LPG by Rs 35 per cylinder.        
	The Opposition parties led by the BJP has called for an all-India strike on Monday to object against the hike, which may flare up inflation further.         
	On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India raised its two key policy rates  the repo and reverse repo  by 25 basis points ahead of its quarterly monetary policy review meeting scheduled for July 27, in a bid to bring down inflation that is hovering above 10 per cent.         
	As far as the interest rate is concerned, the 25 basis point increase in both repo and reverse repo rates (the interest rates at which the RBI lends and accepts deposits from banks) is appropriate and a welcome step, Mukherjee said.        
	When asked whether there would be any further rate hike by the apex bank, the finance minister said, I hope the increase in interest rates will be subsumed (by the RBI) in the policy statement on July 27. The RBI board will come up with its policy on July 27. Let us wait till then.         
	Meanwhile, RBI deputy governor K.C. Chakrabarty, who was present at the function, said, For the Reserve Bank of India inflation is everything; for the (finance) ministry, it is growth. But in the long run, both will converge. Right now, inflation is the biggest enemy.        
	We dont increase anything by less than 25 basis points. In that sense, it is a baby step, Chakrabarty said, justifying the decision of the central bank to go in for a premature rate increase.        
	On the possibility of more monetary action by the RBI on July 27, he said, There may or may not be. At present, it is in the internal debate stage. I cannot disclose it.        
	According to Subhalakshmi Panse, executive director of Vijaya Bank, If the RBI increases the cash reserve ratio (CRR) in its July 27 policy announcement, only then will we consider revising our base rate.         
	At present, the liquidity level is comfortable. The money that has gone out of the banking system for advance tax payment will come back now and it will improve the liquidity situation to some extent. The interest rate being a function of money liquidity, any increase in CRR will prompt banks a rate revision, she said.        
	Financial inclusion        
	The RBI will come out with a policy guideline to appoint for-profit companies as business correspondents of banks. This will increase their reach in providing financial services to people.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Sept 16: Banks are expected to raise interest rates on home, auto and corporate loans next month after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today raised the benchmark short-term lending and borrowing rates by 25 and 50 basis points, respectively, in an effort to quell inflation.         
	But there is good news for savers: banks are also expected to raise their deposit rates. Most of them had cranked up these rates just last month to lure depositors.         
	The rate revisions on retail and corporate loans arent expected immediately. Bankers say the loan and deposit rates can rise by 25 basis points  or a quarter of a percentage point  in October after banks have a chance to assess how todays interest rate hikes affect their cost of funds.         
	Both deposit and lending rates will certainly be raised by at least 25 basis points in early October, a private sector banker said.         
	There will be some impact (on rates), Bhaskar Sen, chairman and managing director of the United Bank of India, told The Telegraph. Our asset-liability committee will meet next week to review the situation before we decide to raise the rates.         
	The RBI, which today held its first ever mid-quarter review of the monetary policy, advised banks to raise deposit rates to halt the alarming slump in deposit growth this year. The real rates need to move in a direction that will encourage bank deposits, the RBI told the banks.         
	The central bank raised two benchmark rates today: the repo rate was raised by 25 basis points to 6 per cent and the reverse repo by half a percentage point to 5 per cent with immediate effect. This is the fifth time this year that the RBI has raised the policy rates.         
	The spread between the two policy rates has narrowed to 100 basis points  the thinnest in the past two years.         
	In Delhi, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said the central banks decision to raise rates was a step in the right direction. He was confident that the monetary measures taken by the RBI would ensure that the economy would grow 8.5 per cent this year.         
	The reverse repo is the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity from banks; the repo is the rate at which it gives overnight loans to banks.         
	The increase in the repo rate means that banks will have to pay a higher rate for loans from the RBI. It is this borrowing cost that banks are expected to pass on to the customers of home and consumer loans.         
	Banks have been running short of cash in recent times and have had to borrow from the RBIs repo window. In a tight monetary situation, the repo rate effectively becomes the operative policy rate.         
	The policy rates were raised to rein in inflation that is currently running at 8.5 per cent. The central bank wants to bring down inflation to 6 per cent by the end of March next year.

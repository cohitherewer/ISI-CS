The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Abhijeet shifts site of Bengal plant 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Abhijeet shifts site of Bengal plant 
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: Nagpur-based Abhijeet Group has decided to shift its steel and power project from Jamuria in Burdwan to Jangipur in Murshidabad.        
	The company, involved in steel and infrastructure, has informed the state government about the new location, which is the constituency of Congress MP and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Abhijeet plans to set up a 2.5-million-tonne steel plant and a 900MW thermal power unit.         
	In 2007, it had signed a memorandum of agreement with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation. It had initially estimated an investment of Rs 10,800 crore. The investment can now go up to Rs 12,000 crore, making it the biggest industrial project in Murshidabad  the Congress stronghold in Bengal.        
	Group director A. K. Shrivastava said the project had the blessings of the finance minister.        
	He (Mukherjee) expressed happiness in our decision and offered to extend all support.        
	Abhijeet requires about 2,000 acres for the project. It wants to buy the land directly from the owners. It had identified two plots but zeroed in on the one near the Sagardighi thermal power plant.        
	Shrivastava said the decision to relocate the unit was taken after the project in Jamuria ran into problems over mining land. The projects of Bhushan Steel, Videocon and Bengal Aerotropolis had hit a hurdle when Coal India Ltd objected to the choice of land. Coal India claimed that the land identified for these projects had coal.        
	Bengal Aerotropolis and Bhushan had to realign their projects. However, Abhijeet, after lying low for the last two years, came up with the surprise decision to relocate the project altogether. The choice of Murshidabad can come as a surprise since it is not close to iron ore or coal mines. Jamuria was considered because of its proximity to coal mines in the Ranigunj-Asansol belt and iron ore mines in Jharkhand.        
	According to industry estimates, 4 million tonnes of raw material are required to produce a million tonne of steel.        
	Group officials said the plant at its new site would be closer to a relatively untapped market, especially north Bengal, that would offset the extra cost involved in moving coal and iron ore.        
	Abhijeet plans to cut down its transportation cost by building a pellet plant in Jharkhand. Instead of iron ore fines, it plans to bring the pellets to Bengal, thereby cutting down on the volume.        
	Abhijeet, owned by Calcutta-based Manoj Jaiswal, is now waiting for the allotment of coal blocks before buying the land. We are taking care of land and iron ore. Hopefully, the state will provide us coal blocks, Shrivastava said.        
	The Bengal government has sought nine coal blocks from the Centre through the state dispensation route. Abhijeet will be one of the beneficiaries of the allotment.

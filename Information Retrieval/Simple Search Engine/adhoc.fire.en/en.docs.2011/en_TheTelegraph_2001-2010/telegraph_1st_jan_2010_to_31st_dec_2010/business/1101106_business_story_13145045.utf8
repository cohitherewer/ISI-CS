	New Delhi, Nov. 5: State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) may soon do away with its policy of procuring network equipment through tenders and let its employees manage the system in favour of outsourcing to a third party which is practised by its private rivals.        
	An internal committee, set up by the department of telecom (DoT), has agreed with the Sam Pitroda panel on outsourcing the network  that involves building, managing and maintaining the system  to global equipment firms. The committee was set up in July by the Telecom Commission to study the report of the Pitroda panel.        
	DoT officials say outsourcing, or the managed capacity model, is likely to do away with the controversies over BSNLs tenders for acquiring equipment.        
	Under outsourcing, the operator makes very little upfront payment to the equipment supplier, enabling it to deploy more money and concentrate on expanding its subscriber base.        
	Officials said the PSU had over 81 million subscribers, but the number had been shrinking.        
	Most private mobile operators have adopted the managed capacity model under which the equipment vendor maintains and operates the network for the service provider and changes the network configuration to meet capacity requirements. The model has not only enabled them to reduce costs but also helped operators to keep their workforce streamlined.        
	Under the managed capacity model, an operator places orders for network from equipment vendors such as Ericsson and Nokia Siemens based on the volume of voice and data traffic.         
	If the traffic is lower than what the operator has committed, the telecom firm pays the vendor a higher rate. But if the company can secure a higher traffic than what has been committed, the vendor gives the contract at reduced rates.        
	In March this year, after a string of controversies, the BSNL board decided to cancel its $10-billion tender for 93 million GSM lines, the largest ever telecom equipment contract globally.         
	The cancellation of the tender, issued in 2008, affected BSNLs expansion plans. Severe shortage in capacity has led to a poor financial performance over the years for the PSU firm.         
	BSNLs performance has been touching new lows every year since 2007, and the telecom PSU has for the first time suffered a loss of Rs 1,822.65 crore in 2009-10.         
	Analysts said losses were set to mount this fiscal, meaning the performance turnaround that the Prime Ministers Office was expecting was unlikely in the immediate future.         
	BSNL was carved out of the DoT in 2000, and started mobile services in 2002.        
	New plan        
	BSNL has launched a plan combining landline and mobile services, which will provide free SIM cards and unlimited free local calls to its customers.

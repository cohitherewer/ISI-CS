The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sharma finds US curbs regressive
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sharma finds US curbs regressive
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Sharma: Stern approach                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: Commerce minister Anand Sharma today termed Americas move to curb outsourcing as regressive and said that protectionist tendencies would deepen recession.        
	Protectionist tendencies are unhealthy for any economy, said Sharma while addressing the employees of IT major Infosys Technologies in Bangalore.        
	Indian IT companies create jobs not only in India but in the US as well, he said. Protectionist tendencies end up deepening recession.        
	Infosys chairman and chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy said the only way out for Indian corporate houses was to innovate.        
	There will always be geo-political issues that could create friction. While ministers like Sharma will take it up at appropriate levels, the corporations must keep innovating, he said.        
	We have to look at innovating more and more so that our clients will realise the importance of outsourcing, said Murthy.        
	Sharma said India would discuss a possible agreement with the US under which professionals on short-term work visits to America would be exempted from paying social security taxes.

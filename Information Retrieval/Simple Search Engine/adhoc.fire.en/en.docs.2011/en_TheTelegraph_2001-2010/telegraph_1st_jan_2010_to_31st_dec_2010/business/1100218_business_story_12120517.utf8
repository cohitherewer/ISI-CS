                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      UBI pads up for maiden float
                                                      
	Mumbai, Feb. 17: The United Bank of India (UBI) is coming out with a maiden share flotation to raise about Rs 300 crore  the first IPO by a state-owned bank in just under three years.        
	The bank is offering to sell 5 crore shares  4.75 crore to the public and 25 lakh to its employees  through a book-built issue which will be managed by SBI Capital Markets, Edelweiss Capital and Enam Securities.        
	It expects to offer the shares in a price band of Rs 60 to Rs 66 per share, with retail investors qualifying for a 5 per cent discount on the issue price.        
	Thirty per cent of the shares on offer are earmarked for retail investors. Another 60 per cent will be allotted to qualified institutional bidders. The bank said 5 per cent of the QIB portion would be kept aside for mutual funds.        
	The issue will open for subscription on February 23 and close two days later.        
	This will be the first IPO by a nationalised bank since Central Bank of India came out with a flotation in July 2007.        
	The UBI  which is the only state-owned bank that is entirely owned by the Government of India at present  will see an equity dilution of 15.8 per cent after the IPO. The governments stake will fall to 84.2 per cent after the issue.        
	Even after the stake sale, it will remain the bank in which the government will have the highest stake. Next in the pecking order is Central Bank of India where the government holds 80.2 per cent followed by Indian Bank (80 per cent).        
	S.C. Gupta, chairman and managing director of United Bank of India, said the issue was attractively priced.        
	The bank hopes to raise Rs 300 crore if the issue price is close to the upper end of the price band. Funds raised from the IPO will be used to augment capital base of the bank enabling it to meet future capital requirements.        
	Even though it is known to be a bank strong in the Eastern and North Eastern regions of the country, United Bank of India has focused its efforts on emerging as a pan-India bank.        
	Senior officials said the bank had been successful in improving its footprint and currently garnered almost 60 per cent of its business from branches outside this zone.        
	The bank had deposits worth Rs 64,740 crore and advances of Rs 41,219 crore in the six months ended September 30 last year.        
	As on January 31, the bank had 1505 branches spread across 28 states and four Union territories.        
	Gupta said the fundamentals of the bank were strong. Total business rose to Rs 106,000 crore in September 30, 2009 from Rs 75,000 crore on March 31, 2008.         
	Growth in advances at around 35 per cent has also consistently been above the industry average.         
	Over the last five years, we have grown by 33 per cent and our credit growth has been above the industry average. We will maintain this pace of growth, Gupta added.        
	UBIs capital adequacy ratio is also strong at 12.93 per cent and the ratio of low cost current and savings account deposits (CASA) stands at nearly 34 per cent. Post issue, the total capital adequacy ratio will jump to 13.50 per cent.        
	Gupta said the bank had been successful in recovering close to Rs 396 crore of bad loans in 2008-09 from Rs 149 crore in the preceding year. The bank has set up a credit monitoring mechanism through its information technology (IT) platform that warns it of any imminent slippage in a particular account, thus enabling it to take remedial steps at the appropriate time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pranab, Asim to fix fresh GST date
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Pranab, Asim to fix fresh GST date
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Dasgupta: Deal delay                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 7: The government is likely to miss the April 1 deadline to introduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, and a fresh date is likely to be announced tomorrow.        
	Asim Dasgupta, who is the chairman of the empowered committee of state finance ministers on GST, today said, Together (empowered committee and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee), we will announce a new date tomorrow.        
	Dasgupta is optimistic about kicking off GST within this year. Some members of the committee, however, indicated that GST would not be implemented before 2011. The members will meet Mukherjee tomorrow to discuss a new date and reach a consensus on the rate of GST.         
	The committee had released a discussion paper on November 10, proposing four rates under GST.         
	A task force of the 13th Finance Commission had, however, recommended a flat 12 per cent rate on all items. While states will get 7 per cent, the remaining 5 per cent will go to the Centre, according to the task force.        
	Dasgupta said, We have reservations over the recommendations of the task force. We would like them to review the methodology.        
	The issue of compensation for the states needs to be resolved. Also to be discussed at tomorrows meeting are value-added tax on imports, compensation on central sales tax, the mechanism for levy on textiles and flexibility to the state governments to exempt goods of local importance from tax.        
	The finance minister had recently said, We should look at a full-fledged rollout of GST. Let it take as much time as required.         
	While industry captains are lobbying for a timely rollout of the new tax structure, the Finance Commission along with states such as Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu want it to be put on hold.        
	The BJP has also asked the Manmohan Singh government to defer the launch of GST by a year.        
	Former finance minister P. Chidambaram, in his budget speech of 2007-08, had announced April 1, 2010 as the rollout date for GST across the country.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 10: Allahabad Bank today decided to increase its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) to 12.50 per cent from 12 per cent effective from August 16.         
	Earlier this month, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, and IDBI Bank hiked their BPLRs by 50 basis points to 75 basis points. These banks have, however, left their base rates unchanged.         
	Existing borrowers who have not yet shifted to the base rate system will have to pay higher interest following the increase in BPLRs.         
	In Allahabad Bank, the interest rate on a 10-year home loan of Rs 25 lakh, currently pegged at 9.75 per cent, or BPLR minus 2.25 per cent, will go up to 10.25 per cent after the 50 basis points hike in the prime lending rate.

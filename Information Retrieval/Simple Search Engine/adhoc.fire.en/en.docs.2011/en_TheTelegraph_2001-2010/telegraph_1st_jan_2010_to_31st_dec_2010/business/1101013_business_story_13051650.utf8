The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Exide net grows 42% in second quarter
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Exide net grows 42% in second quarter
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 12: Exide Industries has posted a 42.2 per cent rise in net profit for the second quarter ended September on the back of the transfer of a leasehold land for Rs 46.93 crore, even as the countrys largest lead acid battery manufacturer suffered from capacity constraints.        
	Net profit stood at 212.93 crore against Rs 149.67 crore in the same period last fiscal, while net sales grew 18.5 per cent to Rs 1,126.73 crore from Rs 950.31 crore.        
	The board of directors has declared an interim dividend of Rs 0.90 per share, which works out to 90 per cent at a face value of Re 1 apiece.        
	Exide said it had to let go a more remunerative replacement business to prioritise supply to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).        
	We had to earmark a significant part of our production volume for our valued OEMs even at the cost of reduced supplies in the replacement market, in spite of it being more profitable, T.V. Ramanathan, managing director and CEO of Exide, said.        
	The availability for the replacement segment should improve with the commissioning in September of the Ahmednagar plant in Maharashtra. The commissioning of additional production lines, also in September, at Shyamnagar and Haldia in Bengal will also help to improve the situation.

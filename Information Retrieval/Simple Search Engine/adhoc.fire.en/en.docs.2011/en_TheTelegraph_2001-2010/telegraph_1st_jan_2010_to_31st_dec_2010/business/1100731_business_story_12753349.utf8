          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bansal: Decision stalled                                  
	New Delhi, July 30: State-owned oil firms have decided against revising petrol prices with the Opposition intensifying its criticism of the government over price rise.         
	The Opposition has been disrupting proceedings in both the houses of Parliament on inflation.        
	Last month, the government deregulated petrol prices, which would vary with the crude rates in the global market.         
	There is no immediate plan to revise petrol prices as the international prices have not fluctuated significantly, B.M. Bansal, chairman and managing director of Indian Oil Corporation, said.        
	However, sources said the oil ministry had advised the PSUs to maintain status quo.        
	Any revision in the prices at this juncture will add fuel to the Opposition ire, the sources said.        
	According to a senior oil ministry official, A policy decision to free petrol prices may have been taken but given the political implications of this move, it has to be implemented cautiously.        
	Oil firms will keep the prices unchanged for another two months, the official added.        
	Bansal said, The Indian basket of crude is stable at $74-$75 per barrel. So, there is no immediate need to change the prices.        
	On June 25, the Centre decided to free petrol prices from state control and raised the prices of diesel, LPG and kerosene to bring down the fiscal deficit and help oil refiners recover losses for selling fuel below cost.        
	Following the decision, the oil companies had said they would announce a fresh price every month, which would be market-linked.         
	Since the petrol deregulation, the average price of the Indian crude basket had marginally increased to $75.15 per barrel from $74.35.        
	The increase had fuelled speculation that petrol prices could be hiked marginally.        
	Analysts said, The revision in petrol prices, either way, would have sent a clear signal that the government was committed to free market pricing of petrol and diesel. Buckling under Opposition pressure to postpone the decision has given rise to doubts about the commitment as diesel is yet to be completely deregulated as stated earlier.        
	The government had freed oil prices in 2002, but politics ensured that the reform was short-lived.        
	Even when crude prices surged in 2007-08, the state-owned oil firms were not allowed to increase prices.

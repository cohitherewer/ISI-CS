	Calcutta, July 9: The United Bank of India (UBI) will raise capital from various avenues to meet its credit requirements for the next three to five years.        
	More capital is needed to sustain growth. The credit offtake is expected to be more than 22 per cent for which more capital is required, UBI chairman and managing director Bhaskar Sen said at the banks first AGM here today.        
	The UBI entered the capital market with an IPO and raised around Rs 300 crore.         
	Sen said the capital would be raised by issuing tier-I or tier-II bonds.        
	We may seek money from the government as well, he said.        
	Sen said the bank had fixed the base rate at 8.25 per cent. The bank has also fixed the upper limit at 14.25 points beyond which it will not charge interest.        
	The bank will install 500 ATMs this financial year and open more branches in the southern, western and northern parts of the country.

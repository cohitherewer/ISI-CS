	Palo Alto (US), Aug. 23 (AP): Hewlett-Packard has bid $1.5 billion for data storage provider 3PAR Inc., just a week after rival Dell agreed to acquire the company for $1.13 billion.        
	HP and Dell have been looking to expand beyond personal computers in a search for bigger profits.        
	3PAR  based in Fremont, California  provides software for organising data on corporate servers. The company offers its products on a subscription basis over the Web, an approach known as cloud computing. HP will pay $24 per share for the company, a 33 per cent premium over Dells bid of $18 per share.         
	With the acquisition of 3PAR, HP will add to its technology services and outsourcing division that makes up a third of its revenue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gas-fired power to cost more
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Gas-fired power to cost more
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sushil Kumar Shinde (left) with Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: Consumers may have to pay more for electricity as the generation cost of gas-based units will increase by up to Rs 1.20 per unit following a government move to double the price of natural gas pumped out by state-owned firms.        
	The increase in administered gas price will certainly increase the electricity rates because of the obvious cascading effect, power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said on the sidelines of a Ficci event here.        
	However, the extent of the hike will depend on the state regulatory authorities.         
	Gas-based power accounts for about 10 per cent of total electricity generation in the country.        
	Coal-fired and hydel plants generate most of the electricity. A typical distribution company buys electricity from plants using different energy sources.         
	Shinde said the cost of generation would go up 90 paise to Rs 1.20 per unit, and consumer prices were also sure to go up.        
	Petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said the increase to the consumers would be marginal. Only 10 per cent of power are gas-based, of which only a third use gas whose prices are controlled by the government (APM gas).         
	The country has power generation capacity of 157,229 mega watts, and gas-based power accounts for 17,055mw.        
	The gas price hike is expected to raise the price of compressed natural gas (CNG) for automobiles by up to 20 per cent.        
	Sunderashan said companies retailing CNG and piped natural gas in metros might not pass on the entire impact of the over two-fold hike in natural gas prices to consumers.

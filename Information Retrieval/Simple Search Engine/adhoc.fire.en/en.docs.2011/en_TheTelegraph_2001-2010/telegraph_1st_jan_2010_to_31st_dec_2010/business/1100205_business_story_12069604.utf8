          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Bitter pill				                                 
	Mumbai, Feb. 4: Israeli drug firm Taro Pharma, which is fighting a takeover battle with Sun Pharmaceuticals, today said the Supreme Court of Israel had debarred the Indian firm from acquiring further stake in the company.         
	The Supreme Court of Israel had ruled that Sun might not exercise a warrant to purchase additional Taro shares, while a previously ordered temporary injunction remained in effect, Taro said in a statement.         
	Sun Pharma is the single largest shareholder of Taro with a 36 per cent stake and it has been trying to take control of the company ever since their $454-million merger deal of 2007 was unilaterally terminated by Taro a year later. After this, both companies have filed cases against each other and the matter is pending in the apex court of Israel.        
	In 2008, Sun Pharma had launched an open offer to acquire additional shares of Taro. The open offer was challenged in the Israeli court, which prohibited Sun from closing the offer until the court gave a ruling in other cases related to the takeover.         
	Taro said in September 2008, as part of an appeal filed by Taro and certain members of its board, the Israeli apex court had granted a temporary injunction prohibiting Sun from closing its tender offer to purchase Taro shares until the court rendered a judgment, and ordered that status quo with respect to Taro be maintained until that judgment was rendered.         
	In December last year, Sun attempted to exercise a warrant to purchase around 3.7 million additional Taro shares at $6 per share.         
	Taro notified Sun Pharma that the exercise of the warrant was contrary to the temporary injunction. The Mumbai-based company asked the apex court in Israel to rule that the temporary injunction did not prohibit the exercise of the warrant.         
	However, in its decision, the Israeli court had ruled that the purpose of the temporary injunction was to maintain the status quo until a judgment on the appeal is rendered and prohibited Sun from exercising the warrant. Taro further pointed out that it had voluntarily agreed to grant an appropriate extension to the term of the warrant in the event that the court took a decision on the appeal after the expiry of the warrant.         
	This development comes after Taros annual general meeting in December last year when minority shareholders of the Israeli company voted against the election of its external director nominees and indemnification proposals mooted by its current management.

        Small savings are under threat with banks likely to offer higher deposit rates soon, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	If government-sponsored small savings schemes have been your preferred investment avenue, you may have to think again.         
	Small savings such as NSC and Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS) are losing their shine, while bank deposit rates are likely to go up. With credit demand far exceeding deposit growth, banks are sure to increase their deposit rates to mobilise more resources. This makes bank fixed deposits more attractive than small savings schemes.        
	The government has set up an expert committee to examine how the interest rate paid on small savings schemes can be benchmarked to market-linked rates. The last time the government revised the interest rate on small savings schemes was in 2003. The rate was brought down to 8 per cent per annum.         
	In the last seven years, there were wide fluctuations in net collections from small savings schemes depending on the interest rates offered by banks on fixed deposits.         
	Payment position        
	In 1999, the government set up the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF). The entire small savings collection now goes to NSSF, which after meeting the repayments/withdrawals invest the rest in special securities issued by the state and central governments.         
	While state governments can borrow 80 per cent of the net collections under small savings schemes from NSSF, they have to issue special securities bearing an interest rate of 9.5 per cent and the loan can be repaid over a period of 25 years, including a moratorium of five years.        
	The average tenure of loan repayment on account of borrowings from NSSF by state governments and the average maturity profile of small savings schemes create a huge asset-liability mismatch.         
	While the average loan repayment tenure is 15.5 years, the average maturity of small savings schemes is 6.4 years.         
	This mismatch has never been a problem because repayments were made from the huge growth in collections. But if gross collections start declining or there is a large-scale withdrawal, there can be a payment problem.        
	Rate status        
	State governments can borrow from the market at a much lower rate than 9.5 per cent under the NSSF. But they cannot do so under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act as states cannot borrow more than 4 per cent of their fiscal deficit from the market. Hence, states are forced to borrow from NSSF at high cost.        
	The Thirteenth Finance Commission has recommended that interest rates on loans contracted by states till 2006-07 and outstanding at the end of 2009-10 be reset at an interest rate of 9 per cent.         
	Thus, the interest rate on small savings schemes has to be brought down below 8 per cent if the interest rate on lending to states has to be brought down to 9 per cent from 9.5 per cent at present.         
	The small savings schemes serve two purposes  provide investment avenues for small savers from rural and semi-urban areas and meet the borrowing requirements of the state and central governments.         
	These schemes are mobilised through incentives such as higher interest rates compared with other instruments and tax concessions. Many income tax payers from urban areas have substantial investments in these schemes because of the tax incentives.        
	If the tax and other fiscal concessions available to small savings schemes are factored in, the effective return on these instruments is higher than the nominal rates of return. Further, with the in-built tax concessions the effective cost of borrowing to the government becomes higher. Higher the tax rebate, higher the cost of funds.         
	Along with the fiscal reforms, linking interest rates on small savings to the market was a little difficult for the government in the absence of pension and other social security reforms.         
	Step by step        
	With the New Pension System in place, the government may consider withdrawing fiscal concessions to small savings schemes. In the draft Direct Taxes Code, tax benefit on National Savings Certificate, 5-year post office term deposit and Senior Citizen Savings Scheme has been withdrawn. Only public provident fund will be entitled to tax benefit from April next year.         
	At present, banks are giving 7.25-7.75 per cent interest per annum on fixed deposits above five years. Bank interest rates, compounded quarterly, are comparable with interest rates on small saving schemes which are compounded either half-yearly or yearly (post office term deposit rates are compounded quarterly).         
	For banks, the growth rate in credit offtake in the first quarter was very strong at around 20 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. Credit demand generally picks up from the second quarter of a financial year. So, credit growth is expected to be higher than the first quarter. Deposit growth during the same period was only 13.9 per cent against 17 per cent a year ago, setting the ground for higher rates.        
	It, thus, merits to take a relook at your small saving investments and consider switching over to bank fixed deposits when they start increasing their interest rates.

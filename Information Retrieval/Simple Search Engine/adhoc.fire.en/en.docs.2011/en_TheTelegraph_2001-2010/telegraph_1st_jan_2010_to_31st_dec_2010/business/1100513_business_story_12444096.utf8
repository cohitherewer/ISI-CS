          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 12: Industrial output grew 13.5 per cent in March  the seventh straight month of double-digit expansion, though at a slower pace. For 2009-10, industry grew 10.4 per cent, up from 2.8 per cent in the previous financial year.         
	The growth rate in February was higher at 15.1 per cent, and the decline in March was because of a slower rise in manufacturing and mining production. The growth curve remains strong, but shows signs of slowing down, officials said. Industrial growth has come down from 16.7 per cent in January and 17.1 per cent in December. Growth has declined partly because of a higher base effect and significant reduction in the output of cement and steel.        
	Manufacturing grew 14.3 per cent, mining, 11 per cent and electricity, 7.7 per cent from a year earlier, the officials said.         
	Notwithstanding the month-on-month decline in growth, the optimism among the officials about the future stems from the solid performance of capital goods (27.4 per cent growth) and consumer durables (32 per cent).        
	As many as 14 of the 17 industry groups have shown positive growth during March compared with the corresponding month of the previous year.         
	Commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma said Marchs lower number was only a minor fluctuation. Whatever steps are required shall be taken to ensure that strong broad-based growth in industrial production continues, Sharma told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.         
	According to D.K. Joshi, principal economist at ratings agency Crisil, The month-on-month momentum was clearly decelerating and anyway you cant sustain 16-per-cent-plus levels of industrial growth, which were mainly because of a weak base.         
	The Indian economy slowed sharply at the beginning of last year because of the effects of the global financial crisis, which exaggerates the growth rate for this year when measured over 12 months (base effect impact).        
	Analysts said the abnormally high rates of industrial growth would flatten out to more reasonbable but still double digit or near double digit growth rates.

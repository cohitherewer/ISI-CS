	New Delhi, Feb 16: US car manufacturer Ford will focus more on small cars as it prepares to launch the Figo next month.        
	As part of this exercise, Ford will soon phase out its hatchback Fusion. We will discontinue the Fusion. The car was anyway giving us relatively small volumes, said Michael Boneham, managing director, Ford India.         
	Small cars comprise 70 per cent of the Indian market. The segment is dominated by Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Tata Motors.        
	Boneham said the company had aggressive plans regarding the Figo, which would be priced competitively. With its (Figo) launch we are to be benchmarked against our key competitors. Commercial production of the car  eight-five per cent of its parts are sourced locally  has started at Fords facility near Chennai.        
	Ahead of the launch, the company has raised the number of dealers to 164 across 97 cities. With the openings today (of 28 dealerships), 40 per cent of our dealers are now in the secondary markets and we will further increase it, Boneham said.

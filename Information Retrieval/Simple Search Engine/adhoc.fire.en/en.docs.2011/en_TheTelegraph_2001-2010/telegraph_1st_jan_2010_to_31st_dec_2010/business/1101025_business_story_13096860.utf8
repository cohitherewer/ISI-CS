The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rupee on a slippery track
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Rupee on a slippery track
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 24: The rupee, which appreciated more than five per cent this calendar year, may be heading for a fall as the enthusiasm of foreign institutional investors can wane with Coal Indias mega public issue complete and domestic equities looking expensive.        
	Forex experts feel the domestic currency may weaken to 45 per dollar over the next few days. The reversal in the rupees fortunes may have already begun as the currency ended sharply lower at 44.59 to a dollar on Friday, a loss of 28 paise over its previous close. This was the biggest single-day fall in over a month.        
	The rupee had climbed to a 25-month high of 43.96 against the dollar on October 15, propelled by the deluge of dollar supplies from the FIIs who pumped over $24 billion into equities, besides another $10 billion into debt instruments. Expectations of a fresh bout of dollar inflow for the Coal India initial public offering also fuelled the rupee rally.        
	The Coal India flotation drew an overwhelming response from foreign investors  the portion reserved for qualified institutional buyers was subscribed more than 24 times. Now that the issue has closed, there is a possibility of a huge outflow of dollars as foreign funds unable to get substantial allotments may choose to withdraw from the market. This can put pressure on the rupee.        
	Even without Coal India, the current pace of foreign fund inflows may not be sustained. Once the major IPOs are completed, valuations may come into investor focus, leading to a lull in equity inflows. According to the price/earnings ratio, Indian equities now appear overvalued, not only by historical standards but also relative to other major Asian markets, Priyanka Chakravarty, forex strategist at Standard Chartered Bank, said in a recent note.        
	According to Chakravarty, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may also intervene in the forex markets to stem the currencys rise. The central bank has largely kept its hands off the rupee. An RBI intervention, which involves buying dollars when the rupee appreciates, would release the Indian currency into the system, thus stoking inflation.        
	A key reason for the RBIs absence from the forex market until now has been surplus rupee liquidity. In recent months, however, liquidity has tightened considerably, and our estimates indicate that this is likely to remain the case in the near future. Hence, the RBI has greater leeway to conduct unsterilised intervention, says Chakravarty.        
	An unsterilised intervention occurs when the central bank does not issue bonds to mop up the excess rupee that enters the system from selling dollars. Chakravarty said the RBI had in the past soaked up dollar inflows after large IPOs.        
	However, there are some who feel that foreign investors will continue to show interest in the forthcoming public issues if the government prices them attractively. Manish Sonthalia, vice-president and fund manager at Motilal Oswal Asset Management, told The Telegraph that if the price offered was attractive, then there was enough money in the world to chase such offerings.        
	Experts feel foreign investors will also be keen on domestic debt paper.         
	Recently, the government increased the investment limit of FIIs in the debt market by $5 billion each in government and corporate bonds to $10 billion and $20 billion, respectively.         
	We expect an increase in FII participation in G-Secs (government bonds) due to this relaxation, Amandeep Chopra, head of fixed income, UTI Asset Management Company, told The Telegraph. Chopra said foreign inflows in the domestic debt market were good at present as the yield was higher compared with most developed countries.

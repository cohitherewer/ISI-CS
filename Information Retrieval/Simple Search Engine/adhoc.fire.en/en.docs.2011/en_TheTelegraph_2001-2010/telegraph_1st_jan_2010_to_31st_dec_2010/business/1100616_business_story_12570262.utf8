The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BOC opts for delisting
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      BOC opts for delisting
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 15: BOC India, the Calcutta-based gas supplier, today became the first company to come out with a delisting offer after the governments recent announcement that all listed companies would have to ensure a minimum public holding of 25 per cent.        
	The Linde group, the parent of BOC India, said it proposed to acquire over 89.75 lakh shares at a minimum price of Rs 225.29 per share.        
	BOC Group of the UK, which is part of the Linde group and a wholly owned subsidiary of Linde AG, holds 89.48 per cent in the Indian entity.        
	Linde Holdings Netherlands, a part of the Linde group, today made a proposal to buy out the 10.52 per cent stake with minority shareholders.        
	The markets have been anticipating that promoters with very large shareholding in their companies would use the governments directive as an excuse to delist the shares. Many of them have been trying to tempt minority holders to give up their shares with buyback proposals but have failed over the years.        
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the shares of BOC India hit the 20 per cent upper circuit limit at Rs 287.45, a gain of Rs 47.90 over its previous close.        
	The share prices of several multinational companies have been holding firm in recent times in the anticipation that they would be prime delisting candidates after the government announcement.        
	In the first week of this month, share prices of companies such as Oracle Financial, Alfa Laval and Gillette India had flared as investors speculated that their parent companies, which hold far in excess of the 75 per cent proposed threshold, would prefer to drop out of the bourses.        
	There are close to 278 listed firms (both domestic and MNC) where the promoter holding is at least 75 per cent. Some of the big names in that list are Wipro, DLF and a few PSU companies such as SAIL. However, market circles feel that not all of them will look to delist.

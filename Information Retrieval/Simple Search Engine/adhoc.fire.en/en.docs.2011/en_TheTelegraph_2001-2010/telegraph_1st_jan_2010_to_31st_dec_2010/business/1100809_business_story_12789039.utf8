        Unit-linked pension plans will no longer be the same after a regulatory tweak. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay finds out why                                            
	If you are planning to buy a unit-linked pension plan, buy it this month. Come September, unit-linked insurance and pension plans will be subjected to new regulations.         
	Under the new regulations, the unit-linked pension plans will lose much of their charm because of several restrictions. Let us see how things may shape up after September.        
	Withdrawal woe        
	The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has stipulated that investments in any unit-linked plan cannot be withdrawn before five years, even if the policy is surrendered. Whatever be the value, the surrender amount will be given to the policyholder only after five years from the start of the policy.        
	Though one can fully or partially withdraw from a unit-linked insurance plan (Ulip) after five years, such withdrawals are not allowed in the case of pension plans till the maturity of the policies. On maturity, one can get only a third of the accumulated fund value as lump sum withdrawal, while the remaining money will have to be used to buy annuity (or the regular pension income).         
	At present a policyholder can completely redeem his/her investment in a unit-linked pension plan after three years. In fact, most insurers use this bait to sell their unit-linked pension plans, particularly the single premium policies.         
	The new rules on premature withdrawal of investment will make unit-linked deferred annuity plans a long-term saving instrument. In a deferred annuity or pension plan, you invest regularly while you are earning. After the expiry of the policy term, you buy annuity or pension income with the fund accumulated under the policy.        
	The larger is the accumulated fund value, the more annuity income you can buy. But how much your investments will grow till maturity will depend on the rate of return it can fetch.         
	Return grumble        
	The new regulations provide that all unit-linked pension/annuity products shall offer a minimum guaranteed return of 4.5 per cent per annum or as specified by IRDA from time to time.         
	Now, if a pension plan has to comply with this guaranteed return, it must have to invest a higher proportion of the premium paid by policyholders in debt instruments. Thus, unit-linked pension plans will become balanced funds with high debt component.         
	Let us see how.        
	At present, government securities (the zero-risk instrument) are available for a maximum tenure of 30 years. The Reserve Bank auctioned these bonds on July 2 this year.         
	The stocks, which will be redeemed in July 2040, carry an annual interest rate of 8.30 per cent. These bonds now have a yield of 8.33 per cent. That means the market price of the bonds has declined and if one invests in these bonds now, the return will be 8.33 per cent, provided the bonds are held till maturity.        
	The current yields of 1-year, 5-year and 10-year government securities are 6.20 per cent, 7.69 per cent and 7.87 per cent, respectively.         
	Now, given the yield range of government securities for varying maturity, an insurance company can invest between 54 per cent and 73 per cent of the premium paid and assure an investment return of 4.5 per cent.         
	If an insurance company wants to assure a 4.5 per cent return every year, it can allocate 73 per cent of the investible premium in one-year government security and invest the remaining 27 per cent in equities.         
	In that case, the insurer will have to reallocate investment in government securities every year, depending on the yield of the government stock. This will be the likely case for regular premium policies.         
	Date with debt        
	If the insurer has Rs 100 for investment, it can invest Rs 73 in one-year government securities and thereby earn an interest of Rs 4.526 in the first year. The return on investment of Rs 27 in equities will be slightly better than the overall return for the policyholder.         
	If the insurer wants to ensure the guaranteed return for the entire term of the policy, it will have to allocate 54 per cent in government securities and the remaining 46 per cent in equities. This will be the likely scenario for single premium policies. In either case, it has to be primarily a debt investment and the return for policyholders will be significantly low.         
	In fact, it will also reduce the fund management fee income for insurers because the charges for managing debt funds are lower than equity funds.         
	Now, the insurer will also have to comply with the IRDAs regulation on maximum charges in Ulips, that is 2.25 per cent in the case of policies above 15 years and 3 per cent in the case of policies for 10 years or below.         
	In other words, if the insurer has to guarantee a 4.5 per cent return net of all expenses, including agency commission and fund management charges, it will have to actually earn more than 10 per cent on investment every year which will be a very difficult task. Thus, all the three regulations will make unit-linked pension plans less attractive for both policyholders and insurers.         
	Difficult to guarantee        
	GV Nageswara Rao, managing director and chief executive officer of IDBI Fortis Life Insurance, said the 4.5 per cent guaranteed return norm would force life insurers to go for 100 per cent debt exposure in pension plans as no companies will take the risk of investing in equities. With a portfolio that is largely or completely debt-oriented, a 4.5 per cent annual return will become unsustainable over a long term, he said.        
	According to Deepak Sood, chief executive officer of Future Generali Life Insurance, it would be difficult for insurers to guarantee a return of 4.5 per cent on funds, especially on a long-term pension plan in a regular annual premium payment mode.         
	Designing pension products will be difficult, said Gorakh Nath Agarwal, chief actuary, Future Generali Life Insurance. We would like investment capital guarantee instead of a guarantee on investment return, he added.

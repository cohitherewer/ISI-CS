The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Strict Jindal terms for Rocklands
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Strict Jindal terms for Rocklands
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Mine game                                   
	Calcutta, Feb. 1: Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) has laid out strict terms and conditions to acquire Australian coal mining firm Rocklands Richfield.        
	The development follows a confirmation by the Naveen Jindal company to go ahead with the offer of Aus$0.56 per share after meeting the Rocklands management in early January in Delhi.        
	The board of the Australian company will soon meet to discuss the conditions laid out by the Jindals as well as an offer from Chinese company Meijin.        
	To begin with, JSPL said it would carry out drilling for four months in the prospective coal blocks in Australia to ascertain the volume of deposits. The expenses will have to be borne by Rocklands.        
	The Aussie company claims it has three prospects in Queenslands Bowen Basin with an estimated reserves of 900 million tonnes.        
	Jindal has demanded an exclusivity period during drilling, meaning Rocklands cannot entertain any other offer, including Meijins.        
	Moreover, JSPL has sought a board berth with a 13.6 per cent shareholding in the company and the power to nominate a member till its holding remains 10 per cent or more.        
	Another Indian firm, Tata Steel, has close to 20 per cent in Australias Riversdale but does not have a place on its board.        
	Jindal has also sought to become the operator of Rocklands metallurgical coke plants in China, if its holding goes up to 19.9 per cent.        
	Meanwhile, JSPL has demanded a preferential share allotment from the Aussie firm to raise its holding to 15 per cent.         
	The shares will have to be placed at Aus$0.42 apiece, the price at which JSPL had entered the fray to buy Rocklands in September.        
	The companys scrip was down 11 per cent today on the Australian Securities Exchange to Aus$0.29.        
	The terms set out by JSPL are the clearest so far and are unlikely to be met in totality by the board of Rocklands.         
	Industry observers say the Indian company wants to move with caution as it seeks to secure coking coal for its domestic business.

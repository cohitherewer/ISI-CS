                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Panel to study Trai proposals on 2G
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Calling attention                                  
	New Delhi, July 7: The department of telecom today set up a committee to study the recent proposals of telecom regulator Trai on 2G spectrum pricing and allocation.        
	The internal committee, headed by DoT member (technology) Chandra Prakash, will discuss all the issues with telecom operators and send its views to the Telecom Commission for a final call.        
	Issues under consideration of the panel are linking the price of 2G spectrum with 3G spectrum, the methodology for the allocation of additional 2G spectrum and the order in which these airwaves would be awarded to the operators.        
	Besides, the panel will discuss the waiver of the lock-in period for the promoters of new firms and the rollout obligations of operators.         
	The Prime Ministers Office had recently asked telecom minister A. Raja to transfer all decisions on Trais latest recommendations to the empowered group of ministers headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.         
	BSNL stake sale        
	In a separate meeting, the Telecom Commission, the apex decision-making body of the department of telecom (DoT), has decided to defer the listing of state-owned BSNL.         
	Officials said the commission wanted the divestment to be deferred till BSNLs enterprise value was increased. The Telecom Commission will send its decision to the DoT for approval.        
	While BSNL is yet to declare its results for the financial year-ended March 2010, analysts said the firm was likely to show a loss of Rs 2,611 crore for this period from a profit of Rs 575 crore a year earlier. This is the first time the PSU would report losses since it was spun off from the DoT in 2000.        
	The BSNL board had cleared a plan to divest 10 per cent in the company through an initial public offering (IPO) in 2008 to raise about Rs 10,000 crore to fund expansion.        
	Earlier this year, the Sam Pitroda panel, set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to improve the financial health of the PSU, had also recommended a strategic stake sale and staff cut by a third.         
	The panel, which also included banker Deepak Parekh and telecom secretary P.J. Thomas, proposed that the government should sell a 30 per cent stake in the company through an IPO and also raise funds from the sale of assets such as signal towers and real estate.         
	The BSNL board in March had approved the Pitroda panels recommendations on the strategic stake sale, but opposition from employee unions had stalled plans to tap the market for over two years.         
	In the past 30 months, the board approved plans to list the company thrice, but each time the government was forced to go on the back foot because the employees were against the selloff.

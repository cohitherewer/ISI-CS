The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Refining capacity set to surge
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Refining capacity set to surge

	New Delhi, Dec. 2: State-owned Bharat Petroleums new refinery at Bina in Madhya Pradesh, to be commissioned next month, is the first of a clutch of such facilities to debut within a span of just 15 months ending March 31, 2012, ramping up domestic capacity to 238 million tonnes (mt) per annum by the end of the fiscal from 196.38 mt now.         
	Apart from the 6mt Bina unit, the other refineries to be commissioned next fiscal are at Punjabs Bhatinda, Orissas Paradip and Tamil Nadus Cuddalore.        
	Though the country imports almost 80 per cent of its crude oil requirements, the surplus refined petroleum products are exported and are the biggest foreign exchange earners. During 2009-10, India exported about 51 million metric tonnes of petroleum products worth around $31 billion, oil minister Murli Deora said.        
	The rush to start the refining units is also prompted by the seven-year tax holiday they will get if they take off before the end of fiscal 2012.        
	Officials said the new refineries would have to earn margins of at least $10 per barrel to meet just their capital needs. To cover operational costs, a margin of another $3-$4 per barrel is required. Thus, a new refinery would have to earn a gross margin of around $13-$14 per barrel to be financially viable.        
	This can be achieved if a refinery is set up within the time period as not many nations are expanding their capacities.        
	Energy analysts said, The countrys cost-effective manufacturing base puts the refinery margins to be the highest in the world. It scores on operational expenditures such as labour, maintenance, insurance and also the construction costs.        
	Indian Oil Corporation is investing Rs 29,777 crore in a refinery at Paradip in Orissa with an installed capacity of 15 mt, while BPCLs joint venture with Oman Oil Company is setting up the Bina unit at an investment of Rs 11,397 crore.        
	HPCL, in a joint venture with Mittal Energy Investments, is spending Rs 18,919 crore in a 9mt refinery at Bhatinda in Punjab. Nagarjuna Oil Corporation is setting up a Rs 6,960-crore refinery of 6mt capacity at Cuddalore.        
	Refineries at Haldia, Mumbai, Vizag, Manali, Panipat, Mangalore and Koyali are expanding their existing capacities.         
	According to a JP Morgan report, the growth of global refining capacity over the last decade was an average 1.2 per cent annually, while demand grew 1.8 per cent.

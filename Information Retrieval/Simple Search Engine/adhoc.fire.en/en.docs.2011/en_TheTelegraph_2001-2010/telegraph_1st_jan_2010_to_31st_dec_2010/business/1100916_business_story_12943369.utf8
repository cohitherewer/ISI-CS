                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mines bill to come up with please-all answer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Handique: Stern                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: The government is likely to favour the sharing of revenues by mining companies with the local population displaced by their projects in contrast to sharing 26 per cent of their profits, which has little support from industry.        
	The group of ministers, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, is slated to meet on Friday to discuss the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Bill, 2010, which favours the profit-sharing principle.        
	In addition, mining firms will pay the displaced not only the market value of the land but also a fixed sum over a period of time.        
	The Haryana government is following this annuity method of compensation, which has the support of Congress president Sonia Gandhi.         
	Besides the market value of the land, farmers in Haryana get Rs 15,000 for 33 years with a Rs 500 raise every year.         
	Mining firms have opposed the profit-sharing initiative of the government on the ground that the new measures could impact investments.         
	However, the mining ministry is keen to push through the profit plan.        
	On whether the government will consider lowering the amount that firms will have to share with the locals, mines minister B.K. Handique said, We are not going to reduce it (profit sharing).        
	The bill is significant in the wake of the governments decision to deny permission to Anil Agarwals Vedanta to mine bauxite in Orissas Niyamgiri.         
	Though the decision was prompted by the projects alleged impact on the environment, wider concerns about the future of the local population have come into the limelight.

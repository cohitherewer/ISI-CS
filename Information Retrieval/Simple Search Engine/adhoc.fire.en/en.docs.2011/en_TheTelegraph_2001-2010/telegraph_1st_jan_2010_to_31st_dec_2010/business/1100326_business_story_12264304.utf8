	The Essar group has signed a definitive agreement to purchase Aries coal mines in Indonesia for around $150-200 million. The deal gives Essar Power access to an estimated resource base of 100 million tonnes of thermal coal and mineable reserves of 64 million tonnes.

	The high-quality bituminous coal has a gross calorific value (GCV) of 6,000 with low ash and low moisture and is suitable for power plants. Production from the Indonesian mine is expected to start within a year.         
	Anshuman Ruia, director of Essar Group, said: The Indonesia mines are an excellent addition to our growing portfolio of coal assets.

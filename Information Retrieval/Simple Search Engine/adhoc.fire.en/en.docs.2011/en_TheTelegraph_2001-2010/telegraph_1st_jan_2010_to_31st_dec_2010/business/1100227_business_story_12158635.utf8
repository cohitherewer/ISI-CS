	The top line of Budget 2010-11 looks great from a savings and investment perspective. This is amply clear from the reaction of most salary earners, as well as the stock market. However, whether the fine print of the budget holds the kind of unpleasant surprises that some earlier budgets have had remains to be seen. On day zero, the huge reduction in income tax outgo is what is holding the attention of most of us on a personal level. This upward move of the tax slab is welcome, and so is the re-articulation of the time-table on the Direct Tax Code.         
	However, Ive always felt that the very concept of fixed tax slabs is unfair. The increase of tax slabs should be linked to some sort of a cost inflation index. If so many other numbers in the tax system can be percentages that go up automatically as the underlying value increases (including the amount you pay as income tax), then why shouldnt the exemption limit and the slabs go up automatically with inflation?                   
	There is also a new Rs 20,000 deduction from taxable income. To use this new tax break, taxpayers will have to invest the money in infrastructure bonds. This is good in that it saves money, but I dont quite like the fact that the government has again started specifying where one should invest money to get tax-breaks. Earlier, the government used to divide the Rs 1 lakh into separate slabs, each meant for a different type of asset. Effectively, the tax system specified how much you could put into equity and how much in what kind of debt regardless of your financial profile was.         
	In the 2005 budget, the law was changed so that each investor could decide his own allocation. Also, Im not sure whether the primary problem for infrastructure today is so much a lack of debt financing or something else.         
	Anyhow, the fact remains that come April 1, all of us will face tax deductions that will be smaller by a pleasing margin, leaving aside more money to buy more expensive petrol and diesel. And the government should change this Rs 1 lakh limit to one that automatically adjusts upward with inflation.        
	One of the more interesting moves is the one to kickstart the New Pension System. The NPS is the best way for small savers to build up some financial security for retirement. However, the scheme has proven difficult to market. In the absence of commission-earning agents, theres no one to sell the NPS. Now, the finance minister has unveiled a truly innovative way of attracting lower-income unorganised workers into the NPS. The government has decided to give a joining gift to this category of potential saver.        
	The government will basically give a gift of Rs 1,000 per year for three years. This scheme is open only to those who deposit less than Rs 12,000 per year and start their account in 2010-11. Since this is a pension system, the money is not available till its usable as a pension on attaining retirement age. For a young person, this Rs 3000 welcome gift from the NPS would grow manifold till she retires.         
	The stock market has given a huge thumbs-up to the budget, although by the end of the day, the markets enthusiasm had become a lot more tempered. This enthusiasm seems to stem from the promise of controlling fiscal deficit to 5.5 per cent. But this is a budget estimate. Whether this is achieved will be another story.

	Small budget proposals for 2010-11 announced by Pranab Mukherjee today have brought big smiles on the faces of millions of taxpayers in the country. Income slabs for various tax rates have been liberalised, thereby giving relief in the overall tax liability for the financial year 2010-11. Anybody whose income is above Rs 10 lakh will enjoy savings of Rs 51,500 in the overall tax liability which translates into an additional Rs 4,300 a month in the pocket. Apart from the above-mentioned relief, taxpayers can save additional tax by investing Rs 20,000 in long-term infrastructure bonds to be specified by the government. Taxpayers in a 30 per cent tax bracket can save additional Rs 6,000 by investing Rs 20,000 in these infrastructure bonds. The government is very keen to promote the new pension scheme and has assured to contribute a certain amount from its side to every individual joining the same.                  
	Various small saving schemes are quite popular among middle classes throughout the country because of the safety of investment and reasonable returns. In the past 12 months, overall mobilisation of schemes such as PPF, post office monthly income schemes and senior citizen saving scheme has improved considerably because investors find these schemes a very safe option compared with other avenues such as investing in stock market or mutual funds.        
	At present, most of the small saving schemes such as NSC, KVP and post office monthly schemes offer an 8 per cent interest per annum, which is taxable though. On the other hand, bank deposits give an average yield of 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent annually and, therefore, the popularity of these schemes has been on the rise.        
	PPF, which offers 8 per cent tax-free income, continues to be the darling of investors for its unique benefits. Investment in six-year lock-in schemes such as national savings certificate and Kisan Vikas Patra are avoidable as post-tax return in these instruments is not even equivalent to the current inflation rate. Two schemes  post office MIS and senior citizen saving scheme  are suitable investment options for retired individuals and senior citizens seeking risk-free regular returns.        
	In a nut shell, this years budget proposals are neither favourable to small saving schemes nor against them.

	The common man had a lot of expectations from this years budget as his average household budget was reeling under pressure because of high inflation costs and other adverse economic conditions. Also, he was exercising caution as the finance minister had his own challenges from macro economic perspective, especially in terms of managing the rising fiscal deficit. Further, the challenge was to provide some relief to the common tax payer and at the same time put a check on the rising costs of food and oil subsidy. Besides, there was a pressure to roll back the fiscal stimulus package. Therefore, the government decided to adopt a mid path, pleasing the common man by giving some tax concessions and simultaneously taking away a portion of the benefits by raising the fuel prices.                  
	Still, there are many positives to look forward to in the current years budget. There has been a long pending demand to increase the tax slab rates for individuals and reduce the overall effective tax rate. Even though the minimum threshold limit below which income is not liable to tax has been retained at the same level of Rs 1.6 lakh for individuals, Rs 1.9 lakh for women and Rs 2.4 lakh for senior citizens, there has been an increase in the slab rates. In general, individuals earning income of Rs 3 lakh or more per annum are likely to benefit in terms of tax savings. In fact, the individuals having income above Rs 8 lakh are likely to gain maximum in terms of tax savings exceeding Rs 50,000 per annum.         
	Even though the expectation was to increase the overall threshold limit for investment u/s 80C from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh, the government has, however, decided to provide additional deduction for investments made in the infrastructure bonds for up to Rs 20,000. This is a welcome move as besides helping individuals save some tax, this would also provide a large pool of funds for infrastructure development requirements.         
	In respect of individuals / SMEs carrying on business, increase in the overall threshold limit from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 60 lakh to get the concessional benefits under presumptive taxation would help reduce their compliance and administrative costs as they would neither be required to maintain detailed books of accounts; nor would they be required to get a mandatory tax audit done. Similarly, encouraging small firms whose total turnover/gross receipts do not exceed Rs 60 lakh in any of the three preceding three years to convert into LLP is again a welcome move and would help SMEs avail themselves of the tax benefits like exemption from MAT and dividend distribution tax.        
	Macro economic perspective : To encourage the people from unorganised sector to voluntarily save for the retirement, the government has proposed to contribute Rs 1,000 per year to each new NPS account opened in the coming financial year. This benefit would be available for persons who join NPS with a minimum contribution of Rs.1,000 and maximum contribution of Rs 12,000 per annum for the next three years.         
	Social security is indeed a matter of concern in our country. A good start has been made in this direction by setting up a National Social Security Fund for the unorganised sector workers covering weavers, rickshaw pullers with an initial corpus of Rs 1,000 crore. Even though, all the people in the unorganised sector should be covered under this scheme, nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction and we can hope that both the scope and the quantum of this scheme would be enhanced over the years to cover larger population. So far so good, though the increase in price of petrol will hit the common man. Further, this is an indication that government will consider the recommendations of the Parikh Committee to rationalise the oil prices and it is likely that prices may go up further this financial year. Therefore, with limited options available, it is still a good deal for the aam aadmi!

	In a budget that strongly roots for infrastructure-led growth and social development, insurance has been given no more than scant attention. The finance minister has by and large ignored the sector. The extension of the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana to cover more workers under the poverty line and inclusion of contributions to the central government health scheme as deduction under the I-T Act are just about the only positive signs displayed in the budget so far as insurance is concerned.                  
	A far greater idea expressed in the budget  but not too explicitly, and, therefore, could well lead to plenty of discussion in the days ahead  is the proposed council for financial stability and development. This apex-level body would monitor macro prudential supervision of the economy. Interestingly, large financial conglomerates would be covered by it as well.        
	The point to be noted here is that several players could easily fit the bill (naturally, the budget does not define conglomerates). Some have in recent years entered the insurance business too, mostly in association with foreign partners; at any rate, these are large players with a national footprint.        
	The proposed council, to be viewed against the backdrop of the recent financial crisis that has altered the global financial markets, would ostensibly empower the maintenance of financial stability. It remains to be seen whether the government would be able to fulfil its stated objective: no prejudice to the autonomy of the existing regulatory agencies. As things stand, there are separate regulators for banking, securities, insurance and pensions. In many cases, the dividing lines between them have blurred.        
	Now, to quickly recap, the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, rolled out in April 2008, was aimed at offering a health insurance cover to workers below the poverty line. As the finance minister pointed out, one crore-plus smart cards have been issued under it. The government now plans to widen its ambit with a view to cover Mahatma Gandhi NREGA beneficiaries who have worked for more than 15 days during the preceding financial year.        
	On another front, contributions to the central government health scheme will now be considered as deductions for computing income tax. These contributions will be treated similar to what are paid by individuals to maintain their health insurance schemes.        
	The budget has underlined the significance of insurance as a tool for greater financial inclusion. In a country where financial inclusion has historically stayed abysmal, insurance and assorted services would be, in the years ahead, delivered through the business correspondent model for small habitations with population in excess of 2000. Sixty thousand such habitations are expected to be covered.        
	While the finance minister has been fairly generous in broadening the tax slabs and even boosting the newly-introduced pension system, not much attention has been paid to the fact that insurance too is a long-term savings mechanism, one that could add immense value to a tax-payers retirement strategy. In fact, the budget has allowed a deduction of an extra Rs 20,000 for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds. This is over and above the Rs 1 lakh limit on tax savings.        
	Investment in insurance  in pure-term plans to be held for a long stretch  could perhaps have been given a similar status. Such a measure could have surely persuaded more individuals to allocate greater amounts to insurance, thereby increasing the social relevance of the sector. This could also have, in a small way at least, altered the insurance industrys obsession with short-term unit-linked plans and even partially shifted its focus to sustainable, long-term products.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: Stimulus measures and a pick-up in domestic demand will help the country grow at 7.5 per cent this fiscal, up from 6.7 per cent a year ago, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said today.        
	In the current financial year, the growth rate of the economy is likely to be 7.5 per cent, Singh said while addressing a meeting of chief ministers on price rise.        
	During the mid-year review of the economy in December last year, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said the growth rate could exceed 7.75 per cent during 2009-10, mainly on account of stimulus provided by the government to help the industry face the impact of the global financial meltdown.        
	The optimism about the higher growth rate stems from the fact that the economy grew at 7.9 per cent growth during the second quarter (July-September 2009-10) despite drought and floods affecting agriculture.        
	The Prime Minister said last year was dominated by the concern to protect the economy from the effects of the global economic slowdown and the government had done well on this front by acting swiftly.        
	The government acted swiftly and I am happy to say that we have done fairly well on that front. At a time when the industrialised countries experienced a sharp decline in output we have only seen a modest deceleration and the growth rate in the first year of the global crisis 2008-09 was 6.7 per cent, he added.        
	Singh said the government had greatly expanded public spending in rural areas, especially in employment intensive activities, and it had helped in creating rural income. I am particularly happy to say that we have also been able to protect the inclusiveness of the growth process to a large extent, he added.

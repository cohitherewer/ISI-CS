          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Flying high                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: Boeing will invest $100 million to set up a maintenance, repair and overhaul centre in Nagpur by the second quarter of this year. The project will be a joint venture with state-run Air India         
	We deliberately delayed the MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) project as we wanted to time it to match with the delivery of the Boeing 787 Dreamliners to Air India. Now, we are on track to deliver the first 787 Dreamliner to Air India by the second quarter of 2011, Boeing India chief Dinesh Keskar told reporters here.        
	The Dreamliners were originally scheduled to be delivered in late 2009.         
	Air India has ordered 27 of the twin-aisle, long-haul aircraft. The MRO would come up by late 2013 or early 2014, Keskar said.        
	About 50 acres had been allotted by the Maharashtra Airport Development Company and construction will start in the second quarter of this year.        
	Keskar said the MRO facility was intended to serve 23 Boeing 777s, 27 Dreamliner 787s as also other aircraft such as the 737s ordered by Air India.        
	The B-787s will not require major checks immediately after their deliveries.         
	The facility would be fully in place when these aircraft need high-level checks.        
	The Boeing India chief projected India would require planes worth $100 billion over the next 20 years, with single-aisle aircraft forming the bulk of the demand worth $60 billion.

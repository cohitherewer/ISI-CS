The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sesa hurdle to Vedanta plan
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sesa hurdle to Vedanta plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 25: Anil Agarwals troubles continue to escalate.        
	A day after minister for environment and forests Jairam Ramesh put the skids on a 6-million-tonne alumina refinery at Lanjigarh in Orissa, a minority shareholder of Sesa Goa filed a suit in the Supreme Court to stop London-based Vedanta Resources from dipping into the iron ore exporters cash chest to pay a part of Cairn Indias acquisition cost.        
	The suit has the potential to drive the Cairn India acquisition plans off the rails.        
	Sources said Harinarayan Bajaj, a minority shareholder in Sesa Goa, had moved an application in the Supreme Court, asking the apex court to disallow Sesa Goa from making an open offer to mop up 20 per cent from Cairn Indias minority shareholders.         
	Last week, Vedanta struck a deal with Cairn Energy Plc under which it proposed to acquire a 60 per stake in Cairn India in a deal valued at $9.6 billion.        
	Under the terms of the arrangement, Vedanta Resources Plc would hold up to 40 per cent in Cairn India with Sesa Goa holding another 20 per cent.        
	Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta Resources has a 56 per cent stake in Sesa Goa and had planned to use the Goan iron ore miner to make the mandatory open offer.        
	Vedanta had planned to buy out Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy Plcs stake in the India entity at a price of Rs 405 per share, which included a non-compete fee of Rs 50 a share.         
	However, the price for the open offer  which is scheduled to commence on October 11was capped at Rs 355 a share.        
	Bajaj has argued that Vedantas acquisition of Sesa Goa has itself violated provisions of the takeover regulations and is being challenged through a case that is already before the Supreme Court. As a result, he contended that Sesa Goa could not come out with the open offer for Cairn India.        
	Bajaj had approached Bombay High Court contesting Vedantas takeover of Sesa Goa.        
	Officials of Vedanta and Sesa Goa could not be reached for comments on the latest development.

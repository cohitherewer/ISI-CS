It will take at least a month for the ministry to study the production sharing contracts and formulate its opinion, oil secretary S. Sundareshan said.                            
	 New Delhi, Sept. 16: The cabinet committee on economic affairs is likely to approve the 20 per cent follow-on offer of the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) next week, which may fetch close to Rs 1,400 crore.

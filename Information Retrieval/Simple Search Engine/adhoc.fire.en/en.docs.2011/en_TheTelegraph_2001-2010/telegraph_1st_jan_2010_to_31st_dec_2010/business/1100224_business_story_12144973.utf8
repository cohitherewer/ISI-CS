	Our attention is once again on what the budget may have in store, this time two days ahead on February 26 instead of the customary February. 28. The proposed direct taxes code (DTC) seeks to replace the present income tax (I-T) legislation from April 1, 2011. Under these circumstances, we should not expect radical changes in the budget from the perspective of direct tax. As we foresee, the budget, in all likelihood, will introduce changes that are necessary or are in the same direction as what DTC will bring in comprehensively in 2011.        
	However, we live on hope and as famously said by Albert Einstein Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow, corporate India does have a few expectations from the budget, as mentioned below:         
	Lowering of corporate tax rate and abolishing surcharge: The finance minister while delivering his budget speech for 2009-10 proposed to phase out surcharge on various direct taxes and as an initial step also eliminated the surcharge on personal income tax.         
	It is expected that this year there should be a reduction in the corporate tax rates and elimination of surcharge as shown in the chart.         
	Boosting infrastructure: Infrastructure development has been identified by the government as one of the key thrust areas. Infrastructure capital companies, or funds investing in infrastructure firms, have long been insisting on restoration of section 10 (23G) of I-T act (which was withdrawn earlier) for exemption of interest income for financing infrastructure projects.         
	It is proposed that the said exemption be reinstated to lower the cost of borrowing funds of infrastructure companies and meet the objectives of development.        
	The countrys mission towards infrastructure development would further be indicated by keeping all companies engaged in power and infrastructure projects and enjoying tax holiday benefit outside the purview of the minimum alternate tax.        
	Boosting exports: Currently, the sunset clause on tax holiday for newly established unit in a free trade zone or hundred per cent export oriented units under section 10A/10B is March 31, 2011. It is proposed that the sunset clause should be suitably amended to allow deduction to units eligible within March 31, 2011 for the entire tax holiday period of 10 years.         
	Mergers amp; acquisitions: The tax benefit for carry forward and set off of accumulated loss and unabsorbed depreciation in respect of amalgamation is currently limited to companies owning industrial undertaking, ship, hotel or PSUs engaged the business of operation of aircraft or to a banking company.         
	With acquisitions and mergers taking place in almost all sectors, this benefit should be extended to all businesses, including financial services, entertainment, sports, information technology and IT-enabled services.        
	Encouraging limited liability partnership (LLP): Finance Act 2009 has recognised LLP as a taxable entity by including it under the definition of a firm. To encourage conversion of companies to LLP, it is proposed that specific provisions should be introduced to effectuate tax-neutral conversion.         
	We hope that the above expectations are favourably considered by the finance minister, as this would go a long way in satisfying the aspirations of the companies, whose contribution to employment generation and the economic growth of India is immense.

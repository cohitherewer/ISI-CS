	Mumbai, May 10: Vedanta Resources, the London listed metals and mining company, will acquire the zinc operations of Anglo American Plc for $1.3 billion, making the Anil Agarwal company the worlds largest zinc producer and helping it establish a foothold in Europe and Africa.        
	The buyout will be routed through Hindustan Zinc, which manages the groups zinc business and has cash reserves of more than $2 billion. The asset purchase will be funded from existing cash resources and immediately add to Vedantas earnings.         
	The two companies today signed a definitive share purchase agreement under which the ownership will be transferred to the Anil Agarwal company from January 1.        
	Vedanta said Anglo American was one of the top five global zinc producers. Its assets include the Skorpion mine in Namibia, the Lisheen mine in Ireland and the Black Mountain Mining, which includes the Black Mountain mine and the Gamsberg project in South Africa.         
	Of the total acquisition cost of $1.3 billion, the Skorpion mine is valued at $698 million, while the Lisheen and Black Mountain mines are worth $308 million and $332 million, respectively.        
	For the year ended December 2009, Anglo American Zinc generated a gross revenue of $670 million and an operating profit of $154 million. It had gross assets of $845 million.         
	Vedanta said it would increase its zinc and lead production from 1,064 kilo tonnes per annum (ktpa) to 1,462 ktpa, representing 11 per cent of the global zinc market.        
	Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal said while the assets would complement its existing portfolio, the company would rapidly develop Gamsberg, known for its high-quality zinc.        
	News of the acquisition sent shares of Hindustan Zinc soaring on the bourses. The stock rose 3.61 per cent, or Rs 39.05, to close at Rs 1,119.30 on the BSE.

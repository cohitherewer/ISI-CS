	 Calcutta, March 4: S.K. Birla-owned VXL Technologies has developed a distress alert transmitter in association with the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) to help fishermen on sea and boost maritime security. The company has supplied 1,000 transmitters to Isro and another 1000 are being prepared. The technology has been developed by the space organisation at the behest of the Indian Coast Guard, which has distributed the transmitters to some fishermen.                             
	 New Delhi, March 4: The finance ministry today ruled out a rollback of service tax on real estate developers at the time of construction, a move which the industry said would jack up housing and commercial property prices. Construction is a service. As a service, there is no reason why it should not be taxed, revenue secretary Sunil Mitra said.

	Calcutta, Sept. 1: Tata Chemicals is planning to set up a new plant to cater to the growing demand for water purifiers.        
	The company, which makes the Swach purifier at Haldia only, will put in around Rs 50 crore for the second unit.         
	R. Mukundan, managing director of Tata Chemicals, said the plant would be close to the rice-producing belt.         
	The purifier has an in-built bulb-like instrument made of rice husk ash, impregnated with nano-silver particles.        
	The Haldia plant can make around one million units. The new plant is likely to produce the same volume.         
	We hope to end the year with 80,000 a month sales, giving an annualised figure of one million, he said at the launch of Swach here today.        
	Ashvini Hiran, chief operating officer (consumer products) of Tata Chemicals, said there would be 3-4 plants in India eventually.         
	Mukundan also hinted at going overseas.

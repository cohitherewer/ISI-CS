The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tokyo trading gets faster
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tokyo trading gets faster
                            
	Tokyo, Jan. 3 (Reuters): The Tokyo Stock Exchange, Asias largest equity bourse, said it would go ahead with the launch of its trading system as planned on Monday after running the final checks.         
	The new system will be able to process trades in 5 milliseconds, 600 times faster than the 2-3 seconds needed on the current system, and roughly the same speed as the New York and London stock exchanges.         
	A spokesperson for the bourse said the exchange ran final checks on the system, called Arrowhead, and determined that it was ready to be launched as planned on January 4, the first trading day of 2010.         
	Analysts say Arrowhead should allow for more computer-driven trading, including high frequency trading where algorithms are used to trade thousands of shares in milliseconds to profit from tiny spreads and market imbalances.         
	The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which plans to go public after April 2010, is betting on Arrowhead after several computer glitches tarnished its image with investors.         
	Last month, the exchange was ordered to pay $120.5 million in damages to Mizuho Securities for a botched trade in 2005. A 2006 accounting scandal at Livedoor Co sparked a massive sell-off of the Internet company. Unable to handle the rush of orders from panicked investors, the Tokyo exchange had to curtail its trading hours for three months.         
	Meanwhile, the Nikkei average booked a 19 per cent gain in 2009, with shares of high-tech exporters leading a rebound rally on a weaker yen.         
	The benchmarks yearly climb followed a 42 per cent plunge  the biggest loss in its 58-year history  last year when investors saw the global financial crisis take a heavy toll on risky assets, including stocks.

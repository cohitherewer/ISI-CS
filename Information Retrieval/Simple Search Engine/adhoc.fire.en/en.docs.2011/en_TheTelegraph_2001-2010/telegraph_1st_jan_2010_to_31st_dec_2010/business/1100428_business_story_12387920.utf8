          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 27: Nasscom has suggested that the IT and BPO industry should adopt the concept of an ombudsperson.        
	The Nasscom Governance and Ethics Committee, which was formed last year by the industry association following the Satyam fiasco, today said the concept of ombudsperson in the industry would give stakeholders the confidence and accessibility to raise their concerns.         
	The committee today released a report suggesting recommendations to further strengthen corporate governance practices in the Indian IT-BPO industry.         
	The ombudsperson should preferably be from the senior management team of a company, the report said.         
	According to the report, the responsibility of an ombudsperson includes ensuring that the stakeholders voicing their concerns are protected against any abuse, bias or improper treatment, investigating their concerns and report findings and taking appropriate action.        
	The committee also recommended the adoption of whistleblowing policy to enable stakeholders to raise their concerns about any malpractice, impropriety, abuse or wrongdoing at an early stage and in the right way, without fear of victimisation, subsequent discrimination or disadvantage.        
	The policy is intended to encourage and enable the stakeholders to raise concerns with the company rather than overlook the problem, the committee said.         
	The IT-BPO sector goes beyond just regulatory compliance and involves robust governance practices and ethical behaviour which not only hinges on the functioning of the board but also on how various interconnected building blocks of the ecosystem work together.         
	I am convinced that, with these guidelines, the Indian IT-BPO industry will become the flag bearer for best practices in corporate governance across sectors, N.R. Narayana Murthy, chairman of the Nasscom committee, said.

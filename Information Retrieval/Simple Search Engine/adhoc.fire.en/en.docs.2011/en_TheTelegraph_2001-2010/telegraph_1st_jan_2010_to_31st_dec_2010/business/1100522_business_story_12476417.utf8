          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dasgupta: Seeking consensus                                  
	New Delhi, May 21: The government today expressed its willingness to increase the compensation to states for switching to GST.        
	While the 13th Finance Commission has recommended a compensation of Rs 50,000 crore, states have been demanding Rs 1 lakh crore to offset any revenue loss that may arise because of the implementation of the new tax regime.        
	After a meeting of the empowered committee of state finance ministers, chairman Asim Dasgupta said, The Union finance minister has communicated to us that he is prepared to go beyond it (the 13th Finance Commissions recommendation on the compensation). This is a very important suggestion coming from the Union finance ministry.        
	Dasgupta also expressed hope that a concrete paper on the constitutional amendments to introduce GST would be ready within a fortnight.        
	The states have lowered the central sales tax to 2 per cent, signalling its gradual elimination with the launch of the GST.         
	In January, negotiations between the Centre and the states came to a standstill because of differences over the compensation package.         
	The task force set up by the Finance Commission recommended the Rs 50,000-crore compensation as a grand bargain to incentivise the states to migrate to GST during the first five years.         
	However, the commission made this compensation package conditional on states agreeing to introduce GST before 2013 at a single rate, along with other features.

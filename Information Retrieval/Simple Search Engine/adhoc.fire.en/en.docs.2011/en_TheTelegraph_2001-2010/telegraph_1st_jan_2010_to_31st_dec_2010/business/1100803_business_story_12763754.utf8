                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      McLeod weighs unit in Dubai
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Khaitan: Growth plans                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 2: City-based McLeod Russel India Ltd plans to set up a tea blending facility in Dubai.        
	We have teas of Uganda, Assam and Vietnam. We are now planning to offer blended tea. We are contemplating new lines of sales, managing director Aditya Khaitan said on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting here today.        
	Mcleod Russel, through its wholly owned unit Borelli Tea Holdings Britain, has acquired the Phu Ben Tea Company of Vietnam in 2009. In the same year it acquired six tea gardens in Uganda.        
	The company expects the unit to start blending by November.         
	We are thinking of setting up the unit in Dubai because it has a multi-origin set-up. We now need to add value to what we have instead of just selling tea. Its a new product we want to bring to the market, he said.        
	According to him, the company will target West Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States as these regions have a good market for blended varieties.        
	McLeod expects its domestic production to be flat in the range of 77.2 million kg this year. The company had set a target of 80 million kg.        
	Khaitan said he expected prices to be about Rs 150 per kg this year against Rs 137 per kg in 2009-10.         
	A higher price realisation was expected on the back of crop loss because of heavy rainfall in north India early this year.        
	McLeod aims to treble its turnover to Rs 3,000 crore and double production capacity to nearly 200 million kg over the next five years. Global black tea production is around 2 billion kg per annum. McLeod Russel produces about 4 per cent of that. Our target is to double this in five years, Khaitan had said.         
	The company has reported a 38 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 18.85 crore during the first quarter of this fiscal.         
	Net sales grew marginally higher to Rs 122.45 crore compared with Rs 120.81 crore in the corresponding year-ago period.

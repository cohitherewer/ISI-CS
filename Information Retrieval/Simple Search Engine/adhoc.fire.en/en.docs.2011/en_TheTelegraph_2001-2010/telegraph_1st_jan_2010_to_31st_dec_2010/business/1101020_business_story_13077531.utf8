          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bumper response                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 19: The State Bank of Indias first retail bond issue of Rs 1,000 crore was subscribed over 17 times on the opening day, thanks to the attractive interest rates offered by the countrys largest lender.        
	Following the huge response, its now learnt, that the SBI may close the issue for subscription tomorrow against the scheduled date of October 25. The issue opened for subscription yesterday.        
	According to sources, the response to the SBI bond issue was equally strong among high networth individuals (HNIs) and retail investors.         
	While the portion meant for HNIs was subscribed over 17 times, retail investors put bids more than 5 times the portion reserved for the category.        
	The State Bank is looking to raise Rs 1,000 crore through this bond issue, which is offering an interest rate of 9.25 per cent for 10 years and 9.5 per cent for 15 years. The lower tier II bonds will help the SBI jack up its capital adequacy ratio and meet long-term cash need.        
	Citigroup, Kotak Mahindra Capital and SBI Capital Markets are the managers for the issue. The bonds are proposed to be listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).        
	Market observers feel the success of the SBI offering may prompt other banks to come up with similar bond issues.        
	The success of the SBI issue comes at a time three other big players are in the market chasing investors. While the Coal India IPO opened for subscription yesterday, IDFC and L amp;T Infrastructure Finance Company are also in the market to raise funds through their long-term infrastructure bonds.        
	Though the SBI offering will fetch higher return than infrastructure bonds, the latter qualifies for tax benefits under section 80CCF of the income tax act.        
	Coal India        
	On the second day of the flotation, Coal India generated demand worth over Rs 26,000 crore for the shares on offer. The government expects to raise an estimated Rs 15,000 crore through this IPO.        
	The coal behemoths mega initial public offer, the countrys largest so far, got demands for 1.71 times of shares on offer by the end of the second day of the issue today.        
	The issue attracted bids for over 108 crore shares against 63.1 crore equities on offer, according to the data available till 5 pm on the NSE.        
	The issue is priced in the range of Rs 225 and Rs 245 a share. The government is divesting 10 per cent of its stake in CIL.

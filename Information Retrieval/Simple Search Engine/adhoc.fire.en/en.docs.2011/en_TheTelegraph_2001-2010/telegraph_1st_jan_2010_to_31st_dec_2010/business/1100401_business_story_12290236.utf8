          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 31: Zain, Kuwaits biggest mobile phone company, expects a profit of $3.3 billion from the sale of its African assets to Indias Bharti Airtel after settling debt and provisions.         
	The gain is expected to be reflected in Zains second-quarter financial statement, the company informed the Kuwait bourse today.        
	Yesterday, Bharti Airtel had agreed to buy the African assets of Zain, also known as Mobile Telecom, for $9 billion. The Indian company will also assume $1.7 billion of debt accumulated by Zain, whose total enterprise value stands at $10.7 billion.        
	This acquisition will increase Bhartis customer base to around 179 million in 18 countries. Bharti had launched services in India in 1995, Sri Lanka in 2009 and acquired Bangladeshs Warid in January this year.         
	According to the Zain statement, the transaction stipulates that Bharti will pay $9 billion, of which $8.3 billion will be handed over on the closing of the deal, while $700 million will be paid one year after that.         
	Last month, Zain had expected to post returns of up to $5 billion, by selling its operations in 15 African countries, including Nigeria and Gabon. Zain units in Sudan and Morocco are excluded from the deal.         
	The Kuwaiti firm said it would distribute a large proportion of the upfront payment it received from Bharti as dividend to shareholders.        
	The key countries to be added to Bhartis network will be Tanzania (Zain has 39 per cent share), Zambia (70 per cent), Nigeria (25 per cent), Congo (45 per cent) and Chad (70 per cent). Besides India, Bharti also has operations in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Seychelles.        
	Zain group chairman Asaad Al Banwan said, This transaction (the deal with Bharti) crystallises the significant value we have created for our shareholders over the last five years.        
	Meanwhile, Rajan Mittal, joint managing director of Bharti Enterprises, today said the company would change the brand of Zains mobile operations in Africa to Airtel but did not specify the time frame.         
	The Bharti scrip today closed with a marginal gain of 0.31 per cent on the BSE. It opened firm and jumped nearly 3 per cent to a high of Rs 319.50 before settling at Rs 311.90.

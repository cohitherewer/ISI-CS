The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi spikes MCX-SX petition
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sebi spikes MCX-SX petition
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 23: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today rejected the application of MCX Stock Exchange Ltd (MCX-SX) to trade in equities for failing to comply with the regulations on the shareholding structure of stock exchanges.         
	Last month, Bombay High Court asked the market regulator to decide by September 30 on the application filed by MCX-SX for permission to trade in equities and other instruments.         
	MCX-SX had earlier dragged Sebi to court for the delay in permission to launch trading in equities, equity derivatives, interest rate futures, mutual funds and debts, among other instruments. MCX-SX argued that the delay happened despite the promoters divesting their stakes to 5 per cent each to comply with the regulations.        
	Sebi whole-time director K.M. Abraham, in a 68 page order, gave the reasons for rejecting the application.         
	MCX-SX failed to ensure compliance with Regulation 8 of the The Manner of Increasing and Maintaining Public Shareholding in Recognised Stock Exchanges, Regulations, 2006 (MIMPS Regulations).        
	Sebi said MCX promoters, Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL) and MCX, were persons acting in concert and could not together hold more than 5 per cent equity shares.         
	However, the duo held 5 per cent each in the exchange.        
	Sebi said MCX-SX had submitted that the two promoters did not share a common management, but it found the two entities operating under the common management led by Jignesh Shah.        
	Besides, Abraham said the promoters had struck some buyback deals that were illegal under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956.        
	He said MCX-SX had been dishonest in withholding material information on arrangements regarding the ownership of its shareholders and, therefore, had not adhered to fair and reasonable standards of honesty that should be expected of a recognised stock exchange.         
	The buyback transactions themselves cannot be considered to have adhered to fair and reasonable standards of integrity.         
	FTIL and MCX initially held 51 per cent and 49 per cent respectively in MCX-SX. This was brought down to 37 per cent and nearly 34 per cent, respectively, through a series of divestments last year.         
	The promoters in April undertook a further financial restructuring  they brought down their joint shareholding to 10 per cent by selling shares to banks and financial institutions; MCX-SX also issued warrants to promoter companies.        
	However, there were reports that the promoters entered into buyback arrangements with some banks to which they had sold part of their stakes.        
	MCX-SX had argued that equity shares and warrants were different, and there were no legal bar to promoters holding warrants. Sebi said that excluding warrants from promoter holding violates the spirit of the MIMPS rules.         
	Substitution of shares by warrants is an attempt to work around the requirements of Regulation 8 of the MIMPS regulations. The order noted that the concentration of economic interest in a recognised stock exchange in the hands of two promoters was not in the interest of a well-regulated securities market.        
	Allowing MCX-SX to function will not be in the interest of trade and public, the regulator said.        
	In a statement, MCX-SX said it is sad to see the continuation of the same bias and injustice as we have seen hitherto in the order passed by Sebi today.         
	MCX-SX added that it was studying the order in all its aspects, and would take appropriate measure in consultation with its legal counsel. Until such time, we would continue to work on our currency derivative segment, MCX said.        
	Market circles do not rule out the possibility of MCX-SX approaching the Securities and Appellate Tribunal.

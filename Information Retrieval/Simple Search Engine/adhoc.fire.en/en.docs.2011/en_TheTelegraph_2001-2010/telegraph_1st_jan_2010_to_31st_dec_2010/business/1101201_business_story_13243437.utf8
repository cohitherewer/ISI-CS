	New Delhi, Nov. 30: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today assured investors of the safety of their money parked in financial institutions in the wake of the housing finance scam.         
	There is no need to press the panic button. Money of the investors in these institutions is safe and all the appropriate measures will be taken (if any irregularities is found in disbursement of loans by financial institutions), Mukherjee said on the sidelines of an economic conference.        
	He said talks were on with the RBI governor and chairman of the Life Insurance Corporation over the bribes-for-loans racket. Last week, the Central Bureau of Investigation had busted a multi-crore housing loan racket in which key executives of large financial institutions, including banks and the LIC, were allegedly bribed to sanction loans to realtors and disclose confidential information.        
	The agency arrested five executives from the LIC, LIC Housing Finance, the Bank of India, the Central Bank of India and Punjab National Bank. Three top officials of Money Matters, a financial intermediary at the centre of the scam, were also arrested.         
	The scam has drawn the attention of the income tax department as well. It will begin assessing tax implications on the money involved after investigations are concluded by the CBI.

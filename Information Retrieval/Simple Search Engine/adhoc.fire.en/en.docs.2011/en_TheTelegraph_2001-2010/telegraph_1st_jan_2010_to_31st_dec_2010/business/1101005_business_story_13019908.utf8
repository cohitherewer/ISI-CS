	Calcutta, Oct. 4: The government is weighing performance-linked incentives for the senior management of public sector banks.         
	The government is examining the recommendations of the A.K. Khandelwal committee and, in all likelihood, a majority of the recommendations will be accepted. A final decision is expected in another couple of months, joint finance secretary K.V. Eapen told reporters on the sidelines of a banking seminar organised by the CII here today.        
	The Khandelwal committee had suggested training for the top management at PSU banks and performance-linked variable pay.         
	According to Eapen, the government is considering incentives based on certain parameters. There are no such proposals for officers in the middle or lower levels.         
	While PSU banks will see large-scale retirement over the next few years, they are finding it difficult to get new recruits as the pay is significantly lower compared with private financial firms.        
	Public sector banks went in for large-scale recruitment in the 1970s after the nationalisation of banks in 1969. All those people who joined in the early 1970s will attain superannuation in the next two-three years, said R. Ramachandran, chairman and managing director of Andhra Bank.

	The State Bank of Hyderabad will open three branches in Calcutta and 230 across the country. Managing director Renu Challu said, We have opened 45 branches across the country during the current financial year. Last year, we had opened 154 branches.

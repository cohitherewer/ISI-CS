	The JSW Energy share closed at Rs 120.10 on the BSE today, up Rs 4.45, or 3.85 per cent, on a volume of 3,349,000 shares. The scrip touched an intraday high of Rs 122.70 and a low of Rs 114.90.        
	The acquisition of South Africa Coal will be done through a maze of transactions. JSW will buy Strider Holdings (Proprietary) Ltds 49.8 per cent stake in Royal Bafokeng Capital (Proprietary) Ltd, which partially owns South Africa Coal, at 30 cents per share.         
	The Indian company will also acquire Mainsali Trading 55 (Proprietary), which, too, holds a stake in South Africa Coal. Mainsail and RBC collectively hold 284.6 million shares in South Africa Coal.         
	IDBI has provided a written confirmation to South Africas Securities Regulation Panel that JSW had the necessary resources to acquire the shares of South Africa Coal.

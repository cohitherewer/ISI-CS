The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cairn seeks govt nod
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cairn seeks govt nod
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: Scotlands Cairn Energy today formally sought the governments approval to sell a majority stake in its Indian arm to Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Resources.         
	Cairn said it would meet all contractual requirements.         
	State-owned explorer ONGC Ltd has, however, claimed that Cairn Energy cannot sell stake without its consent.         
	Cairn India holds 70 per cent operator interest in the 6.5-billion-barrel Rajasthan block, while ONGC owns the remaining 30 per cent.        
	Vedanta is offering $8.5-$9.6 billion to buy 51-60 per cent stake in Cairn India, which has 10 assets in the country, including the giant Rajasthan oilfield.         
	On September 9, Cairn wrote to the oil ministry to approve the Vedanta deal separately for each of the seven exploration blocks it had won under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp). It also sought concurrence for the deal vis--vis the three properties it got before Nelp, including the Rajasthan oilfield.         
	We have received letters from Cairn and we are examining them. We will decide (on it) in due course, a senior ministry official said.         
	Cairn maintained that only Nelp blocks required prior government consent for the transfer of control to Vedanta; there was no such provision for blocks awarded outside Nelp.        
	For the seven Nelp areas, including gas discovery block KG-DWN-98/2 that lies next to Reliance Industries field in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, Cairn subsidiaries applied for approval under Article 28.1 of the production sharing contracts signed with the government.         
	ONGC stand        
	ONGCs company secretary N.K. Sinha has written to Cairn Energy CEO Bill Gammell about the necessity of taking the consent of ONGC, besides other governmental approvals, to consummate the proposed sale.        
	ONGC claims that on account of its stake in the Rajasthan block it has the right of first refusal to buy Cairn India in case the companys ownership changed.

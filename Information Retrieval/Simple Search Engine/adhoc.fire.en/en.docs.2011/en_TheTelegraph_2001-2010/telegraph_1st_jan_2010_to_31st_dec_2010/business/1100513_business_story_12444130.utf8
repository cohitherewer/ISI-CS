          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, May 12: The government is worried about the rate of inflation but feels growth targets will still be met.         
	At a gathering of industry leaders organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said, Inflation erodes real income. It hurts the marginalised and the poor segment of our society the most.        
	However, the minister said retail price inflation could come down rapidly in the coming months in the wake of a good monsoon and hoped India would exceed the growth rate projected by the International Monetary Fund.         
	IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook has projected Indias GDP growth to be 8.8 per cent in 2010, and 8.4 per cent in 2011 and I expect an even better performance, the finance minister said.        
	I expect inflation based on Consumer Price Index  Industrial Workers to decline rapidly as the price of food items is now declining, he said.        
	Average inflation based on the index for industrial workers for February and March has been about 14.6 per cent, he said. Retail price-based inflation is higher mainly because food items make up most of the index basket. Food inflation, based on wholesale prices, had scaled 20 per cent in December but has since declined to around 16 per cent because of the arrival of fresh crops in the market.         
	Admitting that a large chunk of people dont get the benefit of economic growth, Mukherjee asked industry to play a catalytic role in the process of inclusive growth.

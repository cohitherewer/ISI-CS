          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 30: Corporate cognoscenti love to see a confrontation but no one really expects to see a grim face-off between Mukesh Ambani and Yogi Deveshwar just yet.        
	Deveshwar has been stalking EIH since March 2001 when three investment entities belonging to ITC first picked up a little over 6 per cent in the Oberoi-owned hotel chain.         
	By December that year, ITC had started rattling its sabre when it raised the stake to 13.37 per cent.        
	The stake purchase had the Oberois worried and they quickly closed ranks, and slowly upped their holdings, nudging it to 46.43 per cent. Last week, Biki Oberoi said they intended to use the creeping acquisition route to raise their stake by 5 per cent every year under the takeover rules.        
	The problem is that the Oberois are not really flush with cash. At the end of March 31 this year, the group had reported cash and cash equivalents of Rs 648.06 crore, down 17.7 per cent from the level of Rs 787.43 crore at the start of the year.        
	Two matters have made things pretty tight for them: first, they had to stump up cash to restore the Oberoi and Trident hotels in Mumbai that were badly damaged in the terrorist attack in 2008.         
	Second, the global slowdown has made things pretty rough for most hoteliers. In the first quarter ended June 30, EIH reported a net loss of Rs 15.93 crore against a profit of a little over Rs 19 crore in the same quarter a year ago.         
	So, if the Oberois do not have the cash to shore up their stake, it would be logical to bring in a white knight like the Ambanis.        
	Industry analysts are betting that ITC will choose to lie low now that RIL has thrown its weight behind EIH.        
	However, should RIL choose to increase its investment in EIH by a mere 0.88 per cent to touch the 15 per cent shareholding mark, ITC is not likely to hold back.         
	That is when the mandatory open offer for another 20 per cent will be triggered. In such a case, the cigarettes-to-hotel company will have to cough up funds to buy just another 0.02 per cent of EIHs stock to launch a competing open offer.        
	RILs entry also signals its interest in the hospitality segment and the market mavens are eagerly trying to gauge its next moves. Reliance has been showing a strong penchant for service-oriented industries such as telecom, education and hospitals.        
	RIL is also sitting on a huge cash pile of Rs 25,000 crore  and a small investment of a few thousand crore isnt going to blunt its ambitions.

	Calcutta/New Delhi, April 6: Coal India, which plans to come out with its maiden offer of 63.16 crore equity shares in August, may price the issue at around Rs 230 a share to mop up Rs 12,000-14,000 crore.        
	At present, state-run CIL has a paid-up capital of Rs 6,316 crore. The government has decided to divest a 10 per cent stake through the IPO route. The proposal will be placed before the cabinet by the end of this month.        
	The company today reported a net profit of Rs 8,312.40 crore for 2009-10, up from Rs 2,078.70 crore a year ago. The current earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share of the company thus work out to Rs 13.16 and Rs 38.87, respectively.         
	It will be unfortunate if CILs share price is valued on current earnings. The valuation should factor in, at least partially, the future earning potential and other upsides of the company, said Coal India chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya.         
	CIL is the only coal company in the world having proven reserves of 63 billion tonnes of coal, he said.         
	Besides, we are going to sell 330-340 million tonnes of washed coal in the next five years, accounting for almost 50 per cent of our total raw coal production.        
	Since washed coal comes at a higher price than raw coal, CILs average sales realisation per tonne will go up.         
	Of the proposed 10 per cent stake sale, 9 per cent can be offered in the IPO, while the rest may go to CILs 4 lakh employees, additional coal secretary Alok Perti said today.        
	Foreign buys        
	In addition to our capex plan of Rs 3,800 crore for 2010-11, we have earmarked Rs 6,000 crore for foreign acquisitions this fiscal. Right now we are evaluating five proposals from companies in the US, Australia and Indonesia, Bhattacharyya said. US-based Peabody Energy Corp was a potential partner, and CIL was considering whether to buy an equity stake or form a joint venture with Peabody.        
	CIL has decided to set up 20 coal washeries entailing a capital investment of Rs 3,000 crore over the next five years. Besides, new coal mine projects with capacities of 2.5mt or more will be set up with in-built washeries, Bhattacharyya said.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      State Bank sees steady lending rates 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          .P. Bhatt in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)				                                 
	Mumbai, Jan. 8: The State Bank of India does not expect the Reserve Bank of India to increase the cash reserve ratio (CRR) in its monetary policy due on January 29.         
	CRR stands at 5 per cent now.        
	Brushing aside a clutch of forecasts that suggest interest rates will surge as inflation rises, the countrys largest bank feels that lending rates will not go up over the next six months.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said here today that he did not expect the Reserve Bank of India to increase the amount of deposits that banks have to park with the central bank. He felt this wasnt the right time to suck liquidity out of the market with credit growth starting to perk up.        
	Most of the analysts expect RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao to raise CRR by 25 to 50 basis points in view of the double-digit food inflation, which has stoked expectations of a more widespread inflationary impact on the economy.         
	The SBI expects its credit growth to touch the level of 18 per cent by the end of this fiscal.         
	At present, non-food credit is growing in the region of 11 per cent. However, growth at the SBI is higher at 13 per cent.         
	We will definitely cross 16 per cent according to our estimate. It is also possible to touch 18 per cent, the SBI chief told reporters ahead of a two-day bankers conference that begins on January 11.         
	Regardless of what the RBI does, there will be enough liquidity in the system, he said.         
	Bhatt hastened to add that though credit growth had picked up in recent times, it was still tentative. However, as the prospects for a pick-up in its momentum look good, interest rates on credit are unlikely to jump in the next six months.        
	Bank of Baroda chairman M.D. Mallya, who was also present at the preview meet for the conference, said credit growth at his bank was likely to be around 20 per cent by the end of this fiscal.

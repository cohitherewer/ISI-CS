	May 2: India can overtake China in setting up new multinationals by 2018 to become the No. 1 among emerging nations.        
	According to a PwC study on 15 emerging countries, including Brazil, Malaysia, Singapore, Russia and South Korea, India will produce 20 per cent more new MNCs than China by 2024. In 2009, China was the largest source of new MNCs. A firm establishing its presence abroad for the first time is defined as a new multinational.        
	Though China is expected to grow at a slightly higher rate, a relative increase in investment intensity and trade openness will help India to edge out its Asian neighbour by 2018.         
	Chinas current level of investment intensity is unlikely to be sustained in the long term, while growing domestic demand is expected to hold down its trade openness.        
	Together, India and China are projected to account for 42 per cent of the new MNCs coming up over the next 15 years.         
	Vietnam will also be a big mover, second only to India in expected percentage growth, driven by a strong GDP growth and increasing openness and investment intensity.        
	Emerging nations have seen a steady increase in the number of new MNCs over the last five years.         
	There were 352 new multinationals in 2005, rising to 613 in 2008, before decelerating to 470 during the global economic recession. China produced the most new multinationals between 2005 and 2009, from 54 in 2005 to 141 in 2009.         
	Strong export as well as overall economic growth had put China at the top of the table  its share of the world economy rose from 9.5 per cent to 12.1 per cent between 2005 and 2009.         
	Strong trend        
	An intensely competitive global marketplace and less restrictive capital and trade barriers have led to increasing numbers of emerging economy companies setting up operations abroad.         
	Countries with the largest economies  China, India and Korea  produced the most new multinationals.         
	New horizons        
	There has also been a shift in the pattern of where multinationals choose to expand and in which sectors they focus.         
	Initially, firms preferred to invest in countries with similar economic trends.         
	However, they are now keen to expand into the developed markets of the European Union and the US. Moreover, new multinationals have moved away from resource extracting industries to business services and high value manufacturing sectors.

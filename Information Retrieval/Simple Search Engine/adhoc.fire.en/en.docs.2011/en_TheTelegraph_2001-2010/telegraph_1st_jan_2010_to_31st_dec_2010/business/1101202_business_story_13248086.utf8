                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Trust benefits in Premji share switch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Premji: Philanthropic act                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 1: Wipro chairman Azim Premji has decided to transfer 213 million shares in his soap-to-software giant to a new not-for-profit trust that he has decided to establish.        
	The shares have a market value of Rs 8,829.92 crore and amount to an 8.68 per cent stake in the countrys third largest software exporter.        
	Premjis move to set up the irrevocable trust mirrors the example of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, US investor Warren Buffett and  closer home  the $70-billion Tata group.        
	The trust will be dedicated to funding philanthropic activities with a special emphasis on education.        
	Premji will continue to retain the voting rights on the shares transferred to the trust.        
	In a statement to the BSE, the company said, Wipro Ltd has received a notification from Azim Premji, chairman of Wipro, that he will transfer 213,000,000 equity shares of Wipro held by entities controlled by him to an irrevocable trust. The transfer of shares will be effected by December 7, the statement said.        
	In the quarter ended September 30, the promoters of Wipro held a 79.36 per cent stake in the company.        
	Tax experts are not clear at this point of time whether the setting up of this trust will offer tax breaks to Premji in his individual capacity.        
	It depends on how the transaction is viewed. After an amendment to tax laws governing trusts and charities, a deduction is available up to 50 per cent of the amount if the donation is in cash. It is to be seen if instruments that can be converted into cash will be treated like cash itself, said an executive director with a leading international tax consultancy who declined to be named.         
	Azim Premji has already established a philanthropic organisation called the Azim Premji Foundation that holds 0.44 per cent in Wipro. This foundation  set up in 2001  is devoted to improving education especially in rural India.         
	Roughly six months ago, the Karnataka government also approved plans to establish the Azim Premji University in Bangalore under a special act. The university is likely to open next year.        
	On the decision to set up the trust, Azim Premji said, The foundations significant increase in scale and its focus on social purposes will require a substantial long-term financial commitment, which is the purpose this endowment will serve.

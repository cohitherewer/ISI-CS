          JAYATI GHOSE                          EASY SHOPPING                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has started issuing licences to telecom operators for mobile wallet services.        
	The service will enable customers to keep up to Rs 5,000 as virtual cash in their mobile phones, which can be used like credit cards to make payments on purchases.         
	Last year, the central bank had issued guidelines on prepaid payment instruments such as mobile phones. The value stored in such instruments represents the value paid by the holder, in cash, by debit or by credit card, the RBI had said.        
	Bharti Airtel was granted the licence to use the semi-closed wallet this quarter. This will create mobile money payment a category in our country, the operator said.        
	At present, mobile phones can be used to pay credit card and utility bills, and to buy movie tickets. However, the payments are made through third-party gateways such as mCheck or by accessing the Internet on the mobile.        
	In mobile wallet, a non-financial company will store the funds, said sources. The account may be loaded (recharged) from anywhere by depositing cash. The cellphone then may be used to access that money from anywhere and for any transaction, they added.        
	A transaction will occur either by using the phone in a manner similar to a smart card  the mobile will have a chip embedded in its SIM  or by sending an SMS code to the shopkeeper.         
	The RBI, however, clarified that the mobile wallet cannot be used to withdraw money.        
	The semi-closed wallet will allow users to exchange physical cash for virtual money to pay for goods or services less than Rs 5,000, Bharti said in a statement.        
	The telecom operator said it was evaluating options provided by the licence though the exact date for the launch of the service had not been decided yet.        
	Other mobile operators are also expected to get RBI approval, the sources said. There is a huge demand for mobile commerce, which will be met through the mobile wallet service. It will also lead to greater financial inclusion, Romal Shetty, telecom analyst at KPMG, told The Telegraph.

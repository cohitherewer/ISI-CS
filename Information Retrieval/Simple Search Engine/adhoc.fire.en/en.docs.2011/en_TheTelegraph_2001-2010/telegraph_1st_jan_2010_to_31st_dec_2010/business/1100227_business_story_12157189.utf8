										      Guest Column - Ajit Krishnan                        
	In the midst of expectations to regain accelerated growth and fiscal consolidation by way of no negative tax announcements, the corporate world has the following proposals to consider.         
	Instead of an expected corporate tax rate reduction, the increase in minimum alternate tax (by 3 per cent) has dampened spirits. The hike in monthly interest rate on delayed deposit of tax deducted at source (TDS) by 0.5 per cent, appears to be stringent.         
	The reduction in surcharge from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent for domestic companies also appears to have been handed out only to demonstrate an offset against the MAT rate increase.         
	On the TDS front, most of the limit of payments requiring TDS as set by the finance minister over two decades back, have been increased only nominally. However, the new provision allowing deduction for payments in respect of which TDS has been deposited by the tax return due date is a welcome move.        
	Also, on the compliance front, certain limits for tax audit requirements and presumptive taxation have been enhanced favourably. The increase in deductions for research and development expenditure (both in-house and payments to external agencies) is also a welcome move.        
	To curb tax evasion, the transfer of shares of specified companies to a corporate for inadequate consideration will now be subject to taxation in the hands of the transferee company also. This is intended to restrict transaction involving transfer of shares at lower than fair value.        
	The budget intends to promote the housing and hospitality sectors with more liberal and/or extended incentive regimes. For the housing sector, this relief comes in the form of an additional one year for completion of housing projects approved in the period 2005 to 2008 and the much required increase in permissible minimum commercial area. The timeline for tax holiday eligibility of specified hotels being established for the forthcoming Commonwealth Games, has been extended from March 31 2010 to July 1 2010. Further, the investment linked incentives introduced in the budget 2009 have been extended to hotels of 2 star and above categories across the country.         
	There was a clear need to provide for rules related to conversion of specified companies to limited liability partnership (LLP). While the budget has addressed this need, the fineprint contains various conditions that need to be satisfied for availing the prescribed benefits (viz. capital gains exemption to the transferor company and carry forward of losses to the successor LLP).

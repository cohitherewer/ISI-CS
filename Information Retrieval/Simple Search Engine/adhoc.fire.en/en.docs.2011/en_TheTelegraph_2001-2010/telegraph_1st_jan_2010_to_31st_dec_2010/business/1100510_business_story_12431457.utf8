The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BSNL starts work on defence cable network
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      BSNL starts work on defence cable network
          JAYATI GHOSE                                            
	New Delhi, May 9: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has started the process of building a Rs 10,000-crore alternative optic fibre cable network for the defence authorities.        
	The timely completion of the project will ensure that the defence forces vacate third-generation spectrum, or radiowaves through which voice and data travel, for use by mobile operators. The spectrum has to be allocated to the operators by September.        
	The state-run telecom firm will select the supplier of optic fibre cables by the end of this month and place the orders for equipment by July-end, said BSNL officials.        
	The installation of equipment on the optic fibre will take place between November 2010 and March 2012, while acceptance, testing and commissioning will be undertaken by December 2012, said officials.        
	The defence forces will be able to move to the alternative network by early 2013.         
	According to a memorandum of understanding between the defence and telecom ministries, the armed forces will vacate portions of radiowaves depending on the progress of the alternative network.        
	If equipment orders are placed by July, the defence authorities will vacate 5 megahertz (Mhz) of 3G spectrum in that month and a similar amount in August.         
	The telecom ministry is selling 5Mhz of 3G spectrum in each of the 22 telecom circles in the country through an online auction process.         
	According to the 3G auction policy, operators will get the high-speed spectrum by September to roll out commercial services.         
	Telecom firms are betting on high-end services to arrest the fall in revenues because of the ongoing tariff war.         
	Once the network is completed, the armed forces will release a total of 45Mhz over three years, of which 25MHz will be for 3G and the rest for 2G.        
	The optic fibre network for defence will connect 219 army, 33 navy and 162 air force bases.

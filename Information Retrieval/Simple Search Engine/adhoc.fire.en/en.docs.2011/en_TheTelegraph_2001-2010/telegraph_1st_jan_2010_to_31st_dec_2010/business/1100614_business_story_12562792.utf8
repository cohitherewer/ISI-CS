        For a better deal, get your car insurance from a dealer, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Got a new car? You need an insurance, too. Irrespective of whether it is for personal or commercial use, car insurance is mandatory for all new vehicles under the Motor Vehicles Act.        
	Most of the time, people get the insurance from the car dealer itself. But is it beneficial to buy insurance from the car dealer or get it directly from an insurer?         
	In the last few years car makers such as Maruti, Honda Siel and Tata Motors have tied up with several insurers to offer comprehensive car insurance with better service facilities such as instant policy issuance and quicker and cashless claim settlement.        
	Under these arrangements you can enjoy a roaming facility with your car insurance  get your claim settled at any of the authorised dealer workshops of the car maker across the country.        
	But certain features are baffling as Mumbai resident Swapan Dasgupta recounts, My Maruti dealer gives me a Maruti authorised insurance contract. But I have noticed that he (the dealer) changes the insurer every year. He claims it is the same Maruti insurance contract except that the insurer is different. And he has some bogus story for making the change.         
	Apparently, United Insurance doesnt post a man at the dealers end and it, therefore, takes four days to process a claim. But I moved from Royal Sundaram in the first year to United Insurance and now to ICICI Lombard. Now I am beginning to wonder: Is there a game being played here? Is he pulling wool over my eyes? quot; wondered Dasgupta.        
	Marutis secret        
	Maruti Suzuki has tied up with six different insurers  National Insurance, New India Assurance, Bajaj Allianz, Royal Sundaram, Iffco Tokio and ICICI Lombard  through its six different subsidiaries as their agents. However, now the car manufacturer is congregating its six subsidiaries into one wholly owned subsidiary, Maruti Insurance Brokers Ltd, as directed by the Irda.         
	Maruti Insurance Brokers will provide insurance to car buyers through its 250 authorised dealers across the country. If you are already a Maruti car owner, you can buy a fresh insurance under the Maruti Insurance scheme provided your car is not more than seven years old. But if you have already got an insurance under Maruti Insurance, you can keep on renewing it till you junk your car.         
	When Maruti started its insurance business in 2002, the norms for insurance brokers were still being formulated. The company decided to set up Maruti Insurance as a brand and acquired a corporate agency licence for three insurance companies to start with but later expanded to six.         
	The Honda deal        
	Like Maruti, Honda Siel Cars India last november announced its insurance initiative, Honda Assure, under which the entire transaction will be routed through an on-line central server that would enable HSCI to monitor overall operations more effectively. Some of the direct benefits to the customers include cashless insurance across authorised dealers in the country, clear demarcation of plastic and metal parts for greater transparency, instant policy issuance, and improved turnaround time.        
	SMC Brokerage has been appointed as the exclusive broker for the Honda Assure Programme. The business partners for this programme include National General Insurance Company, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company, Royal Sundaram General Insurance Company, Iffco Tokyo General Insurance Company and Universal Sompo General Insurance Company.         
	Tata promise        
	Tata Motors has also entered into agreements with five partner insurance companies to offer comprehensive insurance under the Tata Motors Insurance banner for the Tata Nano at a rate of just 2.76 per cent of the ex-showroom price of the car, the most competitive in the industry.         
	The empanelled insurance companies are National Insurance Co Ltd, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co Ltd, Royal Sundaram Alliance General Insurance Co Ltd, United India Insurance Co Ltd and HDFC Ergo General Insurance.        
	Cost comfort        
	Another advantage of such car insurance is that the car buyer gets a good discount on the premium. In case of Maruti Insurance, policyholders pay 20 per cent less on the premium than they would have paid had they bought the policy directly from the insurer.         
	Faster settlement        
	The turnaround time for claim settlement is also much less because the inspection for the damage to the car is done at the authorised dealers workshop. One doesnt have to wait for the surveyor of the insurance company to come, inspect the damage, ask for various documents and then settle the claim to his satisfaction.         
	Though most insurers are offering a cashless facility, you will have to take your car to the insurers networked garages to get this facility and there the car may lie unattended for days before the insurance surveyor comes and inspect the damage.        
	Maruti Insurance has become quite popular so that 86 customers out of 100 buying a Maruti car buy Maruti Insurance.         
	A few months back I had a small accident in my car. The driver was removing the car from the garage and scraped the vehicle on granite stones that caused the bumper to break. I only had to leave the car at their (Maruti) authorised service station with the insurance papers... no signing on any document or anything... the person at Maruti asked me to come after two days and collect the car. When I went there the bumper was fixed and painted to the cars colour and all I had to do was pay the 50 per cent plastic charges. So the entire bumper plus painting plus labour cost me only Rs 800, said Prabuddha Das, a resident of Calcutta.        
	However, you must select select a good car dealer who provides quick service. Otherwise, you may get caught on the wrong foot.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Takeoff time                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 4: The Bengal government has handed over the second parcel of land for the proposed Aerotropolis project at Andal near Burdwan.        
	Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Ltd (BAPL), which is developing the project, has received 515.33 acres from the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation through a 99-year lease agreement.         
	The integrated Aerotropolis project will be spread over 2,300 acres. The airport, which will be built on 650 acres, is scheduled to be operational by late 2011.         
	In October last year, Bengal had handed over the first tranche of 533.51 acres to BAPL. Singapores Changi is a strategic equity partner in the project.         
	The 1,049 acres received by BAPL include the requisite 650 acres for the airport.        
	The lease premium paid, so far, is around Rs 88 crore.         
	We have started site preparation work for the airport, which will be followed by extensive civil construction work, Subrata Paul, CEO of BAPL, said.         
	We expect to receive the remaining 1,000 acres in the next few months.         
	The airport is expected to have a passenger volume of around 4 lakh annually.         
	Land acquisition for the project began after preparing a rehabilitation package that had the support of the locals.         
	The project area sits over huge coal reserves  an issue Coal India Ltd had raised when the airport city was conceived.         
	A meeting convened by the Bengal chief secretary early last year had reasonably addressed the concerns of CIL by excluding 400 acres of coal reserves. The chief secretary wrote to the civil aviation secretary saying the CIL representative had agreed to the adjustment.

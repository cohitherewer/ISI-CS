The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Foreign investment rules face the flak
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Foreign investment rules face the flak
                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 6 (PTI): The US today sought a level-playing field and an atmosphere of genuine competition for its companies doing business in India, saying the current foreign investment rules are opaque and customs tariffs complex.        
	These (FDI) rules will halt rather than stimulate foreign investment. All that the US seeks is a level-playing field for its companies and a genuine competition, US commerce secretary Gary Locke said while addressing a meeting of the Indo-US Business Summit.The summit was organised ahead of US President Barack Obamas address to the CEOs of the two nations.        
	Locke said it was critical that India should not go in for policies that could slow down this level-playing field.        
	On trade barriers, he said, Indias import tariffs were complex and various non-tariff barriers had grown. Moreover, he added, Indias FDI rules were opaque. India receives about 8 per cent of total foreign investment from the US. FDI in 2009-10 was $25.8 billion, while Indo-US trade in 2009-10 stood at $36.5 billion.         
	Visa fee         
	The US today sought to assuage the IT industry here, saying India had not been singled out on the issue of the rise in visa fee, a move that raised the hackles of technology firms. Indian IT firms had not been singled out and countries like South Korea and Taiwan would also pay more, Locke told a private news channel.

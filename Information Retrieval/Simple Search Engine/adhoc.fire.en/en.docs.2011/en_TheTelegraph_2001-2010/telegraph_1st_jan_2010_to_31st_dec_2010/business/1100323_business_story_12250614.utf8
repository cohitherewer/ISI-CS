	New Delhi, March 22: Canadian hotel group Four Seasons plans to set up four properties in India by 2015.         
	We are looking at opening business hotels in Gurgaon and Bangalore and two luxury resorts in Jaipur and Kerala. They should be operational by 2015, director (marketing) Sanjeev Shukla told The Telegraph.         
	Four Seasons is jointly promoted by its Canadian founder Isadore Sharp, Microsofts Bill Gates and Saudi Arabias Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal.         
	Four Seasons will tie up with local developers to build the properties. The hotel chain will manage them under its brand name.         
	The hospitality sector in India is showing an uptrend with a rise in room occupancy. We want to tap both the business and the leisure segments, Shukla said.         
	Four Seasons, which globally operates management contracts, has only one operational hotel in India  Four Seasons Hotels amp; Resorts in Mumbai, owned by developer Magus Estates.         
	Shukla said the chains room inventory would reach 1,000-1,200 once the new properties came up.         
	The hotel in Mumbai has 202 rooms, with an average rate of Rs 14,000 per night and 76 per cent occupancy.         
	On the Indian hospitality industry, Shukla said, There is a lot of scope for growth and enough room for everybody to operate in the five-star segment.         
	The Indian hospitality industry has become an attractive investment destination.         
	Many global chains plan to enter the country or are keen on expansion.         
	The companies are betting big on the shortage of hotel rooms.         
	According to industry estimates, there are around 40 international hotels, which are expected to be operational in the next three years.

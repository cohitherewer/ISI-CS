The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Apex court cancels Raju bail
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Apex court cancels Raju bail
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Raju: Setback                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: The Supreme Court today cancelled the bail granted to former Satyam chairman Ramalinga Raju, his brother B. Rama Raju and four other top officials by Andhra Pradesh High Court in connection with the Rs 6,760-crore fraud perpetrated by the company.         
	Acting on a petition filed by the CBI, a two-judge bench, comprising Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice Deepak Verma, said though ordinarily the bench would not have interfered with the bail granted by the high court, the facts in the case indicated that they should.         
	The six will have to surrender before a Hyderabad court by November 10. The apex court has directed that the trial be completed by July. It has also permitted the six to move for bail afresh in case the trial was not complete by the stipulated time.         
	Besides the Raju brothers, the others are former Satyam chief financial officer V. Srinivas, G. Ramakrishna, Venkatapathi Raju and Srisailam.         
	The CBI had accused Raju of trying to misuse his bail by meeting a witness and trying to influence him. Counsel Haren P. Raval told the court that there were at least 250 witnesses to be examined. All of them employees of the company, he said.         
	He also stressed that it was the countrys biggest corporate fraud. Letters rogatory have been issued to several countries and their responses are awaited, he said.         
	The counsel for the accused argued that no money was ever siphoned off from the company. There was no fraud but only window-dressing to avoid a takeover and make the company look profitable.

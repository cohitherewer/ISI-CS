          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 31: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are starting to drive the markets to new peaks once again.        
	At the close of 2009-10, the statistics showed that the FIIs had pumped in $23 billion into the country a sure sign that their appetite for Indian equities remains strong at a time the economy has started to surge.        
	With key economic indicators expected to further improve in the coming months and a double-digit growth rate also in sight, market experts feel that overseas investors may continue to repose their faith in India in the new fiscal year as well.         
	They, however, caution that the road will not be smooth as worries over rising inflation and interest rates can blunt their excitement.        
	The year 2009-10 saw the sensex rallying 77 per cent and the Nifty 50 gaining 72 per cent.         
	On April 1 last year, the benchmark index was at 9901.99 and it closed today at 17527.77. The Nifty closed 71 per cent higher at 5249.10 from the levels of 3060.35 at the beginning of the year.        
	Among sectoral indices, metals and auto topped the list with gains of over 200 per cent and 150 per cent, respectively.        
	Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas, said there were several reasons for the surge in various indices. Apart from the timely stimulus measures taken by the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India, the period also saw many companies reporting good quarterly results because of low input cost.        
	Some of the key economic indicators have also bolstered investors confidence.         
	The economic indicators came as a reassurance that the governmental steps are taking shape. IIP number was -0.2 per cent in January 2009 which grew towards 17.6 per cent in January 2010. Gross domestic product is expected to grow to 7.2 per cent in March 2010 from 6.7 per cent a year ago. Exports grew 12.9 per cent to $14.6 billion in January 2010 from $12.93 billion a year earlier.        
	The governments policy measures to curtail budgetary deficit was a welcome step, which can give huge liquidity into our domestic market, he said.        
	Mathews, however, cautioned that rising crude price, input costs and high inflationary trends would have an impact on the profitability of Indian companies in the near term.        
	An analyst from a leading brokerage said despite the attractiveness of India, one factor that could hinder huge FII inflows was the fact that valuations looked expensive at this point in time.         
	He added that the monsoon could turn out to be a key factor in determining funds flows over the next few months.        
	Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, said even though investor sentiment was positive and the undertone bullish, it was too early to say whether the FIIs would continue to pump in money.        
	History shows that the FIIs are a finicky lot and unpredictable. They put huge money in 2007 and pulled out in 2008. They also stayed away for sometime in 2009 before returning in droves, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Oct. 31: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is widely expected to raise key short-term rates by 25 basis points each in Tuesdays monetary policy review to tame inflation that is still above the central banks comfort zone.        
	Bankers and bond market experts feel the RBI will raise the repo and the reverse repo rates by 25 basis points each to 6.25 per cent and 5.25 per cent, respectively. If the RBI decides to increase the rates, it will be the sixth hike this year.         
	The key rates started inching up from March this year, when the repo and the reverse repo rates were raised by 25 basis points each to 5 per cent and 3.50 per cent, respectively.         
	The reverse repo is the rate at which the central bank borrows from banks and repo is the rate at which it lends money to banks.         
	In the midst of a rising inflation, the RBI is also confronted with the challenge of managing soaring foreign inflows. A hike in the key rates is likely to increase the interest rate differential between India and the developed nations, leading to more inflows. FII inflows into domestic debt instruments have touched the $10-billion mark on account of a higher yield in India.         
	Experts say despite the dilemma over the rising inflows, the RBI will choose to raise the rates as inflation remains a major concern.         
	According to Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist of the Bank of Baroda, There is an overheating happening. Demand factor is driving inflation. While an asset price bubble is getting formed, capacity constrains is not keeping pace with the demand. If the RBI does not take any policy measure now to control the demand, the system will face serious inflationary pressures.        
	Nitsure, like others, expects a 25-basis-point hike in the repo and the reverse repo rates. She also did not rule out the possibility of an increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) in December.         
	CRR is the portion of bank deposits which must be kept with the RBI.        
	The annual rate of inflation has risen to 8.62 per cent in September from 8.51 per cent in the previous month. The central bank had projected inflation to be at 6 per cent in March 2011, up from its earlier projection of 5.5 per cent.         
	According to a recent note by economists with the Citibank, With inflationary expectations seeing a rise, there is a concern that higher expectations are becoming embedded, which is a worry, given Indias low inflation tolerance. Sticky inflation is largely a function of higher food prices, which are now more a structural rather than a weather-related concern.        
	Given the growth dynamics, rate hikes are likely to continue (we could see a 50-basis-point tightening in two steps of 25 basis points each before pausing). If inflation doesnt come off as expected (6 per cent levels in the next few months), tightening should continue.        
	However, a few expect a pause in the rate hike with the central bank waiting for the second quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve Bank to happen before it takes a call.        
	It is felt that this quantitative easing will lead to more dollars flowing into emerging markets.         
	They pointed out that while inflation was likely to moderate over the next few months, the central bank would be keen to push growth which was not broad-based.

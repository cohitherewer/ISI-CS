          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 7: The government today deferred its decision on a hike in the prices of petrol and diesel after the Congress failed to take its allies on board.        
	Trinamul Congresss Mamata Banerjee and NCPs Sharad Pawar skipped the meeting, sending a clear signal to the government against the hike.        
	Fertiliser minister M.K. Alagiri and telecom minister A. Raja met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee before the meeting and conveyed DMKs opposition.         
	Sources said the move to free petrol and diesel prices and a hike in LPG and kerosene rates would spike inflation. Free market pricing would raise petrol and diesel prices by Rs 3.50 per litre, sending wholesale price-based inflation up by 1.4 percentage points. Annual inflation was 9.59 per cent in April.        
	The possible inflationary impact of a rise in the prices of petroleum products was also discussed. Further discussion would be necessary before views are firmed up. We had a very good meeting but because of ministers not being present, no decision was taken. We will meet again soon, oil secretary S. Sundareshan said after the meeting of the eGoM, chaired by Pranab Mukherjee. Sundareshan did not give any dates for the next meeting.        
	According to sources, Trinamul Congress and the DMK will try to resist any unpopular measures as they get ready to face crucial state elections next year. Both had opposed an increase in fuel prices in February.        
	We are very happy that the government has not hiked fuel prices for now, Trinamul MP Sudip Bandopadhyay said, refusing to comment if his party was opposing the proposal to raise prices.         
	A Trinamul minister, however, said his party had always been opposed to any hike, and it was but natural that their leader would have opposed the proposal. The Left, Trinamuls principal opponent, has threatened to launch an agitation if prices are raised.        
	Oil ministry officials said they wanted a cautious approach towards diesel as any hike raises transportation costs and has a wider impact on inflation. In one stroke, we cannot raise diesel prices fully to market levels. Initially, the full burden of higher rates may not be passed on to the consumers, the officials said.        
	Ahead of the meeting, oil minister Murli Deora made a strong pitch for raising fuel prices as it was necessary to cut the losses of state-run oil companies.        
	The oil ministry wants diesel rates to be gradually increased to market levels, while recommending a small hike in the price of kerosene and cooking gas. The empowered group of ministers discussed the recommendations of the Kirit Parikh committee.         
	The panel has recommended freeing petrol and diesel prices, while hiking kerosene and LPG prices by Rs 6 per litre and Rs 100 per cylinder, respectively.        
	Sundareshan said the meeting took into consideration the revenue loss faced by oil marketing companies on account of the current price structure and the burden on the government for compensating the companies. The governments burden was more than Rs 3.45 lakh crore between 2003-04 and 2009-10.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said prices were a major problem and firm action was necessary to contain them. Although food prices have moderated after hitting a peak of 20 per cent last December, they continue to be near 17 per cent.

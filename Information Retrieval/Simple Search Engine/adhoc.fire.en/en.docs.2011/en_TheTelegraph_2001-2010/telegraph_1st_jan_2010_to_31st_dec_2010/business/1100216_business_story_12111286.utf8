The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti gets exclusive talktime with Zain
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bharti gets exclusive talktime with Zain
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Feb. 15: Bharti Airtel today said it would hold exclusive discussions with Kuwait-based Zain Telecom to acquire its African operations for which the firm has made an offer of $10.7 billion (Rs 50,000 crore).        
	The announcement came a day after Bhartis bid was approved by the board of Zain. Discussions will be held till March 25.         
	During the exclusive discussions, Bharti would assess the financial parameters and other related issues, including regulatory norms that are needed to be in place.        
	The deal will put Indias largest private telecom firm in the league of the worlds top 10 operators. Zain has operations in 17 African countries, and Bhartis offer covers all but those in Sudan and Morocco.         
	Meanwhile, a report put out by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch on the potential Bharti Airtel-Zain transaction has cut the rating of the Indian telecom player from buy to underperformer.        
	The report says there are three key reasons for this change in rating. One, the prima facie deal valuations seem rich. Two, the growth outlook for Zains African portfolio seems unexciting. And three, the potential deal could stress Bhartis balance sheet.        
	The report says that assuming debt-financing and no synergies, the potential transaction can dilute Bhartis EPS (earning per share) by 10 to 15 per cent. According to the report, the potential deal values Zain at a 40 to 50 per cent of premium over MTN, a rich valuation. The Bharti scrip plunged 9 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange today to end at 285.40.         
	Last month, Bharti bought a 70 per cent stake in Warid Telecom of Bangladesh. The African venture could become the years largest telecom deal.        
	This is Bhartis third attempt in the last two years to enter Africa. In September, Bhartis $23 billion-merger talks with MTN fell through for the second time because of various reasons including regulatory approvals.        
	We all believe that, we would be welcomed in that continent (Africa). I am sure we will go and speak to the regulator and hopefully get the requisite permissions, said Rajan Mittal, managing director of Bharti Enterprises, on the sidelines of an event here today.

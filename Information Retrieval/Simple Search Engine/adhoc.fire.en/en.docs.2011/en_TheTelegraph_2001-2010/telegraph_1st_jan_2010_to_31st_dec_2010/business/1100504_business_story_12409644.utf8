	Calcutta, May 3: United Bank of India (UBI), the city-based public sector bank that recently went public, reported a 74.5 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 322.36 crore for 2009-10.         
	The banks earnings from regular operations increased only 29.3 per cent to Rs 875.85 crore.         
	The growth in profitability, according to a senior bank official, is on account of write-back of taxes on investments booked in the previous year.         
	Treasury income, which constitutes nearly 44 per cent of the banks non-interest income, saw a significant decline in the January-March period, resulting in a 65.6 per cent fall in net profit for the quarter. The bank also had to set aside Rs 240.83 crore in the last quarter against bad loans.         
	In the entire financial year, we saw an addition of Rs 980 crore bad loans, of which a slippage of Rs 448 crore happened only in the last quarter, said UBI chairman and managing director Bhaskar Sen, who joined the bank in March.         
	Some big accounts became NPAs in the last quarter, said another senior bank official, declining to name the companies that defaulted.        
	Total provisioning against bad loan on a year-on-year basis grew marginally by 11 per cent. Total NPA at the end of March stood at Rs 1,372 crore compared with Rs 1,020 crore a year ago, an increase of 34.5 per cent. Net NPA rose to 1.84 per cent from 1.48 per cent at the end of March 2009.        
	Non-performing assets have been a key concern for the bank. We have strengthened our monitoring and recovery efforts for loan repayment. I hope we shall be able to bring down our NPA levels, Sen said.        
	The bank has done well on core banking. The total business grew 22.9 per cent to Rs 1,10,926 crore in 2009-10 with deposits increasing 25 per cent to Rs 68,180 crore and advances going up 19.7 per cent to Rs 42,756 crore.

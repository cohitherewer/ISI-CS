	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Siemens AG, Germanys biggest engineering company, plans to invest Rs 1,600 crore in India over the next three years, with a large chunk of the funds going into wind turbines.         
	Of the total investment, Rs 500 crore would be used to set up a wind turbine manufacturing facility, said Armin Bruck, managing director of the companys India unit.         
	Funds will also pour into research, signalling products, metal technologies and healthcare solutions.         
	Munich-based Siemens is expanding towards the manufacture of renewable energy equipment to benefit from the surging demand for clean power.        
	We are taking advantage of Indias growth opportunity, Peter Lscher, president and chief executive of Siemens AG, said.         
	The company plans to sell the wind turbines in the local market, the first of which should be delivered by 2012.         
	It expects to eventually produce turbines to generate 500 megawatts of electricity, Bruck said, without giving a time frame.         
	Siemens is looking at sites in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu for its turbine plant.         
	India aims to nearly double power generation capacity in the next seven years and plans to add 10,500 megawatts of wind capacity in the five years ending March 2012.        
	Siemens said it would also make India a major centre for value products.         
	It will establish six hubs in India, responsible for the design, development, production and sale in India and the world.         
	 The goal is to generate total revenue of about Rs 6,500 crore by fiscal 2020 with value-priced products from India, said Bruck.        
	The German company will add 8,000 jobs in India by 2012, taking its workforce to 25,000, but said this was not a move to shift production to low-cost countries. The company has won an order worth about Rs 100 crore to construct a 765/400 kV substation at Meerut from Power Grid Corp of India Limited.

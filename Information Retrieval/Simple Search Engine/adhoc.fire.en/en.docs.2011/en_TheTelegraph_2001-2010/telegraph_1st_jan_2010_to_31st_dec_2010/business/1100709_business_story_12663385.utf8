	Washington, July 8 (PTI): The International Monetary Fund (IMF) today raised Indias growth forecast for 2010 to 9.5 per cent. Favourable financing conditions and robust corporate profits will accelerate economic expansion, according to the IMF.        
	The multilateral lender hiked its growth projection from the earlier estimate of 8.8 per cent made in April.        
	In India, growth is expected to accelerate to about 9.5 per cent in 2010 as robust corporate profits and favourable financing conditions fuel investment, and then settle to 8.5 per cent in 2011, the IMF said in an update of its World Economic Outlook.        
	Recently, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said the countrys economy was expected to grow 8.5 per cent for the fiscal ending March 31, 2011. In the last fiscal, the economy expanded 7.4 per cent.        
	According to the IMF, the world economy expanded at an annualised rate of over 5 per cent during the first quarter of 2010, mostly because of robust growth in Asia. World growth is projected at about 4.5 per cent in 2010 and 4.25 per cent in 2011, the report said.        
	The lender noted that Asias strong recovery from the global financial crisis continued in the first half of 2010, despite renewed tension in global financial markets.         
	The IMF warned that despite the stronger-than-expected first half recovery, uncertainties surrounding sovereign risks could hamper the economic outlook. Outcome will be decided based on how Europe deals with fiscal problems, how advanced countries proceed with fiscal consolidation and how emerging market countries re-balance their economies, IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said.         
	Opening a business         
	It takes as many as 46 days for a foreign company to set up business in India, which is faster than in countries such as China and Brazil but far longer than the 7-14 days it takes in the US and Britain, says a World Bank report.        
	Among the Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) nations, Russia has an edge as it takes just 31 days for starting foreign-owned business.         
	It takes 166 days for foreign companies to set up shop in Brazil and 99 days in China.

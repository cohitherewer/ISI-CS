          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          People watch the budget in Faridabad on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The government plans to raise Rs 40,000 crore from stake sales in state-owned companies  a sum that has never been raised before through a process of disinvestment.        
	This comes on top of the Rs 25,000 crore that finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has projected as the proceeds from stake sales this fiscal year which ends on March 31.        
	Listing of central public sector undertakings improves corporate governance, besides unlocking the value for all stakeholders  the government, the company and the shareholders, Mukherjee said in his budget speech.         
	Since last year, ownership has been broad-based in Oil India Limited, NHPC, NTPC and Rural Electrification Corporation while the process is on for National Mineral Development Corporation and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam.        
	I propose to raise a higher amount during the year 2010-11. The proceeds will be utilised to meet the capital expenditure requirements of social sector schemes for creating new assets, Mukherjee said.        
	Sumit Bose, disinvestment secretary, said, Discussions are on with heads of departments of different ministries for the divestment of the government stake in companies under their administrative control.        
	He said divestment was part of the government policy to make it mandatory for all state-run firms that have made profits in the last three years to list on bourses. They will have to place at least 10 per cent of their shares with the public.        
	The market capitalisation of five companies, which have been listed since October 2004, has increased by 3.8 times from the book value of Rs 78,841 crore to a whopping Rs 2,98,929 crore, Mukherjee said making a case for broad-basing the disinvestment programme.        
	 Since the tax collection would be lower this fiscal, the only prudent way left for the government to fund the social sector projects was to reduce its stake in PSUs, said N. R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.        
	Officials said some of the big PSUs like Coal India, BSNL and SAIL would be disinvested in the next fiscal.         
	The cabinet has given nod to Engineers India to come out with a follow-on public offer.

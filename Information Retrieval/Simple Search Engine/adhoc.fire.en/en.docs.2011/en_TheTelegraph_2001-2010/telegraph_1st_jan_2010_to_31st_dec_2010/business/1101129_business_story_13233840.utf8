The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Decision on Cairn to take time
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Decision on Cairn to take time
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          PROLONGED WAIT                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: Cairn Energy will have to wait beyond December to get the governments approval for selling its majority stake in subsidiary Cairn India to London-listed Vedanta Resources for about $9.6 billion.        
	It is almost certain that the December timeline will not be met. The government requires about two to three months to examine all the applications, a senior oil ministry official said.        
	According to sources, even if the government gives its approval by February-end or March, it will be well within the April 15 deadline set by Cairn and Vedanta for closing the transaction.         
	The Edinburgh-based firm had last week sought the approval of the petroleum minister for the prolific Barmer oilfields, the eastern offshore Ravva oil and gasfields and the Cambay fields off the west coast, which had been omitted from an earlier application.        
	It had sought the governments okay for seven fields awarded in the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp) but had left out the three blocks that were awarded prior to Nelp.        
	Officials said the government would ascertain technical and financial capabilities of the new owner before giving its consent. Only companies technically capable of carrying out complex oil and gas exploration and production are awarded blocks. Cairn Energy, too, was judged on this parameter, when in 2002 it bought out Royal Dutch Shell in the Rajasthan block, which is at the centre of its deal with Vedanta.        
	The petroleum ministry maintained that according to the production-sharing contracts, any changes in the ownership of the blocks would need the governments consent.         
	Cairn Energy had said it did not require the governments permission to sell the pre-Nelp blocks to Vedanta, which is promoted by Anil Agarwal.

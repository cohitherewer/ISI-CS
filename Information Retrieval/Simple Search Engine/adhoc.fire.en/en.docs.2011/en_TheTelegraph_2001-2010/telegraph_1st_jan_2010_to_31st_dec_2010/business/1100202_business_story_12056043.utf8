	New Delhi, Feb. 1: Exports remained positive for the second straight month, growing 9.3 per cent in December.        
	While officials said the government could put a curb on stimulus measures, exporters wanted the sops to continue as the higher growth was a result of low base effect.        
	We expect a 5 per cent decline in exports in 2009-10 over the last fiscal. In 2010-11, we can expect a 10 per cent growth as there will be recovery in the rest of the world, Jyotinder Kaur, economist with HDFC Bank, said.        
	Officials said the positive numbers showed that exports in 2009-10 could touch $165-175 billion. This would be, however, lower than last fiscals revised export figure of $185 billion.        
	A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said, Stimulus should continue till exports stabilise as there is a question mark over growth in most economies once the huge stimulus poured into the economies are withdrawn.        
	After falling for 13 straight months because of global recession, exports grew 18.2 per cent in November.         
	Officials said the government could extend the 2 per cent interest subsidy on rupee export credit from March 31 to December 2010.        
	Commerce ministry officials said they had asked the finance ministry to extend the scheme, mainly to labour intensive sectors and engineering and chemicals.         
	Sources in the finance ministry said the demand is being considered, but given the fiscal situation it is difficult to take a call.         
	Imports, which are a reflection of domestic economic activity, also turned positive. After 11 months of decline, imports rose 27.2 per cent in December.         
	Exports in December increased to $14.6 billion from $13.36 billion a year ago. December imports went up to $24.75 billion from $19.45 billion in December 2008, expanding the trade gap to $10.14 billion during the month from $6.08 billion a year ago.

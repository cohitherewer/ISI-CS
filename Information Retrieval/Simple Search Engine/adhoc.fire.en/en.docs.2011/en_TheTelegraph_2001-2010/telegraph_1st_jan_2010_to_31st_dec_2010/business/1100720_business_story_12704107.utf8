	New Delhi, July 19: The government wants to auction coal and iron ore mines among user industries.         
	The amendments to the mining act bringing in a bidding process will be placed before a group of ministers later this week and then before Parliament in the coming session, coal minister Sri Prakash Jaiswal told The Telegraph.         
	Till now, coal and iron ore mines were given to user industries such as steel, power and fertiliser through allocations. This system was often criticised for not being transparent and for breeding corruption.         
	The chief ministers of states that have coal bearing land have agreed with us on the need to bring in auctions ... they will be the beneficiaries of this system as they will get the entire proceeds from the bidding, Jaiswal said. They (states) will devise ways to spend the extra revenue ... welfare schemes will figure in their list of priorities.         
	We will not give any mandatory guidelines to states on how to spend the money, the minister said.         
	The Prime Ministers Office and the Planning Commission favour auctions for coal and iron ore blocks, similar to telecom.        
	Jaiswal said though there were no plans to open up coal mine bidding to pure mining firms who could sell coal to users, this is something we may think of in the long run.         
	However, ministries that look after user industries interests, especially power, had represented that a 3G type auction among limited user industries could drive up the cost of the final products on offer.        
	Power utilities work on a pass through basis with prices fixed by regulators on the basis of actual costs. Officials had pointed out that if the cost of coal in coal-fired power plants were to go up by a huge margin because the cost of acquiring the mine was high, electricity costs would have to go up by that extent.        
	Plan panel advisers, however, said auctions were the only way to ensure investments of Rs 118,000 crore could be brought in to ramp up production to 1,061 million tonnes a year by 2025.         
	Allocated resources are never exploited properly ... but once purchased at a fair auction at high prices, buyers will do their best to exploit the resources to extract profit from their investments, plan panel advisers said.         
	Blocks that have been fully explored as well as those that need further exploration will be put up for bidding. Officials said clauses may be brought in later in the terms and conditions which could give preference to companies that propose to set up washeries or end-use industry in the same state.

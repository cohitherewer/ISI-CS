          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 15: Reliance Industries and the technology titans  TCS, Wipro and Infosys  can all breathe easy once again.        
	The government has dropped its plan to change the formula for calculating the minimum alternate tax (MAT)  a levy that former finance minister P. Chidambaram had introduced in 1996 to squeeze some revenue out of big-spending, zero-tax entities.        
	Last year, the government had unveiled the first draft of its discussion paper on the direct tax code and stunned the MAT-paying companies by proposing to calculate the levy with reference to the value of their gross assets.        
	The change in the formula had also been proposed when Chidambaram headed the finance ministry.         
	Pranab Mukherjee has chosen not to rock the boat by deciding to stick with the current formula under which the levy is calculated on the basis of book profits.         
	While unveiling the revised draft today, revenue secretary Sunil Mitra said the old formula would stay.        
	It may be recalled that in the first draft of the direct tax code, the government had proposed that MAT ought to be charged at 2 per cent of gross assets of a company instead of charging it at 15 per cent of book profits.         
	The discussion paper had then said that MAT would be levied at 0.25 per cent of the value of gross assets in the case of banking companies and 2 per cent for all other companies.        
	Accepting the industrys litany of objections against the change in the formula, the government admitted that there may be practical difficulties and unintended consequences, particularly in the case of loss-making companies and companies having a long gestation period. It is, therefore, proposed to compute MAT with reference to book profits.        
	Reacting to the change, Sanjay Kapadia, executive director, Ernst amp; Young told The Telegraph that had the earlier proposal been accepted, it would have had major negative implications. While it would have resulted in discouraging companies from creating assets, it would also have impacted capital intensive sectors.        
	The earlier proposal would have affected all capital intensive industries and infrastructure companies which have more assets. Moreover, even a company going through a liquidation would also have been subject to MAT since it has assets on its books, Kapadia added.        
	Kapadia, however, added that the revised discussion paper was silent on existing provision of MAT credit being carried forward.        
	Industry had argued against the change in the formula on the ground that companies operating in a cyclical downturn would be badly affected.        
	They had also said it was wrong to apply an efficiency metric like return on assets to calculate presumptive tax.        
	Some experts had said that since the proposed MAT regime did not provide any tax break during the gestation period, investment costs in new businesses would be higher on account of MAT when compared with older businesses which already had the benefit of a depreciated asset base.        
	They also slammed the proposal to include capital works in progress in the equation.

        A multi-storeyed property may be used for various purposes. Subhash Lakhotia offers advice on the tax implications                                            
	Anurag Lohiya owns a three-storey house in Vasant Vihar, New Delhi. The ground floor houses Anurags consultancy firm, he lives on the second and the third floor has been let out to a multi-national company for Rs 1,50,000 a month.         
	As a taxpayer, Anurag seems to be making good use of his house. A single property is being put to multiple uses. However, lets explore the tax issues in the above situation.         
	Deduction norms        
	Anurag runs his consultancy from the ground floor and, therefore, all expenses relating to this floor of the building will be allowed as a deduction in full while computing his net professional income.         
	Hence, expenses such as on painting, repairs and any other maintenance on the ground floor will be fully allowed as a tax deduction to Anurag while computing his income from profession.         
	Moreover, Anurag can also claim depreciation allowance on this floor. This depreciation will be allowed on a year to year basis based on the written down value of the assets.        
	Moving up        
	For the first floor of the property, which is his residence, Anurag can claim deduction up to Rs 1,50,000 per annum as interest on home loan in case he has taken one.         
	If Anurag has taken a loan from any member of his family at any rate of interest, even then he will enjoy a tax deduction.         
	Likewise, Anurag will also enjoy deduction on pro-rata basis on stamp duty and registration fees paid by him for first floor of the building under section 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 within the overall limit of deduction u/s 80C.        
	Anurag can also claim a deduction for repayment of the loan taken for the first floor in case he borrowed it from persons mentioned in section 80-C of the Income-tax Act, 1961.        
	Let out        
	The second floor of the building has been let out by Anurag to a multi-national company. which pays him a hefty rent.        
	For this floor that has been rented out, Anurag will enjoy a deduction on the actual amount paid for house tax or municipal tax.         
	Similarly, for the portion let out, Anurag can claim a deduction of 30 per cent as standard deduction for repair and collection charges, if any.        
	This 30 per cent deduction will be available irrespective of the purchase price.         
	Another important deduction will be on the interest on any loan taken for the second floor.         
	This deduction will be allowed to Anurag without any upper limit.         
	Thus, for prudent tax planning it makes sense to buy a complete building with three multiple uses of the same.        
	Expense log        
	In case there are certain other expenses connected with the property the same will have to be apportioned amongst three floors and then depending on the nature of the expenditure a deduction will be allowed.         
	For example, if Anurag decides to install a lift and generator, he can get a deduction of a third of these expenses, including on maintenance, as they relate to his office premises.         
	However, in a self-occupied property, these expenses will not enjoy any tax deduction.         
	Similarly, for his spending on a lift and generator, Anurag will not enjoy any additional tax deduction while computing his income from house property.         
	If the generator is installed only for the ground floor portion of the building, the entire expense will be allowed as a deduction while computing income from business of Anurag.        
	Whenever a single property is put to multiple use, make sure that every expense incurred by the assessee should be distributed amongst the different floors of the building. Only then should an assessee calculate his deduction claim based on the objective and purpose of that portion of the property. This will help the owner get the relevant tax benefits for the property.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | FDI in retail, aviation up for review 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      FDI in retail, aviation up for review

	New Delhi, July 6: The Manmohan Singh government is looking afresh at relaxing the caps on foreign direct investments in airlines, retail and defence.        
	Sources said the government could allow FDI in the back-end of food retail. Multi-brand retail in select metros could be opened up.        
	The government is also thinking of relaxing the norms for airlines.         
	Though FDI up to 49 per cent is allowed, foreign airlines cannot pick up a stake, even indirectly.        
	Sources said the PMO, the finance ministry and the Planning Commission have long supported minority stakes by foreign airlines.        
	Several carriers, including Vijay Mallyas Kingfisher, have lobbied for the move; others such as Jet have opposed the entry of foreign players.        
	Mallyas Kingfisher was reported to have received offers from Virgin and British Airways.         
	Global aviation body IATA wants India to allow foreign investment, which will improve the efficiency of the local players. Though the industry has grown at a rapid pace, it has been accused of being tardy on safety norms.         
	Retail moves        
	The commerce ministry has come up with a discussion paper on retail FDI. The ministry has sought views from the public on whether to allow FDI in multi-brand retail and the need for a cap.        
	The ministry wants a debate on investments in the food retail chain and whether FDI be leveraged for creating back-end infrastructure.        
	FDI in retail, the discussion paper said, had arrived in China 18 years ago. Initially retail chains with 49 per cent FDI were set up in the six coastal provinces, but even this limit has been relaxed now.        
	Officials said the Congress led UPA had not been able to come to any conclusion. There could still be some kind of relaxation ... it could be by way of allowing FDI in back-end of food retail or in multi-brand retail in select metropolitan cities.        
	To dispel doubts among allies such as the Trinamul Congress, which have in the past opposed the opening up of the sector, the paper says small retailers in the unorganised sector have been growing at 15 per cent annually, while organised entities have seen a dip in profit. The paper highlights recommendations made by an Icrier study.        
	The study has suggested that mandis and food markets be modernised through public-private partnerships, and cash-and-carry outlets such as Metro should be set up.        
	Goods should be procured from farmers as is done in China, while farm co-operatives and associations of farmers should be encouraged to sell in the markets.        
	Organised retailers such as Sunil Mittals Bharti group, which has an alliance with Wal-Mart in the cash and carry business, and Kishore Biyanis Future Group today welcomed the governments move to seek a discussion on such a pressing issue.        
	Defence plans        
	Sources said the government was looking at relaxing the 26 per cent cap on foreign investment in defence and raising it to 49 per cent.        
	However, it might try to link this with the US lifting trade and collaboration restrictions on agencies such as Isro and the DRDO.        
	These restrictions had been placed after the Indian government carried out nuclear tests in 1998.         
	Though the commerce ministry has moved a note seeking to increase foreign direct investment in defence to 74 per cent, Indian firms such as M amp;M, L amp;T and the Tatas as well as the defence ministry are opposed to the proposal.         
	Industry argues that a 49 per cent stake offer will be sufficient to attract the top names in the defence business to go for alliances with local firms.

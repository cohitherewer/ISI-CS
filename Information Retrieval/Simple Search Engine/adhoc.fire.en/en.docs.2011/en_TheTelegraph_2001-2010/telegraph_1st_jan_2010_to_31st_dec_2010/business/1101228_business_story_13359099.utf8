          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sergey Savchenko in Lucknow on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: Sistema Shyam is rolling out 2G services in new circles, while it prepares to respond to a government showcause notice claiming Rs 11 crore as damages for delays in starting operations.        
	The telecom department has pulled up some operators for failing to meet their rollout obligations and have threatened to slap a penalty. The operators have been given three months to respond to the showcause notices.        
	Analysts said the three-month period would give the operators an opportunity to launch services in more circles.        
	Under the licence conditions, if an operator fails to fulfil the obligation even after 52 weeks of delay, the department of telecom has the power to cancel the licence.        
	Sistema Shyam  a joint venture between Russias Sistema and Indias Shyam group  got its licence in 2008 to provide services in all 22 circles. So far, it has started operations in 15 areas, including UP east and UP west  the two new service areas launched today.        
	MTS would now be able to address the telecom needs of over 80 per cent of Indias population and about 92 per cent of data market potential in the country, said Sergey Savchenko, chief financial officer of Sistema Shyam, in Lucknow.

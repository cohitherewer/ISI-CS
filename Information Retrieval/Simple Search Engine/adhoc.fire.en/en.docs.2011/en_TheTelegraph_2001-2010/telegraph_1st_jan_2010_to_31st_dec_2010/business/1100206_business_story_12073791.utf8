          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Feb. 5: A panic wave swept away stock and forex markets globally, taking along with it local stocks and the rupee, which plunged to a five-week low.         
	The problem of spiralling deficit in some European countries has raised fears of a sovereign debt crisis in that region. The BSE sensex crashed 434 points to a three-month low of 15790.93, and the rupee dropped 48 paise to 46.74 against the dollar. The 50-issue Nifty of the NSE also fell a hefty 126.70 points, or 2.61 per cent, to 4718.65.        
	Concerns that a global economic recovery is still some time away added to investors worry when data from the US showed a higher number of people seeking unemployment benefits.         
	Both these developments sent equities into a tailspin globally, with even commodities bearing the brunt as risk-averse investors took money out of these assets. While the Japanese Nikkei plunged about 3 per cent, Hong Kongs Hang Seng crashed over 3 per cent and South Koreas Kospi Index dropped 3.05 per cent. European shares were down with London Stock Exchanges FTSE 100 dropping over 1 per cent.         
	In the US, the Dow was down 1.31 per cent in afternoon trade, while the Nasdaq fell 1.04 per cent.         
	Greeces fiscal deficit of 12.7 per cent of GDP made investors nervous in Europe. Fears were raised about not only Greece but also over the ability of some others to service their debt such as Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain.         
	The global selloff had its impact on domestic equities as risk-averse foreign institutional investors exited emerging markets.         
	The FIIs have developed a cold feet because of the European crisis and this has led to risk aversion among them, said P. Phani Sekhar of Angel Broking.

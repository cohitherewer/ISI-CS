	New Delhi, July 8: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjees timely intervention has removed the uncertainty surrounding Coal Indias Rs 15,000-crore initial public offering.        
	Slated to be the countrys biggest IPO, the issue was in jeopardy after the environment ministry restricted mining in most of the areas controlled by the company.        
	Mukherjee today called environment minister Jairam Ramesh and coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal to his North Block office and brokered a truce.        
	Ramesh agreed to give a green signal to most of Coal Indias mining zones marked as no-go areas.        
	The environment ministry had divided forest areas into go and no-go areas, depending on the tree cover. The move drew a flurry of protests not only from industry but also from Coal India, which found much of its mining area reduced and feared an erosion in its valuation.        
	The two ministries had been negotiating a relaxation in the criteria for the demarcation following orders from the Prime Ministers Office (PMO). The PMO was forced to intervene after steel and power companies raised objection to the environment ministrys order.        
	However, the relaxations that Ramesh was initially willing to offer were rejected by the coal ministry as much of the area owned by Coal India continued to remain in the no-go zone.         
	The standoff between the two ministries raised concerns over the fate of Coal Indias public issue that was initially scheduled for this month.         
	Coal India has already revised its production target for 2011-12 to 486 million tonnes from 520 million tonnes because of regulatory hurdles. It would have to curtail production further if mining was prohibited over large areas, while the stock would lose value even before it got listed.         
	The government holds 100 per cent equity in the countrys largest coal producer and wants to sell 63.13 crore shares at a price of over Rs 200 apiece through the IPO to raise money for social and infrastructure schemes.        
	The environment ministry had made the area-wise divisions based on the satellite imagery of the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI). In a letter to the coal minister, the CMPDI expressed its reservations over the criteria for the selection of non-mining areas. The environment ministry had designated any forest land with more than 15 per cent tree cover as no-go. The CMPDI wanted areas with at least 50 per cent tree cover to be demarcated as no-go.         
	Mukherjees intervention meant that a large number of steel and power companies whose mine allotments were in a similar jeopardy could be off the hook. The Tatas, Hindustan Zinc and Prakash Industries are among those affected.        
	The environment ministrys classification would have put 619 million tonnes of coal production annually out of the reach of miners. Officials said the peace brokered today would help the two ministries to work together to revise the land division and release at least a third of this.         
	According to the mid-term appraisal of the Planning Commission, domestic firms will need to buy more foreign coal assets as the demand-supply gap will shoot up to 200 million tonnes by the end of 2017.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 5: The finance ministry today agreed to pay Rs 14,000 crore to Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum as compensation for selling cooking gas and kerosene below their cost prices in the last fiscal.         
	With this tranche, the government will pay a total of Rs 26,000 crore to the three PSU oil marketing companies as compensation vis--vis the two cooking fuels.         
	The petroleum ministry had asked for Rs 19,620 crore as compensation, but the finance ministry agreed to release Rs 14,000 crore.         
	The finance ministry has agreed to pay Rs 14,000 crore as compensation, said petroleum minister Murli Deora. He, however, did not explain how the gap of Rs 5,620 crore, which would remain even after the compensation was released, would be met.         
	The three state-run oil companies claim they have lost Rs 31,643 crore on selling cooking gas and kerosene below cost during 2009-2010.         
	The petroleum ministry has argued that this compensation should be paid in full as the oil marketers themselves have absorbed all the losses. The three firms have lost Rs 46,163 crore from selling petrol, diesel, domestic LPG (cooking gas) and PDS kerosene below costs in 2009-10. Sources said upstream firms Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Oil India Limited, which are meeting 32 per cent of the revenue loss, could not contribute anything beyond this. The petroleum ministry reminded the finance ministry of its commitment to meet the entire deficit on LPG and kerosene.         
	Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum lose Rs 272.5 crore every day and may end the current fiscal with a Rs 85,000-crore revenue loss.         
	They sell petrol at a loss of Rs 6.63 a litre, while the loss is Rs 6.25 per litre on diesel, Rs 19.74 per litre on PDS kerosene and Rs 254.37 on every 14.2-kg LPG cylinder.         
	An empowered group of ministers, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, is likely to meet next week to look into the proposals for freeing fuel prices and meeting the balance revenue loss.         
	Besides Mukherjee and Deora, the group includes agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, railways minister Mamata Banerjee, fertiliser minister M.K. Alagiri, road transport minister Kamal Nath and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. Officials said they would try to convince the panel to free the price of petrol. If this happens, the fuel can become costlier by Rs 6.         
	However, in diesel, the preferred fuel for trucks, prices might be freed in phases as it could lead to an all-round increase in inflation.         
	The projected losses on these fuels, along with cooking gas and kerosene, are Rs 85,000 crore for 2010-11. Petrol and diesel roughly account for a third of the losses at nearly Rs 29,000 crore. LPG and kerosene may take up the balance Rs 56,000 crore.

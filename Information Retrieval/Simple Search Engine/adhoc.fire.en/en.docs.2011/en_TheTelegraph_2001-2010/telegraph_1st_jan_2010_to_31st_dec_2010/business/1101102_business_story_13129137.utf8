  - RBI identifies challenges and opportunities ahead        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the RBI might take steps to check inflation at its mid-year monetary policy review tomorrow.        
	Mukherjee said he had discussed rates with RBI governor D. Subbarao and expressed hope that the central bank would balance the need to rein in inflation with the need to push economic growth.        
	The finance minister expects inflation to come down to acceptable levels soon and urged the state governments to take action.        
	Inflation is a matter of concern. The main reason for the high level of inflation is food prices, Mukherjee told reporters at a conference of the Indian Banks Association.         
	Overall inflation for September was 8.62 per cent, much higher than the Reserve Banks comfort level of 5-6 per cent.         
	Food inflation, which has remained in double digits for the past three months, is feeding the overall inflation.         
	Food inflation in mid-October stood at 13.75 per cent.        
	In a bid to tame inflation, the central bank has hiked its key short-term lending (repo) and borrowing (reverse repo) rates five times this year. The repo and reverse repo rate is now 6 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.         
	The RBI is expected to hike policy rates by 25 basis points tomorrow.        
	Mukherjee said the country was back on a robust 9 per cent growth path, while fiscal deficit had remained at estimated levels.        
	This year the fiscal deficit will not exceed 5.5 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) as estimated in the budget, said Mukherjee, adding that the total debt stock will come down to 48.2 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal.         
	He also urged the state governments to reduce their debt through fiscal consolidation.

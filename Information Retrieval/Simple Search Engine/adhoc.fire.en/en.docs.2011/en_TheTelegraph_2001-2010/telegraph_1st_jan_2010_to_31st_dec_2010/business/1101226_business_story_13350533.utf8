          PINAK GHOSH                          Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and oil minister Murli Deora in Haldia on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Haldia, Dec. 25: Oil marketing companies that are saddled with huge under-recoveries have reasons to feel assured.        
	The oil ministry today told the retailers that they need not fear about suffering losses on their fuel sales.        
	Solutions will be found to the problem as the finance ministry has given us an assurance. They have no reason to fear about suffering losses, petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said.        
	He was speaking to reporters at the inauguration of a new hydrocracker unit and the expansion of an Indian Oil refinerys capacity here.        
	He said oil companies had been suffering from under-recoveries since 2006-07, ranging from Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 1.5 lakh crore, but none of the oil companies had reported losses so far. The projected under-recovery for 2010-11 on account of selling diesel, LPG and kerosene is likely to be in the region of Rs 70,000 crore.        
	To a query, Sundareshan said the government had not taken any decision about IOCs follow-on public offer.        
	Earlier, speaking at the inauguration ceremony, oil and petroleum minister Murli Deora said the ministrys request to finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was present at the ceremony, was to continue with the subsidies provided to oil companies.         
	Meanwhile, ahead of the meeting of the empowered group of ministers for reviewing the price of diesel and LPG, Mukherjee today said all issues would be considered before arriving at any decision.         
	Prices of petroleum products are always under review. No decision has been taken on hiking prices of LPG and diesel. Everything will have to be factored in before any decision is taken, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | China raises rates to fight inflation
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      China raises rates to fight inflation
                            
	Beijing, Dec. 25 (Reuters): Chinas central bank raised interest rates on Saturday, the second rise in just over two months, stepping up its battle to rein in stubbornly high inflation.        
	The Peoples Bank of China said it would increase the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to 5.81 per cent and raise the benchmark deposit rate also by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent.        
	The central bank said in a statement on its website that the latest rate rise would take effect on Sunday.        
	Annual Chinese consumer price inflation raced to a 28-month high of 5.1 per cent in November, in part because of excess cash in the economy that is driving prices higher.        
	While almost all investors and analysts thought more tightening was coming, there was uncertainty about whether the central bank would raise rates before the end of the year.        
	The move came after Beijing said early in December it was switching to a prudent monetary policy, from its earlier moderately loose stance.        
	Analysts said the change of wording could pave the way for more interest rate increases and lending controls.        
	Chinese stock markets have shed nearly 10 per cent since mid-November on concerns the government would ratchet up its monetary policy tightening in face of rising inflation.        
	To tame price pressures, China raised interest rates on October 19 for the first time in nearly three years. The consensus of analysts this month was for three rate rises of 25 basis points each by the end of next year.        
	Along with playing a key role in the fight against inflation, policy tightening also signals the governments confidence that the worlds second-largest economy is on a solid ground, even as the US and European recoveries remain fragile.        
	China has also officially increased banks required reserve requirements six times this year and restricted lending by them.        
	In addition, Beijing has taken a slew of steps to cool the property sector, trying to ward off a potential asset bubble.

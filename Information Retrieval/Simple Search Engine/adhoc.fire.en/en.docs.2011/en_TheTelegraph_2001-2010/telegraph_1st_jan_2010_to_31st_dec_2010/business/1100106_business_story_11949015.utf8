										      OUR CORRESPONDENT      Day 1: compacts steal the show at auto expo, even as bikers dream comes true                        Ratan Tata with the Aria in New Delhi on Tuesday. Picture by Prem Singh				               
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: Tata Motors plans to take the Nano to the US.                          
	The company is developing a variant of its mini car for the US market, which should be ready in three years.        
	According to Tata Motors chairman Ratan Tata, We recognise there is a market (for low-cost cars) not only in developing countries, but also in the developed markets.         
	For the US, we need a car that will have a larger engine, which needs additional crash tests, modifications, and were in the process of doing this. I cant indicate how long this will take but it could be three years, Tata said at the Delhi auto expo 2010.        
	The Nano was a major attraction at the 2008 expo, with the Tatas hailed for coming out with a car for just Rs 1 lakh. The car has a 624-cubic centimeter petrol engine, measures just over three meters in length and is being sold in three versions.         
	The company also has expansion plans for Jaguar-Land Rover (JLR), which it acquired 18 months ago.        
	On how soon JLR would turn around, he said, No one makes acquisitions on a short-term basis. Ours is not a short-term investment. Its not something to add to our egos.        
	Tata Motors has plans to expand its dealer network for JLR to New Delhi, Hyderabad and Ludhiana in the first phase of expansion but has kept Calcutta out of the picture.        
	As of now we have no plans to open dealerships in Calcutta, said Tata. At present, only Mumbai has a JLR dealer.        
	The company today previewed Aria, a crossover between a multi-utility and a sports utility vehicle. The date of Arias commercial launch is yet to be decided.         
	The company also previewed passenger carrier Magic Iris and MPV Venture, besides the Jaguar XJ.        
	Ratan Tata today virtually ruled out any investment in Bengals Singur and said the company would gladly return the land if compensated.        
	Today we have no plans to do anything in Singur. We went to Singur and invested to give jobs. Unless there is harmony, we wont consider going there, said Tata.        
	Bengal chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti today said in Calcutta the state government was in touch with the Tatas for the return of the Singur land.

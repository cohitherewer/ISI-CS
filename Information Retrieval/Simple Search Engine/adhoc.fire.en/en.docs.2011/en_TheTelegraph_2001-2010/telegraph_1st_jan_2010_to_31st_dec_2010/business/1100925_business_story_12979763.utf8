          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: The Director-General of Hydrocarbons has refused to acknowledge a natural gas discovery by Reliance Industries in the Krishna Godavari basin, close to its prolific D-6 field, on technical grounds.        
	Charging RIL with violation of contractual provisions, the DGH in its letter to RIL and Hardy Oil said the operator (RIL) did not give any notice to witness the discovery.        
	The discovery, announced on August 31, was RILs fourth find in the KG-D3 block. Hardy Oil and Gas holds 10 per cent interest in the block. RIL is the operator of the block with 90 per cent interest. As no representative of the regulator was present to witness the discovery, the DGH said, The notified gas discovery (D-52) in the block KG-DWN-2003/1 is not considered as gas discovery.         
	It is in violation of Article 10.2 of the production sharing contract (PSC) between RIL and the government.        
	According to the production sharing contract for the KG-D3 block, If the contractor conducts a drill stem or production test with regard to any exploration well, it shall notify the government of the time at least 48 hours prior to the proposed test, and the government shall have the right to have a representative present during such a test.        
	RIL officials declined to comment on the DGH decision. We would not like to comment, they said.        
	DGH officials said the hydrocarbon guidelines require that new significant discovery made in any block may be declared only after detailed technical appraisal of the discovery with prior government approval.        
	The hydrocarbon body is keen that companies do not unduly influence market sentiment through huge claims about oil or gas discoveries without technical appraisal.         
	The practice of unduly influencing market sentiments have been adopted by both private sector and state-owned firms, they said.        
	The well, KGV-D3-W1, drilled in deep sea block KG-DWN- 2003/1, also known as D3, struck natural gas at 3,501 metres below the sea bed.         
	The government awarded the block to Reliance and Hardy in 2005 in the fifth round of bidding under the New Exploration Licensing Policy.        
	Industry observers were surprised by the DGH move.         
	At best, the DGH should have warned Reliance for the lapse or sought another test to determine the discovery but to disallow it completely doesnt augur well for an energy deficient nation, an analyst said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Som: Reaching out                          
	New Delhi, July 6: State-owned National Mineral Development Corporation Ltd (NMDC) is in talks with Japanese firms Nippon Steel and Kobe Steel for two separate projects in India.        
	NMDC chairman and managing director Rana Som said Nippon Steel was one among a clutch of Japanese steel firms with whom the PSU was in talks for its proposed two-million-tonne-per-annum steel facility in Karnataka. It will be a joint venture project, and is likely to cost Rs 10,000 crore.         
	The company is in discussions with another Japanese steel firm Kobe for a project in Andhra Pradesh.         
	We are also talking to Kobe for an iron nugget project in Andhra Pradesh. It will be a joint venture with our recently acquired Sponge Iron India Ltd, Som said.        
	The company said it would start placing orders for its upcoming 3 million tonne steel plant in Chhattisgarh from October. We plan to complete the construction of our integrated steel project in Chhattisgarh in the next 40 months from the date of placing the order, he said. NMDC will invest Rs 3,000 crore to set up a 12-million-tonne pipeline from Chhattisgarh to Andhra Pradesh to supply ore in the form of slurry to domestic steel plants.         
	We will set up a 424-km pipeline between Bailadila mines and Vizag at a cost of Rs 3,000 crore and will have an annual capacity of 12 million tonnes, Som said.        
	The company plans to place orders for the pipeline by October and commission it in the next two years.         
	The pipeline will help us in supplying our increasing output to our domestic customers such as Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd and Essar Steel, he said.        
	Som said the company feared a drop in the evacuation of iron ore after its 274-km-long pipeline was damaged  allegedly by the Maoists  in 2009. The pipeline is yet to be repaired. The company will invest Rs 3,400 crore to raise its annual output to about 41 million tonnes from 22 million tonnes. We have already invested Rs 2,000 crore and will commission Bailadila-11/D mines by the end of this financial year and the other will be commissioned after this, he said.        
	The company expects to achieve sales of around Rs 2,400 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal.

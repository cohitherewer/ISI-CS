	New Delhi, Oct. 20: HCL Technologies  the countrys fourth largest software exporter  has posted a 3.1 per cent rise in consolidated net profit for the July-September quarter on narrower foreign exchange losses and demand for its outsourcing services.        
	The infotech firms consolidated net profit stood at Rs 331 crore against Rs 321 crore a year ago. Consolidated revenue jumped around 22 per cent to Rs 3,708 crore from Rs 3,043 crore a year earlier. It grew 10 per cent from the previous quarter.         
	HCL is committed to ensuring a sustained growth momentum by investing in emerging technologies and businesses, while at the same time continuing to profitably capitalise on the existing opportunities, chairman and chief strategy officer Shiv Nadar said.         
	The company announced an interim dividend of Rs 1.50 per equity share of the face value of Rs 2 each. It also increased its headcount to 70,218 by adding over 5,661 people.         
	During the quarter, three industry verticals, including retail, healthcare and financial services, registered a double-digit growth.        
	In the last 10 quarters, this is for the first time all verticals have reported a positive growth, CEO Vineet Nayar, who will take over as vice-chairman from next month, said.        
	Analysts hope that the market for domestic outsourcers will continue to be strong, riding on sales growth as technology spending in developed markets rebounds.         
	Revenue from the US, which accounted for 58 per cent of HCLs total revenue, rose 26 per cent to $466 million during the quarter.         
	HCLs results validate the strong traction in volumes for leading Indian IT firms.

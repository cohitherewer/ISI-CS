The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court notice to Raja
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Court notice to Raja
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Raja: Facing flak                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: The Supreme Court gave telecom minister A. Raja 10 days to reply to charges of causing a loss of around Rs 70,000 crore to the exchequer in 2G spectrum allocation.         
	Along with Raja, the apex court today issued notices to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the enforcement directorate, who are investigating the case.         
	The courts action is based on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, Telecom Watchdog  an NGO  and an individual. The court has questioned the CBIs ignorance about those under investigation, though it has been on the case for several months. The petitioners have asked the apex court to either monitor the CBI probe or have a court-appointed team investigate the matter.        
	They have alleged that the CBI is deliberately messing up the inquiry since a cabinet minister and others in the government are involved.         
	Even after eight months, the CBI has neither summoned the suspects, nor filed any charge sheet. It is clear that the government is attempting to close the case and is trying to ensure that no proper investigation is carried out, said petitioner Prashant Bhushan, a senior advocate.         
	The Opposition has attacked the government over the 2G spectrum allocation and Rajas role. The corruption charges can be traced back to 2008, when 2G spectrum and licences were allegedly allotted to favoured parties at throwaway prices on a first come, first served basis. At the rate of Rs 1,658.57 crore per pan-India licence, the government got Rs 9,014 crore.

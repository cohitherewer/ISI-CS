The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fortis faces Malaysian challenge
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fortis faces Malaysian challenge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES                                            
	New Delhi, May 27: Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah launched a $835-million (S$1.18-billion or Rs 3,950-crore) bid for Parkway Holdings, pitting it against Fortis Healthcare in a battle for Singapores largest private healthcare provider.        
	The surprise offer could either kick off a takeover fight for the medical firm which operates 16 hospitals in Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, India and China or force Fortis to cash out.        
	In March, Fortis Healthcare had paid S$3.56 per share to acquire a 23.9 per cent stake in the Singapore-based healthcare firm Parkway Holdings for $685.3 million (nearly Rs 3,100 crore) from US firm TPG.         
	Khazanah is offering S$3.78 a share to increase its stake from 23.5 per cent in Parkway to 51.5 per cent. The offer price represents a 25.2 per cent premium over Parkways last traded price of S$3.02 per share on May 26 and a 60.9 per cent premium over Parkways 12-month volume weighted average price of S$2.35 per share.        
	Fortis shares jumped 6 per cent in Mumbai after the announcement, indicating that markets expect Malvinder Singh, whose family controls Fortis, to sell out.        
	The market is betting it would be exiting at a profit, Jagannadham Thunuguntla, equity head at SMC Capitals in New Delhi, said on Thursday. If Fortis wants to go ahead, then they will have to write a big cheque.        
	A Fortis Healthcare spokesperson said, We are aware of the development, but have nothing to comment at this stage.        
	Hitesh Sharma, pharma analysts with Ernst amp; Young, said, Fortis had acquired (the stake) with a certain strategy (in mind). The offer price from Khazanah has a marginal premium over what Fortis had paid. So it would study the offer and could even come out with a counter-bid. We have to wait and watch.        
	In March, Fortis said it had no immediate plans to raise its stake and would work with Parkway to expand across the region. The company intended to seek four seats on the board of Parkway and also nominate Singh as chairman.        
	Singh stepped down as chairman of financial services group Religare Enterprises in April to focus on his expanding healthcare business. He recently shifted his base from Delhi to Singapore, where he became chairman of Parkway.         
	Khazanahs offer is being made by its group company Integrated Healthcare Holdings (IHHL), which plans to spread its presence across Asia. Khazanah will hold the Parkway shares in its Integrated Healthcare unit along with its stakes in Pantai Holdings Bhd, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise and IMU Health Sdn Bhd.        
	This deal could be Khazanahs biggest acquisition outside Malaysia. Parkway had no immediate comments on Khazanahs offer.        
	Khazanah has identified healthcare as one of the core areas that they want to go into, Ang Kok Heng, chief investment officer at Kuala Lumpur-based Phillip Capital, told agencies.        
	In 2006, Khazanah bought into Pantai Holdings, which has a network of nine hospitals throughout Malaysia. This offer shows that theyre moving towards that same direction, Ang said.

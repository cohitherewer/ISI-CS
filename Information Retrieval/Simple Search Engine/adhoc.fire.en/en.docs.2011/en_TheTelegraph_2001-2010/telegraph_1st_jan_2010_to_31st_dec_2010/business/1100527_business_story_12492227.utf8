	New Delhi, May 26: Telecom operators have tied up with banks and financial institutions to pay the licence fee for third-generation (3G) spectrum by weekend as well as to roll out services later.        
	STel, a joint venture between the Siva group and Bahrain Telecom, has raised Rs 338 crore as licence fee for three circles. The money will come from PSU banks as a bridge loan or short-term financing till the company gets a long-term loan.        
	Bankers said companies would refinance the short-term borrowings with long-term loans  domestic and foreign  that attracted lower interest rates.         
	The government recently allowed telecom firms to raise short-term loans from the domestic market, which could be refinanced by external commercial borrowings (ECBs) within 12 months. The cap on ECBs has been increased by $5 billion to $40 billion for 2010-2011.        
	STel CEO Shamik Das said the company would also spend around Rs 360 crore over the next five years to roll out 3G services. We are working out the details for raising more and are in talks with potential lenders, Das said.        
	Aditya Birla groups Idea Cellular has borrowed over Rs 5,000 crore for licence fee payment and is in talks for another Rs 2,500 crore required for network rollout. It is a mix of bank loans, existing debt and cash balance, said Akshya Moondra, CFO of Idea.        
	Tata Teleservices has raised over Rs 4,500 crore through a mix of commercial paper and short-term bank loans, said banking sources.         
	Reliance Communications and Aircel have raised about Rs 3,000 crore each, while Bharti Airtel has tied up over Rs 7,500 crore though a combination of domestic debt and ECBs for spectrum payment.

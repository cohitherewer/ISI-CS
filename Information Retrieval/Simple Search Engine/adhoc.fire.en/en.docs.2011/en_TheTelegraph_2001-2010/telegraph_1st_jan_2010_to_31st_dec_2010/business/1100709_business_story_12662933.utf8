The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court backs Daiichi in Zenotech case 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Court backs Daiichi in Zenotech case 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 8: The Supreme Court today fixed Daiichi Sankyos open offer price for Zenotech Laboratories at Rs 113.62 per share, setting aside an earlier order of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) that had asked the Japanese drug maker to offer a much higher price.        
	A bench comprising Justice Aftab Alam and Justice R.M. Lodha set the open offer price for Zenotech Labs at Rs 113.62 per share against Rs 160 per share fixed by SAT for Daiichi Sankyo to acquire an additional 20 per cent stake in the company.        
	Daiichi Sankyo, which had bought a controlling stake in Ranbaxy Laboratories, was locked in a bitter dispute with the minority shareholders of Zenotech over the offer price.        
	The dispute began in January last year over the price of Rs 113.62 per share announced by Daiichi Sankyo. At that time, Jayaram Chigurupati, the managing director of the Hyderabad-based company, had opposed the price. He claimed that the actual price was Rs 160 per share as this was the commitment made by Daiichis management team and that an agreement to offer Rs 160 apiece was reached in July 2008. Chigurupati, who was the founder of Zenotech, first approached the market regulator and subsequently appealed to SAT.        
	Ranbaxy had earlier entered into a share purchase agreement with Zenotech following which it also made an open offer to its shareholders at Rs 160 per share. After this offer, Ranbaxys stake in the company rose to 46.79 per cent. However, Daiichis acquisition of Ranbaxy in 2008 resulted in an indirect substantial acquisition of shares and voting rights in Zenotech. Therefore, Daiichi had to come out with an open offer in accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. It then fixed a price of Rs 113.62 per share based on the average Zenotech share price in 26 weeks.        
	Daiichi Sankyo had contended before the apex court that it would pay Rs 113.62 per share to Zenotech shareholders for their 20 per cent stake, which amounted to 68.85 lakh shares. It further said the relevant cut-off date for the public offer would be based on the stock price of October 20, 2008, when its deal with Ranbaxy was completed.         
	However, SAT had said the Japanese drug makers offer should be based on January 19, 2009 prices, when Daiichi made a public announcement that it would acquire an additional 20 per cent stake in Zenotech through an open offer. Shares of Zenotech Laboratories tumbled on news of the Supreme Court order. On the BSE, it ended 12.16 per cent lower at Rs 99.70.

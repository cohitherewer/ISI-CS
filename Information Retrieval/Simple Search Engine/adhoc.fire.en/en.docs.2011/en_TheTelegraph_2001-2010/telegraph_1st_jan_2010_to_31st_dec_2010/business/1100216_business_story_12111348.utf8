          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 15: With the latest inflation numbers topping Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) forecast of 8.5 per cent by end-March, bankers have turned their attention to the implications of the central banks statement last week that it wouldnt pull the interest rate trigger unless something exceptional happened.        
	The quibble may now begin on whether the 8.56 per cent inflation rate for the month of January marks such an exceptional event but many reckon that the stage has now been set for a rate rise and the only uncertainty is over its timing.        
	Observers point out that there are many dynamics to the story. While the RBI may be keen to control inflation by using key policy rates, it will at the same time want to sustain the growth. On the other hand, it may choose to wait for finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to place his Union Budget and unveil how much the government intends to borrow in fiscal 2011 before deciding on its monetary policy action.        
	Last week, RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn emphasised that the central bank would not take any policy action between two review meetings unless an exceptional event took place, which brought a semblance of stability to volatile markets.         
	The central bank had raised the reserve requirement for banks by 75 basis points at its review meeting on January 29. The next review meeting is on April 20.        
	Bankers are, however, divided on whether the 8.56 per cent inflation rate marks an exceptional event. A senior banker who did not wish to be named said it could prod the central bank into at least mulling an interest rate action as its inflation projection for end-March had already been breached. There is a strong possibility of inflation continuing its upward trend. Another view is that the RBI would wait till April 20 to keep the growth momentum going.        
	However, Samiran Chakraborty, head of research (India) at Standard Chartered Bank, said inflation hitting 8.56 per cent was unlikely to be the unexceptional event that Gokarn was referring to.        
	Chakraborty, who had estimated January inflation to be in the region of 8.4 per cent, added that todays number was not a big surprise. He reckoned that inflation would stay high till April.        
	Chakraborty said one of the key highlights of the January data was that food inflation was spreading to non-food items as well and that the price increase in textiles, chemicals had been quite significant.        
	Saugata Bhattacharya, senior vice president at Axis Bank, was also of the opinion that the central bank was unlikely to initiate any monetary policy action before the April 20 meeting.        
	Bhattacharya, who had expected January inflation to be around 8.25 per, said it could hover between 9 and 10 per cent in early April. But inflation will head down to 6.5 to 7 per cent next fiscal.

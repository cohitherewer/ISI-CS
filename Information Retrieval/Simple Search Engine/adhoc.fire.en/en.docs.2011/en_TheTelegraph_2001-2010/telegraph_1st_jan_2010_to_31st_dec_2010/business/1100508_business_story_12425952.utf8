          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, May 7: Investors lapped up Reliance Industries shares and dumped Anil Ambani group stocks in the wake of the Supreme Court verdict today.         
	While Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries jumped 2.27 per cent, or Rs 22.95, to close at Rs 1,033.85 on the BSE today, Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Limited fell 23 per cent.        
	Analysts feel the judgment will mean an upside of Rs 25-45 per share for RIL. Deepak Pareek, oil and gas analyst at Angel Broking who has a buy rating on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,260, said the brokerage was not immediately planning to revise this price as it would wait for more details on the judgment.         
	Some feel the judgment will remove the overhang on the RIL stock since the Bombay High Court ruling in June last year. The RIL scrip had underperformed, while the sensex gained around 12 per cent during this period. We expect RILs exploration and production activities to accelerate considering the deepwater rigs at its disposal as well as stakes in exploration blocks with high prospectivity, a Deutsche Bank report said.         
	Today the ADAG stocks comprising RNRL, Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure were at the receiving end. RNRL slumped 22.82 per cent, or Rs 15.60, to finish at Rs 52.75, while Reliance Power gave up nearly 9 per cent, or Rs 13.80, to end at Rs 140.10. Reliance Infrastructure  it has a holding in Reliance Power  crashed 7 per cent to Rs 979.70.         
	Analysts are worried about the judgments impact on Reliance Powers Dadri project. The project cost was calculated based on the supply of KG-D6 gas at $2.34 per mbtu. Market observers feel the company will now have to base the project on a pricing of $4.20 per mBtu. Reliance Power will have to base the Dadri project on a price closer to the market, said Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS.         
	Reliance Power was downgraded by Prabhudas Lilladher as it felt the judgment might impact the Dadri project.         
	Analysts are now questioning the business model of RNRL after the landmark verdict. The company was set up to buy gas and sell to another Anil Ambani group company. At $2.34 per mBtu, this business model would have been more profitable.                                 
	Rohit Nagraj and Rupa Shah, analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher, feel Reliance Powers landed cost of fuel would be close to $6.5 per mmBtu in Dadri. This is likely to lead to a generation cost of Rs 3.1 per unit in Dadri for the initial 1,400 MW which we have considered while downgrading the stock. In this case, the company would be required to sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) of around Rs 3.3 per unit. Thus, the company would either have to shift the location of the plant to optimise on cost or put the project on hold, they added. The brokerage has downgraded the Reliance Power stock to reduce from accumulate.         
	On the other hand, for RNRL, it is feared that its business model will now be questioned. ``The company was set up to buy gas and sell to another Anil Ambani group company. Had the company been successful in getting the gas at a price of $ 2.34 per mmbtu, its business model would have been better, but this judgement casts serious questions on its business model, an analyst who did not wish to be identified said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nothing special about it

        Investors tell Dhirendra Kumar he is right about wealth management                                            
	A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article in this newspaper about financial planning and wealth managers entitled Exclusivity trap. The article had pointed out that the enormous growth in the number of entities offering what they call wealth management, high-end financial planning or private banking did not bode well for investors financial wealth. Basically, they were the same old commission-based salesmen and distributors with a better presentation. Terminology such as wealth management and private banking had little purpose except as a branding exercise to help customers feel that they were getting something special. I received far more than the usual number of responses to that article.         
	In their letters, without exception, clients of wealth management services were all heavily critical of the services they received.         
	The typical email I got was about how wealth managers first tell elaborate stories about customised investment plans and then sell junk stocks, or high commission Ulips, or churn mutual fund holdings incessantly.         
	Alarmingly, the very characteristics that the larger wealth management outfits advertise as their qualities were the ones that were most conspicuously missing in their interaction with customers.         
	For example, they all emphasise on a relationship with the client. Financial conglomerates have devoted entire advertising campaigns to how their employees conduct themselves at a personal level.        
	However, in the accounts I read, a common theme was that once the recommended investments start doing badly, the relationship became somewhat one-sided. Far from enthusiastically discussing all aspects of the clients financials, relationship managers stopped taking phone calls.         
	Times may be good now, but the tall claims of wealth managers were severely tested  and found wanting  during 2008, when the investment markets crumbled. When clients started bearing losses and asking hard questions about the kind of investments that had been recommended, wealth managers simply went underground. Now, when the going is good, they are in the hunt again, looking for clients with short memories.        
	There was also another kind of email I got. This was from people engaged in the wealth management business, either as owners of smaller outfits or as employees in such outfits owned by big financial brands.        
	Surprisingly, almost none of them defended the wealth management activity as a whole. All of them said there were a lot of bad wealth managers around (even that a majority were bad) but they, individually, werent one of the bad ones.         
	This response is an interesting development and is markedly different from what Id observed when I first criticised wealth management back in 2007. In those heady days, wealth managers were prone to defend the entire activity. Now, they can see that after their clients terrible experiences in 2008, they must change tack. They all have changed their pitch to I know most wealth managers are bad, but Im one of the few good ones.         
	Some of these people were also highly critical of their customers, saying they were greedy and drove managers to make riskier investments for short-term gains. This may be true to some extent.        
	I must say that a handful of the emails sent by some wealth managers had a ring of truth. These were generally entrepreneurs who have set up new businesses and said they were serving people with whom they had real personal contact.         
	I dont know whether this works but this actual relationship with a customer is what is different from being assigned a relationship manager.        
	So broadly, these were the two categories of responses I got. One, wealth management clients criticising wealth managers. And two, wealth managers criticising all wealth managers except themselves. All in all, not a pretty picture.        
	There was a third category of email that I didnt actually get, even though I kept waiting for it. This was from satisfied wealth management clients. Not one email said, This is the advice I got, these are the investments I made over these years and it all turned out well and that proves you wrong.        
	I wonder where these happy customers are?

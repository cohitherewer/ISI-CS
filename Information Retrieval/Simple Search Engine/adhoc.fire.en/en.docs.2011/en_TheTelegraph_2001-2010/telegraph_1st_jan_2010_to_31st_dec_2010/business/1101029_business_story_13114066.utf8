	New Delhi, Oct. 28: State-owned refiner BPCL today announced that it had found crude in a deepwater area off Brazils northern coast. However, the firm did not provide the details of reserves.        
	BPCL and Videocon Industries along with Brazilian state-owned entity Petrobras own stakes in a block in Sergipe-Alagoas Basin where large accumulations of oil were discovered.        
	Videocon and BPCL subsidiary Bharat PetroResources, through a 50:50 venture, hold 40 per cent interest in the block, while Petrobras holds the rest.        
	Indian oil companies are looking for assets abroad as demand for fuel increases in the country.        
	Fuel consumption may climb 5.7 per cent to 146.08 million metric tonnes during the current fiscal, according to the oil ministrys Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.        
	Oil minister Murli Deora has said that though there has been an increase in the domestic availability of petroleum products, the country is still dependent on imports to the extent of around 80 per cent of consumption.        
	There have been 15 new oil discoveries by state-owned and private firms in the country.

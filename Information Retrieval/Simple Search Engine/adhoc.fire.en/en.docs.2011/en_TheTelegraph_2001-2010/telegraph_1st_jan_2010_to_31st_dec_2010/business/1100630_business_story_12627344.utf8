          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Drill time                          
	New Delhi, June 29: ONGC and its partners will sign contracts for 17 oil and gas blocks it won in the latest round of Nelp auction.         
	Production sharing contracts for 34 out of the 36 exploration areas that were bid for in the eighth round of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp) will be signed tomorrow, official sources said.        
	Of the 70 blocks offered in Nelp-VIII, only 36 attracted bids from interested companies. ONGC and its partners had bid for 25 blocks and won 17.        
	Of the 24 deep water blocks that the government put on offer, only eight received bids, all of which were single bids. ONGC and its partners bagged seven, while Cairn Energy of the UK was the winner of the other such block.        
	Of the 28 shallow water blocks on offer, 13 received bids. BHP Billiton Petroleum won three. ONGC got five as a lead partner and one with Oil India Ltd as the operator. Cairn Energy won a KG-basin offshore block.        
	The government had put 18 onland blocks on offer, of which 15 received bids. ONGC won four onland blocks. Other winners include Jubilant, Oil India, NTPC and Esveegee Steel.        
	The cabinet committee on economic affairs had in March rejected Deep Energys offer for two onland blocks in view of a very low percentage share of profit to government.        
	Meanwhile, oil minister Murli Deora today attacked the Opposition for calling a strike on the fuel price hike.         
	According to him, the BJP-led NDA regime had raised kerosene rates three fold and the Left-supported United Front government had notified the shift towards the market-linked pricing of LPG and kerosene.        
	Defending the government decision, Deora said the UPA was compelled to raise fuel prices by bare minimum to save public sector oil firms from a precarious financial situation.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                
	Mumbai, Feb. 26: Till the devil in the details reared its head, the angels ruled the stock market.        
	The fineprint in the budget took some investor euphoria off the announcements made by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. As investors pored over the text, the sensex gave up more than half of its gains. The index ended higher by 175.35 points at 16,429.55 but it has soared nearly 415 points during the day. The sensex had plunged 870 points after the budget last year.        
	The equity markets had approached the budget with low expectations and many had factored in possibility of the Union finance minister taking some tough measures towards fiscal consolidation.         
	Although the benchmark indices opened marginally higher at 16,255.33 ahead of the presentation of the budget, it stayed in a narrow range as the finance minister initially talked about infrastructure development and proposals to help farmers.        
	The stocks vaulted suddenly when Mukherjee announced that the fiscal deficit would be contained at 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product in 2010-11.        
	The rally continued despite the finance minister announcing a hike in minimum alternate tax, apart from a two per cent increase in excise duties. While the benchmark index stayed higher by more than 320 points when Mukherjee wound up his nearly two-hour speech, it consolidated its gains further to an intra-day peak of 16,669.25 in the belief that the budget was not as bad as feared.        
	However, as finer details began emerging, the investors resorted to profit booking, resulting in the sensex settling at 16,429.55, a gain of 175.35 points or 1.08 per cent.        
	Gaurav Dua, head of research at brokerage Sharekhan, said the initial rally came as there were low expectations and the finance minister did not make any major negative announcements.        
	Moreover, the commitment to curb fiscal deficit also cheered investors. The markets reacted positively to the net borrowing figure that was lower than expectations, he pointed out. Dua however, added that as the investors dissected finer aspects of the budget, there was some amount of disappointment.        
	Apart from some proposals like the service tax on rentals, there was an apprehension that the projected drop in fiscal deficit is not structural. Moreover, the hike in MAT and excise duties could result in a fall in earnings (profit) estimates for 2010-11. Towards the end, there was nothing in the budget that excited the markets, he added.        
	Dua felt that the markets were likely to move in a range-bound fashion over the next few days and that the broad-based nifty could move between 4,700 on the downside and 5,100 on the other end.        
	Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, had a similar view. Everything announced by Pranab Mukherjee initially was good. However, as more details started coming out, it caused concern and the markets reacted accordingly. He said investors would analyse details over the next three days and a definite reaction to the budget would be available on Tuesday when trading resumes.        
	Auto stocks led the list of gainers today as the market discounted the hike in excise duties. While Tata Motors surged by 6.33 per cent, Mahindra amp; Mahindra gained 5.06 per cent, Maruti Suzuki 4.46 per cent and Hero Honda 4.99 per cent.        
	It was followed by metal and bank shares. ITC crashed by 6.17 per cent. Reliance Capital was the top volume grosser as the stock saw investor interest on hopes that it will seek a banking licence.

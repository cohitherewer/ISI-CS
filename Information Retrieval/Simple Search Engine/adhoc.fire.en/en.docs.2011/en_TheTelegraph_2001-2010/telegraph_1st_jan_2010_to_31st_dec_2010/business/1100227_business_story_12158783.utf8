          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The government proposes to plug a loophole that allowed companies to transfer shares of unlisted companies to other entities at prices that were below fair market value without attracting any tax.        
	The loophole is being plugged through section 56 of the income tax act which is a major anti-abuse provision that currently covers only individuals and Hindu Undivided Families.        
	Under this proviso, any sum of money or any property in kind which is received without consideration or for inadequate consideration, above the prescribed limit of Rs 50,000, are chargeable to tax in the hands of the recipient under the head income from other sources. This proviso did not cover gifts made on the occasion of a marriage or under a will. The section is now being amended to include within its ambit transactions undertaken in shares of a company where the recipient is another company that does not have a substantial public stake.        
	The amendment will take effect from June 1 and will apply from assessment year 2011-12. Section 56 was introduced as a counter evasion mechanism to prevent laundering of unaccounted income under the garb of gifts, particularly after the abolition of the Gift Tax Act.        
	The other big relaxation is for charitable institutions that enjoy a streak of income from any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business.        
	At present, charitable purpose is defined narrowly as the advancement of any other object of general public activity. This meant that the entity could not claim to be a charitable purpose if it carried on any business or rendered a service for a cess or a fee or any other consideration irrespective of the nature of the use or application, or retention of the income from the activity. The budget proposes a threshold of Rs 10 lakh for income receipts from any trade, commerce or business that will allow the entity to retain its charitable tag.                          
	This amendment will come into effect retrospectively from April 1, 2009 and will apply from assessment year 2009-10.

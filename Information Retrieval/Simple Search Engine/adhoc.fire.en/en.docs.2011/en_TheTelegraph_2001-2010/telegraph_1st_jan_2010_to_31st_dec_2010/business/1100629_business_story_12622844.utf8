          R. SURYAMURTHY                              
	New Delhi, June 28: Shell India, the domestic arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, plans to have 200 fuel outlets by the end of this fiscal, with the government allowing free market pricing in petrol.        
	The company also plans to sell about 20 of its 80 running outlets and around 20 sites that were acquired for setting up fuel stations as part of its reorganisation strategy.        
	We are pleased with any move that creates a level-playing field and enhances competitiveness in the industry, Deepak Mukarji, spokesperson for Shell in India, said.         
	He said the company would be looking at opportunities to expand its business as petrol is its main source of revenue.        
	Mukarji declined to give the number of outlets that Shell planned to set up. Industry sources indicated that Shell India would expand its presence to about 200 outlets by the end of this fiscal.         
	Shell owns fuel stations in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Assam. The expansion will be in south and west India, the sources added.        
	Shell acquired a licence for a chain of up to 2,000 fuel outlets in India in July 2004 and set up a wholly owned unit, Shell India Markets Pvt Ltd.        
	Shell, the only international brand in the local petroleum retail business, will be investing about Rs 300 crore in the first phase of expansion, according to the sources.         
	The cost of setting up a petrol pump is Rs 8-10 crore in a metro and Rs 2-3 crore in a rural area.        
	Mukarji said, We are selling sites and outlets that are not worth keeping and dont match our portfolio and are buying at other places. We are adding more than we are selling, so that overall there is net growth.         
	The company has been selling branded petrol and diesel, prices of which are not controlled by the government.        
	The governments decision to deregulate petrol could prompt private retailers to revisit their business plans.         
	Reliance Industries, Shell and Essar Energy have licences to set up fuel outlets.         
	Market-driven pricing of fuel will mean re-entry of private players  RIL, Essar, Shell  thereby intensifying competition in an otherwise PSU monopoly. A 5-10 per cent erosion of the PSUs share in the fuel market seems likely, Saeed Jaffery, energy analyst with Ambit Capital, said.

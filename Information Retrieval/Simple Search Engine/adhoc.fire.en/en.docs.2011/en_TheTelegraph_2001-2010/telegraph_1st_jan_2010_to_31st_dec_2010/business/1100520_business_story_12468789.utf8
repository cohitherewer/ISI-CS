The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Price pinch in 3G victory   Operators mull ways to recover high cost
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Price pinch in 3G victory     Operators mull ways to recover high cost
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, May 19: Telecom operators groaned about the high bids thrown up by a 34-day auction for 3G radio waves that left no operator with the ability to offer the high-speed service across the country.        
	We would like to point out that the auction format and severe spectrum shortage along with ensuing policy uncertainty drove the prices beyond reasonable levels. As a result, we could not achieve our objective of a pan-India 3G footprint in this round, Bharti Airtel said in an official statement after the auction results were announced.        
	The statement deepened concerns about a possible winners curse in the two most lucrative circles of Delhi and Mumbai and sparked fears that operators would respond by charging high rates for the high-speed service, thereby blunting its appeal to customers who are used to paying one of the lowest telecom tariffs anywhere in the world.        
	It also left a critical question hanging in the air: would the players be able to lease out spectrum to those who failed to grab the licence in a particular circle?        
	The rules stipulate that none of the operators will be allowed to resell or trade in 3G spectrum but it is silent on the possibility of sharing it. There is no clarity yet on whether players such as Airtel  which grabbed 13 circles but failed to grab a licence for Calcutta  will be able to offer the service in the City of Joy where it has a robust 2G service.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has proposed spectrum sharing as an option in its latest report but the proposal has yet to be debated within the telecom ministry.         
	Officials said a formal policy on spectrum sharing could be framed before the 3G radio waves are allotted to the operators by September. Operators could also buy small players to gain spectrum in circles where they have not been able to buy 3G radio waves.         
	The strategy        
	Analysts said all the operators strategised to buy high-speed spectrum in circles where they anticipate a spectrum crunch because of rising customer numbers or where they have large numbers of high revenue-generating customers who could be tempted to opt for 3G services.         
	Out of the nine players bidding for 3G spectrum, seven players won air waves in one or more circles. Videocon promote-Datacom and Etisalat DB were the two players who did not win any spectrum.        
	Vodafone Essar, the UK giants India unit, and Tata Teleservices won nine circles. Idea Celluar got spectrum in 11 circles and STel bought spectrum in three circles.        
	Operators have ensured that they do not lose out on the best customers in certain circles and also the advantage of being a strong player in a circle, said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consultancy Com First.        
	Vodafone Essar CEO and managing director Marten Pieters said: Vodafone Essar has secured a critical strategic footprint across the country, particularly in the markets where we expect the main demand for 3G services to be in the next few years.        
	We have bagged 13 circles in 3G which will open new revenue opportunities. We now cover the whole of the southern and eastern belts as well as J amp;K, Punjab and UP (east) as well, said Gurdeep Singh, COO, Aircel.

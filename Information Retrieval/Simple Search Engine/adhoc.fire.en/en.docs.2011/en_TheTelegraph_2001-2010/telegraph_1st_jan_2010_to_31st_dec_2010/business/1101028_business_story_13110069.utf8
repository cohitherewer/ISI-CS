          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharad Pawar in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: The debate to open up multi-brand retail to foreign direct investment will be taken to states to override political resistance to the measure.         
	Agricultural minister Sharad Pawar today said he would talk to state governments on the issue. It (FDI in retail) will give good prices to farmers and consumers will also get wider choices.         
	Analysts see the move as one designed to get state governments to support FDI in retail. The Left parties and the BJP have opposed the proposal.         
	Yesterday, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia had said the panel had long been in favour of FDI.         
	If we are open to modern retail formats, then why should we not allow FDI in multi-brand retail, Ahluwalia had said. Food processing industries minister Subodh Kant Sahai had also said he was optimistic of India opening up retail next year.         
	The countrys retail sector is largely closed to foreign firms, with unorganised players such as local stores dominating the market.         
	Multi-brand retailers such as US-based Wal-Mart are not allowed to sell directly to consumers. They are only allowed to open wholesale outlets and provide back-end support to local retailers.         
	India permits 51 per cent FDI in single-brand retail and 100 per cent FDI in wholesale trading.        
	The entry of multinational retailers into India has been mired in controversy, with strong political resistance from the Left and even Congresss allies.         
	There are apprehensions that hawkers, grocers and other types of small retailers would be thrown out of business. Organised retail accounts for only 6 per cent of the total $450-billion domestic retail market.        
	Global CEO of Wal-Mart Stores (Wal-Mart) Mike Duke has been advocating the benefits of opening up the sector.         
	Wal-Mart feels FDI in retail will help consumers, suppliers and farmers, and control inflation by offering more competitive prices to consumers, while reducing wastage.         
	The government has recently sought views from all stakeholders on the issue and recently issued a discussion paper.        
	Top global retailers such as Wal-Mart, Tesco and Carrefour are waiting for the Indian government to ease foreign ownership restrictions.

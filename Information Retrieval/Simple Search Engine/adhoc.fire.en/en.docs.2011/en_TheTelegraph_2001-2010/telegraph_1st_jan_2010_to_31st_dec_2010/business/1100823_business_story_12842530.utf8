The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crude nudge to costlier petrol 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Crude nudge to costlier petrol 
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          PRICE SIMMER                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: Petrol prices may be marginally hiked by the end of this month because of a rise in global crude rates. This could be the first increase by the state-owned oil firms since the deregulation of prices in June.        
	A hike, which is looking imminent, has been held back because Parliament is in session. The government, which had to face the flak of the Opposition over price rise, is wary of further criticism, sources said.        
	Industry sources said the three firms (IOC, BPCL and HPCL) have consulted among themselves and have also discussed the issue with the oil ministry. The governments opinion was sought as it is a majority stakeholder in the oil firms.        
	Though fuel retailers have the freedom to fix the price of petrol, the Centre will continue to monitor the price revisions, officials said.        
	Sources said the oil firms also pressed for a marginal hike in the price of diesel. Decision on this is pending.         
	A petrol price hike is imminent. Only the quantum of increase will have to be decided. As on August 1, the under-recoveries on petrol stood at 50-60 paise per litre, which has now risen to over Re 1, an oil company official said.        
	In June, a government panel headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee decided to free petrol and diesel prices from state control.         
	The price of diesel  a critical transportation fuel  has been increased by Rs 2 a litre for the time being. It is not clear whether the government will continue to provide subsidy for the Rs 1.50- paise-per-litre revenue loss or it will be passed on to the consumers.        
	The oil marketing companies have not revised the prices after the June hike, though crude prices have risen. The price of the Indian basket of crude has increased from $74.84 to $77.32 a barrel. Every $1 increase in crude pushes up the price of petrol by 35 paise per litre.

                                I plan to buy a house by raising loans from friends and relatives. Will I be eligible for tax benefit from all sources?          Samiran Chatterjee, Tollygunj
                    terest payment to friends and relatives can be claimed under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act but only against a certificate received from them. In the absence of the certificate, you will not be eligible for the deduction. The recipient of interest income who issues the certificate is liable to pay tax on the interest income that he receives. As far as the principal payments are concerned, they would not qualify for tax benefit as loans only from notified institutions and banks are eligible for such deductions.                                    Loss on shares      Can I set off long-term capital loss on shares against long-term profits on other assets such as property or gold? Can I carry forward the loss in the next financial year?         Subhasis Pal, 
        Shyamnagar
                    der Section 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, long-term capital gain is tax-exempt if shares are traded through a recognised stock exchange and the security transaction tax is paid on them. Therefore, long-term loss on sale of shares cannot be carried forward or adjusted with long-term capital gains from any other asset. It has to be set off against long-term capital gains from sale of shares or mutual funds only. However, long-term capital loss on shares of a private limited company sold off-market or shares listed in foreign stock exchange can be set off against the long-term gains of other assets. Capital losses remaining after set off for a particular year can be carried forward for subsequent eight years. But it can be carried forward only if the income tax return for the year in which it arose first was submitted by due date.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Smaller than Polo 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Smaller than Polo 
                            
	Wolfsburg (Germany), June 13 (PTI): German auto major Volkswagen today said it was planning to introduce a car smaller than the Polo in India to tap the fast growing compact car segment in the country.        
	We will have something smaller than the Polo. We are working on it, Kurt Rippholz, India communication head of the Volkswagen group, said.        
	He, however, clarified that nothing had been finalised yet.        
	Volkswagen started manufacturing in India earlier this year and rolled out the Polo. It invested around Rs 3,500 crore at its Chakan plant in Maharashtra, which has the capacity to produce 110,000 units per annum.        
	First you have to conceptualise and then assess the market potential, Rippholz said.         
	The small car market in India is the second fastest growing market in the world after China. It accounts for about 75 per cent of the total car market.        
	On the models below the Polo that could be considered for India, he said, Theres the Fox in Brazil and the Ebisa thats sold in Spain. But India is a different market. First, we have to decide which car will it be.

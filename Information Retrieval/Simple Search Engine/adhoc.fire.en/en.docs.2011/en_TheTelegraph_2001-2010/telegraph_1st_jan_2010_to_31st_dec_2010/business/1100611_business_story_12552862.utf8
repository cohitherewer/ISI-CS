The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance nears shale gas deal in US
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Reliance nears shale gas deal in US
                            
	New Delhi, June 10 (PTI): Reliance Industries is close to buying up to a 40 per cent stake in the shale gas assets owned by Texas-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co.        
	Pioneer has about 3,10,000 acres in Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, US, and Reliance is in talks to buy up to 40 per cent interest in them, a source said today.        
	The Reliance spokesperson declined to comment.        
	The company had made its first breakthrough in the US in April when it had acquired a 40 per cent stake in Atlas Energy Incs 3,00,000 acres shale gas property for $1.7 billion. Atlas Marcellus shale gas project covers parts of West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York states.        
	Flush with revenues from its KG-D6 gas field, the Mukesh Ambani-run petrochemical firm has been on the lookout for acquisitions in the US. Pioneers Eagle Ford Shale operations has a gross resource potential of over 11 trillion cubic feet of gas.         
	Shale gas is natural gas stored in organic-rich sedimentary rocks.

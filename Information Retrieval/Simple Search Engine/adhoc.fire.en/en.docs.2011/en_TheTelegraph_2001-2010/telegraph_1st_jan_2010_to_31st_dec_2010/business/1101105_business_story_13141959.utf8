The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex closes at record high   Fed move, CIL trigger surge
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sensex closes at record high     Fed move, CIL trigger surge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 4: A stellar debut by Coal India Ltd (CIL) and the second quantitative easing (QE-2) by the US Federal Reserve sparked euphoria at Dalal Street a day before Diwali as the BSE sensex closed at an all-time closing high of 20893.57, a gain of nearly 428 points.        
	The benchmark index is just a gasp away from the markets record high of 21206.77  reached on January 8, 2008  with many expecting it to scale that peak in tomorrows one-hour muhurat trading session that will usher in Samvat 2067.        
	The special session tomorrow is woven in symbolism and celebration  as much as it is steeped in piety and pelf.        
	Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who have served as the biggest props for the market, usually stay away from muhurat trading, allowing local stockbrokers to turn it into a festive occasion.        
	Analysts said the sensex was riding on two turbochargers today: the spectacular listing of Coal India  the countrys largest IPO till date  and the $600-billion stimulus that the US Federal Reserve was providing through a bond repurchase programme. Many felt that some of the money would spill over into the emerging markets that were giving investors the best returns this year.        
	Our corporate results have been good and the superb listing of Coal India has also boosted the sentiment and then there was this $600 billion QE 2 by the US Fed that led to global markets rallying. Although there are worries that equities in India are expensive, there is still some steam left, said an analyst with a foreign brokerage who did not wish to be identified.        
	After opening at 20605.63, the sensex built on its gains and hit an intra-day peak of 20917.03. It later closed at 20893.57, a gain of 427.83 points, or 2.09 per cent, over the last close.         
	It surpassed the previous historic close of 20873.33 attained on January 8, 2008. On the other hand, the broad-based NSE Nifty closed at 6281.80 points, just six points shy of its record close at 6287.85 on January 8, 2008.        
	While heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, the State Bank of India and HDFC saw brisk buying interest in trading today, the BSE Oil amp; Gas index was the largest percentage gainer, rising 2.77 per cent on the back of huge gains in RIL. Shares of the oil giant, which have been muted vis--vis the sensex during the calendar year, rose 3.71 per cent, or Rs 39.50 to Rs 1,104.75. Metal counters were sizzling well on expectations that prices would vault after the second quantitative easing in the US.         
	The stimulus is expected to bring down the value of the dollar. Since metal prices are inversely related to the dollar, they will gain if the greenback depreciates. Among metal stocks, Hindalco rose 3.66 per cent, while Tata Steel gained nearly 2 per cent.        
	Banking stocks were in the limelight as well with the SBI climbing nearly 5 per cent to a new high of Rs 3,434.90.        
	Shares of auto companies, led by Tata Motors, notched up gains with the auto index rising over 168 points on the BSE.         
	Strong second quarter earnings by most auto companies and hopes of steady growth in sale, driven by the ongoing festive and marriage season, accelerated buying activity by funds. However, some pundits advised caution. The markets are looking fairly valued now and some amount of profit booking is expected, said one analyst. He reckoned that next week would decide the medium-term course of the market.        
	The sensex has gained nearly 5000 points, or over 31 per cent, since last Diwali.         
	Investor wealth, measured in terms of cumulative market valuation of all the listed stocks, has grown about Rs 19,00,000 crore from Rs 58,00,000 crore a year ago.         
	At the end of todays trade, the last day of Samvat 2066, the investors wealth stood at Rs 76,87,640.99 crore.        
	Analysts expect the going to be good on bourses in the months to come, as the economy is growing and foreign investors are flocking the Indian markets with expectations of robust gains. Besides, the performance of the US and European markets will determine the trend at Dalal Street.

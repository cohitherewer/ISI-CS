The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telecom stocks defy worry
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Telecom stocks defy worry
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 20: Telecom stocks rose sharply a day after the results of the 3G auction were announced but the euphoria over the new licences was tempered by concerns that the operators might end up paying a heavy price for the scarce spectrum, which could crimp their balance sheets this year.        
	On Thursday, the prices of some telecom stocks rose as much as 6 per cent.        
	Bharti Airtel has already gone public with its reservations that bid prices have risen beyond reasonable levels. The frenzied rush for 3G spectrum has netted the government Rs 67,719 crore.         
	The Bharti Airtel scrip closed marginally higher at Rs 260.15, a rise of 0. 23 per cent per cent on the BSE today.        
	The share price of Idea Cellular closed higher by nearly a per cent at Rs 53.25.         
	The share price of state-run MTNL, which is expected to match the bid price of Rs 6,564 crore for the Delhi and Mumbai circles, rose half a percentage point to Rs 56.45.        
	Reliance Communications was in the green earlier in the day but then fell 0.73 per cent to close at Rs 135.80.        
	Stocks of telecom companies have not fared well this year. The recent share price slump ranging between 15 and 24 per cent has been triggered by worries about the huge cash outgo that looms on these companies because of the one-time spectrum charge payout on 2G and the 3G bid prices.        
	Brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher said the price correction was too steep but it was concerned about the fact that the telecom firms that won the 3G bids would have to pay the entire sum for 3G spectrum in the next 10 days.        
	The network rollout for 3G will take another three to six months. Hence, financial year 2011 will not see much revenues accruing from 3G but the interest burden on spectrum charges paid would weigh on earnings, it said in a report on the 3G auctions.                          
	Global brokerage house Macquaries research team said 3G licence payouts would stretch balance sheets across the board.         
	Calculations done by Macquarie show that the gross debt on Bhartis books after the Zain acquisition is likely to amount to Rs 55,800 crore. It has estimated the gross debt of Reliance Communications at Rs 32,200 crore and Idea Cellulars at Rs 15,200 crore.        
	The brokerage house said Bharti Airtel sprang the biggest negative surprise in the 3G auctions as it failed to bag licences in several key circles where it earned reasonable revenues from its 3G service. The other companies that had thrown up similar surprises were Vodafone and Idea.        
	It painted a bleak outlook for the sector as a whole. India is unlikely to see meaningful uplift to data revenues in the next two years as the existing base of high-end subscribers will move to 3G from GPRS networks. This implies that 3G will have a cannibalising effect on existing 2G-led data revenues. Besides, only 5 per cent of Indias SIM holders have 3G-capable handsets, it said.

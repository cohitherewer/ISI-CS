	New Delhi, May 11: Ranbaxy Laboratories today posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 960.58 crore for the three months ended March 31  the highest ever for any quarter.        
	The pharmaceutical major had suffered a loss of Rs 767.33 crore during the corresponding period a year ago.        
	Exclusive marketing rights for one of its drugs in the US and forex gains of approximately Rs 452.7 crore boosted its performance.         
	Total income soared 65 per cent to Rs 2,490 crore from Rs 1,558 crore a year ago.        
	Atul Sobti, CEO and managing director of Ranbaxy, said, Solid growth in key geographies, along with an optimal delivery value from first-to-file opportunities in the US, ensured that we achieve yet another quarter of strong operational performance. We also launched Project Viraat, a comprehensive programme aimed at India leadership, in January.        
	In the US, Valacyclovir  a first-to-file product launched in the last quarter of 2009  garnered a market share of 60 per cent.         
	The drug is Ranbaxys copy of GlaxoSmithKline Plcs (GSK) Valtrex used in the treatment of herpes.         
	The drug maker, which is 64 per cent owned by Tokyo-based Daiichi Sankyo, settled a patent dispute with GSK that allowed the Indian company to sell a generic version of Valtrex in the US in November last year.         
	The US Food and Drug Administration grants 180 days of exclusive marketing rights to the first drug maker to successfully challenge a patent. This period is the most lucrative for the company because prices fall sharply when rival versions go on sale.         
	Ranbaxy has reported an over two-fold jump in sales at Rs 1,210 crore during the quarter ended March in North America as a result of market exclusivity.        
	During the same period, the Indian business of the company recorded sales of Rs 345.2 crore, a growth of 6 per cent.        
	Ranbaxy continued to be the second largest company with a 4.9 per cent market share in the Indian pharmaceutical market, the company said.        
	In Europe, sales grew 10 per cent to $67 million, driven by strong recovery in Romania.         
	However, sales in Asia Pacific declined 38 per cent to $14 million because of divestment of certain businesses in Vietnam and China.        
	Total sales in Latin America jumped 40 per cent to $19 million.

	Calcutta, Dec. 9: The Reserve Bank of India will come out with the draft guidelines for banking licences by January-end.         
	Well put out within a week or 10 days the feedback on the discussion paper on new banking licences brought out earlier. The draft guidelines will be put up on our website by January-end, Subbarao said after the Reserve Banks governing body meeting here today.        
	Among the issues put forward for discussion were the initial capital requirement, the period over which promoters holding will have to be diluted and whether corporations will be allowed to set up banks. The RBI also sought suggestions on whether non-banking finance companies can do banking and the business model.        
	Not surprisingly, we had got a wide spectrum of opinions with no clear-cut convergence on those issues, he said.        
	The governing body meeting also discussed the progress of the Malegam committee, which is looking into the regulation of microfinance institutions.         
	Though the Malegam committee has been given time till the end of January, it may submit its report sooner, Subbarao said, adding that the apex bank will meet the heads of commercial banks to discuss their standpoints vis--vis MFIs within a few weeks. Well look into whether anything needs to be done to increase bank funding to MFIs. Subbarao said an RBI team would visit Andhra Pradesh next week and meet chief minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy and stakeholders to assess the problems associated with MFIs.         
	The team will go to other parts of the country, too. However, situations in other states are not similar to that of Andhra Pradesh, he said.        
	On inflation, he said the wholesale price index-based inflation under the new series (with 2004-05 as base year) was pegged at 5.5 per cent for the short term ending March.         
	Inflation in October was 8.6 per cent, much higher than the RBIs tolerance level. But there is still three months time for progression, he said. We will revisit the figures in January.         
	However, RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn said high oil prices were a cause for concern against the backdrop of a sluggish world economy.        
	High oil and commodity prices are the biggest source of concern from the global perspective. It would pose a challenge and make management of inflation more difficult.         
	According to Gokarn, the Eurozone crisis is also a source of persistent worry.        
	On the bribes-for-loans scam, the RBI governor said, We have studied the accounts after getting information from the banks concerned and 13 out of 14 accounts were standard loans. The other account in default has reasons unconnected with the scam.         
	He said all established norms were followed and there was no deviation while sanctioning those loans.        
	He, however, added that the RBIs department of banking was assessing further information received from banks.

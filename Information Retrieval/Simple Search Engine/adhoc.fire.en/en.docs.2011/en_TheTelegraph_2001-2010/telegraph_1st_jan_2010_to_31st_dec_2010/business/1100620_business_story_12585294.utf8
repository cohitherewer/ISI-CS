	Calcutta, June 19: Toyota Kirloskar Motors will roll out Etios, a compact car specially made for Indians, in 2011.         
	The Toyota compact, which will be produced at the companys second plant at Bidadi near Bangalore from December this year, will hit the markets early next year, managing director Hiroshi Nakagawa said here today.        
	India is a very important market for us and we will focus on increasing presence to boost sales here, Nakagawa said. The companys dealer network will increase from 99 now to 150 by the end of 2010.        
	The second plant at Bidadi, which will incur an investment of Rs 3,200 crore in phases, will have a production capacity of 70,000 units a year. The company said it would extend this capacity to 2,00,000 units a year in the second phase.        
	Etios will get the engines from Toyotas Japan plant as the engine numbers were too small to produce them in India.         
	Etios will be powered by both 1.2L and 1.5L engines. Toyota has been in Indian market quite a while and has been tasting success in the MPV segment with its Innova leading in the local market.

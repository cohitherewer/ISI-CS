                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Dredger cross-current at port
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Uncertainty looms                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 2: Dredging Corporation of India Limited (DCI) has threatened to withdraw all equipment from the Haldia port which could lead to its closure even as junior shipping minister Mukul Roy promised no disruptions.        
	In a letter written on January 30, DCI had asked the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), which manages both the Calcutta and Haldia ports, to pay up Rs 375 crore by February 10.         
	Failing this, it will withdraw all the six dredgers  Haldias lifeline to maintain river navigability.        
	Mukul Roy, minister of state for shipping and a Trinamul Congress leader, said the matter had been resolved.        
	There is no worry. Nothing will happen to the Haldia port. It is between two organisations under the same ministry after all, he said.        
	The CPT is yet to receive the budgetary allocation of Rs 478 crore from the Centre for dredging this year.        
	A section of the shipping ministry has refused to release the funds and has instead, questioned as to why a river port should be allowed to function when all the major ones are along the sea.        
	However, Roy said the money had been released two days back but refused to put a number. The CPT will be able to pay up, he assured.        
	Acting CPT chairman Anindya Mazumdar could not be reached for comment.        
	The CPT requires the dredger to protect the Auckland and Jellingham channels that lead ships to Haldia from siltation.        
	Sources claimed that Rs 550 crore from fiscal 2007-08 was still due, apart from the money in 2009-10.         
	The Centre had promised Bengal that it would pick up the dredging bill in the wake of the Ganga water sharing pact with Bangladesh in 1996.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: Jute mills engaged in modernisation will get a higher subsidy of up to Rs 3.5 crore against the previous limit of Rs 75 lakh, the cabinet decided today.        
	This is expected to provide the much needed incentive for the jute industry to invest in modernisation on a significant scale, the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) said in a statement. For new and existing mills in the Northeast, the cap has been enhanced to Rs 4 crore.        
	Under the previous scheme of the Jute Technology Mission, the ceiling on subsidy was Rs 1 crore for mills in the Northeast and Rs 75 lakh in the rest of the country.         
	The total outlay for the scheme is Rs 80 crore. Poor offtake under the previous scheme has prompted the CCEA to raise the ceiling.        
	Based on a techno-financial viability study, it was worked out that the subsidy cap of Rs 3.5 crore would mean 100 per cent viability gap funding for mills having capacity of 70 tonnes per day or lower, the textile ministry said.        
	Mills with larger capacity will be able to carry out partial modernisation; alternatively, they can get benefits under the technology upgradation fund scheme, which has no subsidy caps.        
	Proposal from Bengal mill owners        
	As the jute strike in Bengal reached its 46th day, representatives of the mills in a meeting with the unions today proposed paying the revised wages and arrears in instalments.         
	However, the unions have not agreed to the proposal but consider it as a favourable sign as this is the first time the management has put forward a package.        
	The unions, management and the state representatives will meet again on Friday at Writers Buildings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bangla bid to hasten free trade pact
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bangla bid to hasten free trade pact
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Khan: Listing priorities                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: Bangladesh commerce minister Farouk Khan will visit India later this week to speed up the first free trade agreement that Bangladesh may sign with any nation, ahead of a proposed trip by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Dhaka next year.         
	Khan, who will be leading a large delegation of Bangla business leaders, will try to strike deals to increase Indias duty free import quota of 8 million Bangladeshi garment pieces and to wrangle duty concessions on 61 more products, most of them in the garment sector, from his Indian counterpart.         
	The commerce minister, known to be one of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajeds trusted lieutenants, will also try to get Indian leaders to push ahead their schedule on more tricky issues such as sharing of the Teesta waters and swapping of border enclaves.         
	India has cut down the list of products that cannot be exported to India from 700 to 480. However, Bangladeshi traders have been complaining that the cuts did not help much as garments and footwear, where Bangladesh could easily gain a market in India, were still on the banned list.        
	Bangladesh diplomats say the eastern nation has already exported 70 per cent of its allowed quota of 8 million garment pieces in five months and the quota needs to be enlarged, besides withdrawing duty on 61 product lines.         
	Officials said India was likely to concede to these demands to reduce the huge trade gap between the two neighbours.        
	Bangladeshs exports to India during 2007-08 stood at a mere $358.08 million or about a tenth of Indias exports worth $3.37 billion.        
	Top diplomatic sources said, The Bangladeshi side wants the Indian Prime Minister to visit Dhaka next year. But for this to happen he needs to have some big deals settled and Khans visit is part of the work building up to that visit.         
	The last time an Indian Prime Minister visited Bangladesh was in the 1980s.         
	India has already conceded transit to Nepal and Bhutan to Bangladesh, offered a $1-billion soft loan for infrastructure and power projects and agreed to build a 1,320mw coal-fired power plant to help its neighbour meet a crushing electricity deficit.         
	A deal on border haats (markets) that will encourage trade between Indias northeastern states and Bangladesh will also be finalised during Khans visit.        
	However, the jewel in the crown for Bangladesh is a free trade agreement, which Khan wants to push through by 2011, preferably around the time of the visit of the Indian Prime Minister.

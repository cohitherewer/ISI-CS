          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 7: Representatives from the financial services industry today urged the Reserve Bank of India to set a minimum capital criteria of Rs 1,000 crore for new banks that are expected to get licences later this year to start operations.        
	They also wanted the banking regulator to relax an onerous condition by granting the promoters of new banks a 10-year time frame to bring down their stake to 10 per cent. At present, there is no time frame for complying with the cap on promoters stake, and the RBI sets the deadline at its discretion.        
	Representative from several industry forums met the central bank officials today to discuss the requirements for granting banking licences to business houses and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs).         
	In August, the RBI had floated a discussion paper on the granting of licences. Industry was putting forward its suggestions in response to that paper.        
	At the meeting with RBI deputy governor Usha Thorat, the Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC)  a body representing non-bank finance companies  suggested that the central bank should give promoters a decade to bring down their stake to 10 per cent.         
	The present RBI guidelines stipulate that a promoter has to initially bring in a minimum 40 per cent of capital that will be locked in for five years. Over time, this stake has to be brought down to 10 per cent. Mahesh Thakkar, director-general of the FIDC, said the RBI should allow banks to bring down their stake in a phased manner over 10 years.        
	In its discussion paper, the RBI had proposed that the minimum capital requirement for a new bank should be Rs 300 crore and that it could go up to Rs 1,000 crore. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), however, suggested that the minimum capital for new banks should be set at Rs 1,000 crore.        
	The CII agrees with the views in the paper that lower capital could result in relatively small banks, which could potentially lead to higher risk taking and more volatile earnings. This, in turn, could result in lack of focus on financial inclusion and defeat the very purpose of this round of licensing. The CII made the point that even the smallest new private sector bank and several NBFCs have more than Rs 1,000 crore capital today, the industry association said.

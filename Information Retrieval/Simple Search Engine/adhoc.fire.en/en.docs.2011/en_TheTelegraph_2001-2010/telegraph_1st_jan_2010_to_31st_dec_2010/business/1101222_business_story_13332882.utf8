   Strategy ready to recast debt          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 21: Steel baron Sajjan Jindal has snapped up a controlling stake in Ispat Industries, the ailing, debt-ridden steel maker.        
	Jindals JSW Steel will acquire a 41.29 per cent stake in Ispat Industries in a deal valued at Rs 2,157 crore.         
	JSW Steel will pick up over 108.66 crore Ispat shares under a preferential allotment at a price of Rs 19.85 per share. The company will be renamed as JSW Ispat Steel Ltd.        
	Jindals stake could rise further if Ispat shareholders bite the bait of an open offer that is likely to be made tomorrow.        
	The Mittals will hold 26 per cent in the company they founded in 1984.        
	Jindal will be the non-executive chairman of Ispat Industries. Vinod Mittal, present executive vice-chairman of Ispat Industries, will continue in the same position during the transition period. He will subsequently become a non-executive vice-chairman.        
	Proceeds from the preferential allotment will be largely used to reduce the Rs 9,500 crore worth of liabilities on Ispats books.         
	Under the debt restructuring plan, close to Rs 7,500 crore of debt will be refinanced by low-cost borrowings  a move that will bring down the interest cost by 3 to 4 percentage points. The debt recast will be completed within nine months.         
	JSW Steel chairman Sajjan Jindal said the partnership was a win-win for both groups and would bring a lot of synergy benefits to the two companies.        
	The deal will make JSW Steel the countrys largest steel producer with a combined capacity of 14.3 million tonnes by March next year.        
	Ispat Industries has a capacity of 3.3 million tonnes.         
	Jindal said that until now, Ispat had supplied its steel to south India, thereby inflating its freight costs. Under the new deal, Ispat will now supply only in Maharashtra. This will bring down its freight cost to Rs 325 per tonne from Rs 1,400 per tonne at present.        
	Ispat has also been buying power at a high price of Rs 5.5 to Rs 6 per unit. JSW Energy, the Jindal group company, will supply power from its Ratnagiri plant, enabling Ispat to trim costs on this front as well.        
	Jindal was confident that he would be able to make Ispat Industries profitable over the next 12 months.        
	We have mining expertise and will bring Ispats mining facility quickly into operational mode, he added. Ispat Industries has mining activities in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.        
	JSW Steel will fund the buyout from its internal accruals.        
	Jindal said he planned to bring down Ispats cost of production by setting up a coke oven plant, pellet plant and power plant over a period of 36 to 48 months. Various operational efficiency projects and a debottlenecking exercise would raise its capacity to 4.2 million tonnes from 3.3 million tonnes.        
	Jindal, who was accompanied by Vinod Mittal, said lenders such as IDBI Bank, ICICI Bank and IFCI would convert some more of their debt into equity. The shares will be issued to these banks at a discounted price of Rs 14.75.        
	The debt conversion will bring down JSW Steels stake to 39.9 per cent and the Mittals holding to 24.5 per cent.        
	There were mixed reactions to the deal on the stock exchanges with the Ispat scrip falling over 15 per cent to Rs 21.20, driven down by disappointment over the open offer price. On the other hand, the JSW Steel scrip rose 2.23 per cent to Rs 1,211.95.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          P. Bhattacharya in Calcutta on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, May 10: Speciality steel and wire rope manufacturer Usha Martin will invest Rs 1,200 crore in a wide range of facilities to reduce its cost of production.        
	The company board today approved the capital expenditure plan, which will be completed over the next three years.         
	The new plan comes close on the heels of a Rs 2,100-crore expansion project that Usha Martin hopes to complete in the next few months, taking its speciality steel capacity to 600,000 tonnes in Jamshedpur.        
	For a steelman, there is no full stop, P. Bhattacharya, joint managing director of the company, said today. The company is braving an uncertain business environment to take up the projects.         
	The company will spend Rs 1,050 crore to consolidate the steel business and another Rs 150 crore to expand the wire and rope unit capacity.        
	The company will build a coke oven unit and a sponge iron facility along with a pellet and an ore beneficiation plant. It will also set up two power plants using waste heat.         
	The projects will increase the competitiveness of our business, Prashant Jhawar, who was nominated the chairman today, said. Prashant replaces his father Basant Kumar Jhawar who will now become the chairman emeritus. The company is fully integrated on the raw material side having captive iron ore and coal mines. New investments are aimed at making the most of the mines.         
	Bhattacharya said the company intended to expand its speciality steel capacity to 800,000 tonnes by putting up extra facilities by the end of the next fiscal. We are planning to ramp up to 1 million tonnes thereafter, he added.        
	Profit rises        
	Consolidated net sales grew 8.8 per cent to Rs 644.46 crore, while profit after tax rose 140 per cent to Rs 69.2 crore in the fourth quarter.         
	For the full year, sales were down 14.8 per cent to Rs 2,514 crore, while profit was down 9 per cent to Rs 168.62 crore.

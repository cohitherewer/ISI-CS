          PIYA SINGH                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 17: Vallabh Bhanshali, one of the last of the original deal makers of Dalal Street, has decided to cash out.         
	The decision of the Enam group to merge its broking and investment banking business with Axis Bank for a price tag of Rs 2,100 crore highlights the changing face of I-banking in India.         
	Bhanshalis and the more low-profile Nemish Shahs exit follows a similar deal that was struck five years ago when veteran investment banker Hemendra Kothari sold his controlling stake in DSP Merrill Lynch for Rs 2,250 crore to the foreign partner.        
	The other dons of Dalal Street  Uday Kotak and Nimesh Kampani  also parted ways with global investors Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, respectively. Both Kotak and Kampani  who chose different routes to go solo  preferred to remain independent rather than lean on the global banks that were chafing to expand their business in the sub-continent.         
	The India is hot story has encouraged foreign banks  Barclays, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs  to expand operations in India. Many more are queuing up to grab a slice of business.         
	Indian shops are very much in business, but Bhanshali and Shahs decision to cash out clearly points that the next generation of bankers is gaining ground quickly.         
	This is the start of a new era. The first generation of bankers have played their cardsnow, it is the turn of the newer generation, whether its an Edelweiss, India Infoline or an Ambit, said Ashok Wadhwa who promoted Ambit Holdings.        
	The investment banking community is stumped by the Enam-Axis Bank deal.         
	Banking circles were aware that Enam Securities, which has struck some memorable deals in the past and also saved the Infosys BPOs maiden flotation from devolving, was looking around for a partner.        
	Wednesdays announcement, however, caught them by surprise. The Axis Bank offer may have just come at the right time as Enam looked for avenues to scale up at a time when global banks with deep pockets are vying with pure play shops for business.         
	Enam has got an amazing price. Its very difficult to make money in dealmaking these days. Revenues are under pressure and, with the global banks and youngsters shooting from the hip, it becomes difficult after a point, said a Mumbai-based veteran investment banker who declined to be named.         
	The might of global banks and innovations of homegrown firms make for competitive times, but Bhanshali and Shahs exit should not be interpreted as a sign that Indian outfits cannot make the cut if they go solo.         
	Carlyle India managing director Rajeev Gupta, who is credited with assisting Kothari in the sale to Merrill Lynch, said, If the model of independent investment banks is valid anywhere in the world, it is in India. Domestic outfits enjoy the value of integrating their businesses.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Smooth sailing                          
	New Delhi, March 29: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) and Shipping Corporation of India Ltd (SCI) have formed a 50:50 joint venture to take care of the steel makers logistic needs.        
	Under an agreement signed today, the new entity will own and operate ships for SAIL.         
	Registered in Calcutta, the joint venture will initially handle around one million tonnes of annual imports.         
	SAIL chairman S. K. Roongta said the company wanted to ensure a steady supply of raw materials in the long term.         
	The steel PSU will continue to focus on logistics and creation of infrastructure for the smooth movement of raw materials and finished products.        
	SAIL imports around 10 million tonnes of coking coal per annum, a major input for steel making.         
	The requirement will increase considerably to cater to SAILs current expansion plan that will nearly double its capacity from around 14 million tonnes now.         
	The shipping JV will give SAIL control over part of its coking coal supply chain and help it to curtail risks in the volatile shipping market.         
	SCI, which will give its expertise in shipping to the JV, is already acquiring new vessels.        
	S. Hajara, chairman and managing director of SCI, said the shipping firm expected to double its current fleet of 79 vessels in five to seven years at an investment of $3.5 billion.         
	SAIL and SCI had announced their plans for the venture in 2008 and had signed a memorandum of understanding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deadline set for DPSC deal 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Deadline set for DPSC deal 
          SAMBIT SAHA AMP; TAPAS GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 19: Calcutta High Court today set a time frame to complete the process of share sale in power generator DPSC Ltd.        
	The court directed the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), the General Insurance Corporation (GIC) and public sector unit Andrew Yule to sell their shares by January 28 to a consortium led by Srei.         
	Srei and its partner Indian Power Company have been told to complete the formalities (pay for the shares) the day after.        
	Though the certified copy of the order was not available, officials of Srei, Yule, DPSC and several lawyers associated with the case confirmed the development.        
	The development follows a petition filed by the Srei consortium seeking court direction to complete the DPSC share sale, which has been hanging fire for the last two months.         
	On November 20, Srei had emerged as the highest bidder for a 57.17-per-cent stake in DPSC, which owns a 40-mega-watt power plant and holds the rights to distribute electricity over a 640sqkm area in Burdwan.        
	Srei had quoted Rs 710 per share in an auction conducted by a court appointed officer, outbidding Descon, which had offered Rs 705.         
	Descon is the largest shareholder in DPSC with a 32 per cent stake. However, its shares are pledged to JSW Energy, which had also participated in the DPSC sale process.        
	S. Radhakrishnan is the managing director of both DPSC and Descon.        
	Soon after Srei became the highest bidder, doubts were raised over the LIC and the GIC parting with their holdings in DPSC that stood at 42 per cent. The insurer duo had the option of not selling the shares if they were not satisfied with the bid price.        
	In the last two months, neither did Yule received approvals from its parent ministry to sell its shares nor the insurer duo okayed the Srei transaction.        
	The immediate provocation for Srei to move court was DPSCs sale of its stake in Tide Water in the last quarter.        
	Srei alleged that DPSC sold the shares after the auction took place on November 20, but DPSC denied the allegation.        
	In the petition, Srei had also asked for the removal of DPSC managing director S. Radhakrishnan, appointment of a special officer and a speedy conclusion of the sale.        
	While the high court today paved the way for the completion of the sale, there was a possibility that the LIC, the GIC and Andrew Yule could seek more time.        
	Yule plans to use the money to clean up its balance sheet.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Private equity for new CESC projects
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Goenka: Cash chase                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 3: CESC Ltd plans to raise Rs 1,000 crore from private equity firms to finance three upcoming projects in Bengal, Maharashtra and Orissa.        
	The company, owned and managed by Sanjiv Goenka, will develop 2,500 mega watt of generation capacity, including 600 mega watt at Haldia, with the money.        
	The projects, entailing an investment of Rs 12,500 crore, is being executed by Haldia Energy Ltd, a special purpose vehicle and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CESC.        
	A number of private equity firms, both domestic and international, are vying for the stake. Its great to be wanted so much, Goenka said, adding that a final decision would be taken by the middle of February.        
	CESC hopes to earn a premium on the share sale because of its high degree of preparedness. Two 600MW projects in Haldia and Chandrapura (Maharashtra) are ready to start construction in two months, while the 1300MW project in Orissa needs only coal linkage to achieve financial closure.        
	The total equity requirement in these three projects is about Rs 3,000 crore. Dont think we are selling 30 per cent to raise Rs 1,000 crore. It will be lot less, even lower than 26 per cent, he said.        
	A private equity investment generally entails a public issue to give investors an exit route after 3-5 years. For Haldia Energy, another option would be a merger with parent CESC, a listed entity.         
	Goenka said 400MW from Haldia would go to meet growing demand from Calcutta.         
	Net up 23%        
	CESC posted a 23 per cent rise in net profit for the second quarter ended September at Rs 155 crore compared with Rs 126 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.        
	Net sales during the quarter were at Rs 1,090 crore compared with Rs 949 crore registered during the corresponding period of 2009-10.        
	The strong show can be attributed to a 15 per cent rise in power generation from the third unit at Budge Budge.

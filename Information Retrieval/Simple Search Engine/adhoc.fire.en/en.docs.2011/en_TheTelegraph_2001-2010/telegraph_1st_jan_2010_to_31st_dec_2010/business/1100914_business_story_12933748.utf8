The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New price index today
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      New price index today
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: The government will introduce a new wholesale price index (WPI) tomorrow. The new series has dropped 200 commodities from the list of 436 items that now make up the index. Over 400 items, including laptops, mobiles, microwaves, are the new entrants.         
	The weight assigned to primary articles, including food items, will come down to 20.12 per cent from 22.02 per cent, while that of manufactures is up to 64.97 per cent from 63.75 per cent and fuel to 14.91 per cent from 14.23 per cent.        
	Top commerce ministry officials said products such as pan masala, beer, alcohol, asbestos, feldspar, baby food, hessian sacks and some kinds of chemicals have been dropped.         
	Besides modern gadgets, articles that are more relevant to todays consumers such as shampoos, various kinds of leather and artificial footwear, sandals, wooden cupboards and cabinets, plywood and veneer are now on the list.        
	The current WPI series with a base year of 1993-94 reflects the structure of the economy nearly 15 years ago, officials pointed out.        
	To ensure that the index is a true reflection of the economy, a working group was formed in December 2003 under Planning Commission member Abhijit Sen to revise the series. The new WPI has been drawn according to the working groups recommendations. Officials said 2004-05 had been taken as the base year for the revised index.        
	Analysts said the new series would be unpredictable. One would expect inflation to be lower in the new series with articles such as microwaves and laptops whose prices keep coming down. But there are other goods in the new series whose values keep going up. So, in the short run this could be more volatile.        
	Officials said data under both the old and the new series would be available to analysts and researchers.        
	The government is not trying to show lower inflation numbers with a new WPI series, if thats what you are hinting at, the officials said.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 7: LG Electronics India has firmed up plans for the festive season and aims to achieve over 35 per cent of its annual sales during the season.        
	The company sees its annual sales revenue from the domestic market increase to Rs 17,000 crore in 2010 from Rs 13,089 crore last year.         
	We have also firmed up plans to spend Rs 140 crore on promotions during the festive season this year. This is slightly higher than what we had spent last year, Amitabh Tiwari, head (sales) of LG Electronics India, said here today.        
	Last year, the companys sales rose over 25 per cent during the season.         
	We are planning to introduce new products in the home appliances segment before the festive season, he said. The company sees better sales from LCD television sets, frost-free refrigerators and home appliances this year.        
	Meanwhile, the company is planning to start sponsoring football in India.        
	The Korean consumer electronics giant, which sponsors Fulham Club of England, will take a final call on the football sponsorship pattern in India within a month, Tiwari said.        
	India has never qualified to play in the soccer World Cup. LG is seriously making efforts to set up a professional body of experts, followed by a training academy, Tiwari said.

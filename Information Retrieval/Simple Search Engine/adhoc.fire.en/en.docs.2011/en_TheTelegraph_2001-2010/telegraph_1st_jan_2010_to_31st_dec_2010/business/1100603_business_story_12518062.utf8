          JAYATI GHOSE                          Added Attraction                                  
	New Delhi, June 2: Mobile operators are tying up with value-added service providers and handset makers to come up with innovative 3G products for high-end customers.        
	Analysts said high-end subscribers, who already use high-speed data services and make up 8-15 per cent of an operators subscriber base, contribute 25-30 per cent to a telecom firms revenues.         
	Consulting firm Analysys Mason estimates that companies will be able to generate an additional 50 per cent revenue per user by offering 3G and other multimedia-based value-added services.        
	The high-speed 3G services, to be launched by year-end, will offer full song downloads, video-on-demand, mobile TV and online games.        
	Data services in India are likely to be driven primarily by entertainment services. So, film, sports and gaming content are likely to drive revenues, be it full song tracks, streaming music, videos, live sports content, game download, and online gaming, said Kedar Sohoni, president of Informate Mobile Intelligence, a mobile analytics company.         
	State-owned BSNL and MTNL, the only players offering 3G services now, have increased their 3G user base to 19 lakh subscribers in the past one year. One of the most used applications on the 3G network is music video downloads, followed by video calls.        
	Analysts expect data users to contribute over 40 per cent to a companys revenues after the introduction of services such as voice-based learning, mobile wallet, e-commerce and health monitoring.         
	Content needs to be innovative and applicable for the common man, covering banking, healthcare and education to generate good revenues, said Hemant Joshi, telecom head with Deloitte India.        
	Analysts said the high-speed services should also be competitively priced to attract customers.         
	Pricing depends on the whole ecosystem. In some markets where 3G services are already present, operators have adopted a penetration pricing strategy, which has helped to grow the use of 3G, said Sangeet Chowfla, chief strategy officer of Comviva, a global VAS player.         
	According to KPMGs Romal Shetty, 3G prices cannot be very high as users may reject it then. So, to begin with, operators will have to go with a price point that is similar to 2G.         
	Affordable 3G-enabled handsets will help to encourage the use of these services. Firms such as Micromax, Karbonn, Zen and Wynncom are gearing up to launch handsets at less than Rs 4,000.

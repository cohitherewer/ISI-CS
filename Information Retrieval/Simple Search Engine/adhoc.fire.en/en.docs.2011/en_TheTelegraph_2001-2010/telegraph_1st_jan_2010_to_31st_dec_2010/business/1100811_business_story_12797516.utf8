The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Anxiety over US visa fee hike
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Anxiety over US visa fee hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cause for concern                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: The US House of Representatives today approved a key border security bill that would steeply hike H-1B and L-1 visa fees to fund the security measures, amid concerns by Indian companies who are one of the main beneficiaries of the travel permit.        
	The development is likely to double the cost of a work visa and impact Indian firms bodyshopping software professionals to America. After it becomes a law, the bill could run for five years.        
	Indian infotech firms fly thousands of employees each year to the US to work as on-site specialists at their clients locations. Though this has evoked the ire of US unions, clients like it as this reduces costs and brings troubleshooting to their doorstep.        
	In a letter to US trade representative Ron Kirk, commerce minister Anand Sharma has expressed serious concern, saying the bill will hurt Indian companies, which account for a little less than 12 per cent of visas issued by the US to India.        
	According to the bill, companies with less than 50 per cent of American workforce have to pay an additional $2000 on H1B and L1 visas, earmarked for skilled foreign workers. The current visa fee is $2,500.        
	S. Gopalakrishnan, CEO of Indias second-largest outsourcer Infosys Technologies, said he was saddened and disheartened by the step and the sector would lobby against it.        
	He said the additional cost implications of the hike in visa fees would be passed on to customers.        
	It is estimated that the bill will have an additional cost implication of over $200 million annually and an adverse impact on the competitiveness and commercial interests of Indian companies sending professionals to undertake projects locally for American customers in the US, Sharma said. Indian companies are believed to be paying over $1 billion in social security contributions for their employees posted in the US.         
	US firms use more H1-B and L-1 visas but they wont have to pay the increased fees. However, Indian companies will be affected as they are more likely to cross the threshold of 50 per cent of non-American employees holding H1-B or L-1 visas, which triggers the higher fee payout, Sharma said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Change of guard at Tata Steel Europe
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Change of guard at Tata Steel Europe
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Khler: New role                                  
	Mumbai, June 27: Karl-Ulrich Khler will become the managing director and CEO of Tata Steel Europe from October. He will take over from Kirby Adams who has decided to step down.         
	Khler, 54, was appointed the chief operating officer in February and has been working with Adams to implement a new strategy and business model. Before joining Tata Steel, Khler, who has 30 years of experience in the steel industry, was with ThyssenKrupp Steel. Till October, he was the president of Eurofer, the European steelmaking federation.         
	I am delighted to accept the position of the CEO and to have the opportunity to carry through the strategy initiated by Kirby and our team, Khler said.        
	Tata Steel Europe (the erstwhile Corus) reported positive earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of Rs 2,303 crore in the second half of 2009-10 compared with an EBITDA loss of Rs 3,655 crore in the first half. The management was cautious about the current fiscals outlook.         
	We expect steel consumption in Europe to recover 15 per cent to 140 million tonnes in 2010. While the first half of the year is encouraging, the second half is suspect, Adams had said.        
	In October last year, Tata Steel had restructured its management by creating the post of managing director for its European operations, with Adams taking over. Adams had come to the Tatas from Bluescope Steel of Australia.        
	Adams said, I am very pleased that Karl is now taking on this role and I wish him every success. I have spent the past 15 months undertaking a major review of the operations during a time of unprecedented difficulty in the European steel industry.        
	Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Steel, said, In his time as CEO of Tata Steel Europe, Kirby has effected a major turnaround and he leaves the firm well placed for the future.

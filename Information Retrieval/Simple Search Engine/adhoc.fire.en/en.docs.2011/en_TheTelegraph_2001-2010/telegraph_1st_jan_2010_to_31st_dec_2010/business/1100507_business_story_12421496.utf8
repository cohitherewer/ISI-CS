	 New Delhi, May 6: Food inflation eased for the second consecutive week to 16.04 per cent. However, fuel inflation remained unchanged at 12.69 per cent, as the effect of hike in duties on petrol and diesel translated into higher auto fuel prices. The 0.57 percentage point fall in food inflation during the week ended April 24, from 16.61 per cent a week earlier, was mainly on account of easing pressure on prices with the arrival of rabi crops in the markets.

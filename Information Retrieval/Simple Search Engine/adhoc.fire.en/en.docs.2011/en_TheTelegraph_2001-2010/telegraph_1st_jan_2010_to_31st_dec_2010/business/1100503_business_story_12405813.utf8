          AGENCIES                          Warren Buffett in Omaha on Saturday. (AP)                                  
	New York, May 2: Legendary investor Warren Buffett, who has till now made only a few investments outside the US, plans to visit India next March and is likely to explore possible investment opportunities.        
	One of the richest persons in the world, Buffett is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, which has holdings in diverse firms such as Coca-Cola and Swiss Re.        
	Buffet disclosed his plans to visit India next year at the annual general meeting of Berkshire Hathaway in Omaha. According to the Wall Street Journal, responding to a query on whether he would consider investing in India, Buffett said he was eyeing the country and is going to make a trip to India in March next.        
	Attributing to Buffett, the publication said one problem was that laws limited how much Berkshire could invest in Indian firms. Still, he sees potential, noting that India has made big improvements in the last 10 years, the daily said.        
	In Asia, Berkshires investments include those in South Korean steel maker Posco and in Chinese entity BYD. Switzerland and Israel are among the other countries where Berkshire has investments.        
	Buffett was quoted as saying that his company had looked at Indian insurance business. Berkshires main businesses are in insurance and reinsurance.         
	The conglomerates reinsurance business is run by India-origin Ajit Jain, long rumoured to become the successor of the billionaire investor at Berkshire. In his annual letter to shareholders this year, Buffett described Jain as a superstar and said Jain was known worldwide as the man to call when something both very large and unusual needed to be insured.         
	A hugely important event in Berkshires history occurred on a Saturday in 1985. Ajit Jain came into our office in Omaha  and I immediately knew we had found a superstar, he wrote in his annual letter to his shareholders.         
	If Charlie (Charles Munger, Buffetts business partner), I and Ajit are ever in a sinking boat  and you can only save one of us swim to Ajit (Jain), he had said.        
	In last years annual letter, too, Buffett had showered praise on Jain while asserting that there was no one like him.         
	Defending Goldman        
	Buffett has launched a strong defense of Berkshire Hathaway Incs $5-billion investment in Goldman Sachs and the investment banks embattled CEO, Lloyd Blankfein.        
	This makes Buffett Goldmans most powerful defender in the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commissions civil fraud lawsuit on April 16 against the company.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sigh of relief at Rajus homecoming
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sigh of relief at Rajus homecoming
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Raju: Home again                                  
	Hyderabad, Oct. 2: Byraju Ramalinga Raju, the man behind the biggest corporate fraud in India, has returned home after more than 20 months.        
	Raju, who is the former chairman of Satyam Computer and the prime accused in the Rs 7,800-crore accounting fraud, was today discharged from the Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences where he was undergoing treatment for Hepatitis C for the past one year.        
	NIMS gastroenterologist Ajit Kumar said Raju requested the hospital authorities to discharge him yesterday.         
	He made a request yesterday. He still has to be administered 11 injections as part of the treatment. However, the risk is much less now. His liver is functioning normally, Ajit Kumar said.         
	Raju has cleared the hospital bill of approximately Rs 8 lakh yesterday, the doctor said.         
	We gave him some instructions on sanitation and medication to follow. He did not indicate if he would be getting admitted in any other hospital, Kumar said when asked about the risk factor, which was cited as the reason for Raju not attending the court proceedings earlier.         
	Raju was received at his Jubilee Hills home by his wife Nandini, sons and other family members. Raju was whisked away to a sanitised upper-floor room of the bungalow and visitors were told he would see them later. My husband is home after over a year. Please leave us alone, Rajus wife told reporters.        
	According to Rajus legal counsel S. Bharat Kumar, Raju was discharged from the hospital as his health condition had improved significantly.         
	Hepatitis C viral count has come down while his platelet count has gone up. As his immunity level is precarious doctors have advised him to keep himself in a hygienic environment and not to mingle with crowds. He will regularly take doctors advice for further treatment, he said.        
	Raju was arrested on January 11, 2009 and was in Chanchalguda jail for nine months till he was admitted to NIMS in September last year for Hepatitis C treatment. He had avoided appearing for court proceedings until he got bail. Soon after he was granted bail by Andhra Pradesh High Court in August, the NIMS authorities said Raju needed further treatment.        
	The CBI, which is investigating the multi-crore accounting scam of Satyam, filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking cancellation of bail to Raju and nine others. The apex court subsequently issued a notice to Raju to file a reply before October 21.        
	SEC plans civil suit        
	Satyam Computer said it had received a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission saying that the market regulator may file a civil suit alleging fraud.        
	Satyam revealed in a regulatory filing on Thursday that it had received the notification, known as a Wells Notice, on September 17, 2009. It was not immediately clear why it was being made public now.        
	A spokesperson for Satyam did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.        
	The notice said the SECs division of enforcement had tentatively decided to recommend that a civil suit be filed alleging fraud and other violations and seeking permanent injunctions and monetary relief, according to Satyam. The SEC has not yet made a decision, the company said.

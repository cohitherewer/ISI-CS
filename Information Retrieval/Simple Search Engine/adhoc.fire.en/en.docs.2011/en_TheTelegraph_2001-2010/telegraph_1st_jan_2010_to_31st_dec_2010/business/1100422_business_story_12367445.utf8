	New Delhi, April 21: US telecom giant AT amp;T, Frances Vivendi and Telefonica of Spain are the possible suitors for a 26 per cent stake in Videocon-promoted Datacom.        
	Many foreign companies are eyeing a stake in us (the telecom venture). We may dilute a stake of up to 26 per cent, Venugopal Dhoot, chief of Videocon, told reporters.        
	Sources said officials from AT amp;T, Vivendi and Telefonica had been in talks with Datacom to buy a stake in the mobile venture.        
	Dhoot, however, did not comment on the names of foreign players. He said the stake dilution could take place as soon as we get a good valuation.        
	Earlier, Videocon had abandoned talks with UAEs Etisalat and Turkish telecom firm Turkcell as valuations collapsed during the financial crisis.         
	Dhoot said the companys valuation, which is at Rs 12,000 crore, might go up considering the rapid expansion it had undertaken. Datacom, which offers GSM-based mobile services, has operations in the Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Mumbai circles. It has set a target of 100 million customers in the next three years and will invest Rs 14,000 crore.        
	Videocon has licences for all 22 circles and plans to become a pan-India operator soon. Besides expanding its services, Videocon is in the race for 3G spectrum and has aggressive plans to launch high-speed services.        
	The Videocon group reported revenues of $4 billion in the year ended March 31, 2009. It hopes to touch the $10-billion mark by 2013, of which close to $4 billion will come from mobile services.        
	Buying a stake in a relatively new player makes better business sense as valuations will be low, said analysts. Videocons distribution reach and cross-selling opportunities also make it a good asset.        
	However, some analysts feel a company with limited operations (three circles) and limited access to spectrum (4.4 megahertz in each circle) may not offer great value to any buyer.         
	A stake in Datacom operations is likely to offer limited value to any buyer, specially after a consolidation in the market, said Mahesh Uppal, director of Com First India, a telecom consulting firm.         
	However, players such as AT amp;T are keen on entering the Indian mobile market and may grab this opportunity.

	Mumbai, Jan. 24: Oil India Ltd and ONGC Videsh Ltd  two public sector oil companies  are baulking at onerous performance criteria that the government wants to work into the memoranda of understanding signed between state-owned companies and their respective ministries.         
	The department of public enterprises (DPE), which comes under the ministry of heavy industries and public industries, has sent stateowned companies into a tizzy by mandating that all PSUs will have to ensure a 10 per cent increase in gross sales, net profits, net worth and gross margins over their expected achievement in 2009-10 or their performance in 2008-09, whichever is better.         
	The new performance criteria for PSUs were spelt out in a note that the DPE sent out on December 10. The government clearly seems to be conditioning PSUs to crank up performance now that the economic downturn is over. It also ties in with the governments resolve to ratchet up overall economic growth to over 9 per cent next year.        
	But the two oil companies have argued that the condition that mandates a flat 10 per cent increment across all performance metrics does not take into account external factors over which they have no control.        
	For example, the price of crude has tumbled from $147 per barrel in July 2008 to roughly $80 per barrel now while the rupee has hardened recently to Rs 45 to a dollar. Since oil companies performance depend critically on the price of crude oil, they contend that a one-size-fits-all condition isnt fair.        
	The DPE has said that the PSUs will have to sign the new MoUs by March 15. Enterprises that fail to do so will find their performance rated as poor. Similarly, subsidiaries of PSUs will have to sign MoUs with their holding companies.

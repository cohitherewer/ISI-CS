The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deora at odds with oil cop over royalty 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Deora at odds with oil cop over royalty 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Murli Deora with son Milind in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: Reliance Industries need not club marketing margin to the Krishna-Godavari gas price to calculate the governments share of royalty, the government said today.        
	The statement contradicts a proposal by the director-general of hydrocarbons.        
	The oil regulator wants the margin of $0.135 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) that Reliance charges for covering risks to be added to the governments royalty.         
	The production sharing contract (under which firms such as Reliance produce oil and gas from areas assigned by the government) does not envisage the sharing of revenue earned by the contractor (RIL) on the marketing margin between the government and the contractor, petroleum minister Murli Deora informed the Rajya Sabha in a written reply.        
	The government has fixed $4.20 per mBtu as the price of gas from Krishna-Godavari for five years. Reliances risk-cover, or marketing, margin of $0.135 per mBtu is in addition to this.        
	The marketing margin is beyond the delivery point and arises as a result of gas sales and purchase agreement signed between the seller and the buyer, Deora said in reply to a question by former Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh.        
	Delivery point is the place where Reliance transfers custody of gas for sale to customers.         
	The PSC (production sharing contract) provides for sharing of revenue between the government and the contractor at the said price at the delivery point, he said. The marketing margin is agreed upon between the buyer and the seller under the gas sales and purchase agreement, which is different from PSC.        
	The rate of marketing margin, neither for KG-D6 (Krishna-Godavari) gas nor in any other case, is decided or approved by the government, Deora said.        
	Thorny issue        
	In September, Anil Ambani-led ADAG and NTPC had opposed Reliances move of charging marketing margin. State-owned NTPC later agreed to buy the gas on the condition that the government would take up the matter later. Similarly, ADAG agreed to buy the gas under protest for its plants in Andhra Pradesh.        
	The government has allotted NTPC about 2.67 million standard cubic metres per day gas from the Krishna-Godavari block to its Anta, Dadri and Faridabad power plants.

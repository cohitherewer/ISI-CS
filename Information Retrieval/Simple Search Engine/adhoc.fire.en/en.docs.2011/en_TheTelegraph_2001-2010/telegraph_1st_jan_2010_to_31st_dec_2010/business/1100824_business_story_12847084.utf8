          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      FRESH WORRIES                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: India will protest trade barriers imposed by any country, including hikes in visa fees, commerce minister Anand Sharma said today.        
	Many of the developed countries are looking inwards for fiscal consolidation. Economic barriers such as visa restrictions and the hike in visa fees will negatively affect the global recovery, Sharma said.        
	The US has substantially increased the fees for H-1B and L1 visas, the most sought-after by Indian IT companies.         
	The move, intended to fund increased security expenses along the US-Mexico border, has not gone down well with the Indian government and software industry.        
	We have officially taken it up with the government concerned, Sharma said.        
	Commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said India was talking to other countries that were also affected by the visa fee hike.        
	We have sent out a clear message to the world that the visa fee hike is WTO incompatible. The US cannot pass a law which clearly hurts Indias interests and then realistically expect us to accommodate their commercial interests, he said.        
	Sharma and Khullar are likely to take up the issue in their next visit to the US.        
	The commerce minister also said India remained committed to the successful completion of the Doha round of free trade talks.         
	We are in favour of rule-based, fair and equitable global trading regime, which has development as its core objective and which must respond to the aspiration of millions of people of the developing world, Sharma said.         
	In a bid to allay fears over the proposed withdrawal of fiscal benefits to SEZs in the direct taxes code, Sharma said he had conveyed the investors concerns to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	I would like to assure (you) that we will protect the benefits which investors were to get in the SEZs, he said.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      GTL close to Aircel deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Jan. 13: GTL Infrastructure is set to buy Aircels 17,500 telecom towers in a deal valued at around Rs 8,500 crore.         
	The two companies have reached an agreement and an announcement is likely tomorrow.        
	Following the acquisition, GTL Infrastructure, a Rs 221- crore company, will become one of the largest telecom infrastructure companies in the country with over 30,000 towers.        
	In a notice issued to the bourses today, GTL said its board would consider opportunities for strategic acquisition in a meeting tomorrow instead of January 18 as originally scheduled.         
	The stock markets got a whiff of a possible deal, and the GTL share surged nearly 14 per cent to end at Rs 42.90 on the BSE. The scrip was also the top gainer in the A group.         
	Sources said GTL group companies would pool in up to Rs 3,500 crore to fund the acquisition. GTL Infrastructure would also take on a debt of Rs 5,000 crore on the books of Aircel. Aircel is a unit of Malaysias Maxis Communication.         
	American Tower, Bharti Infratel and Tata Quippo were also in the race to acquire Aircel towers.        
	Analysts are optimistic about the future prospects of companies such as GTL Infrastructure, which offer ready-to-use passive infrastructure to telecom operators.         
	Telecom players, facing severe pressure on their margins, are likely to outsource their infrastructure requirements to players such as GTL Infrastructure and concentrate on just providing telecom service.         
	Indus Towers, jointly owned by Bharti, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular, is the largest tower company in the country with 100,000 towers.        
	Reliance Telecom Infrastructure, part of the Anil Ambani group, is also a major player.

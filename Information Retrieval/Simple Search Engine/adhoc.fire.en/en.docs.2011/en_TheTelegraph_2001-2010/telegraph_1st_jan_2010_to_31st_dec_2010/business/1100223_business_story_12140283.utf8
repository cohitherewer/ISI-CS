          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Recast mode                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 22: Citigroup has hired nine people, including Keshav Sanghi, as part of a move to strengthen its India equity team.         
	Sanghi, who has joined Citigroup Global Markets as managing director and deputy head of equities (India), was earlier the CEO of Anil Ambanis Reliance Equities.         
	According to Nikhil Nagle, head of equities for Citi India, while the move shows Citis commitment to its clients in India, it will also help to consolidate its presence in the domestic equities market.         
	We remain committed to our clients in continuing to invest in our Indian equities franchise across both the primary and secondary markets. To this end, Citi has made a number of significant hires across the sales and execution platforms in recent months. These hires have strengthened Citis presence in the Indian equities market to over 25 highly talented and motivated individuals, Nagle, head of equities (India), said.         
	He said India was a high priority market in the Asia Pacific region and with these new appointments, Citi would become one of the leading equity franchise in India.         
	The combined experience of the newly expanded talent pool is over 100 years in equity markets, which include hires across sales, trading and execution.         
	Other than Sanghi, Richard Macfarlane joined as managing director and head of execution services, India.        
	Vandana Luthra, who is now the managing director of India equity sales, was earlier with Merrill Lynch.         
	Other new faces are Chandra Sekaran (equity sales trading director), Abhijit Attavar (India trading director), Andrew Sutcliffe (equity sales trading director), Abhinav Khanna and Suveer Chainani (equity sales directors). Vaibhav Shintre has joined as execution trader.

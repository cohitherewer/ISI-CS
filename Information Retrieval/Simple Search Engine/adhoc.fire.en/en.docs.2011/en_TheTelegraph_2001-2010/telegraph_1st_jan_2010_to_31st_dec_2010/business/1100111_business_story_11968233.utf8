	New Delhi, Jan. 10: Merchant bankers in PSU share issues may be chosen not just on the basis of fees but past track records as well.        
	The government is planning to come out with a new set of criteria from next fiscal.         
	The new system will give weightage both to quality and fees to be paid by the government for selecting the merchant banker, divestment secretary Sunil Mitra told The Telegraph.        
	He said the proposal for changing the criteria had been sent to the Central Vigilance Commission, and I am hopeful that they would clear it before we start the divestment process for the next fiscal.        
	At present, the lowest bidder is given the contract to be the merchant banker for PSU divestment. The ministry feels that the lowest fee does not always bring in quality, so we have suggested changes, he said.        
	Selection criteria        
	The qualities that the ministry is looking for in the merchant banker include experience and capabilities in handling similar transactions as advisers or global co-ordinators.        
	Merchant bankers should possess sectoral expertise and have prior knowledge of the PSU. Besides, they should have a clear marketing strategy, local presence as well global outreach.         
	Mitra said the parameters for each criterion and its weightage would be formulated, and the selection would be fair and transparent.        
	In some recent issues, merchant bankers have quoted low rates.         
	For NTPCs follow-on public offer, sources said the government would pay a fee of 0.0007 per cent (seven paise per hundred rupees), aggregating to less than Rs 8 crore, including all expenses such as advertisement, listing, and regulators fees. An issue of such a large size should normally cost over Rs 25 crore.         
	A senior finance ministry official said the weightage of fees in the selection could come down to as low as 25-30 points.        
	Mitra said the present system led to unfair competition, with those having deep pockets bagging the mandates by quoting low amounts.But, how long the deep pockets can sustain is also a question.         
	Strategy talks        
	Officials said the department of divestment was holding consultations with the administrative ministries of over 50 PSUs to assess their preparedness for a public offer.         
	Fund requirements of the PSUs were being examined to arrive at a right balance between the issue of fresh shares and the sale of government equity.        
	According to the divestment policy unveiled in November, 50 unlisted companies with positive net worth and three years of profit and 18 listed companies that have less than 10 per cent floating equity will tap the market.

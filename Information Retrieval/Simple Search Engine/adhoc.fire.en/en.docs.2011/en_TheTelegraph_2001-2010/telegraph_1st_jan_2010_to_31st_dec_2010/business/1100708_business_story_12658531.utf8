The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panagarh land for urea plant
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Panagarh land for urea plant
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, July 7: The Bengal government has allotted land to Matix Fertiliser amp; Chemicals Ltd at Panagarh to set up a gas-based urea plant at an investment of Rs 5,000 crore.        
	The company, owned by Nishant Kanodia of Datamatics Group, has started land development work and hopes to complete the first phase by 2012.        
	Matix has received 420 acres from the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation.        
	Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen said the plant would be one of the largest industrial projects in the state in recent times. The fact that the state has managed to attract a big-ticket investment amid a turbulent political environment makes the project even more significant. Moreover, the government has been able to facilitate the physical possession of the land by Matix.        
	The company will use coal bed methane (CBM) gas from the nearby Raniganj field operated by the Essar group, owned by Ravi and Sashi Ruia. Nishant Kanodia is the son-in-law of Ravi Ruia. It is learnt that Essar and Matix Fertiliser have executed an agreement for an assured supply of gas for 20 years.        
	Essar plans to start producing gas this year and reach an output of 3 million cubic meters per day by 2012. CBM is gas trapped in coal seams and found in and around mines.        
	In the first phase, Matix plans to set up a 2,200-metric-tonnes-per-day ammonia plant and a 3,850 metric-tonnes-per-day (1.3 million tonnes a year) urea facility along with associated utilities.         
	In the second phase, the urea capacity will be increased to 3 million tonnes per year. The complex will house a 33-megawatt captive power plant with a dedicated water reservoir and steam generation facility. The project has received all key approvals. The Union department of fertilisers has identified the project for a subsidy. The company has also submitted the environment impact assessment report to the Centre.        
	Industrial Development Bank of India has rated the project as investment grade and sanctioned the loan. It is leading the process of syndication to achieve financial closure.         
	The company has also chosen the key technology partners. Houston-based Kellogg Brown amp; Root will license its purifier ammonia technology for the plant. The use of CBM as a feedstock in the ammonia synthesis process is a relatively new application. CBM is an alternative to natural gas in areas where coal is abundant. Matix has also tied up with Italys Saipem.         
	The Matix plant will have a ready market for urea in east India. The country imports around 7 million tonnes, or 30 per cent of its annual requirement of urea.

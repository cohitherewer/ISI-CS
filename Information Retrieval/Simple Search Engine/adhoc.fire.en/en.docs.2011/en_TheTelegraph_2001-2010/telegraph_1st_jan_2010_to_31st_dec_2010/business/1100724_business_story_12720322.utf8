	Transcend Infrastructure, a subsidiary of US-based American Towers, wants a 100 per cent stake in Essar Telecom Infrastructure.        
	The proposal of S Tel, promoted by Chennai-based C. Sivasankaran, to sell a 6.3 per cent stake to Bahrain Telecom Company (Batelco) was, however, rejected by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) as the home ministry had sought some clarifications on ownership.         
	The proposal of US-based Telcordia Technologies to implement mobile number portability was also turned down on security grounds.         
	The FIPB had deliberated on Telcordias proposal for over eight months and deferred it several times during this period because of objections raised by the home ministry, including the companys presence in Pakistan.         
	Frigorifico Allanas Rs 125-crore investment for setting up a joint venture was among those to be cleared. Other proposals approved include those of Nisarg Building Art amp; Technology, Turquoise Metals amp; Electricals and Modi Naturals.

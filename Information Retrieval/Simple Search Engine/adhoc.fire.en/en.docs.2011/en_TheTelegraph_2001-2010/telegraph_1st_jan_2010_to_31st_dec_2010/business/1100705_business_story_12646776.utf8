                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Back to basics
        The insured have nothing to gain from the new Ulip norms, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Ulip as an investment instrument is going through a major change. Irda has set in force certain norms which seek to make the Ulip a better product  primarily insurance and partly investment. The norms, Irda feels, should benefit the policy holder in the long run as it makes a higher sum assured mandatory, reduces surrender charges and offers much more cover.        
	But in reality the customer has nothing much to gain from these changes. Despite the lower surrender charges, the customers who buy a Ulip after the rules come into effect in September are no better off than those who are already invested.         
	Moreover, Ulip was popular more as an investment product rather than an insurance product. Most people would invest in Ulips for tax benefits or for the tax-free returns on maturity. Customers were not so keen on the cover part. But in the changed guidelines, the insurance component is much higher and so are the mortality charges. This in the long run reduces the investible corpus and reduces the maturity benefit of the customer. So who gains? Not the customer who wants to earn higher returns and is not bothered about cover.         
	Moreover, the norms may have sounded the death knell for Ulip as a product as insurers now wont be interested in selling these products. As surrender charges have been done away with after five years and reduced drastically before that, insurers have no way out but to decrease their agents commission. So agents who used to get 40 per cent commission in the first year might get just 5 per cent. So they would want to revert to selling traditional insurance plans where they will continue to earn high commissions.         
	The new rules entail some fundamental changes that may lead to a situation where the product is very good but no one is willing to sell it, said Kamesh Goyel, CEO of Bajaj Allianz Life.        
	Let us illustrate how the changes are going to impact the policy value.        
	At present the minimum sum assured of a Ulip is five times the annualised premium. If Ram (30 years) buys the Ulip for an annual premium of Rs 1 lakh for 20 years, his minimum sum assured will be Rs 5 lakh and he will get Rs 50,17,371 on maturity. It is assumed here that gross return on Rams investment fund is 10 per cent annually compounded.         
	Under the current cost structure, Rams investment fund value grows enough to cover his sum assured, that is Rs 5 lakh, in four years. In other words, if Ram dies within the first four years, his family will get Rs 5 lakh. But if he dies after the first four years, his family will get the fund value which is greater than the sum assured.         
	Since the minimum sum assured has now been increased to 10 times the annual premium, a higher percentage of Rams annual premium will go towards mortality cover. Under the current cost structure, he will get on maturity after 20 years Rs 49,91,747. His survival benefit gets reduced by Rs 25,624 simply because the minimum sum assured has been increased.        
	The new regulations also stipulate that overall charges have to be evenly distributed during the first five years.         
	Assuming a gross return of 10 per cent per annum Rams fund value under the new dispensation will become just enough to cover his sum assured after seven years and the fund value at the end of eight years is only Rs 11,321 more than under the current dispensation.        
	However, even this gain may not be there. The new regulations allow insurers to charge a maximum of 4 per cent from the fifth year. In other words, insurers may restructure various charges from the fifth year so that it gradually tapers off from 4 per cent to 2.25 per cent (in case of a policy of more than 15 years) in the 15th year.        
	Though there will be no surrender charges applicable after the first five years, the accumulated fund value that Ram may get on surrender will not be very different compared with what he gets now.        
	Thus, while the new regulations will make policyholders stay put through the policy term, the survival benefit on maturity may not be very different from what it is now.         
	Another important aspect is that the minimum premium for a unit-linked policy will go up. A year ago, insurers had been selling Ulips with a minimum annual premium of Rs 5,000.         
	Insurers believe post-September the minimum annualised premium for Ulips may go up to Rs 20,000 or more. This is because acquisition cost of small ticket policies will become costlier for insurers. Many people will simply not be able to afford a Ulip.

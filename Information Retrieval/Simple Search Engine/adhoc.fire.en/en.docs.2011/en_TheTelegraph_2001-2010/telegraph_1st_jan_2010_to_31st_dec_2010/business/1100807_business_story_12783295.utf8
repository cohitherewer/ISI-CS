	Calcutta, Aug. 6: General Motors India is planning to enter the light commercial vehicle market next year in the sub- one-tonne segment.        
	Under the joint venture with Chinas SAIC, we plan to launch three passenger vehicles and two light commercial vehicles (LCV) in 2011 and 2012, managing director Karl Slym said here today.         
	General Motors India was converted into a 50:50 joint venture between General Motors and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) last year.        
	The light trucks in the sub-one tonne and one tonne categories will be competitively priced, Slym said. He declined to give details about the passenger vehicles. The company today opened a new showroom in the city.         
	All passenger vehicles will be sold under the Chevrolet brand. But the company is yet to decide the brand name for LCVs, he said, adding that the LCV market in India was set to grow 24 per cent on an average in the next three to four years.         
	This gives us the scope for good growth.         
	The LCVs will be produced at the Halol facility in Gujarat, while the passenger vehicles will be manufactured at the Talegaon plant in Maharashtra.        
	About half of all commercial vehicles sold in India are light trucks, in which Tata Motors enjoys nearly 90 per cent share.         
	More players are entering this segment such as utility vehicle maker Mahindra amp; Mahindra, which launched its Gio mini-trucks last year.        
	Japans Nissan has a joint venture with Ashok Leyland to make light trucks, while Germanys Daimler will start manufacturing them at its facility in south India.

	Calcutta, June 18: ITC declared a 1:1 bonus today, its fifth in the last two decades.        
	The tobacco-to-hotels conglomerate approved the issue ahead of its centenary in August.        
	ITC had last offered a bonus of 1:2 in 2005. There are about 3,39,383 shareholders in the company.        
	The companys stock had rallied from May 21 when it announced that bonus shares would be discussed by the board on June 18.         
	The scrip has gained Rs 12 since then, rising from Rs 262 to close at Rs 294 today. During the day, the stock had even surged to Rs 299 before cooling off.        
	The bonus issue will have to be ratified by the shareholders at the annual general meeting on July 23.        
	The fresh issue comes at a time ITC is evolving into a multi-business conglomerate from just a cigarette maker.         
	The company is now the leading FMCG marketer in India, owning the second largest hotel chain, market leader in paperboards and packaging and countrys foremost agri-business player.         
	Over the last 15 years, ITC has consistently done well, without much surprises. The stock market loved the scrip as a good defence against volatility. During this period, post-tax profits recorded a compound growth of 21.7 per cent per annum.         
	Total shareholder returns, measured in terms of increase in market capitalisation and dividends, grew at a compound rate of 24.3 per cent annually during this period.        
	ITC has a market capitalisation of more than Rs 1 lakh crore.

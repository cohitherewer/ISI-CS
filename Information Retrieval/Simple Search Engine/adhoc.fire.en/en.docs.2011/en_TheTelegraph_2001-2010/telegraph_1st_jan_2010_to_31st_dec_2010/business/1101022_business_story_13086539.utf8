	Calcutta, Oct. 21: Allahabad Bank today reported a 20.68 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 402.57 crore for the quarter ended September 30 compared with Rs 347.14 crore during the same period a year ago.        
	The profit growth came on the back of a 60.66 per cent jump in net interest income, which is the interest earned on advances and investments minus the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.         
	Total interest income surged 28.84 per cent to Rs 2,636.93 crore, while interest expenses went up 15.54 per cent to Rs 1,667.73 crore.        
	The bank has recorded a 36.83 per cent growth in advances at Rs 83,182.67 crore during the second quarter, which is considered a lean period for business and marked by slow offtake.        
	In fact, we had huge amount of sanctioned loans in the first quarter and disbursals of those loans took place in the second quarter, chairman and managing director J.P. Dua said.        
	According to him, the bank still has Rs 20,000-crore sanctioned loans, which are awaiting disbursal. Nearly 70 per cent of those loans are for core projects and our infrastructure loan book during July-September has increased 61 per cent, he said.        
	We had made it a point to disburse a loan as quickly as possible once it was sanctioned to increase our average loan growth rather than terminal loan growth, executive director D. Sarkar said.        
	The bank targets a 25 per cent growth in business at Rs 2,20,000 crore at the end of this fiscal. It has also been able to jack up its net interest margin to 3.34 per cent at the end of September from 3.10 per cent at the end of June.        
	However, net non-performing assets have increased to 0.56 per cent from 0.41 per cent at the end of June, and gross non-performing assets rose to 1.77 per cent from 1.50 per cent.         
	This was primarily because of a Rs 250-crore agriculture loan, which turned bad even after the implementation of the debt waiver and debt relief scheme, Dua said.        
	The bank has sought a capital infusion of Rs 1,000 crore from the government.        
	The shares of Allahabad Bank today closed at Rs 240.85, up 4.22 per cent from the previous close of Rs 231.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

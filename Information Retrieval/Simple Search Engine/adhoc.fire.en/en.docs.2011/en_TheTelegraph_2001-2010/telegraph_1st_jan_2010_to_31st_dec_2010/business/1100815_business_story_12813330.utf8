The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Britannia offers exit option
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Britannia offers exit option
          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 14: Britannia Industries today asked its workers at the Taratala factory to take voluntary retirement as the company had decided to reduce production at the unit soon.        
	Today, two management personnel had a meeting with the two workers union at Britannias Taratala factory. They had asked us to take VRS and threatened to stop production at the factory, a top union representative told The Telegraph. There are 307 workers on the companys permanent payroll and about 300 more are on contract.        
	The two company officials, who attended the meeting, said they were not authorised to speak to the media. The companys official spokesperson could not be reached for comment.        
	According to the workers unions, the Taratala factory produces 1,650 tonnes of biscuits per month; the eastern region requires about 3,200 tonnes monthly. The rest is produced at other factories in the eastern region, including some where production has been outsourced.        
	It is not true that production at the Taratala factory is unviable. The company just doesnt want to run the factory, the union representative said.         
	The workers feel the company will force them into taking VRS by stopping production.        
	In October last year, Britannia had received an eviction mandate from the Calcutta Port Trust following a rent dispute. The company had since moved court to settle the issue but little progress had been made.        
	Earlier this week, chairman Nusli Wadia said at the company AGM that Britannia had adopted a two-pronged strategy to resolve the dispute with CPT. While it has moved court, it is also trying to negotiate through dialogue.         
	Britannia managing director Vinita Bali had said on the sidelines of the AGM that production at the Taratala factory was in full swing.        
	The company, however, has shifted its sales and marketing team from Taratala to Camac Street. The team had been operating from the Taratala premises since the 1960s.        
	Britannia has already shut its factories in Chennai and Mumbai. The Mumbai facility was shut down because of labour problems and rent dispute with the state authority. After closing the plants, Britannia has mostly outsourced the production.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Apex bank warning on teaser rate
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Apex bank warning on teaser rate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 12: The Reserve Bank of India has sounded a warning on the teaser interest rates that banks have been offering to lure borrowers, signalling its concerns about an increase in loan delinquencies.        
	The central bank is worried that the borrowers may not be able to service the loans when the rates are bumped up to market levels after the first year.        
	Last February, the State Bank of India triggered an industry-wide trend with a home loan programme that capped interest rates at 8 per cent for the first year.         
	The SBI has already tweaked the programme and now offers 8 per cent in the first year, and 8.5 per cent in the second and the third year. The interest rate rises from the fourth year and is capped at 2.75 percentage points below the prevailing State Bank Advance Rate at that time. At present, the SBAR is pegged at 11.75 per cent.         
	Teaser rates are increasingly being offered which is a cause for concern, RBI deputy governor Usha Thorat said.         
	I hope banks are ensuring that borrowers are well aware of the implications of such rates and the appraisal takes into account the repaying capacity of the borrowers when the rates become normal, she said.                    
	The central bank is widely expected to tighten rates this year as it tries to tamp down on inflation and reverse its liberal monetary policy that it put in place in September 2008 to counter the effects of global recession.        
	While analysts feel that the RBI will initially raise the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and subsequently up the reverse repo and the repo rates, the main worry is that this could lead to a further rise in non-performing assets (NPAs).        
	The repo is the rate at which RBI provides funds to banks against government securities. It uses the reverse repo to soak in excess liquidity. The CRR is the proportion of bank deposits which must be maintained with the central bank. The repo rate now stands at 4.75 per cent and reverse repo at 3.25 per cent. The CRR is pegged at 5 per cent.        
	Although senior bankers like SBI chairman .P. Bhatt have acknowledged that NPAs, particularly from the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), have been rising, they contend that the situation in the retail category isnt worrying.        
	Bankers claim they have not diluted the due diligence process followed while sanctioning or disbursing a loan.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      PSUs out of 25% float rule ambit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 9: State-owned firms need not rush to offload shares as they have been exempted from the rule that makes it mandatory for all listed companies to ensure a minimum 25 per cent public holding.        
	The easing of the cap for PSUs will prevent too many issues from hitting the market at the same time and help the state-owned firms to get a better valuation when they plan a flotation.        
	According to a finance ministry notification, state-owned companies are required to divest only 10 per cent over three years, while private players will divest 25 per cent over the same period. At present, the minimum listing norm is 10 per cent.         
	However, the notification clarifies that private players can reach the 25-per-cent threshold at one go and need not do it in a phased manner by selling 5 per cent each year.        
	On June 4, the government amended the Securities Contract (Regulations) Act by ordering all listed companies, including public sector firms, to lower their promoters holding in a phased manner till a minimum of 25 per cent was with the public.         
	The objective was to let investors benefit from Indias economic growth and promote better price discovery.        
	Under the norms, all listed companies were required to dilute at least 5 per cent every year until public holding reached 25 per cent.        
	For any new listing, the earlier notification continues, if the public offer is over Rs 4,000 crore, the company can list with just 10 per cent public holding to start with and reach the 25 per cent requirement with an annual increase of 5 per cent over the next three years.         
	The new rules state that in case of a listed PSU whose public holding of 10 per cent falls at any given time, such a company shall bring the public shareholding to 10 per cent within a maximum period of 12 months from the date of such a fall.        
	PSUs account for 30.7 per cent of the market capitalisation of the Bombay Stock Exchange at Rs 18.64 lakh crore, according to www.bsepsu.com, a website dedicated to government-owned listed firms.        
	The Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE) had earlier opposed the mandatory 25 per cent minimum public holding norm, fearing that this would lead to a spate of follow-on public offers by PSUs, which would lower their valuations.        
	In a market flooded with follow-on public offers, the unlisted public sector entities may not feel encouraged to list on the bourses, SCOPE had said.        
	At present, there are 56 listed public sector entities, including 22 banks. Of the 34 non-banking listed public sector enterprises, as many as 21 entities have public holdings of less than 25 per cent. In public sector banks, the number of listed companies where the holding is less than 25 per cent is around five.        
	In the short term, the lower divestment levels are good for valuations of the public sector firms planning to list on the bourses, Alex Mathews, head (research), Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services, told The Telegraph.        
	State-run Coal India today filed a draft prospectus for an initial public offering with Sebi. Other government share sales in the pipeline this fiscal include public offerings in Steel Authority of India, Hindustan Copper and PowerGrid.        
	The norms relating to public holding are specified under the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, which is administered by the finance ministry.         
	Currently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has powers to waive or relax the listing requirements under the act.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, May 11: Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has signed a deal with Merck amp; Co for its cholesterol lowering generic drug Ezetimibe.         
	Under the terms of the out-of-court settlement, Glenmark can launch the drug on December 12, 2016, four months ahead of its patent expiry on April 2017. It will also get a marketing exclusivity period.        
	Ezetimibe is a generic version of Merck-Schering Ploughs patented drug Zetia.         
	Glenmark had filed an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for the generic version of the drug with the US Food and Drug Administration on October 2006. The company had got the tentative approval for Ezetimibe tablets in 10 mg strength last year through its US-based subsidiary Glenmark Generics.         
	Glenmark had challenged Mercks basic compound patent on numerous grounds. In response, Merck wanted to prevent Glenmark from launching the drug until its patent expires.         
	Zydus Cadila        
	US-based drug maker Abbott has signed a licensing and supply agreement with Zydus Cadila for 24 products to be sold in 15 emerging markets.        
	The company, however, did not specify financial details of the agreement, which also includes an option for the addition of more than 40 products from the Indian drug firm.

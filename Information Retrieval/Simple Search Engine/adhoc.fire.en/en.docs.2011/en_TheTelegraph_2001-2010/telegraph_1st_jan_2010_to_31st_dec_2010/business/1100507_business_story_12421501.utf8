          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 6: The sale of third-generation (3G) spectrum has entered the final stages today, with mobile operators placing bids for all 22 telecom circles.         
	At the preceding stages, there were some circles  such as Orissa, Assam and Jammu and Kashmir  which were not receiving any bids.        
	The estimated 3G revenue raised so far, including the money which BSNL and MTNL will have to pay for their spectrum allocation, is Rs 44,566 crore, which is around 27 per cent more than the target for 3G and broadband wireless taken together.        
	Officials of the department of telecom said, With bids in all circles, the auction has entered 100 per cent activity stage and is expected to conclude by Saturday.         
	The auction will conclude when all the circles find buyers equal to the number of slots on sale in each circle.         
	In 17 circles, three slots will be auctioned, while in the rest, four slots are available.

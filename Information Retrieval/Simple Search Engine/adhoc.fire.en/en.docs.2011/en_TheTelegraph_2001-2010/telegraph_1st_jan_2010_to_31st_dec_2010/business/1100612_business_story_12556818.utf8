          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 11: The 16-day-long broadband spectrum auction ended today with the government richer by Rs 38,540 crore.        
	The broadband proceeds coupled with the Rs 67,719 crore received from 3G spectrum sale mean the government has earned Rs 1,06,259 crore, which is likely to reduce its fiscal deficit to 4.47 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in this fiscal from the budget estimate of 5.5 per cent of GDP.        
	Anant Nahata-promoted Infotel Broadband Services Private Limited (Infotel) is the only company to win a pan-India licence in broadband. It will pay Rs 12,848 crore for the 22 telecom circles.        
	Maxis-owned Aircel came second after winning spectrum in eight circles, including Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam. It will pay Rs 3,438 crore in fees.        
	We have a 2G network as well as a 3G presence in the broadband circles, putting us in a formidable position to provide a full suite of voice, data and broadband services in these zones, said Sandip Das, director of Aircel.        
	US-based Qualcomm, the worlds largest maker of mobile phone chips, won the lucrative circles of Delhi and Mumbai along with Kerala and Haryana.         
	The company is looking to partner one or more local players to roll out a long-term evolution network and will pay Rs 4,912 crore in fees. It plans to exit the venture as soon as the network has been implemented.         
	We are looking for partners among the firms that won third-generation spectrum, said Kanwalinder Singh, president of Qualcomms Indian and South Asian operations, adding that a partner will be announced in a month.         
	Other winners include Bharti in four areas, including Calcutta, for Rs 3,314 crore; Tikona Digital Networks in five areas for Rs 1,058 crore; and Augere (Mauritius) in Madhya Pradesh for Rs 125 crore.        
	Several big players, including Reliance Communications, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular, opted out of the race as bid prices climbed to irrational levels.        
	Even winners such as Bharti Airtel said a combination of scarcity of slots and the auction format once again resulted in extremely high price levels.        
	The final bid for a pan-India licence fee shot up to Rs 12,847.77 crore, which is 634 per cent higher than the Rs 1,750-crore base price.         
	State-run BSNL and MTNL, who have been allotted 20 megahertz of broadband spectrum, would pay Rs 8,313.80 crore and Rs 4,533.97 crore, respectively.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 28: ITC has picked up an additional 1.54 per cent stake in Hotel Leelaventure through its wholly owned investment subsidiary Russell Credit.         
	With this, ITCs consolidated holding in the Bangalore-based hospitality major rises to over 10 per cent.        
	The development comes within two months of ITC taking over Russell Credits stake in Leelaventure.         
	Besides Leela, Russell Credit had also transferred shares of EIH and VST to ITC. All the stocks were sold at the historical cost of acquisition.        
	One of the reasons for the share transfer was to boost Russell Credits balance sheet.        
	According to analysts, the wholly owned subsidiary of ITC will be able to make fresh investments with the proceeds from the inter-se transfer.        
	The fresh purchase could have caused Russell Credit nearly Rs 28-30 crore.        
	The Leela scrip closed 2.68 per cent higher at Rs 46.05 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.         
	The stock has corrected nearly 14 per cent from the peak reached this month.        
	The fresh purchase has come at a time when the Leela board has approved a proposal to raise Rs 375 crore via foreign currency convertible bonds and an identical amount through the issue of a qualified institutional placement (QIP).         
	The QIP issue will dilute ITCs holding, which stood at 8.48 per cent as on March 31.        
	The promoters of Leela have also taken the creeping acquisition route to scale up their holding in the firm by around 2 per cent to 53.32 per cent.                                      
	ITC had checked in at Leela in during third quarter of 2008-9 with 3 per cent. In subsequent next 6 quarters, its consolidated holding has now crossed 10 per cent.        
	ITC does not have much leeway to invest in another hotel major EIH where its stake in 14.98 per cent.        
	EIH is more diversified company than Leela which only has 6 properties in India. But it will open two more hotels in Delhi and Chennai within next one year.                    
	ends

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: State-run Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd is planning to invite bids from mobile firms in the next 3-4 months to lease out some of its transmission towers.        
	The company can get a revenue of Rs 50 crore in the first year from giving its towers on lease, said S.K. Chaturvedi, chairman and managing director of PowerGrid.         
	Our estimates are that if the foray is successful, it has a potential of Rs 350-400 crore over the next 5-6 years. PowerGrid has 150,000 transmission towers.        
	The power transmission firm expects to launch a follow-on offer to raise up to Rs 8,600 crore by the second week of November.         
	The proceeds from the offer will be used to expand its transmission network.         
	We are yet to fix a price band for the issue, said Chaturvedi. PowerGrid plans to sell 10 per cent fresh equity, while the government that holds 86 per cent in the company will sell 10 per cent. Both the government and the company expect to raise up to Rs 4,300 crore each.        
	We plan to use our share to fund the remaining investments during the Eleventh Plan (through March 2012) and also for initial projects during the Twelfth Plan period (starting April 2012), he said.        
	J.P. Morgan, ICICI Securities, SBI Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs will be the lead managers.        
	PowerGrid is also in discussions with the World Bank for a loan of $1 billion to build infrastructure in the Northeast.        
	The company needs to expand its network to meet the huge generation capacity required to provide electricity to millions of rural households, fight peak-hour shortages and cater to the growing demand from industry.        
	The company is strengthening its infrastructure to transfer power from large plants in east and northwest India to consumers across the country.        
	PowerGrid has set a capital expenditure target of Rs 55,000 crore for five years through March 2012, said Chaturvedi.         
	It plans to spend another Rs 80,000-85,000 crore from April 2012 to March 2017 to expand capacity and strengthen the national grid.        
	Overseas roster        
	PowerGrid is one of the preferred bidders for transmission projects in Kenya and Nigeria.        
	In addition, we are working on a project in Bangladesh and have signed a memorandum of understanding in Sri Lanka, Chaturvedi said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in Murshidabad on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Margram (Murshidabad), April 18: The Central Bank of India is planning to venture into the insurance and mutual fund businesses, a senior bank official said.         
	We have been looking for suitable partners for the insurance as well as the asset management businesses for a few months now, said S. Sridhar, chairman and managing director of the Central Bank of India, after inaugurating the banks 3,564th branch here today.         
	Sridhar also said the bank was considering both life and non-life insurance ventures.        
	We have not yet decided on anything particular and we are open to all options. It will all depend on the suitability of the partner, Sridhar said. The bank is hopeful of finalising things within this year.         
	The Central Bank is expected to clock over Rs 1,000 crore net profit in 2009-10.         
	In the first nine months, we have recorded a net profit of Rs 887 crore, which was higher than Rs 604 crore the bank had ever achieved, Sridhar said, adding that the total business in 2009-10 stood at Rs 2,63,000 crore.         
	Advances grew 23 per cent to Rs 1,07,000 crore and deposits went up to Rs 1,56,000 crore.         
	In 2010-11, we are targeting a credit growth of 25 per cent, Sridhar said.         
	The bank has got a capital infusion of Rs 450 crore from the government in March.         
	In the current quarter we hope to get another Rs 250 crore from the government. This Rs 700 crore will take care of our capital requirement for the current financial year. However, we will take a call on our capital raising plan soon keeping in view future business growth, Sridhar said.         
	New tax rule        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the second draft of the direct tax code would take time.         
	Once we get it done, it will be put on the ministrys website for public comments and then parliamentary procedures will be followed, he said after inaugurating the 1,225th branch of Dena Bank in Raghunathganj, Murshidabad, today.        
	He also said the GDP growth for 2009-10 was expected to be 7.2 per cent and for 2010-11, 8.5 per cent.         
	Mukherjee said the declining trend in GDP growth had been arrested because of various tax breaks given by the government. We shall have to increase our GDP growth rate.         
	On banking, Mukherjee said Indian banks stood on a firm footing even as their global counterparts in the US and Europe collapsed under the weight of the financial crisis.        
	He said Indian banks did not chase hot money and hence, didnt fall prey to asset bubble.        
	Referring to the recent financial crisis that hit the US and spread across the globe, Mukherjee said the countrys banking system was not involved in speculative activities like its counterparts in the US and Europe.         
	He praised the banking system for helping the nation to achieve an inclusive growth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Greek ghost haunts stocks

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 8: Greece came back to haunt equities today when renewed worries about its potential debt default spooked stock markets across the world.        
	The impact was felt on the local bourses as well with those concerns exacerbated by mounting worries about an imminent interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India in an attempt to quell surging food prices.        
	At the end of a frenetic day of trading, the sensex tumbled 256 points to close at 17714.40, snapping a four-day streak of gains.        
	Broking circles explained that while concerns about high valuations capped the possibility of a major rally, the Greek crisis and food price inflation had left investors in a mood of disquiet.        
	Market participants were first treated to the disappointing news that annual rate of inflation based on the wholesale price index of food articles had risen up to 17.70 per cent during the week ended March 27 from 16.35 per cent during the previous week. This fuelled concerns that the RBI would raise key short-term rates in its monetary policy due on April 20. The news saw hectic sales in banking stocks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and the SBI among others.        
	But then came the second whammy when European stocks opened in the red and Asian stocks slid as the Greek tragedy took on epic dimensions. Greece currently faces a huge debt of around euro 300 billion. Investors were apprehensive about a possible bailout package being cobbled by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), if Athens isnt able to borrow money from the financial markets.        
	The financial markets are sceptical about Greece coming out of its problems as evinced by the fact of yields on Greek government bond hitting a new high, thus making it even more challenging for that country to issue new debt and raise money.         
	An analyst from a domestic brokerage pointed out that while a correction was due, the undertone remained strong as it is widely expected that corporate India will post strong earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009-10.

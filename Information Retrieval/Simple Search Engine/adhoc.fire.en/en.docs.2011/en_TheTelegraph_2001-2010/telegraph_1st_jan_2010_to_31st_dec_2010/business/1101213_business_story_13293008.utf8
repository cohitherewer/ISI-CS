The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Merc to offer hatchbacks on new platform
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Merc to offer hatchbacks on new platform
          ANASUYA BASU                          Growth driver                                  
	Pune, Dec. 12: Mercedes-Benz will drive in its A- and B-Class hatchbacks in 2013-14, based on a front-wheel drive platform being developed in Stuttgart.         
	The platform  Mercedes-Benz front wheel architecture (MFA)  is flexible and built for a wide range of cars such as the A- and B-Class hatchbacks, sedans smaller than the C-Class and mini-SUVs.         
	Besides, it costs much less than the sandwich floor construction used in the current crop of A-and B-Class cars, which are nearing the end of their life cycle.         
	The new generation A-and B-Class, now being developed at Stuttgart, are radically different to look at, said Wilfried Aulbur, outgoing chief executive officer of Mercedes-Benz India. Aulbur will be replaced by Peter T. Honegg from next year.         
	Mercedes had been planning to introduce the hatches in India for a long time. But the high cost of the A-Class, pegged somewhere between Rs 28 lakh and Rs 35 lakh, and the B-Class, priced more than Rs 32 lakh, did not justify the volumes it would generate in India.         
	However, with the introduction of the new platform, the company is likely to revise its policy on introducing its small cars in India, said an industry source.        
	The present Mercedes cars are rear wheel drives. MFA will be the first front wheel drive platform, said a company source.         
	Faced with stiff competition in emerging markets such as India, MFA is one of the means by which Mercedes sees itself driving the volumes. It is going to be one of the key pillars of Mercedes-Benz, the source said.         
	With MFA, the German giant is set to enter a less-niche market, he added.        
	Merc will also be able to develop a vehicle in the compact SUV segment with this platform. It will help Merc develop an answer to BMWs X1, the industry source said.         
	BMW, the main competitor of Mercedes, is set to introduce its compact sports activity vehicle  X1  at an entry-level price of below Rs 25 lakh. The car will be assembled in the country.         
	At present, we do not have a vehicle in that segment. The (Mercedes) GLK, which comes close to a compact SUV, is a left-hand drive and developed for the European markets, the Mercedes source said.         
	MFA is going to help Merc develop a rival to the X1 and a whole range of such affordable small cars without compromising on its built and safety features. The mother plant for these vehicles will be in Hungary.        
	Mercedes expects to clock an 86 per cent growth in sales at 6,000 units this year against 3,250 units sold in 2009.         
	Mercedes took 13 years to produce 20,000 cars, two-and-a-half years to produce the next 10,000 cars and we would take less than two years to produce another 10,000 cars, Aulbur had said earlier.         
	The company plans to invest Rs 200 crore in the next 18 months to set up a paint shop at its manufacturing facility.        
	According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, Mercedes sold 5,109 units in the January-November period, while BMW sold 5,345 units during the period, according to PTI.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Call for more                                  
	New Delhi, April 22: State-run Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Ltd (MTNL) expects 3G services to push its revenues up to over Rs 5,000 crore in 2010-11.         
	The PSU today launched the countrys first 3G television services, in a collaboration with Alcatel-Lucent and Aksh Optifibre.        
	The service allows subscribers to watch TV programmes on a mobile phone.        
	According to industry experts, the technology will find favour with teenagers and young professionals who want to be constantly in touch with the latest news or music, while on the move.         
	MTNL is also playing the tariff card to attract subscribers.         
	In February, the firm launched a SIM card costing Rs 10, the lowest 3G offering. Another scheme enables customers to make voice calls for half a paisa per second. Under this scheme, the company charges one paisa for 10KB data download on a SIM card of Rs 149 that offers a talk time of Rs 12.         
	MTNL, which offers services in Delhi and Mumbai, has close to 2.5 lakh 3G subscribers.         
	MTNL could post revenues above Rs 5,000 crore in 2010-11 by offering live mobile TV and other high-speed 3G services at low tariffs, telecom analyst Sudipto Basu said.        
	Earlier, MTNL had signed a memorandum of understanding with the department of telecom projecting a revenue of Rs 5,250 crore in 2010-11. According to sources, the PSU can end 2009-10 with a revenue of Rs 4,500-5,000 crore.

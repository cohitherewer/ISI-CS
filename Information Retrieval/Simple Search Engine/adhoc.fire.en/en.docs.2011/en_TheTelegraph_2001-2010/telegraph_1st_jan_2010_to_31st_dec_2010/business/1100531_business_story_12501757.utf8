        Fund houses are coming out with multi-asset schemes. But how good are these? Srikumar Bondyopadhyay finds out                        
	Asset management companies are coming out with multi-asset funds to attract investors and spice up the fast drying market for new fund offers.   
	After almost a year since the UTI Wealth Builder Fund Series II was launched, two more fund houses  Religare and Canara Robecco  recently came up with their open-ended monthly income schemes laced with gold.         
	Each of these schemes invests in equities, debt and gold in various proportions to reduce the volatility and provide a higher return than in a pure debt fund.        
	Tempting offer        
	Conservative investors looking for an income higher than bank fixed deposits or other assured income schemes will find these gold-laced monthly income plans attractive.         
	Monthly income plans of mutual funds are also more tax-efficient than other fixed-income instruments.         
	The interest income from bank fixed deposits is added to the depositors annual income and is taxed at the rate at which an individual pays the personal income tax. In the monthly income plans, the dividend is tax-free in the hands of the investor.         
	Any appreciation of capital originally invested, however, attracts capital gains tax, depending on the tenure of the investment.         
	If the investment is sold within 12 months, the investor will have to pay tax on the capital gains at the rate of ones personal income tax.         
	For investments of more than 12 months, long-term capital gains tax will be applicable. The tax rate will be 10 per cent without indexation, or 20 per cent with indexation benefit.         
	Gold-laced monthly income plans are an extension of traditional balanced funds investing in equity and debt papers.         
	Now, with gold added to it, the volatility will not only get reduced to a great extent, but the return will also improve.         
	In such funds, gold ETFs comprise up to 20-25 per cent of the asset allocation and equity comprises up to 35 per cent. Debt and money market instruments account for a minimum 65 per cent.         
	Given the allocation, the composite return on such schemes will depend on the price movements of individual asset classes.         
	Gold at a peak        
	After the sovereign debt problems in Poland, Iceland, Greece and Spain in the euro zone, gold has peaked to a new high of $1,235 per troy ounce earlier this month.         
	With the debt problem likely to linger in the euro zone, the demand for gold as a safe haven investment will continue for some more time.         
	The debt crisis and the consequent bond market collapse in Europe will also cause the euro to depreciate against the US dollar, at least in the short to medium term.         
	This will provide an additional impetus to the demand for gold as anti-currency, a feature of the yellow metal that strongly came to the fore in 2009.         
	Thus, the near term outlook of gold price remains strong till the ailing economies of the developed nations get back firmly on the growth track.        
	In the domestic market, however, the price movement of gold will largely depend on the exchange rate of the Indian currency vis-a-vis the US dollar.         
	If the Indian rupee continues to appreciate against the US dollar, the rupee price of gold wont rise as much as in dollar terms. Besides, the pull-out of foreign institutional investors has so far been limited only to equity and debt markets after the Greece crisis surfaced. We have not yet seen them pulling out of gold ETFs. When that happens, the price of gold ETFs will start coming down.         
	Equity status        
	The domestic equity markets are peculiarly positioned at present.         
	While the yield on the benchmark 10-year government securities is hovering around 7.5 per cent, the earnings from sensex is ruling at around 5 per cent.         
	This means that while you can earn a risk-free return of 7.5 per cent by investing in a 10-year G-sec paper, your investment in equities will earn you a return of only 5 per cent.         
	Given the fact that equities are risky investments, investors will ask for a risk premium. In other words, the return from equities should be greater than or equal to the yield on G-sec (risk-free investment) to make equity investments a viable option.        
	Some experts argue that unlike a debt instruments coupon interest rate that remains fixed for the tenure of the security, the earnings per share (EPS) of a stock has an implicit element of growth.         
	In the January-March quarter, many companies have positively surprised with their earnings results. Given that the GDP growth is expected to be around 8 per cent this year, we shall definitely see corporate earnings being upgraded, said Arindam Ghosh, CEO of Mirae Asset Management (India).        
	Even considering a 20 per cent earnings growth for companies in 2010, the sensex is trading at a price that is nearly 16 times its EPS.         
	At this EPS, the yield (the inverse of the price to earnings multiple) works out at 6.25 per cent, which is still at a significant discount to a 10-year G-sec yield.         
	It shows that equity prices are overvalued and the sensex has to come down to 15000 (where its earnings yield will be equal to the yield of 10-year G-sec) if the investment has to make any value proposition.        
	Debt show        
	The RBI has announced measures to ease the pressure of liquidity in the banking system that may crop up in the face of the governments borrowing programme and the 3G spectrum auction.         
	Interest rates are likely to go up in the second half of the financial year with increased credit demand from companies as well as households. If the interest rates go up, the price of bond/debt instruments will fall.        
	The factors favouring high returns for monthly income plans are short to medium term in nature. So, these schemes can be a safe bet for two to three years.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: The government has tempered its higher growth projection for the fiscal with a warning on the uncertainties dogging European nations that can not only affect Indian exports but also slow down the flow of foreign investments.        
	According to the mid-year analysis of the economy, the growth projection is in the region of 8.40 per cent to 9.10 per cent (8.75 per cent plus or minus 0.35 per cent) against 8.25 per cent to 8.75 per cent made by the Economic Survey in February.        
	It is estimated that growth in 2010-11 will be 8.40-9.10 per cent. The range indicates the possibility of crossing the 9-per-cent-mark this year itself, but is wider than the earlier estimate owing to higher risk factors, which includes the economic situation in the euro area turning for the worse, the report said.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, after presenting the review in Parliament, told newspersons that the wider range was because of weaknesses in the euro zone where some governments had to seek bailouts from global development banks and the European Union.         
	One of the reasons (for a wider range) is there have been certain uncertainties like the recovery of the euro. And Europe has relevance from the viewpoint of FDI, investment and from external trade, particularly exports, he said.        
	Mukherjee said a rapid and robust recovery in Europe was important as a sizeable percentage of Indian exports go to Europe.        
	However, the review listed many positives on the domestic front that could push the growth beyond 9 per cent.        
	It sees the economy growing at a faster pace in the last two quarters of the current financial year, driven by strong manufacturing and services growth along with good winter crop.        
	Abundant late rains are boosting farm growth, while higher consumer spending and falling inflation rates are very encouraging signs.        
	Agricultural activities are in full swing across the country and productivity is likely to witness an improvement on the back of a normal monsoon this year even though the acreage under cultivation will remain the same.        
	Buoyant revenues are expected to keep the budget deficit in check at 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) as government spending goes up.        
	The review sees food inflation at 19.95 per cent and fuel inflation at 10.29 per cent. However, manufacturing inflation at 4.95 per cent should bring overall inflation down to 8.98 per cent.        
	Capital flows into the country in the first half of the fiscal were $37.4 billion against total inflows of $53.6 billion in the previous fiscal.         
	A booming stock market has ensured that foreign funds park their money here instead of in western bourses.         
	However, this has raised the value of the rupee.         
	The appreciating rupee can have adverse impact on the earnings of exporters and makes exports less competitive, the mid-year analysis said.

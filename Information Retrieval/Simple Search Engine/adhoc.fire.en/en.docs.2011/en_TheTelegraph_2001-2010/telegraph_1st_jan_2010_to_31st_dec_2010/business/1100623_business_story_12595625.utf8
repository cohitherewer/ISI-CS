The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Birlas launch fresh offensive
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Birlas launch fresh offensive
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 22: Rameshwara Jute Mills Ltd, a company controlled by the Birlas, has slapped criminal cases against Birla Corporation and its chairman Harsh V. Lodha before the chief metropolitan magistrate, Calcutta, opening a fresh front in the battle of bequeath for the MP Birla empire.        
	The chief metropolitan magistrate said there had been sufficient grounds to proceed in the case under various sections.        
	In its complaint, Rameshwara said Birla Corp had set up an elaborate money market business as big as its core cement business without seeking approval from shareholders through a change in the memorandum of association.        
	The Birla outfit, a shareholder of Birla Corp, contended that such an elaborate business, akin to a non-banking finance company, could not be run without changes in the memorandum of association.        
	So far, Birla Corp has not sought any such change, which requires permission from shareholders.        
	The objects clause of Birla Corps memorandum of association has no mention of money market/treasury operations, trading in finance, arbitrage in money market and NBFC, the complaint said.        
	Observers said the criminal case heralded heightened legal activity from the side of the Birla family, which failed to actively pursue various cases against Harsh Lodha to oust him from Birla Corp, the flagship of the MP Birla empire, and eventually take pole position in the will case.        
	The Birlas recently suffered a jolt at the Company Law Board when its bid to stop the AGM failed. It also could not prevent Lodha from becoming a director and, thereby, chairman.        
	Harsh Lodhas father late Rajendra S. Lodha sought probate of a will made by Priyamvada Birla where he was both the executor and beneficiary.         
	The Birlas later furnished another will claiming the estate will go to charity.        
	Clearing Corp membership        
	Rameshwara also said that Birla Corp had even taken the membership of Clearing Corporation of India Limited to deal on the CBLO (collateralised borrowings amp; lending obligations) platform.

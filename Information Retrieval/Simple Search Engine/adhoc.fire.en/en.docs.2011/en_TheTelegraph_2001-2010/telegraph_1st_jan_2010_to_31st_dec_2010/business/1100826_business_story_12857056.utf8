          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 25: Great Eastern Energy Corporation Ltd (GEECL), the first Indian company to commercially produce and sell coal bed methane (CBM), has achieved break-even in June.        
	The company, which produces CBM at Raniganj in Bengal, is expected to post a net profit for the first time since commencing production in 2007.        
	The Y.K. Modi company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, produces 3.7 million cubic feet of gas per day and supplies to around 20 units in the Asansol-Durgapur belt. It also sells CBM as compressed natural gas (CNG) through the petrol pumps of state-run oil retailers such as Indian Oil in the region.         
	Prashant Modi, president of GEECL, said the company had bettered last fiscals turnover in the first quarter of this financial year itself.         
	The company plans to ramp up production and will deploy a second rig by November. It has set a target of 100-120 million cubic feet of gas per day. Great Eastern Energy has invested Rs 700 crore in Bengal and intends to pump in another Rs 1500-2,000 crore. It has opened 75 wells and plans to open another 300 in the future.        
	The firm had planned an initial public offering in India and submitted a draft red herring prospectus to Sebi, which took 10 months to clear the proposal. By then it had raised $30 million in London by issuing fresh shares.         
	After the overseas financing, there is no need for an IPO now. We will list here but have not decided on the time, Modi said.        
	Permission delay        
	GEECLs plan to expand its CNG network has hit a bureaucratic hurdle in Bengal. The company uses five petrol pumps of PSU oil firms to sell fuel to autos. Its application to sell at a BPCL outlet in Durgapur is lying at the district magistrates office for six months. It has been cleared by the chief controller of explosives, which looks after safety issues. The firm needs a licence from the district magistrates office to sell the gas.         
	Till now, GEECL has never faced any problem in getting state approval after receiving certificates from the chief controller of explosives.

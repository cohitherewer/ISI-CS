                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Audit report blames Raja
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Vinod Rai (left) in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: In a huge embarrassment to the UPA, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has held telecom minister A. Raja responsible for selling second generation (2G) spectrum at lower than market rates in 2008, causing a loss of over Rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer.        
	The CAG report on the alleged telecom scam says Raja ignored the advice of the finance ministry, the law ministry and the Telecom Commission while allocating the spectrum in an arbitrary manner.         
	Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha plunged into turmoil today over the issue. A united Opposition is set to embarrass the government in the Rajya Sabha tomorrow by seeking the removal of Raja.         
	All Opposition parties have given notices for a motion on the removal of Raja, whose DMK party is a key constituent of the Congress-led government at the Centre.         
	The Congress, on its part, has put the ball in DMKs court to decide on Rajas future.         
	While we assert that it is the Prime Ministers prerogative to decide upon his council of ministers, we will also keep in mind the coalition dharma, party spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan told reporters.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to take a decision on Rajas continuation in the Union cabinet after his return from the G20 meet in Seoul on Friday, sources said today.        
	The CAG report has been submitted to the President and the finance ministry, who will take a decision soon.         
	Yes, we have submitted the final report to the government. I cannot disclose the findings of the report. It is up to the government when it will be tabled in Parliament... may be within a fortnight or it may take long, said Vinod Rai, comptroller and auditor general of India.         
	The CAG report said the price at which spectrum was allotted in 2008 was based on 2001 rates, which were quite low and had resulted in a loss to the exchequer.        
	Nine firms were issued licences, bundled with start up 2G spectrum, in January 2008 at Rs 1,658 crore for pan-India operations.        
	The auditor has also slammed the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India for not stepping in to prevent the irregularities.        
	The telecom ministry had, however, hit back at the CAG saying policy decisions cannot be assailed as arbitrary and refuted CAGs claim that spectrum was allocated in an arbitrary manner.        
	The Supreme Court had on October 29 pulled up the CBI, saying the agency was making tardy progress in its investigations.

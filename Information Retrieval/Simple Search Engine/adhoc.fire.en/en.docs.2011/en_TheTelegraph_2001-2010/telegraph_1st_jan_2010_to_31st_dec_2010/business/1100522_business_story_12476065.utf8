The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BSNL bids give China a miss
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      BSNL bids give China a miss
                            
	New Delhi, May 21 (PTI): BSNL will invite bids to acquire 5.5 million lines  to expand GSM operations  from three foreign vendors that had participated in the aborted 93-million-line tender, leaving out Chinese bidders such as Huawei and ZTE.        
	A special board meeting of the PSU decided on the vendors today, senior officials said. The three vendors are Ericsson, Nokia-Siemens Network and Alcatel-Lucent.         
	BSNL refused to comment on its decision to exclude Chinese firms, but sources said getting security clearances was the primary reason.        
	Huawei was a winner in one of the regions in the earlier tender.        
	Asked why the tender had been reduced to a small quantity, they said it was for immediate requirement.        
	BSNL had cancelled the 93-million-line tender amid controversies that the process lacked competition and that the PSU did not require that kind of capacity addition at one go.        
	Leading vendor Nokia-Siemens, which was disqualified from participating in the financial bid, had also challenged the decision of the telecom PSU in court.

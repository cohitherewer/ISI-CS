                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ambani peace pact propels group stocks 
          OUR BUREAU                                    Mukesh, Anil: Bourses happy                                  
	Mumbai, May 24: The new deal between the Ambani brothers reached on Sunday  which sought to end acrimonious courtroom battles but ignite healthy competition at the marketplace  boosted the combined shareholder wealth of their five premier listed companies by over Rs 18,000 crore.        
	Investors scooped up shares at various Reliance counters as a wave of euphoria coursed through the bourses, welcoming the decision to scrap a contentious non-competition agreement signed in January 2006 between the two warring groups.         
	The only exception is gas-based power generation  an area where Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has decided not to enter till March 31, 2022.        
	On Monday, RIL  the top-weighted stock in the market-gauging barometers such as the sensex and the Nifty  climbed 2.58 per cent to close at Rs 1,021.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Its market capitalisation swelled to Rs 3,34,034 crore.        
	Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Natural Resources Ltd surged 22.58 per cent to close at Rs 54.55, while Reliance Power was up nearly 8 per cent and ended the day at Rs 149.55.         
	Reliance Communications shot up 10.87 per cent to close at Rs 147.90. Its market capitalisation rose over Rs 2,992 crore to Rs 30,526 crore. Reliance Capital put on nearly 5 per cent at Rs 672.10.        
	The announcement by the Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani groups contributed to the positive sentiment in the morning trade, said Motilal Oswals Jigar Shah.        
	In a company update on Reliance Industries in the morning after the deal, Goldman Sachs said, We believe the new agreement is positive for RIL as it opens up opportunities for growth in new sectors within India. The foreign brokerage expects RIL to generate free cash flow of $18 billion between financial years 2011 and 2014.         
	Goldman Sachs said there was no mention of any cash exchange between RIL and the Anil Ambani group of companies as part of this development. It also spoke of the possibility of RIL co-operating with Anil Ambani group firms or going in for some sort of industry consolidation if the oil and gas major chose to enter competitive businesses such as telecom or financial services.        
	We will not rule the potential for both companies to look into leveraging their complementary experience and exploiting potential synergies in sectors such as telecom, retail, logistics and infrastructure, the note stated.        
	That there could be complementary synergies between the two groups in areas such as RILs logistics business for retail and Anil Ambani groups infrastructure business may be true, but the verdict is still out on whether the two brothers will work together.

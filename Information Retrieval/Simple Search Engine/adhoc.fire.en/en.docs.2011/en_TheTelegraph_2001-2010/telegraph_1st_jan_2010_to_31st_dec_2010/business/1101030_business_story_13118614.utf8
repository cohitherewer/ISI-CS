	Calcutta, Oct. 29: ITC has posted a robust growth in sales and profit in the second quarter, backed by a strong performance in all its business segments, especially tobacco.

	Losses, too, were down at the companys high profile non-tobacco FMCG business, which includes branded packaged food and personal care.        
	Operating profit from non-tobacco business grew 37 per cent in the quarter to Rs 421 crore from Rs 307 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.

	ITC, which completed 100 years on August 24, witnessed improved performances in the hotel, paper and pulp, and agri-commodity businesses.        
	Revenues and profits grew 20 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively, in the hotel segment.         
	The recent investments in paper and pulp capacities and a new product mix drove margin expansion, with segment revenues and profits going up 17 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively.

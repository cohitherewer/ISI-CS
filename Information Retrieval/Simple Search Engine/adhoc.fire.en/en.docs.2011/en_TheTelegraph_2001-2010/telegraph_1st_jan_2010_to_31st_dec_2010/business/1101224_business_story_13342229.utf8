The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New bank norms take shape
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      New bank norms take shape
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 23: Stakeholders of the financial industry seem to have reached a consensus on issuing banking licences to entities that are able to stump up at least Rs 1,000 crore as capital with the possibility of scaling it up to Rs 2,000 crore over a period of three to four years.        
	However, serious reservations regarding the wisdom of issuing unfettered licences to large industrial houses still persist.         
	These form part of the feedback that the Reserve Bank of India has received in response to the discussion paper it brought out in August on the entry of new banks in the private sector.         
	Releasing the comments it has received from industry, the apex bank said there were wide-ranging views, which did not indicate clear consensus on any of the issues.         
	The RBI is expected to scrutinise the feedbacks and come out with its revised guidelines next month.         
	On the minimum capital requirement for new banks, the RBI saw industry and bank associations pitching for a high start-up capital of Rs 1,000 crore, which could go up to Rs 1,500-2,000 crore over a period of time. It is felt that new banks would require high investments in technology for financial inclusion and to expand operations.         
	However, the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) preferred a lower start-up capital of around Rs 300-500 crore. NBFCs feel that a large bank with a capital of Rs 1,000 crore was unlikely to be effective at local lending or financial inclusion. Therefore, the RBI should consider giving restricted licences to about 20 banks with less rigorous capital requirement.         
	Most respondents felt that foreign shareholding should be capped at the current level of 74 per cent. Some favoured the removal of all restrictions, while a few suggested that the apex bank should put a cap of 50 per cent.         
	A wide range of views were expressed on allowing industrial houses to promote banks. Those who were against giving licence to industrial houses expressed concern over connected lending in cases where an entity has a financial licence and is involved in industrial activities.         
	The stakeholders also submitted that the ownership structure of large industrial/business groups may open opportunities or regulatory arbitrage, as the apex entity of a financial conglomerate is unregulated.         
	Yet a few maintained that a couple of industrial houses could initially be allowed to own small banks and their future course should be based on this experience.

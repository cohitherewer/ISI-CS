          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 27: The core sector grew 7.2 per cent in March against 3.3 per cent a year ago, reflecting a firm industrial recovery.        
	The six core industries  crude, petroleum refinery products, coal, electricity, cement and finished steel  had grown 4.7 per cent in February.        
	The trend indicates that the industrial recovery is on a firm ground and the RBI could further increase the interest rate as it fears that inflation could spill over to the overall economy, N.R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy said.        
	Finished steel led the charge by expanding 9.2 per cent and reversing a negative 1.8 per cent growth in March last year.         
	Coal, electricity and cement grew 7.8 per cent each against 5.3 per cent, 6.3 per cent and 10.1 per cent, respectively, in the year-ago period.        
	This (7.2 per cent growth) means overall industrial growth will stay healthy in March, Crisil principal economist D.K. Joshi said.        
	Crude production increased 3.5 per cent from a negative 2.3 per cent.         
	However, petroleum refinery products showed a dismal performance by contracting 0.4 per cent over a positive 3.3 per cent growth a year ago.        
	For 2009-10, the core sector, which has a 26.7 per cent weight in the overall industrial production, grew 5.5 per cent against 3 per cent in the previous fiscal.        
	According to consultancy firm Dun amp; Bradstreet, the economy is expected to expand 8.3 per cent this fiscal, driven by strong industrial and services growth.         
	In February, the index of industrial production grew 15.1 per cent, which was slightly lower than around 16 per cent in January and 17.6 per cent in December.        
	The economy is expected to grow 8.5 per cent in the current fiscal and 9 per cent in the next.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has hinted at a further rollback of stimulus measures.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Next round of oil hunt on way
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Next round of oil hunt on way
          R. SURYAMURTHY                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The government plans to launch the ninth round of oil and gas block auction under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp) later this month. About 50 blocks are likely to be on offer this time.        
	This could be the last round of bidding under Nelp before the government moves to the open acreage licensing policy in 2012, allowing companies to bid for blocks any time of the year.        
	However, there is an uncertainty on tax holiday for gas blocks.         
	We have taken up the issue with the finance ministry. There can be no question of Nelp IX without tax breaks being worked out for gas as well, oil ministry officials said .        
	Lack of clarity on the seven-year tax incentives resulted in a subdued response in the eighth round of bidding. Of the 70 blocks offered under Nelp VIII, only 36 got bids. The government awarded 33 blocks, half of which went to public sector explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation.        
	The 50 blocks on offer under Nelp IX will include those that did not attract any bid in the previous rounds.        
	Analysts expect the government to extend the tax holiday for oil and gas as it did in the previous rounds of bidding. The direct tax code bill has specified that the existing benefits will continue till the new tax code comes into force.        
	Resource potential of the block will be the key factor for attracting investments in exploration and production from now on as the taxation in DTC proposals are similar to global standards, Deloitte Indias Surendra Prakash Singh said.        
	Entities producing mineral oil, including winners of the Nelp VIII and CBM (coal bed methane) IV rounds, are eligible for tax incentives under the current regime and will continue to do so as the benefits will be valid under DTC, analysts said.        
	Since 1997, when the government launched the Nelp, it has awarded 239 blocks.

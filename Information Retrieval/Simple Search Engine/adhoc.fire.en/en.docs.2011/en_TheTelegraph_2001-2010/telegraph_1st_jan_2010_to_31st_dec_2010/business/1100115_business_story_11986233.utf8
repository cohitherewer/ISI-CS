          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: The government is likely to compensate state-owned refiners with cash instead of bonds for selling fuel below cost. The compensation could be worth around Rs 12,000 crore.        
	No decision was taken, petroleum minister Murli Deora said after a meeting with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Most likely, it (subsidy) is going to be cash. Discussions were held and we hope to hear from them soon. No decision had been taken on the amount of compensation, petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey told reporters after the meeting.         
	Sources said the main issue was how much of the revenue loss the government would bear, and there were differences over the extent of the under-recovery. We do want to give subsidy through oil bonds We want to make the system more transparent. We also do not agree with the oil companies calculations of under-recoveries, a finance ministry official said.        
	Sources said oil companies could be compensated with around Rs 12,000 crore in cash for under-recovery on LPG and kerosene for the April-December period.        
	The finance ministry officials said global oil prices had been moderate in the current year. So, the government should pick up one-third of the revenue loss, according to a 2006-07 formula.        
	The petroleum ministry, however, wants the government to honour a commitment made in July of making up for the entire loss on domestic LPG and kerosene. According to the July understanding, the losses on petrol and diesel were to be borne by upstream firms such as ONGC, Oil India and GAIL (India).        
	Losses from the sale of LPG and kerosene are estimated at Rs 20,900 crore for this fiscal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Kingfisher gets okay for debt-equity swap
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Kingfisher gets okay for debt-equity swap
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 25: The board of Kingfisher Airlines today approved a debt recast package under which 30 per cent of the troubled carriers debt of Rs 6,500 crore would be converted into equity.        
	The move follows the RBIs relaxation of its debt restructuring guidelines.        
	Under the plan, debt worth Rs 1,355 crore from lenders and Rs 648 crore from the promoters will be converted into shares of the airline.        
	The move is likely to give a shot in the arm to the private carrier that has been attempting to pare its loans at a time the aviation sector has recovered from a two-year slump.        
	The debt recast also allows the airline to pay back the remaining debt of Rs 4,497 crore to lenders over a nine-year period. This includes a moratorium of two years.         
	Kingfisher has secured a 3.5 per cent reduction in interest rates to 11 per cent, the airline spokesperson said.        
	Kingfisher said the package also included a sanction of additional fund and non-fund based facilities by the lenders.         
	While board sanction has been received from several lenders, the same is shortly expected from the others. The debt recast package is subject to the execution of necessary documentation, it said. After the debt recast is completed, the airline is likely to go in for a $250-million global depository receipts (GDR) issue.         
	While Kingfisher Airlines chairman Vijay Mallya had said the airline would start the GDR process once the debt recast was through, the spokesperson declined to comment on the companys plans to pursue this route to raise additional funds and bring down debt further.        
	AI chiefs SMS to unions        
	Arvind Jadhav, the chief of the beleaguered Air India, has solicited the support of the unions to wriggle out of the crisis through an SMS and asked them to tell the media that the employees would put in their best.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sunset clause for base rate switch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhatt: For change                                  
	Mumbai, July 12: All loans linked to the old benchmark prime lending rates are likely to be linked to base rates within a year.        
	The Reserve Bank of India is examining the possibility of introducing a sunset clause for loans taken under the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) system.        
	The sunset clause is one of the suggestions given by bankers to the RBI, which is learnt to be in favour of the proposal.         
	The issue was raised today by senior bankers at a meeting with the RBI ahead of its July 27 monetary policy.        
	After meeting RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn and other top officials of the central bank, SBI chairman . P. Bhatt said the RBI was considering a sunset clause with a one-year deadline. An announcement may be made soon.        
	Yes, they are going to announce (the decision on sunset clause). The RBI is currently examining the clause (with a deadline) of one yearthat is by June 30 next year, Bhatt said.        
	He said the SBI would wait for the central banks monetary policy on July 27 before changing its interest rates.         
	Banks have already migrated to the base rate regime with effect from July 1. The base rate is the minimum lending rate that banks can charge their customers for loans given after July 1.         
	Credit growth        
	At the meeting with the RBI today, the bankers were optimistic of credit growth touching 20 per cent under base rates compared with 16.5 per cent last year.         
	With all the available parameters there, it (credit growth) will be definitely better than last year, Bhatt said.         
	The Reserve Bank expects both credit and deposit growth to be 20 per cent in the current fiscal.

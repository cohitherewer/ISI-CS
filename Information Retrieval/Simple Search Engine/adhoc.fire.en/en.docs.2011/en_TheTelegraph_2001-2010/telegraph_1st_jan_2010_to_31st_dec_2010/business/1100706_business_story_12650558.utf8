	New Delhi, July 5: Telecom operators have urged the government to charge zero goods and services tax (GST) on mobile equipment to encourage local manufacturing.        
	Encouragement to local production is necessary in the wake of security concerns over foreign equipment particularly those from China.        
	Service providers also want GST to include all telecom infrastructure and equipment to ensure complete elimination of the cascading effect of indirect taxes.        
	At present, in addition to the service tax, the sector is saddled with several other charges and levies, including a 10 per cent excise duty on telecom equipment.        
	To eliminate the cascading effect of indirect taxes such as excise duty, VAT, service tax, the government must implement GST in India at the earliest so that telecom equipment become cheaper for the end-user, said Bharti Airtel in a written communication to telecom regulator Trai.        
	GST, which will replace the excise duty and service tax at the central level and value-added tax at the state level, besides the cess, surcharges and local taxes, is expected to be implemented from the next fiscal year.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is meeting state finance ministers on July 21 to discuss constitutional amendments needed to roll out GST.        
	Operators said the lack of subsidies to local manufacturing in the country is a major hurdle, which has led to a dependence on foreign vendors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Japanese stake in Tata Steel arm
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Japanese stake in Tata Steel arm
          SAMBIT SAHA                                             
	Calcutta, Jan. 24: Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK), one of the worlds largest logistic groups, has picked up a strategic stake in Tata Steel subsidiary TM International Ltd.        
	The Japanese major has bought 26 per cent in the Calcutta-headquartered company that operates a berth at Haldia, runs charter ships and handles bulk cargo such as coal for Tata Steel and other customers.        
	The Tatas hold a 51 per cent stake in the company  set up in 2002  with IQ Martrade of Germany holding the rest. NYK has come in as a shareholder after buying equity from IQ Martrade.        
	Dibyendu Bose, managing director of TM International, confirmed the development. Yes, NYK has become a shareholder and its representatives have joined our board, Bose told The Telegraph.        
	The value of the deal between Martrade and NYK is kept under the wraps. Bose declined to comment on the deal value, saying the transaction was between two shareholders.        
	Besides Bose, there are four representatives from Tata Steel on the TM International board. IQ Martrade and NYK have two members each. Tata Steel managing director Hemant Nerurkar is the chairman. This is the second time that the Japanese major is joining hands with Tata Steel, the worlds eighth largest steel producer and extensive user of port and shipping lines because of its need for raw materials such as coal, iron ore and limestone.        
	A few years ago, Tata Steel and NYK formed a 50:50 joint venture called Tata NYK Shipping Pte Ltd based in Singapore mainly to cater to the needs of Tata Steel and other Tata group companies. It operates nine ships.        
	The synergies between the two companies will only grow now that NYK has picked up a stake in TM International.        
	For instance, TM International, which has so far followed an asset-light strategy, is buying three tugs for Rs 120 crore. This is a prelude to its entry into port management services. The company initially acquired the right to operate berth 12 at Haldia. Later, it extended operations to Paradip as well.         
	Looking forward        
	TM International has now big plans for Dhamra, the deep water port being built by Tata Steel and L amp;T. The port, located between Paradip and Haldia in the Bay of Bengal, is likely to start operations in the middle of 2010.         
	TM International may bid for port management services that include tug operations. If Dhamra allows private parties to operate berths, the company is likely to participate.        
	It handled seven million tonnes of cargo last year at Haldia and Paradip, while shipping accounted for another three million tonnes of business in 2008-09. This is expected to increase this year.        
	TM International does not own any ship now but it operates 10 ships under long-term charters.         
	The company clocked a turnover of Rs 125.47 crore in the last fiscal and earned a net profit of Rs 10.08 crore. It has an equity base of Rs 18 crore. Market experts estimate the companys valuation at Rs 400 crore.

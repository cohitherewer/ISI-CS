                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      UltraTech to buy Dubai firm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Birla: Expansion mode                                  
	Mumbai, April 29: AV Birla group company UltraTech Cement is acquiring Dubai-based ETA Star Cement Company for Rs 1,700 crore. The acquisition will give the company access to markets in West Asia and Bangladesh.        
	UltraTech, which is set to buy the cement business of group company Grasim Industries, will get management control of ETA Star Cement.         
	UltraTech chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said the acquisition was in line with the groups long-term strategy of expanding its global business. The acquisition of ETA Star Cement marks the entry of the Aditya Birla groups cement unit into West Asia, he added.        
	The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this quarter.        
	ETA Star has a 2.3-million-tonne (mt) clinker plant and a 2mt grinding plant in the United Arab Emirates. It also has 0.4mt and 0.5mt grinding units in Bahrain and Bangladesh, respectively. The company is promoted by the ETA group, which is a UAE conglomerate involved in the engineering, construction, shipping, commodity trading, property development and retail businesses. The acquisition will be funded through a mix of debt and equity.        
	The announcement comes on a day UltraTech reported disappointing results for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2010. Net profit came down to Rs 228.54 crore from Rs 309.46 crore in the year-ago quarter. Net sales, however, rose to Rs 1,909.35 crore from Rs 1,860.13 crore.        
	On the prospects of the cement business in the current year, UltraTech said significant capacity addition might lead to surplus. With capacity utilisation expected to be around 80 per cent, prices may come under pressure. However, initiatives in infrastructure and housing will benefit the industry and demand is expected to grow over 10 per cent in the long term, the company added.

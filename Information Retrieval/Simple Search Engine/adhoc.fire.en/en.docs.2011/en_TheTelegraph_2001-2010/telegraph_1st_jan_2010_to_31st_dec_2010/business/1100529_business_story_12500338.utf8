	Tokyo/Munich, May 28 (Reuters): Diehard fans mobbed Apple Inc stores in Europe and Asia as the iPad went on sale outside the United States on Friday, with some shoppers having queued all night to buy one of the coveted tablet computers.        
	The device, a little smaller than a regular notebook computer and with an open, colour touchscreen, is designed for surfing the Web, watching movies and reading, and has been hailed by the publishing industry as a potential life-saver.        
	Apple has sold a million iPads in the US since its April 3 debut, exceeding even the most bullish pre-launch estimates. Demand was so heavy the company had to delay the international roll-out by a month.        
	RBC Capital Markets estimated iPads total shipments will reach 8.13 million units worldwide by the end of the year  which would translate into at least $4 billion in revenue.        
	I wanted to touch it as soon as possible. I felt real excitement when it was finally in my hands, said Takechiyo Yamanaka, 19, who had camped out in front of Tokyos flagship Apple store from Wednesday evening to be the first in line.        
	Its a bit of a gut decision, an emotional decision, because its not really rationally justifiable, said Anna Kistner as she emerged from the Apple store in Munich, Germany with two iPads. Its a lot of money.        
	The iPad is now on sale in Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Britain, Japan, Australia and Canada.        
	Prices for the cheapest, Wi-Fi only version range from $499 in the United States to the equivalent of $617 in Britain.        
	The buzz around the iPad helped propel Apple past Microsoft this week to become the worlds most valuable technology stock, marking a remarkable turnaround of a company that nearly went out of business in the 1990s.         
	Apple is yet to announce a launch date for mainland China, which could prove a much more difficult market to crack. Bootleg versions of the gadget are being snapped up online and in retail malls in the piracy-prone country.        
	However, there is some concern that Apple, which contracts out the production of the device and depends on numerous parts suppliers, may not be able to supply enough of the device.

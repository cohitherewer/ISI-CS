The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Good rains to boost FMCG prospects
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Good rains to boost FMCG prospects

	Mumbai, June 13: Firms in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry are hoping the forecast for normal rains holds good as this will lead to both strong sales and cost reductions.        
	Analysts said FMCG industry growth would accelerate significantly in the second half of this fiscal if rains were normal.        
	A good rainfall is expected to cool down inflation, thereby increasing the purchasing power of individuals and improving volume growth. Amnish Aggarwal and Nikhil Kumar, FMCG analysts with Motilal Oswal, in a recent research note, said, The monsoon can be a big turning point for the FMCG sectors growth in this year. We believe the growth of FMCGs can accelerate significantly from the second half of 2010-11 as the benefits of lower input costs and inflation, and higher income kick in.         
	An analyst with another brokerage who did not wish to be identified also said that a good rainfall this year would see demand perking up.        
	The drought last year, which led to high food inflation, had resulted in FMCG companies witnessing a lower volume growth and a shift to cheaper rivals in categories such as soaps, detergents and shampoo. This came across as high food inflation affected purchasing power, particularly at the lower end of the income segment.        
	Some hiccups        
	Though a normal monsoon is expected to benefit the sector as a whole, the impact could vary within the industry.         
	Aggarwal and Kumar said companies who use agricultural inputs would be in a better position than others where the proportion of crude-based inputs was high.         
	Since a good rainfall is likely to bring down the prices of several agricultural commodities, it is felt that companies such as Britannia, Nestle, Dabur and GSK Consumer will gain as the prices of inputs such as sugar, wheat, flour soften.         
	The monsoon will be largely neutral for Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and Asian Paints because they use a higher proportion of crude-based inputs, the analysts said, adding that the price of crude-based inputs have limited scope of softening unlike agricultural inputs.         
	HUL may face other challenges as well. Price cuts in categories such as detergents and shampoos because of tough competition, particularly from new entrants (who are using prices to make their mark), will restrict any major attempts to raise prices.        
	Besides, margins may also come under pressure as companies will have to resort to higher ad spends and costs to face competition.

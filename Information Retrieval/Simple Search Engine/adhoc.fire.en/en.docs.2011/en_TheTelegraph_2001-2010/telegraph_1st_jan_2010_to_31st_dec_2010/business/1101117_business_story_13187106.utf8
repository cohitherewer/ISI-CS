The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cairn Energy in deal doubt
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cairn Energy in deal doubt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Awaiting approval                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 16: Cairn Energy Plc appears to have a wrinkle of doubt over whether it will be able to close the deal with Anil Agarwals Vedanta Resources on the sale of its stake in its Indian outfit.        
	Observers said Cairn appeared to be showing its first signs of uncertainty after a senior executive of the Edinburgh-based oil explorer said the deal was not done till it was completed.        
	Mike Watts, deputy CEO of Cairn Energy, said on the sidelines of a conference in London today that we can never say never until the ball crosses the line. He was, however, quick to add that the parent expected to secure approvals for the sale of its majority stake in Cairn India to the Vedanta group by the first quarter (January-March) of 2011.        
	Cairn Energy is selling 40-51 per cent out of its 62.38 per cent stake in Cairn India to London-listed Vedanta Resources for $8.48 billion.         
	The deal, announced on August 16, is yet to win the approval from the regulator or its partner, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which holds 30 per cent in Cairn Indias main oil asset in Rajasthan.        
	ONGC has claimed that it has pre-emption right, or the right of first refusal on Cairn Indias assets. Cairn Energy has, on the other hand, been asserting that the corporation has a pre-emptive right for an asset sale and not in terms of a corporate sale and, therefore, ONGC does not have a first right of refusal in the transaction with Vedanta as it did not involve the transfer of an asset.        
	Watts further added that if anything were to happen, it doesnt change the fact that it is a hell of a good project, which perhaps indicates that the deal not going through would not be a bad thing after all as the Rajasthan oilfields, the main asset of Cairn India, have huge prospects.        
	Obviously there are processes to go through. We have got approval (for the deal) from (our) shareholders and we are waiting for Vedanta shareholders to give their approval and there is the process in India to go through in terms or approvals and consents, he said.        
	Sesa Goa, the Vedanta group firm, which intends to make an open offer to acquire an additional 20 per cent stake in Cairn India, missed the October deadline as the Securities and Exchange Board of India has not yet given its approval for the offer.

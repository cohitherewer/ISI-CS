	New Delhi, March 24 (PTI): G.R. Gopinath, credited with heralding the low-cost carrier model in the country, today stepped down from the board of Kingfisher Airlines.        
	G.R. Gopinath and K.J. Samuel have resigned as directors, Kingfisher said.        
	Gopinath was appointed vice-chairman of Kingfisher Airlines after the latter took a controlling stake in his budget airline Deccan Aviation.        
	Gopinath has started an express transportation and logistics company  Deccan 360  where he is chairman and managing director. Last year, Gopinath offloaded his stake in Kingfisher, cutting it down to 0.32 per cent by September.

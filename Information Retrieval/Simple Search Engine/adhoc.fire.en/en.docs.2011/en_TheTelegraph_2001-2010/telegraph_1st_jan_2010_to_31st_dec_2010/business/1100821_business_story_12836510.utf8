The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hint of more income tax relief 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Hint of more income tax relief 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      S.S.N. Moorthy, chairman, the Central Board of Direct Taxes                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: Taxpayers could get additional relief after the proposed overhaul of the countrys tax laws, the chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes said today.         
	The finance ministry will further bring down slabs on direct taxes to widen its tax base and make the tax administration user friendly for all stakeholders. The direct taxes code (DTC) is a good example in this direction, said S.S.N. Moorthy, chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).        
	At present, individuals do not have to pay tax on annual income of up to Rs 1,60,000, and the draft direct taxes code unveiled in August last year had kept this figure intact.         
	The DTC bill is likely to be tabled in this session of Parliament so that it can replace the income tax act from April 1, 2011.         
	In the first DTC draft, the government had proposed a substantial widening of the tax slabs. It had suggested imposing 10 per cent tax on income of Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, 20 per cent on income of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 25 lakh and 30 per cent beyond Rs 25 lakh in a year.         
	The tax slabs were substantially broader than those in Budget 2010-11. The budget imposed a 10 per cent tax on income of Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, 20 per cent on Rs 5 lakh to Rs 8 lakh and 30 per cent on over Rs 8 lakh in a year.         
	Earlier, the slabs were Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 3 lakh, Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh and over Rs 5 lakh in a year. Women and senior citizens enjoy greater relief.        
	The second draft said the rates proposed in the first draft could be calibrated, while giving significant reprieve to individual taxpayers by retaining the tax exemption for long-term saving schemes and delinking valuation of perks from market rates.         
	Collections on track        
	Moorthy said that direct tax collections of Rs 4.3 lakh crore for the current fiscal were on track.         
	The target for the current year is about Rs 4.30 lakh crore. Fortunately we are on track. We are growing at the rate of 15 per cent, he said.         
	He said tax deduction at source, which constitutes a major chunk of direct tax, was not adequate but it would pick up. This year we are going at the (TDS) rate of about 37.5 per cent, which is not adequate enough but anyway it will pick up.         
	Last year, TDS collection was around 38 per cent of the total revenue at Rs 1.40 lakh crore.        
	ELSS benefit         
	Sebi and mutual fund houses have asked the finance ministry to continue with the tax benefits on equity linked schemes.        
	The revised DTC draft, based on which the government is finalising the bill, has proposed to do away with the benefits available in equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS).        
	Under the income tax act, investments up to Rs 1 lakh in ELSS and dividends accrued on them are exempted from tax.         
	Besides, there is no long-term capital gains tax on withdrawal of the funds after the three-year lock-in period.        
	Sources said Sebi and the mutual fund industry had written to the finance ministry to continue with the current exemption, as the industry was witnessing redemption pressure after the entry-load ban, a type of agent commission that was charged from investors.        
	Withdrawals in July from ESS were Rs 139 crore.         
	At present, there are over 40 ELSS schemes and in 2009-10, mutual funds sold ELSS units of over Rs 3,000 crore.

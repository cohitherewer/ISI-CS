          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 18: Strides Arcolab will buy out South African company Aspen Pharmacares stakes in their two oncology joint ventures for $117 million.         
	Bangalore-based Strides has raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for 2010, following the restructuring of the joint ventures.        
	The joint entities are Onco Therapies, India, and Onco Laboratories Ltd, Cyprus. According to Strides, Aspen Global Inc will sell 50 per cent stakes in the joint ventures. Oncology relates to the treatment of tumours.        
	Strides, however, will give the licence for existing and future oncology products to Pharmacare Ltd, an Aspen Group company, in certain regions.         
	Strides is ramping up manufacturing and development facilities of its specialities business. It has set up sterile assets in India and Europe and acquired the Campos facility in Brazil, besides taking full control of the oncology ventures.         
	While the restructuring of the oncology arrangements with Aspen provides Strides greater focus and ownership of a key domain in our specialities division, we are delighted to strengthen our existing partnership with Aspen by entering into a licensing agreement in territories where Aspen has established distribution, Arun Kumar, vice-chairman of Strides, said.        
	In its revised guidance for 2010, Strides has projected a 35-37 per cent growth in revenues in the range of Rs 1,775-1,825 crore against the earlier guidance of a 25-30 per cent increase in February.        
	News of the revised guidance led to the Strides share firming up on the stock exchanges today. On the BSE, the scrip ended higher by 3.55 per cent at Rs 339.40.

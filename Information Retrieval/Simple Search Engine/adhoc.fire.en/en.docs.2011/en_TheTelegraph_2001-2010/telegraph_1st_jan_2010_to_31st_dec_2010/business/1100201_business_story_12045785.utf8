                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Mutual affection
                                I want to invest in mutual funds through stock brokers. I came to know that I must have a depository account for such investment. How can I open a demat account in a rural area? Is it possible to make transactions personally in the depository account?          Swapan Kumar Mandal, Howrah
                    It is not true that you must have a demat account to buy or sell MFs through stock exchanges. You can do it through physical mode. The stock broker will give you the option. In the case of redemption of units through physical mode, the money will be directly credited to your bank account. Almost all banks have offer demat facilities. Even brokerage firms provide demat accounts.                                   Place change      I was employed in Bhilai. So I used to file my IT returns there. Now I have shifted to Calcutta after retirement. I am a senior citizen and have a PAN card. My income from interest on fixed deposits is above the basic exemption limit. I am filing my IT returns at Bhilai. Is it ok?        S.K. Mallik, Calcutta
                    You can change your IT ward/circle from Bhilai to Calcutta. From the website www.incometaxindia.gov.in, you will know the jurisdiction of your IT ward/circle.Meet the assessing officer there and get your address changed.                                  Clear your doubt      I had deposited Rs 4 lakh in a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme in 2005. I used to submit Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source as my annual income was less than the basic exemption limit. The deposit comes up for maturity this year. I was told that tax would be deducted at source as I didnt submit the annual income tax return. What should I do?        Sushil Kumar Basu, Khardah
                    ce your annual income is less than the basic exemption limit, there is no question of filing annual income tax return. Tax will be deducted at source if you have not submitted Form 15H before the interest is credited to your account. Talk to a senior official of the post office.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Microsoft drags Motorola to court
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Microsoft drags Motorola to court
                              Battle begins                            
	Seattle, Oct. 2 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp. has sued Motorola Inc, alleging patent infringement on the handset makers line of Android phones, in the latest development in a web of legal actions in the evolving smartphone business.        
	Microsoft, the worlds largest software company, charged that former ally Motorola infringed nine of its patents in the Android-based smartphones, which run on software built by Google Inc.        
	Microsoft makes its own Windows phone software, which it charges handset makers to use in their phones. Motorola, like some rivals, has shifted towards Googles free Android as a more attractive option, straining the relationship between the two companies.        
	The suits come 10 days before Microsoft launches the new version of its mobile software, which it hopes will win back market share from Apple Incs iPhone and Google.        
	The patents in question relate to synchronising email, calendars and contacts, scheduling meetings and notifying applications of changes in signal strength and battery power, Microsoft said.        
	A Motorola spokesperson said the company had not yet received a copy of the suit, but based on its strong intellectual property portfolio, plans to vigorously defend itself.        
	Google said it was disappointed with Microsofts move, which it claimed would threaten innovation in the sector. While we are not a party to this lawsuit, we stand behind the Android platform and the partners who have helped us to develop it, the company said.

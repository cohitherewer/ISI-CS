The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL, Posco in stake tussle
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SAIL, Posco in stake tussle
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          S.K Roongta, chairman of SAIL                                  
	New Delhi, May 26: Steel Authority of India Ltd wants its planned joint venture with Posco to be a 50:50 one, while the Korean steel maker will not transfer its proprietary Finex steel making technology to a company where it does not have majority stake.        
	We have sought a 50:50 stake, they (Posco) will prefer a majority stake, said SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta, who had earlier this month visited Korea to discuss the joint venture. This is, however, not holding back the negotiations ... there are a few issues which we are resolving.         
	Roongta, who has completed four years as chairman and managing director of the Indian steel giant and is slated to retire by the end of this month, said, Their Finex technology converts iron ore fines to make special steel. Talks are on ... till now Korea has not parted with this technology. But these involve government-to-government negotiations.        
	SAIL will give the joint venture  which will annually make 1.5 million tonnes of specialised steel  land at Bokaro, besides high-grade iron ore fines from its mines in Jharkhand.         
	At present, SAIL does not put the fines it churns out as a residue of iron ore mining to much use. Among other things, the state-run steel maker owns a huge hill of 35 million tonnes of iron ore fines at Gua, one of its oldest mines.         
	Indian iron ore, with over 60 per cent iron content, was sold for as high as $193 a tonne in global markets in April. This would put the value of the Gua dump alone at nearly $700 million.        
	According to Roongta, SAIL has its own plans for using the fines. We will go ahead with a pelletisation plant soon, the chief executive said.         
	SAIL has plans to set up two pelletisation plants  one each in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. Sources said the plants could cost Rs 2,500 crore each.         
	Pellets can be readily used by SAILs steel plants though they do not have the technology to use fines in large quantities as yet.         
	SAIL has significant iron ore reserves to satisfy its needs in the short term, but in the long run it needs to ramp up ore sources to feed its steel mills.         
	In internal notes sent to the Centre, the PSU had estimated it would face a shortfall of 2.3 billion tonnes of iron ore in the future to feed its expansion and would need to find new mines.        
	Under Roongta, SAIL had been planning for the future. Use of iron ore fines is part of a strategy that the chief executive had drawn up for SAIL.        
	We have to shift our focus from operational aspects to strategising our raw material needs. We have to plan 30-40 years ahead. Steel makers that can secure raw material resources for the long run will continue to be profitable, Roongta said.

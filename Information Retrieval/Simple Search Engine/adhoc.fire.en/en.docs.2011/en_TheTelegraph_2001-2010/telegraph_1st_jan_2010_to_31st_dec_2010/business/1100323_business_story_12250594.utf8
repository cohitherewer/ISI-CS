The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ICICI gets full Singapore rights
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ICICI gets full Singapore rights
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 22: ICICI Bank has secured all approvals for a full banking licence in Singapore.        
	It will be the second entity after the State Bank of India to launch full banking services in the city state.        
	The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)  the central bank  has granted qualified full banking (QFB) privileges to the private sector bank.        
	This essentially means that ICICI Bank can now offer the full suite of products. It can also accept deposits, give loans, and establish branches and ATMs in 25 locations in Singapore.        
	The private bank may not establish all these branches in one go and that a phased approach is likely to be taken up. The first branch may come up within the next six months, according to sources. Though ICICI Bank now has a branch in Singapore, it offers financial solutions to corporates with India linkages that include international loan syndication and trade finance apart from wealth management products and treasury operations.        
	The Singapore branch was the first overseas branch of ICICI Bank. The MAS had granted ICICI Bank a licence to transact banking business in Singapore from August 2003.        
	We are delighted to receive this approval since it will further strengthen our footprint in the corporate, commercial, wealth management and direct banking services in Singapore. We expect to see significant increase in our client base in the region having strong India connections, Chanda Kochhar, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, said.        
	The State Bank of India was the first bank from India to get the QFB licence in March 2008. The nationalised bank now has seven branches and around 13 ATMs in Singapore and it offers a host of products that include deposits, mortgage, loans against deposits and remittances apart from bancassurance and trade finance.        
	The two banks received approvals to set up branches in the city state under the terms of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with Singapore that was signed in 2005. This allows three banks from Singapore to set up branches in India. Three Indian banks will in turn receive QFB privileges in the city state.         
	For ICICI Bank, which has a strong international book (overseas branches contribute around 26 per cent of its loan book), the MAS approval comes at a time the global economy is showing signs of a strong revival. This is expected to benefit entities such as ICICI Bank which has a presence in 18 countries through subsidiaries, branches and representative offices.

	Calcutta, July 9: German luxury car maker Audi hopes to capture 30-35 per cent of the premium car market in eastern India by the end of this year.         
	The eastern region sells around 450 units in this segment annually.        
	We want to become the leader in the domestic market, although there isnt a defined timeline on this yet. We will have to establish our leadership city-by-city, Audi India director Michael Perschke said here after inaugurating the companys first showroom in Calcutta today.        
	Audis dealership has sold 16 vehicles in the city and has bookings for another 10.        
	During January-June, Audi recorded a 71 per cent rise in year-on-year sales in India, Perschke said.         
	We have just increased our forecast from 2,300 to 2,700 units. We are looking at a record year for Audi, he said.        
	The company plans to bring the Audi A8 sedan later this year to take on rivals Mercedes and BMW. We will launch the A8 at the end of this year, Perschke said. Audi leads the luxury SUV market in India with its Q5 and Q7 models.         
	The company has already announced that it would invest 30 million euros in India to build an assembly unit by 2015. The company intends to have a capacity of 6,000 units per annum in one shift.         
	According to Perschke, Audi will ramp up its national dealership network to 19 by 2011 from 14.        
	Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz has posted a 100 per cent sales growth in the eastern region during the January-June period. The company, which has sold 103 cars in 2009, has sold 86 units so far this year in the east.        
	Nationally, Mercedes-Benz has reported a 79 per cent rise in sales during the first six months of this year. It has sold 2,402 cars against 1,342 cars during the same period last year.        
	BMW has sold 2,183 units during the period. The company, which entered the country three years ago, is slightly ahead of Mercedes-Benz, having sold 3,619 cars in 2009.         
	Mercedes, which began selling cars in India in the late 1990s, sold 3,247 during the same period.

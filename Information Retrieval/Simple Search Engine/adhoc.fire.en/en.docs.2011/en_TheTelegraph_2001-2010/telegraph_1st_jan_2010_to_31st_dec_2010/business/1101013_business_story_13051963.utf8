The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Tele to launch 3G service by Diwali
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata Tele to launch 3G service by Diwali
          PIYA SINGH                          New offer                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 12: The race to launch 3G services in the domestic telecom market is hotting up. Tata Teleservices Ltd will be the first private operator to launch the service by Diwali.        
	A Tata Teleservices spokesperson confirmed the development. The company, in which Japans NTT DoCoMo has a 26 per cent stake, is expected to launch the service in nine circles simultaneously. The service is likely to be launched under the DoCoMo brand.         
	We will be sourcing the equipment from Nokia Siemens. With our partnership with NTT DoCoMo, the inventor of 3G, we have access to a repertoire of proven products that can be customised for the Indian market, said the spokesperson.        
	Tata Teleservices, which offers both GSM and CDMA technology platforms, is present in 22 circles.         
	Along with Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra), its subscriber base has crossed 80 million.         
	Other private operators such as Reliance Communications (R-Com) are expected to launch their 3G services by the end of the year or early 2011.         
	A Reliance spokesperson, however, declined to comment on the launch date.        
	Analysts expect mobile operators to ride the 3G wave to bolster revenues as call rates for second-generation telephony services come down.         
	UBS Investment Research, which has put a buy on R-Com, said in a report, We believe that R-Com with its CDMA and 3G spectrum coupled with optic fibre network is well positioned to ride any boom on wireless data.        
	R-Com is likely to launch dongle-based broadband in 500 cities and offer wirless Internet on handsets in the next 12 months, the report added.         
	Telecom analysts, however, warn that Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd have launched the service to a very tepid response from subscribers.        
	These are early days, quite similar to when Internet was made available in the country. There are issues of spectrum continuity, availability of a plethora of applications and high-priced handsets, said a telecom industry executive.        
	There are also concerns over the spectrum fees paid by the telecom companies.

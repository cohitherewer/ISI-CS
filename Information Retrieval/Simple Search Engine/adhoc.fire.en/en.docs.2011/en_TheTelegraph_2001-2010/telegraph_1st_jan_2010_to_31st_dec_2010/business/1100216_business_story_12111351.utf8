          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 15: Tata Motors today announced the appointment of ex-General Motors head (Europe), Carl-Peter Forster, as the group chief executive officer of the company.         
	This is a new executive position at the automaker. Forster will be responsible for Tata Motors operations in India and abroad and will report to the companys board of directors. The role will include charge of Jaguar and Land Rover.         
	Carl-Peter Forster is the new super boss, said a Tata group executive.         
	Managing director (India operations) P.M. Telang will report to Forster. So will the managing director of Jaguar Land Rover who will replace David Smith. Tata Motors is on the look out for a replacement for Smith who stepped down as JLR CEO in late Januaryafter dismal sales in the year ended March. A development on this front is expected in the next few weeks, said a Tata Motors spokesperson.        
	The decision to appoint an expat group CEO seems to have arisen from Tata Motors global ambitions and its plans to launch several key models across categories in overseas markets.         
	Commenting on the appointment, Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata said, Tata Motors expects that Forsters induction will greatly facilitate its ambition towards being a truly international company.         
	Forster has 24 years of international experience in the automobile industry. Most recently he was the head of General Motors, Europe, where he looked after Opel/Vauxhall, Saab and the European activities of Chevrolet.        
	Before joining General Motors in 2001, Mr. Forster spent 13 years in BMW where he was managing director of BMW South Africa. He was also on the managing board of BMW responsible for manufacturing.        
	Forster will be one of the few expat CEOs in the Tata group which derives 65 per cent of its revenues from overseas markets. There are two others in top executive slots: India Hotels Raymond Bickson and Tata Technologies Patrick McGoldrick.        
	Besides Jaguar and Land Rover, Tata Motors has a South Korean commercial venture called Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co and Spanish bus maker Hispano Carrocera. On Monday, Tata Motors also said that the companys global vehicle sales in January has shot up 93 per cent to 85, 714 vehicles.         
	Jaguar Land Rover global sales in January 2010 were 16,269 vehicles, higher by 195 per cent, said a company release. Jaguar sales for the month were 2,974, higher by 122 per cent while Land Rover sales were 13,295, higher by 219 per cent.

	Mumbai, Feb. 2: National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the countrys largest power producer, has set a floor price of Rs 201 a share for its follow-on public offer that opens tomorrow.        
	The sale is expected to fetch the state-run company at least $1.8 billion.        
	It will be the largest selloff as part of the governments divestment programme.         
	In a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), NTPC said the empowered group of ministers (EGoM) had decided on the floor price at a meeting on Monday.         
	The EGoM has also approved offering a Rs 10 per share discount to employees subscribing shares, thereby fixing the floor price for the employees at Rs 191. The issue closes on February 5.        
	The minimum bid lot has been decided at 28 equity shares and its multiples thereafter.         
	Marketmen said the issue was priced well and would attract investor interest.         
	This is an attractively priced follow-on offer. It may have been more reasonable if the floor price was 10 per cent lower, said Motilal Oswals fund manager Manish Sonthalia.        
	The government is talking to over 30 ministries to sell stakes in state-run companies in order to bridge its fiscal deficit, according to reports.        
	The floor price of the NTPC offer was set at a 4.9 per cent discount to Mondays close. ICICI Securities, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Kotak Mahindra Capital Co are the lead managers to the issue.         
	On Tuesday, the NTPC scrip fell 2.46 per cent to Rs 206.05.

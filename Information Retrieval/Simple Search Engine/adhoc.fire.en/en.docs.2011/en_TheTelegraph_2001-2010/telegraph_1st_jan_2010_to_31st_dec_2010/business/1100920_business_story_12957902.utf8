The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Electrosteel IPO price surprise
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Electrosteel IPO price surprise
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Umang Kejriwal: On way to market                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 19: Electrosteel Steels Ltd (ESL), which will hit the capital market with its initial public offering on Tuesday, is poised to give investors a rare opportunity to subscribe to shares at par.         
	This is the third time since 2000 that a company is offering shares having a face value of Rs 10 at Rs 10.        
	The last time a company announced a public offering at Rs 10 was September 2003, when Vardhaman Acrylic did a share sale. This was preceded by Moschip Semiconductor, which priced its IPO at par on December 2000.        
	ESL has set a price band of Rs 10-11. In a book-building method, the managers of the issue and the promoters are allowed to fix a price within the band. In Vardhaman and Moschip, the IPOs were done at a fixed price. There is no bar on a fixed price issue now, but companies prefer the book-building route.        
	Umang Kejriwal, the promoter director of ESL, said the management wanted to keep something on the table for investors. ESL is raising around Rs 250 crore through the IPO to part fund an integrated steel project in Jharkhand.        
	It is a small issue. The idea was to give an exit route to existing investors rather than arranging fund, he said.        
	Electrosteel Castings Ltd  the countrys largest ductile iron pipe maker  is the promoter of ESL. It has invested Rs 700 crore in the equity portion of ESL, followed by UK-based steel trading group Stemcor at Rs 400 crore and a clutch of equity funds who have put in Rs 700 crore. ECL and Stemcor hold about 37 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, in the firm.         
	We are thinking of the long term. Hopefully, this is not the last time we are hitting the market. There will be further expansion and fundraising. The goodwill we generate now will see us through then, ESL director Uddhav Kejriwal said.         
	The company is yet to start production at its Jharkhand facility. It will start earning revenues from the end of this year. Going by enterprise value, it is close to Tata Steel.        
	ESLs public offering is coming at a time a slew of other floats will be open for subscription. Even at this rock-bottom price, ESL will have to fight hard for investors attention. The first of the three blast furnaces will start operations next month. In the next nine months, the plant, along with a 120-mega-watt, coal-fired power facility, will be fully operational.        
	The company has begun production at its coking coal mine, with reserves of 231 million tonnes (mt), in Bokaro. Operations at its iron ore mine, with 91mt reserves, at Kodolibad in west Singbhum district is expected to begin in eight months.

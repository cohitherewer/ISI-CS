          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 4: Interest rates have started nudging upwards once again.        
	Three private sector banks  HDFC Bank, ICICI and Kotak Mahindra Bank today sent out a clear signal by raising auto loan rates by 25-50 basis points.        
	HDFC and ICICI Bank also scrapped their teaser home loan rate schemes that were launched with great fanfare last year to woo customers.         
	Of late, the Reserve Bank of India had been voicing its disapproval over the teaser rates as these were not being offered to existing borrowers.        
	The other concern was that borrowers of the teaser rate loans were probably not being adequately informed about the loan repayment burden that they would have to shoulder once the teaser rates ended after a short fixed period and the market rates kicked in.        
	The discontinuation of the teaser rate schemes means that new borrowers will now have to pay relatively higher interest rates on home loans. However, existing borrowers will not have to worry  at least for the time being as these banks have not revised their benchmark rates, which impact interest rates paid by such clients.        
	Officials said ICICI Bank had discontinued the two-year fixed rate home loan scheme, which offered an interest rate of 8.25 per cent for the first two years, with effect from March.         
	They said auto loan rack rates had been raised 25-50 basis points. The interest rate on new auto loans will now be in the range of 9.75 per cent to 11 per cent.         
	On the home-loan front, ICICI Bank is offering these loans for up to Rs 30 lakh at 8.75 per cent and those between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 50 lakh at 9 per cent. For loans above Rs 50 lakh, the interest rate stands at 9.50 per cent.        
	HDFC, Indias largest provider of home finance, also axed its special home loan scheme. In December, HDFC had announced the dual-rate loan under which a borrower would be charged a fixed rate up to March 2012 and a floating rate subsequently.         
	For a 20-year loan of Rs 30 lakh, a borrower will pay a fixed rate of 8.25 per cent up to March 2012 and then a floating rate, which is 500 basis points below its benchmark rate. According to sources, the last date for the scheme was February 27, and HDFC has decided not to extend it.        
	This means a new borrower will have to pay an interest rate of 8.75 per cent for loans up to Rs 30 lakh, and 9 per cent for loans between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 50 lakh. For loans above Rs 50 lakh, the interest rate comes to 9.25 per cent.        
	The withdrawal of the teaser schemes was expected after the RBI raised the cash reserve ratio by 75 basis points to 5.75 per cent and also directed banks to move to a base rate system with effect from April 1. Earlier, Canara Bank and Union Bank had withdrawn their schemes expecting higher interest rates ahead.        
	According to sources, HDFC Bank  which is the biggest player in auto loans  has raised rates by around 50 basis points. The bank now offers an interest rate of 9-10.50 per cent on auto loans.        
	A private sector banker, said the hike in interest rates on auto loans was an indication of the firming up of rates and that banks were not only reacting to signals communicated by the RBI in its January monetary policy review but also to the prospect of inflation inching up further, which could affect interest rates.         
	The yield on benchmark 10-year security, which was prevailing around 7.58 per cent levels in late January, has spurted to nearly 7.95 per cent.         
	Many expect it to cross the 8-per-cent mark. Several banks such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank have already upped their deposit rates.

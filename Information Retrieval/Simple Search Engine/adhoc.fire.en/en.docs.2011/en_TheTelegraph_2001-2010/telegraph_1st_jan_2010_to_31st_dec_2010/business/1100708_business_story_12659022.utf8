The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Petrol price review likely once in 15 days
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Petrol price review likely once in 15 days
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          New regime                                  
	New Delhi, July 7: The government may allow oil marketing companies to change petrol prices every fortnight as it looks to announce the pricing norms for the fuel next week.        
	Both PSU retailers such as Indian Oil as well as private players such as Reliance and Essar will have to fix their prices on the basis of a formula that incorporates not only the global price of crude but also the exchange rate and local tax rates, sources said.        
	The oil ministry would hold discussions with the retailers later this week to finalise the norms.        
	Discussions would be on the periodicity to revise the retail prices, pricing formula and the trigger point when the government would intervene to protect the interests of consumers during a volatile crude spike, the sources said.        
	The pricing system would bring automatic changes in fuel prices without any government intervention, officials said.         
	Last month, the government granted autonomy to oil firms to fix the price of petrol and raised the prices of diesel, kerosene, and cooking gas. It said diesel prices would eventually be market-determined but gave no time frame.        
	The government move resulted in a rise in petrol prices by Rs 3.50 a litre. Diesel prices went up by Rs 2, kerosene by Rs 3 and cooking gas by Rs 35 a cylinder.        
	If the government had announced the pricing norms along with the deregulation, petrol prices would have fallen.         
	When prices were raised on June 25, crude oil prices were hovering at around $75 per barrel, which have now come down to $71.        
	To protest the fuel price hike, the Opposition parties on Monday had called a nationwide strike demanding a rollback.         
	Oil minister Murli Deora and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee have ruled out such a move.         
	 Officials said depending on the success of the fortnightly revision of petrol prices, the government may allow a weekly price revision or go in for dynamic pricing.        
	The US follows the dynamic pricing model that allows retailers to set different prices in different parts of the country. This should encourage greater competition leading to better service standards.

	Calcutta, Jan. 27: Sistema Shyam TeleServices will need to spend $440-550 million this year to complete its network expansion.        
	The company  a joint venture between Russias Sistema and Indias Shyam group  has to wait for funds from Russia, which has postponed its proposed $677-million investment for a 20 per cent stake in the Indian firm.         
	We have rolled out services in 11 circles and expect to complete the rollout in the remaining 11 circles by the end of this year, Sistema Shyam CEO Vsevolod Rozanov said.        
	According to industry experts, it takes about $40-50 million to roll out services in a circle. The board of Sistema Shyam has given in-principle approval to the company to tap the markets. We are in the process of finalising the merchant banker for the IPO and hope to do it by the end of February, Rozanov said.        
	Russias Sistema JSFC owns 73.71 per cent in the venture, while the Shyam group holds 23.79 per cent. The minority shareholders own the rest.

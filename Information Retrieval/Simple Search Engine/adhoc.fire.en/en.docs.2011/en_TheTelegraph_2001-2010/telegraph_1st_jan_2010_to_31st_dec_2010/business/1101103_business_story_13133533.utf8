          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Next in line                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 2: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today said it would announce draft guidelines for the licensing of new private banks by January.        
	The announcement effectively means that there is very little likelihood that the new banking licences will be handed out in this financial year that ends next March. A number of companies have already indicated their interest in entering the banking space once the guidelines are announced.        
	Back in February, Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said the central bank would consider the possibility of handing out additional licences to private players.         
	In August, the RBI had floated a discussion paper on the subject. The central bank today said that based on the comments and suggestions received from various parties and discussions held with major stakeholders last month, it is proposed to put the draft guidelines in public domain by end-January 2011 for public comment.        
	Banking circles say that the RBI is following a step-by-step process in granting licences.         
	This has to be welcomed even though it takes some time, a senior official from a PSU bank said.        
	The RBIs discussion paper, which focussed on four key issues and their associated advantages and risks, suggested raising the capital requirements to at least Rs 300 crore. It had indicated that this could be raised to Rs 1,000 crore.         
	The discussion paper observed that there were various advantages of allowing corporate houses to set up banks, though there were potential risks as well. It added that with past experience in India either with small NBFCs and local area banks not encouraging, there is a necessity of having banks with a strong capital base.         
	The discussion paper had said industrial and business houses engaged in real estate activities, either directly or indirectly, should not be allowed to promote banks.         
	In its second quarter review of monetary policy, the central bank disclosed that it was also in the final stages of releasing a discussion paper on the presence of foreign banks in India.         
	It may be recalled that in the monetary policy statement of April, the RBI had said that following the crisis, a discussion paper on the mode of presence of foreign banks through branch or wholly-owned subsidiary would be prepared by September. The apex bank is now engaged in consultations with the government before drawing up the discussion paper.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Narendra Modi in   New Delhi on Tuesday. (AFP)                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi today urged national and international business leaders to choose the state as an investment destination.        
	I invite you to Vibrant Gujarat programme (an investor meet) to share your ideas, initiatives, ambitions, aspirations, plans and projects. Our aim is to make Gujarat a global hub and globally preferred place to do business, Modi said.        
	The biennial event, which will be held on January 12-13 in Gandhinagar, is aimed at attracting business leaders and investors. Investment commitments worth $240 billion were signed in 2009.         
	He said there was huge a opportunity for investors in tourism, education, infrastructure, shipping, healthcare and renewable energy.        
	After special economic zones, we are moving towards special investment regions. These are going to be very big in size and scale. They will be developed as global hubs with world-class infrastructure, civic amenities and exemplary policy framework, he said.

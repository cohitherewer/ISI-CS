          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 10: Companies are expected to report strong second-quarter results driven by robust demand. However, the good show may be marred by relatively lower margins.        
	With the BSE sensex ruling over 20000 on account of huge FII inflows that have breached the $20-billion mark, a good report card is crucial in sustaining this momentum.        
	With valuations beginning to look stretched, the focus will now be on companies profitability. The profit numbers will have to be good for equity prices to sustain, Rajeev Thakkar, CEO of Parag Parikh Financial Advisory Services, told The Telegraph.        
	Brokerages are optimistic that the sales, or revenue, of many companies will be robust because of good demand. Profit growth may not disappoint, though margins may wane because of high raw material prices.         
	According to Angel Broking, net sales of sensex companies in the second quarter will increase 20 per cent, but profits are likely to rise 13.5 per cent.         
	Information technology, metals, oil amp; gas, capital goods and banking are expected to do well. Telecom, faced with tough competition, may continue to disappoint.        
	Infosys will kickstart the earnings season when it declares its second-quarter numbers on October 15. Analysts expect the Bangalore-based company to not only post strong numbers but also raise its full-year dollar revenue guidance.         
	IT vendors will record good results in this quarter led by robust volumes. We expect a marginal uptick in pricing for some of the companies. Lower pressure on margins because of the absence of salary increases, positive impact of cross currency and forex gains will drive profitability, said Rohit Kumar Anand at PINC Research.        
	Brokerages are divided in their expectations from the auto sector. While most agree that the sales, or revenue, will be strong, some analysts feel margins may come under pressure. We believe margins for the auto industry will decline from the peak levels of the second and third quarters of 2009-10 driven by raw material cost push, brokerage Motilal Oswal said.         
	Banks will benefit from higher loan growth, while capital goods firms will gain from the revival in the economy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL gets interim boss
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SAIL gets interim boss
          OUR BUREAU                          Bhattacharya: New role                                  
	New Delhi, June 1: Soiles Bhattacharya today took over as the interim chairman of Steel Authority of India Ltd.        
	The PSU steel major informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that S.K. Roongta ceases to be the chairman of SAIL with effect from May 31, 2010, on attaining the age of superannuation.         
	Soiles Bhattacharya, director (finance), has been given the additional charge of chairman SAIL, it added.        
	Bhattacharya is the senior most director at SAIL. Official sources said he had been given the additional charge for three months, or until further orders were issued.        
	The steel ministry had to appoint an interim chairman, as there were delays in the approval of C.S. Verma, who is currently the director (finance) of Bhel, to the top job in the steel PSU. The Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) had recommended Verma for the post of SAIL chairman.        
	While most of the clearances for Verma are in place, his appointment has not yet been confirmed by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), pending which Bhattacharya has been made the chairman.        
	A government official, on the condition of anonymity, said that recently certain clarifications were sought by the ACC on the appointment of a new chairman for SAIL.        
	The steel ministry has already sent its reply on Vermas appointment to the ACC, he added.        
	Steel minister Virbhadra Singh had last month said that he had approved Vermas name and recommended him to the ACC.         
	Meanwhile, in an interview to PTI, Roongta today said he favoured the merger of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited with SAIL.        
	Price cut        
	SAIL today cut prices of its products by up to Rs 1,500 a tonne in line with the softening global trend and the slackening demand scenario in the domestic market.        
	The price cut is effective from today.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Tax liability
                                I had invested around Rs 90,000 in Kisan Vikas Patras. I bought those in different denominations of Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000. The KVPs will mature in 2017. What will be my tax liability on the maturity amount? Is TDS applicable to KVPs? Do I have to fill up Form 15G with the post office? What is the interest rate on KVPs?          Jayanta Kumar Sanyal, Calcutta
                    KVPs, the rate of interest is 8.4 per cent compounded annually. TDS is not applicable to KVPs, and there is no tax benefit either. You shall have to pay income tax on the withdrawal amount at the marginal rate of your income bracket, taking into account the KVP maturity amount.                                    Refund route      I have five term deposits of Rs 2.75 lakh. The bank had deducted TDS of Rs 1,309 from two deposits that matured on November 4 and November 8 last year. I used to submit Form 15H but did not preserve any copy. The bank said they had not received Form 15H for 2007-08 and the tax was deducted at source for that year. The deducted amount will be refunded if I produced the relevant documents, which is not at my disposal. How can I get back the deducted amount?        Parimal Bandyopadhyay, Hooghly
                      Since the bank has deducted tax at source, it is bound to give you a TDS certificate. To get refund of the deducted amount, you shall have to file income tax return claiming the tax refund.                                      Wealth watch      If I sell my residential house and a piece of land and liquidate my investments in shares, KVPs, NSCs and gold, the total sum may cross Rs 30 lakh. How shall I calculate the wealth tax? If I dont sell these, shall I have to pay wealth tax?        Soumitra Das, Howrah
                    Productive assets like shares, debentures, bank deposits and mutual funds are not included in wealth tax. Non- productive assets like jewellery, cars, urban land, residential house, cash in hand more than Rs 50,000, are used to determine wealth tax liability. Wealth tax is charged every assessment year irrespective of whether you sell those assets or not. The tax is charged on valuation of the net wealth (gross value minus cost of acquisition) of the assessee.

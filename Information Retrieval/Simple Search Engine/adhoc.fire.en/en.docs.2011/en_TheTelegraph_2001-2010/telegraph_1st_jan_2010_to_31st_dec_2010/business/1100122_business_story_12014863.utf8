	Calcutta, Jan. 21: The basic infrastructure for the rollout of unique identity numbers will be ready by early next year, according to R.S. Sharma, director-general and mission director of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).         
	He was speaking on the sidelines of Infocom 2009-10, the IT conference and exhibition organised by Businessworld, an ABP Group publication.         
	We hope to combine databases of multiple agencies and this can be a win-win situation for registrars. We have done extensive consultations with stakeholders and have talked to banks, including the Reserve Bank of India, for sharing their databases, Sharma said.         
	Similar talks have been initiated with the oil, food and civil supplies ministries, he said.         
	We will float a tender for application development for unique identity numbers this Monday. We have a technological team to handle our software requirements, Sharma said.         
	He said the UIDAI hoped to roll out 600 million IDs in four years.

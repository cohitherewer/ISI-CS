The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Silent on rebate
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Silent on rebate
                                I want to purchase some NSC in my minor daughters name for tax savings. Can I get tax rebate under Section 80C?          Vineet Kapoor, Calcutta
                      Unlike clauses (i), (v) and (xi) under sub-section (2) of Section 80C, where it is clarified that deductions are available to the assessee in the case of contributions to LIC premium, PPF and Ulip investments in the name of spouse or minor children, clause (ix) of the said section is silent on whether deduction is available for subscription to NSC in the name of spouse and children. Hence, it can be assumed that subscription to NSC in the name of spouse or children would not be eligible for deduction u/s 80C.                                      Open an account       I have invested Rs 15 lakh in a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme where my wife is the second account holder. Can she open a separate SCSS account?        S. Banerjee, Behala
                    Yes, your wife can open a separate account provided she is a senior citizen. A joint account under SCSS can be opened only with the spouse. In the case of a joint account, the age of the first applicant decides the eligibility to invest under the scheme. The deposit amount in an SCSS account is attributed to the first applicant only. Hence, both the spouses can open individual or joint accounts with each other with maximum deposits up to Rs 15 lakh.                                  Leave salary woe      I have resigned from a company where I was previously working with. Can I claim exemption on leave salary received after the resignation?        Ranjan Dasgupta, Hooghly
                    Leave encashment is taxed as salary income. But Section 10 (10AA) of the Income Tax Act provides for exemption on leave salary if it is received on superannuation or retirement or otherwise. Whether exemption under Section 10(10AA) is covered for resignation from employment under the word otherwise was debated before Chennai and Mumbai high courts. Both the courts ruled that otherwise includes resignation from service as well.                                    If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.

	New Delhi, Sept. 14: International Coal Ventures Ltd (ICVL) plans to acquire mines in Indonesia and Mozambique and has joined hands with RITES, the engineering consultancy arm of the Indian Railways, to develop the infrastructure for bringing the coal back to India.        
	ICVL is collaborating with RITES for coal mines in Indonesia and Mozambique. A joint team will leave for Indonesia soon, SAIL chairman C.S. Verma said.        
	ICVL is a special purpose vehicle set up by SAIL, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, Coal India, NMDC and NTPC in 2008 to scout for coal properties abroad and bridge the gap between domestic demand and supply, which stands at about 80 million tonnes.        
	According to the agreement, RITES will develop the rail infrastructure for transporting coal.         
	Verma, who also heads ICVL, did not elaborate on the reserves or the location of the mines.         
	Railway Board chairman Vivek Sahai said RITES was already present in Africa and would expand further.        
	On a possible initial public offering, he said it would depend on how the firm did in Mozambique and other African countries.         
	We may do it at a proper time when we are sure of the commercial return of our investments in those nations, he said.        
	A separate entity could be created to run the African businesses of RITES.

	SAIL today signed an agreement with RITES to set up a railway wagon-making unit in Kulti at an initial investment of Rs 120 crore.         
	The total investment of Rs 205 crore will be split into two parts.        
	The joint venture between the two PSUs is mutually beneficial. It will lead to many more such collaborations between them, steel minister Virbhadra Singh told reporters after the signing ceremony.        
	Steel secretary P. K. Mishra, Railway Board member Sanjiv Handa and RITES managing director V.K. Aggarwal were among the senior officials present on the occasion.        
	The steel minister said the two companies had plans to form five such joint ventures.

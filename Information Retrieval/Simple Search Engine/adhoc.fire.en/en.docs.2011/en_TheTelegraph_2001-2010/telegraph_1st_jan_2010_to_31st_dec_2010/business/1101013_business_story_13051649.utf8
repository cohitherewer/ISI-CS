	Super financial cop a step closer to reality  
	Our Special Correspondent  
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today managed to get the approval of all the regulators for a financial stability and development council (FSDC) to deal with inter-regulatory issues.  
	The four regulators are  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Insurance Regulatory Development Authority, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority.  
	At a meeting held today, the government sought to address the concerns raised by the RBI over its autonomy.  
	After the meeting that was attended by the heads of the regulatory bodies, including RBI governor D. Subbarao and Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave, Mukherjee said, I had a very constructive discussion with the regulators. It is a step forward in the creation of FSDC.   
	The finance minister made it clear that the council would not only deal with inter-regulatory issues, but also involve itself with the larger economy, including the functioning of big financial conglomerates.   
	This set the alarm bells ringing as the RBI feared its power over monetary policy might get curtailed by the super regulator.  
	To allay the apex banks apprehensions, the RBI governor has been made the head of a sub-committee of the FSDC. He has been given the position of the first among equals in the council vis--vis other regulators, said finance ministry officials.   
	The FSDC itself will be led by the finance minister.  
	It was agreed that to strengthen and institutionalise the mechanism for maintaining financial stability and development, the central government will set up the apex council, the finance ministry said in a statement.   
	The council will also focus on financial literacy and financial inclusion and look into issues relating to financial development.   
	The council was proposed by Mukherjee in the budget.  
	Mukherjee had earlier clarified in Parliament that the new panel on financial disputes will not be a super regulator.   
	Its true there were lots of apprehensions (on) whether were going to dilute the regulators independence. It will only be in the case of jurisdiction disputes between regulators that the joint mechanism will be used, he said.  
	The regulators were expected to settle their differences bilaterally, failing which they could go to the high-level coordination committee headed by the RBI governor. If a solution still eludes them, then only will it come to this (body) ... the buck has to stop somewhere ... the minister (for finance ) is the man who is ultimately responsible to Parliament, Mukherjee said.  
	The minister then also made it made it clear that the panel would not interfere with the RBIs monetary policy functioning.   
	The RBI will be supreme (in matters of monetary policy), he said.

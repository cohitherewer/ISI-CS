          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          New status                                  
	Hyderabad, April 20: The Andhra Pradesh government has brought information technology under the Essential Services Maintenance Act of 1971 to stall the flight of dollars from the much vaunted sector because of political tension.        
	The move comes at a time the state is grappling to find ways to tackle the Telangana issue, which threatens to jeopardise the prospects of the economy.        
	The government hereby reiterates and reaffirms that the IT software industry, including software, services and IT enabled services, is an essential service under the Andhra Pradesh Essential Services Maintenance Act, 1971 (Act No.20 of 1971), the gazette GO/MS/5 today said on the government website.         
	On February 15, Nasscom had approached the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, K. Rosaiah, seeking the uninterrupted functioning of IT offices.         
	The Hyderabad Software Exporters Association and Nasscom had taken up the issue when IT professionals had to stay away from work in December because of the ongoing Telengana agitation.         
	The week-long curfew during the recent communal riots had also hit the movement of personnel and food supplies across Hyderabad.         
	The situation had worsened as software engineers could not venture out and critical services had to be shut down causing huge losses to several IT majors, said J.A. Chowdhary, a senior member of the CII in the state.         
	IT secretary K. Ratna Prabha said once under Esma, the allied services which kept the software industry running such as travel, transport and hospitality would also be exempted and the employees in those services would not be allowed to go on strikes.         
	According to an industry spokesman, the government move will protect not only employees but also help establishments function without any interruption during agitations, curfews and prohibitory orders.         
	It will also entitle them to power, water and catering services even during those critical hours, said Narasinga Rao, secretary of the HYSEA (Hyderabad Software Exporters Association).         
	Since 1995, the software industry had driven a blooming BPO and ITeS services industry in Andhra Pradesh, providing jobs to over 3.2 software engineers directly and another 15 lakh persons indirectly.         
	Nasscom chairman        
	Harsh Manglik was appointed chairman of Nasscoms executive council for 2010-11 on Tuesday. Manglik takes over from Pramod Bhasin.

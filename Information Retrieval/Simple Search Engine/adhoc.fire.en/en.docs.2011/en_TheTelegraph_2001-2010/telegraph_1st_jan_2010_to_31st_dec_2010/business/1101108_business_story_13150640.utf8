The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Trai weighs cash call to Gulf
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Trai weighs cash call to Gulf
          JAYATI GHOSE                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 7: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is exploring the possibility of increasing the termination charge on incoming calls from the Gulf countries in the wake of the Gulf operators hiking the charge.        
	Local operators, who are lobbying for a hike, are arguing that the government can earn as much as Rs 270 crore extra revenue in the event of the hike.         
	The termination charge is a fee paid by an operator from whose network a call originates to an operator on whose network the call ends.        
	The regulator has sought inputs from domestic operators on the revision of termination charges after a few of them pointed out that a hike would result in a ten-fold jump in revenues for the government.         
	All operators share a certain percentage of their total revenues, including those earned from termination charges, with the government as taxes.         
	At present, the government gets Rs 30 crore from inbound settlement cost, whereas it could earn up to Rs 300 crore per annum, if the termination charges are revised, said the operators in a letter to Trai.         
	While the domestic operators had earlier proposed that termination rates on all international calls should be raised, they are now focused on the West Asian countries as Etisalat and Du recently raised their international call settlement charges from 10 cents per minute to 13 cents (around Rs 7) per minute.         
	So, while operators such as Du, Saudi Telecom, Zain and Etisalat pay a mere 40 paise per minute for terminating their traffic in India, they charge Bharti, Reliance Communications, BSNL and Vodafone Essar around Rs 7 per minute for calls that originate in India and terminate in the Gulf countries.         
	Operators said, this unilateral increase in termination rate is a clear abuse of monopoly and that Trai should address the issue.         
	Existing domestic laws prevent Indian operators from charging more than 40 paise per minute as termination fee for incoming calls from abroad.         
	According to industry data, India and West Asias international voice traffic, which is mainly led by the persons of Indian origin living in the Gulf countries, is around 10 billion minutes per annum. Traffic from West Asia is 8.5 billion and traffic to West Asia is around 2.2 billion minutes.         
	Indian operators argue that since incoming international call traffic is estimated to be nearly four times higher compared with outgoing international calls, an increase in termination rates (for incoming calls) will lead to higher foreign exchange inflow.

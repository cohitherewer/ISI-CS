The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL to go global for ore security
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SAIL to go global for ore security

	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The Indian government wants Steel Authority of India Ltd to follow other Indian steel makers and turn international by setting up steel plants in Indonesia and South Africa.         
	We have had government to government talks with Indonesia and South Africa. Both countries are keen that SAIL ventures there to set up steel mills  in return we are looking for quality coking coal and iron ore assets and assured supplies, said steel minister Virbhadra Singh in an interview with The Telegraph.        
	Both the mills will initially have an annual manufacturing capacity of 3 million tonnes of steel  but to go abroad we will need a cabinet nod, which we shall seek as things get firmed up, said Singh, who has been trying to break SAILs 10-year jinx of not being able to secure raw materials from abroad. Sources said the capacity of both mills would later be raised to 5mt.         
	SAIL has been hunting for coking coal and iron ore mines for nearly a decade but without much success, and it feels its future growth can be hit if supplies cannot be tied up now.         
	What Singh has decided is to barter SAILs expertise in steel making for raw material security. In the process, SAIL will have to turn into an international company.        
	The mill offers came after these two friendly and valuable partner countries were approached for help in securing iron ore and coking coal mines or equity stakes in existing mines.         
	SAIL has tried steel making technology and strong managerial expertise in running integrated and value added steel mills. The joint ventures will draw upon this. Thats what India is putting on the table, said Singh.        
	The equity holdings will depend upon negotiations and will be a flexible issue decided by mutual negotiations. A Mongolian delegation has also shown interest in a similar partnership but that avenue has to be further explored, said officials.        
	Both the joint ventures would be with state-run organisations, though in the South African case, local laws that seek to raise the standards of living of poor South Africans make it mandatory for a company to issue 26 per cent of equity to indigenous people.        
	Prices of coking coal, a key ingredient in steel making, rose 74 per cent in the August-September quarter from a year earlier, which has dented SAILs net profit by as much as 34 per cent. SAIL imports about 70 per cent of its coking coal requirement, much of it from Australia.         
	SAIL has only looked at buying raw material assets abroad but never considered a facility, possibly prompted by the fact that its market was mainly within India and there was no necessity to fritter away its resources abroad. The PSU exports a small percentage  about 3-4 per cent  of its production, but it works out to around Rs 3,000 crore in revenues.         
	However, with scarce and costly raw material at stake, officials say the investment abroad makes more than good sense. After all that is why Posco came to India  so that it could get the right to ship away 30 per cent of the high-grade iron ore allocations it would get in return for investing in a 12mt steel mill, officials said.

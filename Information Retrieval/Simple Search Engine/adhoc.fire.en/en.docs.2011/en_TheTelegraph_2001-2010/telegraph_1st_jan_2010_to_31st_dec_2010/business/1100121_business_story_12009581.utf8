The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court blow to Reliance bid for Lyondell 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Court blow to Reliance bid for Lyondell 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 20: Reliance Industries has suffered another setback in its quest to acquire LyondellBasell, the ailing Dutch chemicals maker.        
	On Tuesday, a US court gave the management of LyondellBasells US subsidiary time till April 15 to come up with a reorganisation plan designed to take it out of bankruptcy protection.        
	Judge Robert Gerber of the US bankruptcy court in the southern district of New York brushed aside a request by unsecured creditors of Lyondell Chemical Co for an investigation to determine how the Lyondell management was evaluating a competing bid from Reliance.        
	On November 21 last year, Reliance Industries had made a preliminary, non-binding offer for Lyondell Chemicals parent LyondellBasell Industries AF that valued it at $12 billion. The Lyondell management immediately termed it as a lowball offer.         
	Earlier this month, Reliance Industries raised the offer to $13.5 billion after selling a pile of treasury stock in three tranches to raise Rs 9,328 crore, which many believed would be used to fund the bid. The unsecured creditors  who have been kept out of Lyondell managements reorganisation plan  have argued that Reliances bid was far superior to the one being prepared by the management in consultation with a group of large, secured creditors.        
	The decision to grant an exclusivity period to the Lyondell management to come up with its reorganisation plan effectively snuffs out the hope of the unsecured creditors to force the court to consider both plans on merit.        
	Judge Gerber said the latest order would prevent parties from filing a competing proposal for the courts consideration but the unsecured creditors could still press for a shorter exclusivity period. Gerber also rejected a bid by the unsecured creditors to force Lyondell Chemicals Co to block payments worth about $500 million to secured lenders which are designed to protect lenders collateral while the company is in bankruptcy protection.        
	On December 24, Lyondell Chemicals had come up with a revised reorganisation plan that provided for the conversion of $18 billion of debt into common equity which would be handed out to the secured creditors who supported the plan.        
	LyondellBasell, a Luxembourg-based holding company, is owned by Russian-born investor Len Blavatnik through New York-based Access Industries.         
	Lyondell took on billions of dollars of debt when Access led the takeover of the chemicals maker in 2007.        
	The US subsidiary  which accounts for the largest chunk of Lyondells revenues  filed for bankruptcy after it was unable to meet debt obligations when demand for petrochemicals dropped worldwide in the wake of the global downturn.

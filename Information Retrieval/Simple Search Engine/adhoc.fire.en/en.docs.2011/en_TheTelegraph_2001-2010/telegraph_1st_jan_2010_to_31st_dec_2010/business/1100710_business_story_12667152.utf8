          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 9: The government is expecting an early settlement to the impasse vis-a-vis import restrictions on Chinese telecom equipment.        
	We have received inputs from the industry. Were working on resolving the issue. We had discussions with organisations and associations and they have helped us with their suggestions, telecom secretary P.J. Thomas said.        
	The controversy over security concerns regarding Chinese vendors has been rocking the telecom sector. The Centre is concerned that Chinese equipment may have embedded spyware to intercept sensitive conversations and government documents.        
	Though the government denies any blanket ban on the import of equipment and network gears, Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE complain that the government did not approve their deals.        
	China today asked the Centre to treat its firms fairly and called for an open and transparent system.        
	We have noticed the list and are investigating. We hope India will provide a fair, open and transparent investment environment for Chinese companies, reports quoting Chinese commerce minister Chen Deming said.         
	A report in state-run Global Times said 25 Chinese firms had been blacklisted by the Indian government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt wants BlackBerry to provide live data
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Govt wants BlackBerry to provide live data
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 19 (PTI): The proposal by BlackBerry for intercepting its messenger services to address the governments security concerns seems to have hit a rough patch today with agencies insisting that information given should be on a real-time basis.        
	The smartphone maker had offered to provide information on a deferred basis after it faced the threat of a shutdown of the core features by August 31 if security agencies couldnt get access to encyrpted e-mail sent on a BlackBerry handset.        
	Research In Motion (RIM), the maker of the smartphone, along with the department of telecom had submitted a proposal for intercepting BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) services.        
	Under this proposal, a mobile number needed for monitoring would have to be handed over to RIM that would provide the information within 10 days.        
	However, the security agencies insisted on real-time information rather than a deferred one in the interest of national security.        
	Now, for example, if two terrorists are negotiating a strike, you cant expect us to wait for 10 days, a senior home ministry official said.        
	The BlackBerry maker is racing against time to meet the August 31 deadline set by the government last week to provide a solution for intercepting the BBM and BlackBerry Enterprise Mail (BES), or face a shutdown.        
	The officials of RIM, which has a subscriber base of nearly one million in India, have informed the government that they would come up with a more precise solution next week which will help the security agencies to monitor the services.        
	Only after security agencies are satisfied with the technology of interception, a green signal will be given for continuation of the services, the official said.

	New Delhi, Dec. 11 (PTI): Diversified business group ITC Ltd today said it would resume production of cigarettes only after receiving a formal government notification on what pictorial warning should be printed on packs.        
	The company, its rival Godfrey Phillips India and others, had stopped production of cigarettes since the beginning of the month because of uncertainty over what pictorial warning should be printed.

	It was decided that the current pictorial warnings would be retained for one more year, after which it will be reviewed in December 2011.        
	The existing pictorial warnings  a scorpion on bidi packs and a cancer- affected lung on cigarette packs  were to be replaced by a cancer-affected mouth, from December 1 following a notification by the ministry of health and family welfare in May.        
	Speaking on the sidelines of an event organised by the company, Deveshwar said the company has enough stocks at present but could start facing shortage if the current production shutdown continued for a longer period.        
	I hope not... it depends on how long it is closed if it is closed for a long time, it will affect, he said, when asked if its sales were impacted because of the shutdown.        
	Cigarette business accounted for about 50 per cent of the companys overall annual turnover of over Rs 18,150 crore in the last fiscal.

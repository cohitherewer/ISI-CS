          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Cash comfort                                  
	New Delhi, May 21: The government will soon bring before the cabinet a proposal to sell up to a 10 per cent stake in Shipping Corporation of India Ltd (SCI).         
	The divestment department has also written to Nalco and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) to consider listing on the stock markets by issuing fresh equity.        
	Sources said the divestment department had reminded Vizag-based RINL that it should get listed on the bourses to continue enjoying its navratna status.        
	The offer to sell SCIs stock may involve a fresh issue of shares equivalent to a 10 per cent stake in the company. The government holds 80.12 per cent in SCI.        
	Officials said SCI needed about Rs 2,000 crore for its fleet acquisition plan. It has recently borrowed from the global market to buy tankers and freighters.         
	At present, the government holds a 100 per cent stake in RINL. The steel maker is likely to issue 10 per cent fresh equity with the government selling a similar stake. This is likely to be done after a capital restructuring of the company.         
	In March this year, RINL joined the navratna club. The firm can now take investment decisions up to Rs 1,000 crore without seeking the steel ministrys approval. But, it needs to get listed within a year to continue enjoying this financial autonomy.        
	Divestment in Nalco may not make much headway because of opposition from the state. Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik had said, The BJD is against the idea of divestment in Nalco. However, the selloff proposal can still see the light of the day if the state is convinced that only a minority stake will be sold to provide Nalco with funds for expansion.        
	The divestment department has lined up selloffs in Engineers India, Coal India, SAIL, PowerGrid and Hindustan Copper by the middle of this financial year.        
	The central government has set a target of raising Rs 40,000 crore through share sale this fiscal. Analysts believe the government can raise Rs 50,000 crore even without divestments in SCI, RINL or Nalco.

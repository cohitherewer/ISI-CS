                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      JLR steers Tata Motors to profit 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Aug. 10: A stellar performance by Jaguar Land Rover and a rise in domestic demand have helped Tata Motors to report a first-quarter consolidated net profit of Rs 1,988.73 crore, a major turnaround from a loss of Rs 328.78 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	Revenues grew 64.2 per cent to Rs 27,055.57 crore from Rs 16,472.97 crore in the same quarter last year. The numbers, way ahead of analysts estimates, led to the Tata Motors share surging on the bourses today. On the BSE, it closed at a new high of Rs 957.30 compared with Rs 918.95 after touching an intra-day peak of Rs 967.30.         
	On a standalone basis, revenues rose nearly 63 per cent to Rs 10,416.26 crore from Rs 6,404.02 crore in the corresponding period last year. However, net profit dropped to Rs 395.72 crore (Rs 513.76 crore).         
	C. Ramakrishnan, chief financial officer of Tata Motors, said the stand-alone net profit should be seen in the context of the extraordinary income that the company received last year on sale of investments.         
	Tata Motors said an overall economic growth, a robust IIP and availability of liquidity have led to higher domestic demand during the quarter, leading to a volume growth of both new and existing products.         
	In the domestic market, commercial vehicles sales increased 38.7 per cent to 100,186 units. The growth was supported by medium and heavy commercial vehicles, which grew 62.4 per cent year-on-year.         
	Passenger vehicles, including Fiat and Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles distributed in India, grew 56 per cent in the domestic market to 77,858 units, driven by a good response to the Tata Indigo Manza, Indica Vista and Nano.         
	However, it was the performance of JLR that was the highlight of the robust first-quarter performance. JLR reported a profit after tax of 221 million against a loss of 64 million in the same quarter last year. This is the third successive quarter where the unit is reporting a positive profit after tax. Though the profits were also on account of a favourable exchange rate, higher sales did play a part.         
	Tata Motors said wholesale volumes of Jaguar Land Rover in the first quarter were 57,153 units compared with 35,947 units in the same period last year. Retail sales also improved in the quarter because of increased demand for Land Rover products and the new XJ.         
	Ramakrishnan said while cost pressures were building up on account of rising input prices, the company would look to at least maintain its current margins. He added that on the domestic front, the momentum was likely to be maintained because of new products lined up such as the Aria, Magic Iris, Venture and Prima Range. The company will also look to bring down its debt-equity ratio to below 1:1 from 1.96:1 in the June quarter.

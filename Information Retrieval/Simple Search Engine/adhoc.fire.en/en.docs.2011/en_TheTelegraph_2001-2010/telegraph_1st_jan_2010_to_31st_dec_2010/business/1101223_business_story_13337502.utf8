          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Hyderabad, Dec. 22: A contract worker and an employee were killed in the early hours of Wednesday at the API unit of Dr Reddys Laboratories at Bollarum, 25 km from Hyderabad.         
	A suspected nitrogen gas leak has allegedly led to the deaths, while two others have been taken ill.         
	The accident took place at 1.30am on Wednesday at the firms Bollarum facility, which produces active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). This is one of the six US FDA approved facilities of Dr Reddys in the country.         
	Police said the victims were on night shift when the accident occurred. The deceased workers have been identified as Sridhar Reddy (hailing from Tenali in Andhra Pradesh) and Deepak Kumar Jena (from Orissa). Their discoloured bodies were discovered by the morning shift workers inside the plant.         
	A source in the Dr Reddys Lab Union said there was a power shutdown at 11.30 hours last night when nitrogen gas leaked from one of the coolant systems in the third unit of the facility.         
	In the darkness the workers were caught unaware and died of asphyxiation, said the union member.        
	The company authorities took the workers to Kukatpally government hospital where they were declared dead.         
	We will know more about the leaked chemicals only after a report by the medical experts, the police said.        
	The bodies have been sent for post mortem, they said.         
	In a statement, Dr Reddys denied reports of any injuries to others but confirmed the death of persons and serious illness of two others.        
	A case under Section 304 (negligence leading to death) of the Criminal Procedure Code has already been registered against the management.         
	Meanwhile, the Dr Reddys scrip opened at Rs 1,642.40 today and dropped to a low of Rs 1,618.00.

After December 31, 2012, Ceat Ltd will be the exclusive owner of the brand in business related territories all over the world.         
	Ceat manufactures over 10 million tyres every year and has a major market share in the truck segment. Pirelli Group is the fifth-largest manufacturer in the world in terms of turnover, with 20 factories in four continents.        
	Meanwhile, Ceat today said its Halol facility in Gujarat would start commercial production in about two months.

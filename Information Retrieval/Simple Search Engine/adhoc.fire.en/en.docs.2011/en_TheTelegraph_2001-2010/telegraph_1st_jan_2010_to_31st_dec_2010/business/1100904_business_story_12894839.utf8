The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL key job up for grabs
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SAIL key job up for grabs

	New Delhi, Sept. 3: SAILs director (commercial) Shoeb Ahmed will retire on October 31, and the Public Enterprises Selection Board is expected to select his replacement from among 15 candidates, including 10 from within the organisation.        
	Sources said D. Ranjan, executive director (transport amp; shipping), is a favourite, while two other recently-promoted executive directors  Suman Mukherjee of the flats marketing division and Anil Dhawan of warehousing  are also in the fray.        
	Ranjan has considerable experience in marketing and is considered the frontrunner. However, the actual selection will depend upon a number of factors, including the steel ministers preference.         
	The PESB will select two candidates after consulting the SAIL chairman. The ministry of steel will then give its comments on the candidates and pass it on to the appointments committee of the cabinet.         
	Sources said Ahmed did not get along with former SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta, who is a marketing man himself.         
	Current SAIL chairman C.S. Verma, who is new to the organisation, will want to have a say in the selection and bring in a man with whom he can work without friction.        
	Sources said steel minister Virbhadra Singh would not like to interfere in the selection and will go by the advice of the PESB and his ministry officials.         
	The PESB is an independent body set up by the government to select candidates for top jobs in state-run enterprises.        
	Since the late 1990s, market conditions have determined how a steel firm fares in the Indian market, and the post of commercial director in SAIL, which has a turnover of Rs 44,000 crore, has assumed importance.         
	PESB members said the two most crucial posts in the years ahead would be the heads of the marketing and raw materials divisions.         
	SAIL is also planning to recruit managing directors for its key plants  Bhilai, Bokaro, Durgapur and IISCO.         
	Interviews for these jobs are likely to be held over the next few weeks.        
	SAIL, which has been recently accorded the status of maharatna, is currently preparing for the divestment of 10 per cent of its equity in two tranches. The public sector steel giant is implementing a Rs 60,000-crore modernisation and expansion plan.        
	Meanwhile, the company has increased the price of its flat products by Rs 1,000 a tonne on account of a pick-up in demand.        
	There is a Rs 1,000 rollback on discount given on our flat steel products. Long steel prices remain unchanged, a SAIL spokesperson said.

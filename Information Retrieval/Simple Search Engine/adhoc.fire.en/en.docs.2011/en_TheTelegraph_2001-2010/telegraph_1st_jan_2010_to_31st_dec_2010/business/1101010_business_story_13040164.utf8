The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Concerted bid to avert currency clash
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Concerted bid to avert currency clash
                                US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner (top) and French finance minister Christine Lagarde in Washington on Friday. (Reuters)                           
	Washington, Oct. 9 (Reuters): Global finance chiefs have stepped up efforts to prevent tensions over currency valuations that threaten to derail a fragile economic recovery and stressed the need to find ways to rebalance global growth.        
	Ministers from the Group of 20 nations on Friday repeated a call for export powerhouses, such as China, to spend more at home so that indebted countries, like the United States, can rebuild their finances without risking a still-fragile global recovery.        
	The International Monetary Fund, which held talks with the Group of Seven rich countries, was seeking support for a more active role in monitoring the worlds major economies. Officials worry that a weak US dollar and relatively strong currencies elsewhere could push nations into a round of currency depreciations to help their exports.        
	The dollar fell to a 15-year low against the yen on Friday after a US report of more job losses cemented expectations of a further loosening in an already-easy US monetary policy. The uneven pattern of global growth has seen US interest rates cut to nearly zero, driving capital into emerging markets and prompting talk of a currency war. At the same time, China has allowed its yuan currency to rise only slowly.        
	Im not in the mind or in the mood for war, this is totally inadequate, inappropriate and unnecessary, French finance minister Christine Lagarde said. The US urged the IMF to act as a more forceful global overseer. Finance chiefs were working towards giving the Fund a redefined role, possibly by the time G20 political leaders meet in Korea in November.        
	The IMFs managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, sought support for a systemic stability initiative to keep a closer watch on the largest economies and ensure they do not put the world in danger of financial crisis again.        
	US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner called on the IMF to speak out effectively about challenges and marshal support for action.         
	Taking a jab at China, Geithner complained that foreign exchange intervention by countries trying to keep undervalued currencies from appreciating threatened the global recovery. China pushed back by saying it will move ahead with exchange-rate reforms at its own pace.        
	Voting power        
	India today pitched for a revision of the quota formula in the IMF based on purchasing power parity and demanded a 5-6 per cent increase in voting power for emerging economies in the 186-nation multilateral agency. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said the existing flawed quota formula should be revised in a separate time-bound programme.

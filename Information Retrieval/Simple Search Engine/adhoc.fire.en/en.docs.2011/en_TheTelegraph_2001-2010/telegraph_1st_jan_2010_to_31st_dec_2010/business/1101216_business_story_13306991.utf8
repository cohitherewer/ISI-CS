          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 15: MOIL Ltd  the state-run manganese ore producer  today made a sparkling debut on the bourses with the stock closing with gains of over 24 per cent to its issue price after surging nearly 58 per cent in intra-day trades.        
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the MOIL share ended at Rs 466.50 after opening strong at Rs 551. It rose to an intra-day high of Rs 591.05.         
	On the National Stock Exchange, the share listed at a premium at Rs 565 and rose to the days peak of Rs 590 before closing at Rs 464.20.         
	MOIL had come out with an initial public offering (IPO) last month at the price band of Rs 340 to 375 per share. The offering was well received by investors and was subscribed 56 times. The issue price was later fixed at Rs 375 per share, which meant the IPO yielded about Rs 1,260 crore.         
	The Union government has diluted 10 per cent of its stake in MOIL, while the Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh governments have shed 5 per cent each.        
	Market circles said profit taking by high net worth individuals could be one of the reasons why the share sank below the Rs 500-mark in intra-day trades.        
	MOIL chairman and managing director K.J. Singh said the company was planning to invest around Rs 1,200 crore over the next four to five years to expand ore capacity and raise ferro alloy production.        
	We plan to invest nearly Rs 1,200 crore over the next 4-5 years to up our production capacity of manganese ore to 1.5 million tonnes by 2016 from the existing 1.1 million tonnes. We will be investing nearly Rs 150 crore in the production of ferro-alloy for which we have entered into joint ventures with the Steel Authority of India and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, Singh said.        
	The firm will invest nearly Rs 770 crore for capacity expansion and will make an additional investment of Rs 50 crore to Rs 60 crore for automation of equipment. MOIL was also planning to venture into overseas markets, he said.

	Calcutta, June 17: The government has sought Korean expertise to improve power transmission and distribution (T amp;D) infrastructure and reduce losses, which stand at 29.9 per cent of total supply.         
	Union minister of state for power Bharatsinh Solanki said he had recently taken a delegation to Korea, and a lot of T amp;D equipment manufacturers there were interested in investing in India. He was speaking at a seminar organised by the Merchant Chamber of Commerce here today,         
	T amp;D losses in Korea stand at 3.9 per cent, one of the lowest in the world. So, the power ministry has decided to adopt the Korean technology to pare losses in India. A Korean delegation, including the members of Kapco, one of the leading Korean firm, will visit Delhi and Mumbai in October to meet representatives of Indian distribution firms, Solanki said, adding that the Korean and Indian firms could enter into joint ventures.         
	We are also setting up a working group where representatives of the power ministry will be there, along with those from the Korean government and the ministry of external affairs, he said.        
	The target is to bring down the losses to 15 per cent by 2012. A reduction in losses is equivalent to adding new capacity of a similar amount, he said.        
	Moloy De, managing director of the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd, said the T amp;D losses in Bengal could be brought down to 9 per cent without any major investment.         
	We suffer a loss of 22 per cent. It is 15 per cent if one takes together other licencees such as CESC, DPL, DPSC and DVC, he said.         
	During the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2012-17), the government aims to add 1 lakh mega watt of capacity, Solanki said.         
	CESC plan        
	CESC will invest around Rs 800 crore to strengthen its distribution network and accommodate new customers by 2012.        
	Dilip Sen, executive director (commercial and mains), said, We are adding around 80,000 customers every year and need to create additional capacity to cater to them. CESC had invested about Rs 600 crore to augment its network in 2009-10. We have also decided to add 100 km of cables in the next two years, Sen said.

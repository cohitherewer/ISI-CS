The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crisil sees hike in deposit rates
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Crisil sees hike in deposit rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Attractive scheme                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 11: Banks are expected to raise their deposit rates further, larding the benefits they have already extended to savers.         
	Rating agency Crisil said banks were likely to announce more hikes in the next few months. These increases can be sharp if credit offtake revives substantially, it added.        
	This may be accentuated if the central bank announces any further rate hike in the second half, Crisil said in a report released today.        
	So far, state-owned and private banks have raised deposit rates on two occasions by at least 50-100 basis points.         
	Crisil said banks were likely to announce fresh hikes in deposit rates in the second half of 2010-11 as credit growth started to get stronger.        
	The response of Indias banks to the steady monetary tightening policy pursued by the Reserve Bank of India has been measured and gradual in the first half of the year.         
	The RBI is set to announce its monetary policy on November 2. Banking pundits are expecting the apex bank to raise key policy rates by another 25 basis points to tame inflation.         
	In its mid-quarter policy review last month, the RBI had raised the rates by 25 basis points and 50 basis points, prompting banks to increase both their deposit and lending rates this month.        
	Since March, the RBI has raised the repo and reverse repo rates by 100 and 150 basis points, respectively. The reverse repo is the rate at which it absorbs liquidity from banks and repo is the rate at which it provides money to banks.        
	Crisil said deposit rates had risen, on an average, by only 50 basis points during the first half of 2010-11 and thus the increases in benchmark rates were yet to be fully transmitted to the deposit rates.        
	It said this was because the aggregate bank credit had grown 4.3 per cent (not annualised) during the five months ended September 10. Though this growth is higher than the 1.3 per cent growth witnessed in the corresponding period of the previous year, it is lower than the expectations of the banking industry.                                
	According to Suman Chowdhury, HeadCRISIL Ratings, Credit offtake will be substantially higher in the second half of 2010-11. This is because credit demand in India is by nature back-ended, given the festive and agricultural harvest seasons in the second half of each year. Moreover, banks have sanctioned loans to a slew of large infrastructure projects, which have obtained the necessary approvals and mobilised equity, and may now begin to draw down loans.        
	He added that the deposit rates at 6.50 to 7.75 per cent for tenures up to a year among commercial banks are modest, and given the steady high inflation, translate into negative real interest rates. Thus, the deposit rates will need to be more attractive for inflows to revive.

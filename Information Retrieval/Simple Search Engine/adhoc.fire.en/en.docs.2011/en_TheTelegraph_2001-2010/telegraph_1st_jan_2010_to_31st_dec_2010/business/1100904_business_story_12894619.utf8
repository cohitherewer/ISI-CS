          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: The state-run Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is likely to retain the 8.5 per cent interest rate for its five crore subscribers for the current financial year.         
	Besides, the EPFO is unlikely to decide in favour of investing in the stock market contrary to suggestions by the finance ministry to adopt a more liberal strategy, said sources.         
	The EPFO board will meet on September 15.        
	Last year, the finance ministry had suggested that up to 15 per cent of the Rs 3-lakh-crore provident fund corpus could be invested in equities.        
	In July, finance secretary Ashok Chawla had written to labour secretary P.C. Chaturvedi, pointing out that the EPFO was not following the finance ministrys suggestion regarding investment of funds in various securities and instruments.        
	In a recent meeting, the EPFOs key advisory body  the finance and investment committee  ruled against investing in stocks. The panels recommendations are generally accepted by the EPFO board.        
	The labour ministry today said it would abide by the decision of the Central Board of Trustees (CBT)  the apex decision making body of the EPFO  regarding investment in stocks.         
	The CBT decision will determine whether the EPFO should invest in stock markets or not. The board will soon take up the issue, Harish Rawat, minister of state for labour, told reporters today at an industry event.         
	The EPFO invests in central and state government securities as well as in public sector undertakings and financial institutions. We are careful in investing the money of our workers. People call us very conservative, but the safety of the principal amount (deposits) of workers is most important, labour secretary P.C. Chaturvedi had said recently.

	New Delhi, May 18: GAIL is planning a petrochemical joint venture in Egypt at an investment of $1.7 billion and scouting for more overseas energy assets.        
	Negotiations are on with Egyptian Petrochemical Holding Company for the project in Port Said, which is near the Suez Canal. The project will have a cracker capacity of 300KTA (annual kilo tonnes).        
	The proposals are at a preliminary stage, said B.C. Tripathi, chairman and managing director of GAIL.        
	GAIL is already present in Egypt through Fayum Gas, Shell CNG and National Gas  entities in which it holds equity stakes.         
	Tripathi said, We are keen on expanding our presence in Egypt soon.        
	Sources said the company was also exploring opportunities in piped natural gas and gas processing in the northern African nation.         
	Analysts said Indian state-owned firms were trying to secure oil and gas assets overseas to meet the countrys rising energy demand.        
	GAIL has also been short-listed by the Nigerian government for its ambitious gas development project.        
	Nigeria, which holds the worlds seventh-largest reserves of proven natural gas, is keen to develop the sector under its Gas Master Plan.        
	In Nigeria, we, along with partners Total and Shell, have been shortlisted as one of the companies to develop the gas plan, sources said.         
	Nigeria will pick one of the shortlisted firms, which will make investments of $30 billion in developing the reserves and transporting them to power firms as well as export in the form of LNG.         
	The project involves building three gas gathering plants and transporting the gas through pipelines, one of which will traverse the Sahara for supply to Europe.        
	GAIL wants to expand its city gas distribution network in Egypt and is in talks with the authorities in Ghana.        
	A proposal has come from Papua New Guinea for a piped gas project.         
	Due diligence study is being conducted before taking a final decision, sources said.

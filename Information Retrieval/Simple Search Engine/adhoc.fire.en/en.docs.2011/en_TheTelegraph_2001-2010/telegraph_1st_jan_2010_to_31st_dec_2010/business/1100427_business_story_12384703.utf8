          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 26: Shareholders of Sterlite Industries (India) have reason to cheer. The non-ferrous metals producer today declared a 1:1 bonus issue even as it came out with better-than-expected numbers for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2010.         
	The company also announced a stock split with the face value of shares being reduced to Re 1 per share from Rs 2.        
	The announcement coupled with its fourth-quarter results sent its shares soaring on the bourses. On the BSE, the stock gained nearly 6 per cent, or Rs 47.30, to close at Rs 842.50.        
	Sterlite has been a key beneficiary of rising commodity prices because of the global economic recovery, and this was reflected in its fourth-quarter numbers when net profit after exceptional items surged to Rs 1,381 crore, up 131 per cent from Rs 598 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.         
	Analysts had expected the company to report profit in the region of Rs 1,200 crore. It added that net sales during the period rose 64 per cent to touch Rs 7,111 crore (Rs 4,336 crore).        
	The bonus issue from Sterlite was a surprise. We may see more number of companies, particularly those having a very strong balance sheet proposing bonus issues in the days ahead, an analyst said.        
	Last week, Wipro declared a bonus issue in the ratio of 2:3, and earlier Rallis India and Engineers India announced bonus issues in the ratio of 1:2 and 2:1, respectively. The analyst said Sterlites decision to go in for a stock split would improve its liquidity, thus helping retail investors.        
	For the year ended March 31, 2010, Sterlite recorded a profit of Rs 3,744 crore (Rs 3,540 crore) and net sales of Rs 24,410 crore (Rs 21,144 crore).        
	Sterlite said in its zinc business, mined metal production during the quarter and the year stood at 1.94 lakh tonnes and 7.69 lakh tonnes, respectively.         
	During the year, the company recorded its highest mined metal production, close to the rated capacity.         
	Refined metal production during the quarter and the year were 1.70 lakh tonnes and 6.50 lakh tonnes, respectively.         
	Improved operational efficiencies have helped Sterlite to achieve its highest annual refined metal production. During the quarter, average zinc prices grew to $2,288 per tonne from $1,174 per tonne in the year-ago period.         
	In copper, revenues for the quarter and the fiscal were Rs 3,653 crore and Rs 13,063 crore, respectively, against Rs 2,260 crore and Rs 11,530 crore last year.

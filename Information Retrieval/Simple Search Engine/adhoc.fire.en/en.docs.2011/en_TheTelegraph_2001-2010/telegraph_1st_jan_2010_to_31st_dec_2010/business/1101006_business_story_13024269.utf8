          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: Mobile newcomer Uninor along with Vodafone and BSNL have added more subscribers than market leader Airtel in August, with each capturing more than 12 per cent of the 18.18 million new subscribers.        
	Vodafone-Essar added 2.30 million users to take its subscriber base to 113.77 million, while state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam added over 2.25 million users in August, taking its user base to 76.03 million.         
	Uninor added 2.22 million users to become the third player to attract more than 12 per cent share of the total additions in August.        
	Analysts said in a market crowded by 14 operators, Uninor, Vodafone and BSNL have added more subscribers because of novel tariff plans and the PSUs rollout of high-speed 3G services.        
	With the implementation of mobile number portability next month, it would become more difficult for players to retain and add customers.        
	Idea, Aircel and Tata DoCoMo will use the MNP opportunity to target Bhartis and Vodafones high-revenue customers, said Ganesh Duvvuri, telecom analyst with Edelweiss, in a report.         
	Overall, telecom operators added 18.18 million subscribers in August, taking the total number of mobile users in India to 670.60 million, said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).        
	According to regulators data, the wireless subscriber base increased from 652.42 million in July to 670.60 million by the end of August, translating into a growth of 2.79 per cent.         
	The total number of telephone subscribers (both mobile and landline) increased to 706.37 million by August-end from 688.38 million in July.         
	With this, the overall teledensity (telephones per 100 people) touched 59.63 per cent.         
	Market leader Airtel added 2.03 million users, taking its subscriber base to 141.25 million, while Idea Cellular and Aircel added 1.98 million and 1.61 million subscribers, respectively.         
	Reliance Communications added two million subscribers, while Tata Teleservices had 2.09 million new users.

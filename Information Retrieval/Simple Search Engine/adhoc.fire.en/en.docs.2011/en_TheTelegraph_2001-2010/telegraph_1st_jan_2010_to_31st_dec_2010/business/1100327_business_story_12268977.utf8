          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	New Delhi, March 26: Growth of core industries slowed to 4.5 per cent in February from 9.5 per cent in the preceding month, raising concerns about the near-term sustainability of higher industrial growth.         
	However, on a year-on-year basis, growth was higher than the meagre 1.9 per cent in February last year.        
	Finished steel and cement were the worst performers, barely managing to expand 0.9 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively, in February against 2.4 per cent and 8.3 per in the year-ago period.         
	Petroleum refinery products grew a meagre 0.8 per cent from 0.5 per cent a year earlier.        
	Given these numbers, I think the IIP (index of industrial production) figures will come down in the coming months, D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil, said.         
	The six key sectors  crude, petroleum refinery products, coal, electricity, cement and finished steel  have a weight of 26.68 per cent in the total industrial output.        
	Electricity and crude oil were the top performers growing 7.3 per cent and 4 per cent against 0.6 per cent and a negative 6.2 per cent, respectively.         
	During April-February 2009-10, the core industries grew 5.3 per cent against 2.9 per cent in the same period last year.        
	The overall trend is that industry is performing better than last year and is on a recovery path. However, there could be month-to-month variation, but that should not cause much worry, N.R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy said.

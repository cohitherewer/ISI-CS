The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Anil firm stares at shell status
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Anil firm stares at shell status
          PIYA SINGH                          Anil Ambani: Tough time                                  
	Mumbai, May 8: The Supreme Court judgment on the Ambani gas tussle has virtually reduced the Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) to a shell company.        
	The court has directed the two Ambani brothers to renegotiate the gas supply agreement within the ambit of government policy that includes the gas utilisation policy and the empowered group of ministers (E-GoM) decisions.         
	Government policy so far does not allow for allocation of gas from the KG-D6 basin to plants which are in the pipeline. That means RNRL, a company whose future depends on the allocation of gas from Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Ltd, will have to wait for years before it can actually engage in this business.        
	RNRL chairman Anil Ambani in the past had pointed out this eventuality if the gas verdict did not go in the companys favour.         
	After the Bombay High Court judgment on the fight for gas, RNRL chairman Anil Ambani said, Our company was formed solely for the supply of gas from RIL to our group companies for power and other projects. Hence, the gas supply contracts are critical for the future of RNRL.        
	Unfortunately, RNRL will become a shell company if the gas supply contract is not honoured, as has been observed by Bombay High Court in its judgment, he said.        
	On Saturday RNRL declined to comment on the issue.        
	Besides being a company that was set up after the demerger of Reliance Industries to supply gas from RIL to the Anil Ambani group companies, RNRL owns four coal bed methane blocks and an oil and gas block in Mizoram that was awarded under Nelp-VI.        
	However, at this point that does not amount to much.         
	Analyst S.P. Tulsian, who has closely tracked these developments, said, Its evident that RNRL has been reduced to a shell company after the Supreme Court verdict. I would attribute a ball park value for its other business  the CBM blocks and oil block  at around Rs 1,500-2,000 crore compared with its current market capitalisation of roughly Rs 8,000 crore.        
	Others believe that the renegotiations will ensure that the interest of RNRL shareholders will be protected.         
	PricewaterhouseCoopers associate director Deepak Mahurkar who tracks the oil and gas sector said the renegotiation as directed by the Supreme Court was yet to take place.         
	It is more than likely that the interests of the RNRL shareholders would be protected as a result of this renegotiation process, he added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 14: Usha Martin plans to raise Rs 500 crore through a qualified placement issue. The fund-raising will help the company to reduce its debt.        
	At the end of the second quarter of the current fiscal, the company had a net debt of about Rs 1,600 crore.        
	The floor price of the issued has been fixed at Rs 85.90 per share, a 3.5 per cent discount to the closing price of Rs 89.10 on the BSE today.        
	Equirus Capital and Edelweiss Capital are the lead managers to the issue.        
	The fund-raiser comes at a time the company, owned by the Jhawars, is about to complete a Rs 2,100-crore expansion exercise. The company had last raised funds about four years ago.        
	The expansion, which includes hiking speciality steel capacity to 600,000 tonnes from 350,000 tonnes now, is being funded by Rs 1,400 crore of debt and Rs 700 crore of equity and internal accruals.        
	Once the new facility is ready, Usha Martin expects a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore on the basis of present realisations.        
	For the third quarter, the company has posted a 31 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 18.42 crore and a 17.2 per cent drop in revenue at Rs 439.87 crore.        
	However, profit was up 25.73 per cent compared with the second quarter of this year, while revenue was down 9.45 per cent.

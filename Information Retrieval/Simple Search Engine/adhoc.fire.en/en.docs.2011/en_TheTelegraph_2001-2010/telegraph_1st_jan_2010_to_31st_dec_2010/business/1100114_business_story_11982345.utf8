The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jindals in mining pact with US firm
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Jindals in mining pact with US firm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Growth drill                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 13: Jindal Steel amp; Power Ltd (JSPL) has tied up with Nasdaq-listed Massey Energy of the US to develop and operate underground coal mines.        
	The Indian company will seek Masseys assistance in potential domestic projects as well as those in Mongolia, Australia and the US.        
	Under the agreement announced today, Jindal will identify projects and obtain licences, permits and approvals from the governments, while the US coal producer will provide technical and mining expertise.        
	Massey will also be responsible for developing detailed plans, and providing technical manpower and project management. We believe there is great potential for synergies between Massey and JSPL, Massey chairman and chief executive Don Blankenship said.        
	The development comes at a time JSPL is scouting for coal mines abroad. The company is bidding for Australian coking coal company Rocklands Richfield and a virgin block in Mongolia.        
	It is also putting up a coal-to-liquid-energy project in Orissa where surface mining is more popular than underground mining. However, the local miners are increasingly taking to underground mining because of the fast depletion of surface reserves.         
	Masseys technology could also come in handy for Jindal Power Ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of JSPL  which operates a thermal power plant and plans to set up some more. In most cases, the company will be developing captive coal mines.        
	Massey operates 35 underground mines and 12 surface mines in West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia.        
	Two years ago, Massey had announced a strategic alliance with Essar Mineral Resources Ltd, a member of the Essar group, to evaluate and develop select business opportunities on a project-by-project basis.        
	The partnership was initially focused on the development of coal reserves, coke ovens and a coal-preparation plant for an electric power plant to be set up in India by Essar.

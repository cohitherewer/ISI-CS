The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Recovery on shaky ground

	Calcutta, April 24: The countrys economy is recovering though there are doubts about its sustainability, chief statistician Pronab Sen today said.        
	At an event organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce, Sen said, The fiscal and monetary stimuli should not be totally withdrawn until the sustainability of the recovery is ascertained.        
	Latest IIP numbers show that while the production of consumer durables has grown 30 per cent, non-durables have risen only one per cent.         
	According to Sen, higher output of non-durables is the real indicator of the broadening of market and lifestyle consumption compared to consumer durables which are one-off purchases.        
	Data with the department of industrial policy and promotion also do not indicate any fresh investment.         
	What is happening on the investment front is a bunching effect. There is a serious question on the sustainability of the recovery process, Sen said.        
	A revival in consumption will be key to a sustainable economic recovery. A near normal monsoon, as predicted by the meteorological department, may change consumer psyche and help in a strong revival of demand, particularly in the rural sector, said Sen.         
	Domestic consumption can take the GDP growth to 8 per cent or 8.5 per cent which is very much on the cards for 2010-11. Anything more than that has to come from the export sector, Sen added.         
	For financial year 2009-10, Sen said GDP growth was expected to be 7.2 per cent.         
	New inflation index        
	New comprehensive consumer price inflation indices for urban and rural sectors will be ready early next year, Sen said. At present, there are four indices.         
	We started collecting data for the urban sector from June 2009 and that for the rural sector from October 2009. We hope to come out with the new indices early 2011, Sen said.

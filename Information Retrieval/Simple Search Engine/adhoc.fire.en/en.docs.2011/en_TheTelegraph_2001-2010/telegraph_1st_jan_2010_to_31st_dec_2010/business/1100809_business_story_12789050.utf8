          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 8: Higher gas prices and lower subsidy payments are expected to boost the financials of upstream oil firms ONGC and OIL, which posted disappointing first-quarter results.        
	Both Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) reported lower-than-expected numbers, with their topline and net profit taking a knock in the first quarter ended June 30. ONGCs net sales declined 8 per cent to Rs 13,710 crore and net profit fell nearly 25 per cent to Rs 3,661 crore.         
	OIL  the countrys second largest explorer  reported a 21 per cent drop in net sales at Rs 1,523 crore. Net profit came down 32 per cent to Rs 501 crore.        
	The poor performance has been attributed to a higher subsidy burden, which led to a drop in earning on each barrel of crude sold.         
	While ONGCs earning came down to $48 per barrel from $58 per barrel in the year-ago quarter, OILs stood at $49.7 per barrel, lower than $55.7 per barrel a year ago.        
	Under the subsidy-sharing mechanism, upstream oil firms  ONGC, OIL and GAIL  have to share the under-recoveries of PSU oil retailers from selling fuel below cost. The share of the trio is implemented through a discount on crude sold to the marketers.         
	In the first three months of this fiscal, the three upstream firms bore nearly 33 per cent of the subsidy burden.         
	 During this period, according to analysts, their burden surged to Rs 6,690 crore from Rs 561 crore in the same period last year. ONGC had to shell out Rs 5,516 crore as subsidy.        
	However, analysts believe the picture will begin to change from the current quarter. The second quarter earnings outlook for upstream PSUs is bright and we expect their net income to improve, a report from brokerage Sharekhan states.         
	The brokerage said the subsidy burden during this quarter would be 36 per cent lower on a sequential basis at Rs 12,931 crore because of the deregulation in petrol prices and a hike in the price of diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG with effect from June 25.        
	While this is expected to improve the net realisation of both ONGC and OIL, the report said the full impact of a 133 per cent hike in administered gas prices (APM) would also be visible from the current quarter.         
	The Centre had recently increased the price of APM gas to bring it on a par with the price of Reliance Industries gas from the Kishna-Godavari basin.                    
	Deepak Pareek, analyst at Angel Broking, said ONGCs performance would be better in the coming quarters.

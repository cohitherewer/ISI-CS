	Calcutta, Aug. 9: Macquarie SBI has picked up an 18.8 per cent stake in unlisted Adhunik Power and Natural Resources Co Ltd, which is developing a merchant power project in Jamshedpur.        
	Macquarie SBI is going to invest Rs 125 crore in the Adhunik Metaliks-promoted company.        
	The cost of the project is Rs 2,650 crore, which is being funded in a 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio. The loan requirement of Rs 1,987 crore has already been tied up.        
	The promoters will bring in Rs 288 crore as equity in the venture. They had received Rs 250 crore from IDFC Project Equity Company last year.        
	With this investment, the equity requirement for the first phase of 540 mega watt is fully covered. The promoters have invested Rs 170 crore and the rest will be done in the next few months, Manoj Agarwal, managing director of Adhunik Metaliks, said.        
	The power plant will go on stream by January 2012. Agarwal said the capacity would be doubled eventually to 1,080MW. Varun Vajpai, CEO of Macquarie SBI, said he was pleased with the investment.

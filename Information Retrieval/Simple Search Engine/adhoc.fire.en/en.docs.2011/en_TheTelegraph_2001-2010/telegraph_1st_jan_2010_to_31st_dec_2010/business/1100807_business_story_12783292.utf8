The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Apple in deal talks with China firm
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Apple in deal talks with China firm
                                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Apple is in talks to buy Chinese software maker Handseeing, an executive at the Chinese company said today.         
	The deal will mark the iPhone makers first acquisition in that country.        
	We should have a decision in about one or two months, Tian Bo, vice-president for operations, said. They are still talking about it and its not quite settled right now. He declined to give more details.        
	Apple spokesperson Jill Tan did not comment.         
	Handseeing is a little-known gaming company with its headquarters in southwest Chinas Sichuan province. It designs online games based on popular Chinese folklore.        
	If realised, the deal could point to an effort by Apple to push harder into the gaming or China markets.        
	In China, Apple operates two retail stores in Beijing and Shanghai and is on track to have 25 such outlets by the end of next year. It also sells its iconic iPhone through mobile operator China Unicom Ltd.        
	The maker of the iPhone and iMac computers has nearly $46 billion in cash, the biggest cash hoard among the US technology companies and roughly equivalent to a fifth of its total market capitalisation.        
	Unlike Hewlett-Packard Co and Oracle Corp, Apple has made few major acquisitions in the past, primarily because most of its products have been developed internally.

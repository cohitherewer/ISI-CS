The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Penalty punch for spectrum loss
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Penalty punch for spectrum loss
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: Embroiled in a controversy over distributing spectrum cheap, the government may ask telecom operators to pay an additional amount, over and above the Rs 1,651 crore they have already paid as licence fee in 2008.         
	The CAG had earlier raised questions on the pricing of 2G spectrum allocated with the licence.         
	Sources said it seemed the government had realised that there had been a loss to the exchequer because of the grant of licences in 2008. It will look at a formula to arrive at the true value of 2G spectrum to compensate the public exchequer, they said.        
	However, the government is unlikely to accept Trais suggestion to cancel some of the permits granted in 2008 because the operators have failed to meet rollout obligations.         
	Cancelling licences is not a solution... Telecom is an important industry and cannot be destroyed, the sources said.         
	Telecom minister Kapil Sibal had said he would be looking at Trais recommendations, and officials said a major review was on.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) yesterday sent an internal note to the department of telecom (DoT), recommending that 69 licences, allocated to six firms in 2008, should be cancelled as they failed to meet rollout obligations. Various licences of Aircel, Uninor, Videocon, Sistema, Etisalat DB and Loop Telecom are under Trais scanner for not meeting obligations.        
	Sibal has asked the ministry to prepare a note on Trais recommendations. It is an exhaustive report and the DoT has to study it in detail, look at all conditions...study whether it has any power to cancel licences and also consequences of that action on the sector as a whole, before coming to any decision, sources said.        
	Sources added that the companies that had failed to roll out services in various circles could be asked to pay a penalty but mobile permits might not be scrapped.        
	Under the licence conditions, the DoT can impose a fine of Rs 5 lakh a week for the first 13 weeks of delay, Rs 10 lakh for the next 13 weeks, and thereafter at the rate of Rs 20 lakh for delays up to 26 weeks.        
	According to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), the six new players obtained spectrum between April 2008 and January 2009, but none of them had launched services till December 31, 2009. It resulted effectively in hoarding of the finite resource by these operators, the CAG said.        
	2G pricing formula        
	To calculate the true value of 2G spectrum, sources said, the formula could be partly based on 3G market prices or some other parameter, which needs to be decided, and companies asked to pay the extra amount.        
	Industry players have aggressively contested any move to link the price of 2G spectrum to the market value of high-speed 3G radio waves.        
	Trai is also preparing its recommendations on the pricing of additional 2G spectrum, which will be studied by the DoT before reaching any conclusion.         
	The telecom ministry has put a ban on the allocation of 2G spectrum to all operators till it finalises a mechanism for pricing this resource. The domestic telecom sector is the fastest growing in the world, adding more than 15 million wireless subscribers a month.

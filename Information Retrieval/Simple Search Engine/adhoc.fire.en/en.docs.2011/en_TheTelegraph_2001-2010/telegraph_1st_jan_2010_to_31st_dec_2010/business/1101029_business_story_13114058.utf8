          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Oct. 28: Moser Baer has decided to drop its photovoltaic project in Fab City here. Fab City is a semiconductor and solar energy hub.         
	Prospects of political instability over Telangana have forced many multinational companies to slow down or wind up operations in the city.         
	The Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) had launched the Fab City project in 2006 and allotted 1,074 acres to a global facilitator. Around 33 global companies evinced interest in the project, but only 14 made investments of Rs 680 crore.         
	Moser Baer, which took over 100 acres in November 2009, had failed to pay Rs 15 crore towards the lease even after several reminders and notices.         
	The lease was cancelled, and the government took over the land.         
	Moser Baer wanted to set up a photovoltaic facility at an estimated investment of $500-700 million with a production capacity of about 500MW as part of its plan to set up 1 gigawatt capacity in the country.        
	Latest reports say that the company has plans to increase its capacity in Chennai.

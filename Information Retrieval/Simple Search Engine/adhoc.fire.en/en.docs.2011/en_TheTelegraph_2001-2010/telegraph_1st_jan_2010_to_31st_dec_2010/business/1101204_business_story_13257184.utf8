The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telecom newbies go slow on stake sale 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Telecom newbies go slow on stake sale 
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Put on hold                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: New telecom operators have put their stake sale plans on hold as the government has questioned their eligibility to provide mobile services.        
	Many new operators, including Videocon and Loop Telecom, were looking at a stake sale to stay afloat as the sector struggles with intense competition and very low call charges that are hurting earnings.        
	The new players, who got licences in 2008, are not allowed to sell promoters equity till 2011. But the ongoing investigation by the department of telecom (DoT) will make it difficult for these firms to sell stakes even after the lock-in period.        
	The DoT has issued showcause notices to Loop Telecom, Unitech Wireless, Etisalat DB, Videocon and STel and given them two months to explain their inadequacy to meet eligibility norms while applying for a permit.        
	It would be difficult for new players to sell equity stake till the government resolves the licensing issues, Mahesh Uppal, director of telecom consulting firm Com First, said.        
	The uncertainty in the sector is also hampering the entry of global operators such as the US-based AT amp;T, French firm Vivendi and Telefonica of Spain, who were looking at buying into one of the operators.        
	Earlier this year, Videocon had said it might sell up to a 26 per cent stake in its telecom venture to foreign players.        
	Investors are following the wait and watch approach for now given the regulatory overhang, said Supito Basu, an independent telecom analyst.        
	Last year, the industry witnessed many mergers and acquisitions, with 33 deals valued at $10.45 billion as Vodafone Group, NTT DoCoMo and Norways Telenor made purchases. In 2008, there were 28 deals worth $4.3 billion.        
	Analysts said apart from resolving the current controversies surrounding the sector, M amp;A rules also needed to be modified to encourage more consolidation.                    
	Existing regulations make mergers difficult as telecom firms cannot hold more than a 10 per cent stake in another company that has operations in the same circle. Besides, telecom firms cannot buy out their rivals that have operations in the same states as current rules do not allow operators to have more than one licence in a circle.         
	Trai chairman J.S. Sarma had earlier said that mergers are imperative to spur growth and investment in the capital intensive telecom sector. However, changes in M amp;A rules would have to be a studied process, he said.        
	Industry analysts said as average revenue per user decline, markets start to slowly saturate, and mobile telephony moves from the current land grab mentality to a fight for switching high-paying customers between competing mobile networks, the sector would be more efficient if it moved to 6-8 top players on an all-India basis through consolidation.

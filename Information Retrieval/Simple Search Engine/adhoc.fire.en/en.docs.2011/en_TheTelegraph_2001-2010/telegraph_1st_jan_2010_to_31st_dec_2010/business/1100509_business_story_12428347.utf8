	Mumbai, May 8 (Reuters): The Supreme Court verdict on the RIL-RNRL gas case on Friday could upset investment plans of foreign investors.        
	Energy-hungry India wants to reduce its dependence on foreign oil and become a new frontier for oil and gas exploration, and has showcased the Krishna Godavari discovery to attract foreign investment.        
	Giving the government control over pricing could, however, put off overseas investors looking for more marketing freedom to pump in the billions of dollars needed for exploration.        
	Anil Ambani had earlier said the petroleum ministrys efforts to control the pricing and sale of gas was the reason for a poor response to the governments auction of oil and gas exploration blocks last year.

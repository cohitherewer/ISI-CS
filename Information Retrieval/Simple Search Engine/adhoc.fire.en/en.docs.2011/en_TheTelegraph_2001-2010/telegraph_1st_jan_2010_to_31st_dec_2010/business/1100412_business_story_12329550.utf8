The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | DHL wants to set up more   outlets
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      DHL wants to set up more   outlets
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Road to growth                                
	Mumbai, April 11: Logistics company DHL Express (India) Pvt Ltd plans to beef up its presence in the country.        
	DHL and Blue Dart Express together have around 400 centres in 100 towns. The plan is to set up over 1,000 outlets in the next three to five years.         
	DHL, which is an arm of Germanys Deutsche Post, holds a little over 80 per cent in Blue Dart. R.S. Subramanian, country manager for DHL Express India, told The Telegraph that the idea was to have outlets within the reach of anyone who has an international shipment requirement.         
	We would like to reach all pockets where there is an international shipment need, Subramanian said.        
	India holds a crucial place in DHLs global map. With the economy recovering steadily after the global slump, the express major is confident of further growth.        
	According to Subramanian, while the express sector saw signs of a rebound since August last year, the recovery has been broad-based in recent times.         
	DHL, which serves both retail and corporate customers for their shipment needs, has seen positive response from various industries such as engineering, automobiles and pharmaceuticals.        
	As far as the express industry is concerned, the thumb rule is that it grows 2-2.5 times the countrys GDP growth. We feel the industry will grow in double digits in India, Subramanian said. DHL focused on efficiencies and adopted various cost-efficiency measures last year when the industry was hammered by the slowdown.         
	We prepared for the future and we focused on our strengths. Now that the basic foundation is in place and we have the headstart over others, it will ensure that our lead (in the industry) will be maintained, Subramanian said.        
	DHL provides a host of express services such as same day and time definite delivery. It also provides value-added facilities such as customs clearance and airport ground services.

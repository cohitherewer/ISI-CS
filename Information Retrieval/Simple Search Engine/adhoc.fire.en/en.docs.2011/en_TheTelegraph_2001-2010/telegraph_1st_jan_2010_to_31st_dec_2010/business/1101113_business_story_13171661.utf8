          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharyya: Foreign plan                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 12: Coal India Ltd is considering buying mines of US-based Massey Energy Company, Peabody Energy Corporation and an Indonesian firm.         
	The countrys largest coal producer is doing the due diligence on deposits in a mine of Virginia-based Massey Energy.         
	Coal India had in August invited expressions of interest from overseas miners for strategic alliances, with or without equity participation, for long-term offtake.         
	Massey Energy had expressed interest following which we decided to pursue this proposal, a Coal India official said. We shall buy a mine of Massey Energy and not the whole company.         
	If the deal  expected to cost less than $1 billion  goes through, it will be Coal Indias first acquisition of a productive asset overseas. In August last year, the company had acquired two blocks in Mozambique, which has potential to produce coal.         
	The PSU seeks to ensure long-term supply of 50 million tonnes from abroad for which it has kept both options open equity participation and long-term purchase agreement on a cost-plus basis.        
	According to Coal India chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya, the company is considering three proposals with equity participation.         
	Coal India, which made its debut on the domestic bourses with a 40 per cent premium to the issue price of Rs 345 a share on November 4, has around Rs 39,000 crore in cash reserves as on June 30.         
	The company has kept aside $1.7 billion (approximately Rs 6,000 crore) for overseas buyouts. Coal India has been considering five proposals from miners from the US, Australia and Indonesia worth $1.7 billion.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Dipankar Mukhopadhyay, Bengal commerce secretary                          
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: PCR Chemicals is going to submit an application by the end of the month, seeking environment clearance for the proposed petroleum, chemical and petrochemical investment region (PCPIR) on Nayachar island.        
	The company, a joint venture between NRI businessman Prasoon Mukherjee-led New Kolkata International Development (NKID) and the Bengal government, has appointed 13 consultants, local and international, for an environment study that will be completed by September.        
	PCR Chemicals, armed with the report of the study, will then be in a position to approach the West Bengal Pollution Control Board for environment clearance, Dipankar Mukhopadhyay, Bengals commerce secretary, said.        
	The project, which was shifted to Nayachar island near Haldia from its original location in Nandigram following political violence, has drawn flak from a section of environmentalist who claim the chemical industry could endanger the marine biology of the Hooghly river estuary.        
	The application will set in motion a crucial phase in the development of PCPIR, popularly known as the chemical hub in Bengal.        
	The secretary said around half of the area of the island, approximately 6,000 acres, can be used for the development of industry going by the coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) classification.         
	The environment clearance, if and when it comes, will lay down the guidelines that PCR Chemicals must follow to set up industry on the island.         
	According to the CRZ guideline, industry can be built in CRZ-III area. No industry is allowed in CRZ-1, while light industry can come up in CRZ-II area.        
	Prasoon Mukherjee, director of Universal Success and majority owner of NKID, had in the past remained ambivalent about what he wanted to do at Nayachar.        
	Master plan        
	PCR Chemicals is yet to submit the master plan which will guide the industrial development on the island. The lease agreement signed between the Bengal government and PCR Chemicals had stipulated that the master plan would have to be submitted within six months.         
	Given that the lease was signed in November last year, the plan should have been submitted to the state by May. However, a right-to-information application made by social activist Utpal Roy revealed that the plan was yet to be ready.        
	Industry department officials said work on the detailed project report (DPR) is on and Tata Consulting Engineering has been entrusted with the job.        
	The government had given permissible possession of the land in February 2008 to PCR Chemicals and signed a lease deed for the land after 21 months.         
	However, the original agreement to develop a PCPIR was signed in 2006 keeping Nandigram in mind. NKID had given Rs 70 crore to WBIDC but the same was returned before the lease deed was signed in November 2009. No fresh agreement has been signed after that.        
	WBIDC has given 96 acres to NKID to build social infrastructure such as housing in Baruipur. It is not known if the land was provided to cross-subsidise the development cost of Nayachar.        
	Mukherjee could not be contacted for the report despite repeated attempts.

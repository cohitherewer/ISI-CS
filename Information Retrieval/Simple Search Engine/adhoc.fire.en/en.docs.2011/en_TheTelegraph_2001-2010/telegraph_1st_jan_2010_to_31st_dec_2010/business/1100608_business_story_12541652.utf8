	Chennai, June 7: Production at Hyundais Chennai plant came to a complete halt after a flash strike by employees, demanding reinstatement of 67 sacked employees and recognition of their union affiliated to Citu.        
	The workers stopped production at the companys plant at Sriperumbudur, 50 km from Chennai.         
	As a result of the sit-in strike by around 150 workers, the management of Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) is forced to suspend production today resulting in a loss of 2,200 cars worth around Rs 65 crore. HMIL management is seeking government intervention and has also approached the labour commissioners office for an early settlement of the dispute, a company statement said.         
	According to K. Thangapandiyan, vice-president of the Hyundai Motor India Employees Union, Production has stopped at the plant and nearly 1,500 workers are on strike asking for reinstatement of the dismissed colleagues.         
	The workers have also been seeking recognition of their Citu-affiliated union, a demand that was rejected by the management. State Citu leader A. Vardarajan issued a statement accusing the management of reneging on the agreement about reinstating the sacked employees.         
	The company, however, disputed the claim by saying that only 150-200 workers were on strike. Calling the strike illegal, HMIL said it would not give in to their demands as these employees had been dismissed for gross misconduct leading to damage of company property and violence against fellow workers.         
	The current strike is in violation of the orders of the district munsif cum judicial magistrate, Sriperumbudur, which prohibits any unlawful activity within the factory and within 100-metre radius of the factory premises, HMIL said.         
	In July last year, the management and striking workers had signed a wage settlement agreement.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Haldia, Feb. 24: Production was stalled at a Tata Chemicals unit here today after over 200 daily wage labourers belonging to a Citu union went on an indefinite strike demanding a monthly salary.         
	About 600 casual workers, also belonging to the union at the unit, have joined the strike.        
	Citu, which had earlier called a days token strike today, decided on an indefinite strike after a tripartite meeting to discuss their demand fell through. The wage labourers earn about Rs 200 daily on an average, but they dont work throughout the year.         
	We have told the management that 216 daily wage labourers will have to be paid a monthly salary. The management has rejected our demand and so we have called an indefinite strike, said Arjun Mondal, general secretary of the union.

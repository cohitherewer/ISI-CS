The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mittals south plan faces ore hurdle
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mittals south plan faces ore hurdle
          SAMBIT SAHA                          L.N. Mittal in Bangalore on Thursday. (AP)                                  
	Bangalore, June 3: Karnataka is willing to meet just one-third of a steel companys iron ore demand through captive mining facilities, which appears to run counter to steel czar Lakshmi Mittals insistence in setting up units only after owning a mine.         
	I would not look to build plants without captive mines in India, Mittal said after renewing his quest to build a steel unit in the country. Mittals projects in Jharkhand and Orissa have got bogged down in procedural hurdles.        
	His company  ArcelorMittal  wants to put up a 6-million-tonne plant in Karnataka at an investment of Rs 30,000 crore. He signed an MoU with the state government here at the Global Investors Meet, his third such agreement with as many states in the last five years.        
	Mittal, who has been expressing his disappointment over the slow progress of new projects in Jharkhand and Orissa, said he hoped to get land and iron ore mine approval in Karnataka soon.        
	However, a senior bureaucrat of the Karnataka government said no investor would get full allocation of the mines. We will offer them one-third of the known reserves and one-third by way of a prospecting licence. The rest they must buy from the market, he said. So, investors will have to start with only a third of their immediate requirement from captive sources.         
	They may hope to get another one-third after prospecting  exploring ore and determining reserves  followed by mining at a later date.         
	Will it put off investors who are looking to build plant after the full allocation of resources? No serious investor will go. Everyone knows it is not possible to give 100 per cent. Natural resources are finite and everyone must be taken care of, the bureaucrat said.        
	Apart from Mittal, Essar chairman Sashi Ruia and Neeraj Singhal, managing director of Bhushan Steel, signed MoUs for a 6-million-tonne plant each. Bengals Adhunik Metaliks also inked an agreement for a 2.2-million-tonne unit. Tomorrow, Tata Steel is likely to announce a project of 3 million tonnes.        
	Sajjan Jindals JSW Steel runs a 7-million-tonne facility in the southern state with only 20 per cent of captive ore. The company has asked for a greater allocation but in vain.         
	The cost of ore from self-owned mines is around Rs 500 a tonne compared with Rs 4,000 when bought from the market.

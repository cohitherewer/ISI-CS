The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Railway bid to reduce collision on fast track
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Railway bid to reduce collision on fast track
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          SAFE RIDE                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Indian Railways plans to install anti-collision devices across the country at a cost of Rs 8,100 crore after completing trials that begin tomorrow.         
	The final phase of trials begins on December 20 and the product will be ready for implementation across the country by the end of January 2011, Bhanu Tayal, managing director of the Konkan Railway Corporation, told reporters at Madgaon in Goa.        
	The anti-collision devices (ACD) are being designed and developed by Konkan Railway.        
	Tayal said the second phase of trials, with minor changes on 18 parameters as suggested by the Railway Board, would take place at Arakkonam near Chennai and would continue till the end of this month.        
	Konkan Railway officials expressed confidence that the ACDs, developed almost a decade ago, would be implemented soon as there is political will now.        
	The railways were criticised for delay in the implementation of the ACDs that could have prevented the collision between the Uttarbanga Express and Vananchal Express at Sainthia, claiming 62 lives.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee had given the project the go-ahead in January 2000 after riding a train on which the ACD was being tested. However, the project has not been scaled up since then.        
	So far, ACDs have been deployed over 736km on the Konkan route and another 1,730km on the Northeast Frontier Railway, which have difficult terrain, manual signalling and single non-electrified tracks.         
	In the first phase, the ACDs will be installed in the Southern, South Central, South Western and South Eastern Railways.        
	Countries such as South Africa, China, Russia and Singapore have evinced interest in the devices and are waiting for the implementation in large parts of the country, Ajaykumar A. Bhatt, executive director (signal and telecommunication) of Konkan Railway, said.

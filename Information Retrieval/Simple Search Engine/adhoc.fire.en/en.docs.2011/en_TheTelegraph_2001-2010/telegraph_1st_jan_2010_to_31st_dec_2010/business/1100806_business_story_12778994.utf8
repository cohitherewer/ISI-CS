          JAYATI GHOSE                          [+ucfirst('SAFETY DRIVE   SAFETY DRIVE')+]                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: The government is studying the possibility of installing sniffer softwares to decode data transferred via BlackBerry phones as well as Skype and Gmail.              
	A sniffer is a program that can read encrypted data when installed at gateways, which are nodes managed by telecom operators where data is transferred from one device to another. Messages, calls and emails sent through BlackBerry phones, Skype and Gmail are in a coded format, making it difficult for security agencies to understand the content.         
	While privacy is ensured, the agencies are worried that terror groups can misuse these services.        
	Officials in the department of telecom said a sniffer software was being tested by the National Security Advisor along with the National Test Research Organisation to provide security agencies access to data travelling through the smartphones. BlackBerry services are provided through mobile operators, who can install the sniffers at the gateways, said officials.        
	Another option being considered by BlackBerry maker Research In Motion (RIM) is to set up a proxy server in India where emails and data from the smartphones will be stored for six months and can be monitored. Thats how RIM has appeased officials in China and Singapore, the officials added.        
	The government had yesterday indicated that the onus of providing security agencies access to data was on the service providers.         
	Telecom minister A. Raja is confident that a solution will be reached soon. We have not reached an agreement so far. Hopefully, some solution will come out soon, he said.                                       
	Telecom service providers like Airtel, Vodafone, Tata Indicom and even the government-owned MTNL and BSNL who are providing BlackBerry service have to have in place a mechanism that allows security agencies to monitor and intercept phone calls and data transfers on these phones, in line with the conditions laid down in their licence agreement, the government has informed the service providers.         
	So far the government had been insisting to have a local server to host emails in India, but RIM, the makers of Blackberry, have cited problems in setting up country-specific servers.        
	Similar concerns were raised against BlackBerry devices two years ago but the issue was put on the backburner. However, official sources indicated that this time the concerns of the security agencies will have to be addressed with the home ministry pushing for a secure communication network.        
	Skype is a free service is used by a vast majority of urban middle class Indians for communicating with families and friends spread across the world, while Googles Gmail is a very popular email service in the country.         
	BlackBerry maker Research In Motion, Skype and Gmail services had come under the scanner, asking these companies to either ensure that data going through their networks be made available to security agencies in a readable format or face a ban from offering services in India.

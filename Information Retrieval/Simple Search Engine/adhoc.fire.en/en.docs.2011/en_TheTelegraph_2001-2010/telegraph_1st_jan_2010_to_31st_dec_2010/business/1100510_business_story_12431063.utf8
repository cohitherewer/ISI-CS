	Calcutta, May 9: BSNLs Calcutta Telephones aims to wipe out losses by March 2011, chief general manager A.K. Garg said.        
	The Calcutta circle of BSNL had suffered a loss of Rs 46 crore in 2008-09. It anticipates a loss of Rs 70 crore during 2009-10. The entity is expected to report a revenue of Rs 850 crore in 2009-10.         
	We are targeting a revenue of Rs 1,000 crore during 2010-11 and hope to cover up losses by the end of this fiscal, Garg said.        
	However, the Calcutta circle has seen a revenue drop of almost 10 per cent during the first three quarters of 2009-10.         
	The PSU, which had a turnover of Rs 933 crore in 2008-09, earned revenues of Rs 701 crore during the first nine months of 2008-09. Revenues during the first nine months of 2009-10 have come down to Rs 630 crore.         
	Most of the fall is because of the reduction in landline use, Garg said.         
	Landline tariff has been reduced to Rs 306 crore during the first nine months of 2009-10 from Rs 359 crore in the year-ago period.         
	There has also been a tariff reduction in the mobile phone segment. Although lots of subscribers were added, there had not been a corresponding increase in tariff, the company said.         
	According to Garg, Calcutta Telephones is banking on enterprise sales to boost growth.         
	We are offering dedicated optic fibre lines to offer high-speed broadband services to large enterprise customers. Other telecom services will also be offered through this, he said.         
	Calcutta Telephones, which targets at least 400 customers in the enterprise segment by the year-end, hopes to earn a revenue of Rs 120 crore during the year from this segment.        
	Broadband subscribers have also grown to 2.7 lakh during the period under review from 50,000 in the same period last year.         
	Customer service is an area of concern for us and we are working on making it better, he said. The company has launched a host of SMS-based offers, which enable subscribers to request a service by sending a text message.

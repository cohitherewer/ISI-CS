          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said the economy would grow 7.5 per cent in 2009-10, higher than the 7.2 per cent growth estimated by the Central Statistical Organisation.        
	The IIP (index of industrial production) figures for December suggest that we may end the year 2009-10 with a growth rate of 7.5 per cent and next year growth (could be) at over 8 per cent, he said at a seminar here.        
	The finance ministry had projected 7.75 per cent growth in December.         
	Mukherjee expects growth to marginally exceed the CSOs projection, driven mainly by a sharp rise in industrial output, which jumped 16.8 per cent in December compared with a decline of 0.2 per cent a year ago.        
	The government, meanwhile, is hoping that the winter crop will augment food supplies and put a brake on the rising prices of essential articles in the next couple of months.        
	We have taken adequate measures on the supply side, which will take some time to have the pressing impact on rising prices, particularly of essential commodities. I do hope that over a period of few months, it will be possible to have the moderate rate of inflation, Mukherjee said.        
	Rising prices have been posing a big challenge to the government.         
	The Reserve Bank of India may consider raising interest rates even before April to ease the situation.         
	Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of another programme, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said, We have to admit prices of important items such as rice, wheat, pulses and sugar are showing declining trends. The situation will change after March-end.

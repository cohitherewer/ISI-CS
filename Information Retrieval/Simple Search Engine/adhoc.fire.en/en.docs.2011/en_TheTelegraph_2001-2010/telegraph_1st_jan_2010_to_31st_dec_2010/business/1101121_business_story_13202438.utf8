          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Sunil Mitra in Calcutta   on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                          
	Calcutta, Nov. 20: Nearly 70,000 posts are lying vacant in the income tax and customs department, according to revenue secretary Sunil Mitra.        
	The vacancies could not be filled because the departments were unable to bring out the promotion list amid the controversy related to the 2G spectrum scandal, Mitra said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	Since the departmental promotions are being held up, vacancies at the lower grade could not be created at the moment and hence we cannot hire new people. However, we expect to do something before the end of the current financial year, Mitra said.        
	Earlier, addressing the gathering, he called for greater co-ordination among states for a smooth rollout of the goods and services tax.         
	The GST bill is expected to be tabled in Parliament in the budget session.        
	The rollout of GST, which will subsume excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT at the state front, besides local levies, has been hanging fire, ever since it missed an initial deadline of April 1, 2010.

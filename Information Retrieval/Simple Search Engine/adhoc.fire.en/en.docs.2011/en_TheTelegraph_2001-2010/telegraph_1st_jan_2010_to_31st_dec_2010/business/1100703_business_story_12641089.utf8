The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | HSBC buys RBS in India
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      HSBC buys RBS in India
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, July 2: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd (HSBC) today struck a deal with Royal Bank of Scotland, the largest government-owned bank in Britain, to buy its banking operations in India.        
	RBS Indian operations had a gross asset value of $1.8 billion as on March 31 this year.        
	HSBC Holdings  the parent of HSBC Ltd  said the deal would be subject to regulatory approvals and was likely to be completed by the first half of 2011.        
	RBS has about 1.1 million customers in India, 1800 employees and 31 branches, according to a statement put out by HSBC Holdings.        
	The size of the deal is difficult to estimate because of certain riders built into the transaction.         
	HSBC  which is making its third transaction in India in the past two years  has offered to pay a premium of $95 million over the tangible net asset value of the business acquired on the day the deal is completed.        
	However, the payout will adjust for 90 per cent of any credit losses suffered in the unsecured lending portfolio of RBS India in the two years subsequent to the completion of the deal. Most banks, including HSBC and RBS, have struggled to cope with the surge in credit card and loan delinquencies in the past few years.        
	In June 2008, HSBC picked up a 26 per cent stake in a Rs 500-crore joint venture insurance company established with Canara Bank and Oriental bank of Commerce. In October the same year, it acquired retail brokerage IL amp;FS Investsmart and renamed it as HSBC InvestDirect.        
	HSBC currently has about 2 million customers and 50 branches across 29 cities in the Indian market.        
	RBS had acquired ABN Amros worldwide operations in October 2007 for 70 billion euros, beating Barclays Plc in a bidding war.        
	In 2007, RBS was looking to aggressively expand its operations and Fred Goodwin  its then chief executive  spent over $100 billion to acquire entities in 54 countries.        
	However, the global recession in 2008 forced RBS to seek a cash infusion of 37 billion from the British government which ended up with an 83 per cent stake in the bank. It led to a change of guard at the largely nationalised bank.         
	RBS CEO Stephen Hester has been selling a lot of the assets acquired by Goodwin and the Indian entity is the latest transaction. In fact, there was speculation last year that RBS was in talks with HSBC for the sale of its Indian operations but the two sides couldnt agree on a price.        
	In the past month, RBS had sold units in Argentina, Kazakhstan, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. It is reversing a decade-long international expansion drive and has raised over $2.5 billion by exiting or selling over 20 businesses in the last 14 months.

	New Delhi, July 1: Steel Authority of India Ltd will invest Rs 230 crore in a wagon factory to be set up in a joint venture with the Indian Railways. The new entity will compete with existing players Jessop and Braithwaite.        
	The unit will come up at Kulti, near Durgapur, where SAIL has an alloy steel plant. The plant can supply raw material to the wagon factory, which is initially expected to have an annual capacity of 1,000 units.         
	SAILs new chairman, C. S. Verma, is believed to have assured railway officials close to Mamata Banerjee that he would speed up the project. Verma has been trying to remain in the good books of both the powerful ministers from Bengal  finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and railway minister and Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee. Both the Bengal wing of the Congress and the Trinamul Congress took an interest in the selection of the SAIL chairman, which was approved by the appointments committee of the cabinet recently.         
	SAIL has lined up huge investments in Bengal. The political parties wanted the SAIL chief to be someone who could speed up the projects, which are expected to generate large-scale employment in the state.         
	SAIL will be investing Rs 14,443 crore in a 2.3-million-tonne steel plant at Burnpur. The steel maker will spend around Rs 20,000 crore in Bengal for expansion.         
	The wagon making unit is part of SAILs strategy to increase its share of value-added products. At present, value-added products account for 37 per cent of SAILs output, and the state-run company wants to increase this to 50 per cent.         
	The railways will acquire more stainless steel wagons, which last longer and make loading and unloading easier. Besides, goods trains with stainless steel wagons can run on less fuel because of their lighter weight.         
	Sources said SAIL would soon be appointing a managing director for the Kulti venture.         
	The steel maker is expanding its three plants in Bengal by 2.2 million tonnes to 5.5 million tonnes. It is also investing in a number of projects at Kulti to manufacture value-added products.         
	SAIL is investing in another wagon making unit at Bangalore in collaboration with BEML.

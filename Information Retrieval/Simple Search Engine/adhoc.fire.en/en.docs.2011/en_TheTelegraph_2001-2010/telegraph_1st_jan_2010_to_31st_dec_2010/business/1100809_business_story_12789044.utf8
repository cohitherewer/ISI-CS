The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ruia to go for SsangYong 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ruia to go for SsangYong 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Object of pursuit                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 8: The Ruia group today joined Mahindra amp; Mahindra to put in a final bid for troubled Korean auto maker SsangYong.        
	A company official confirmed that it was indeed bidding for the Korean firm. A decision was taken in the afternoon at a meeting chaired by Pawan K. Ruia.        
	The last date for submitting the final bids is August 10.         
	The Ruias along with Mahindra amp; Mahindra and Renault-Nissan are among the six shortlisted bidders.        
	SsangYong is expected to name the preferred bidder within a week of receiving the bids.        
	The SUV maker, which is listed on the Korean Stock Exchange, has been undergoing a restructuring programme following an order from the Seoul Central District Court last year.         
	The SsangYong administrator will offer a 51 per cent stake to the acquirer. The money from the stake sale will be utilised for the companys operations and loan repayment.        
	It is understood that the Ruia offer wont be a simple one where the money will only be committed for equity. The group could look for both equity and debt reduction.        
	On Thursday, Ruia said he was considering three factors before taking a final call  future cash flow, profitability and SsangYongs ability to withstand competition.         
	Ruia had visited Korea earlier this week and met top officials there.        
	Yesterday, the M amp;M board gave its approval to submit a binding bid to acquire a majority stake.         
	Auto experts expect M amp;M to bid aggressively for the Korean company, which has a 2 per cent market share in that country.         
	M amp;M is keen on SsangYong to boost its international presence. It can also bring SsangYongs range of sports utility vehicles such as Rexton and premium sedan Chairman to India.         
	It is believed that M amp;M will fund the buyout through a combination of internal accruals and debt.        
	For Ruia, the SsangYong deal will be his first step towards entering the automobile sector. The Dunlop owner had earlier said he wouldnt be disappointed to lose the bid. But Ruia, whose company has grown through acquisitions such as Dunlop, Jessop and Falcon, knows that firms such as SsangYong dont come up for sale too often.        
	Chinas SAIC Motor Corporation owns about 10 per cent in SsangYong. About 70 per cent are held by creditors, led by state-owned Korea Development Bank.         
	The SsangYong sale process was kicked off in May by the Seoul court.         
	The company extended the last date for submission of financial bids to August 10 from July 20 on the bidders request.

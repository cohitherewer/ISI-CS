The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cash prop for PSU banks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cash prop for PSU banks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CREDIT FLOW                                  
	New Delhi, April 23: The cabinet today approved capital infusion of Rs 15,000 crore in state-run banks for the current fiscal to help them meet capital adequacy norms and increase their lending.        
	The infusion of Rs 15,000 crore in tier I capital instruments of banks would enable them to expand their credit by about Rs 1,85,000 crore, an official statement said.        
	The capital infusion will not put any pressure on the fiscal deficit as the funds will come from a World Bank loan of $3.2 billion to government-controlled banks.        
	Formalities for the first tranche of $2 billion have already been completed, said the statement.        
	The move will benefit the Union Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Central Bank, Dena Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Syndicate Bank, Uco Bank and IDBI to maintain an 8 per cent tier I capital, said sources.         
	Tier I capital are funds that a bank keeps aside to provide protection against unexpected losses.         
	The governments move is to ensure that the banking system does not suffer from capital adequacy constraints.         
	Capital adequacy refers to funds, primarily shareholders equity, which banks have to set aside for every Rs 100 they lend.         
	According to government stipulation, all public sector banks are required to maintain a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 12 per cent.        
	The capital adequacy ratio of most Indian banks are well above the Basel norm of 8 per cent and the RBI stipulated norm of 9 per cent.         
	However, officials said, the aim is to raise CAR above 12 per cent to help banks become stronger and lend larger sums.        
	The exact amount, mode of capitalisation and other terms and conditions would be decided in consultation with banks at the time of infusion.         
	The additional availability of credit is likely to benefit employment oriented sectors, especially agriculture and micro and small enterprises along with exporters and entrepreneurs.         
	Jute MSP up 14%        
	The Centre today increased the minimum support price of jute by over 14 per cent to Rs 1,575 per quintal for 2010-11.        
	The Jute Corporation of India would continue to act as the nodal agency to buy the fibre at the MSP level.        
	The government also hiked the fair and remunerative price of sugarcane by 7 per cent to Rs 139.12 per quintal for the 2010-11 season.

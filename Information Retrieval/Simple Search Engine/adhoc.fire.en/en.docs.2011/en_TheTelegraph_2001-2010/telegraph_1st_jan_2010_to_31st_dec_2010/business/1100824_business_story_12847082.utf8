  Govt hopes to meet $200bn target          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: The government today gifted incentives worth Rs 1,050 crore to exporters, particularly of labour-intensive textiles, handicraft and leather, to help them see through the fragile economic recovery globally.        
	We are not yet out of the woods, commerce minister Anand Sharma said as he extended tax breaks, subsidised loans, provided help to upgrade machinery equipment and offered other concessions in the annual supplement to the foreign trade policy.        
	To give immediate relief, a bonus incentive is being provided to sectors whose exports are still not doing well, he said.        
	The Rs 1,050-crore bonus incentive will be in addition to the package announced earlier, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said, adding the incentive schemes will be effective from April 1, 2010. The government has already announced an incentive package of Rs 1,350 crore.        
	Labour intensive sectors such as handicraft, handlooms, silk carpets, leather and leather manufacturers, sports goods, toys and some bicycle parts are covered under the scheme.        
	We are happy that the sectors that were not doing well have been considered. Extension of the Duty Entitlement Pass Book (DEPB) Scheme and interest subvention are welcome, A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo), said.         
	Sharma reiterated that India was on track to meet its exports target of $200 billion this fiscal. The countrys merchandise exports last year fell 4.7 per cent to $176.5 billion as appetite for Indian goods shrank sharply.        
	Sharma said the country would aim at a 25 per cent average annual export growth in the next three years and double the export of goods and services by 2014.        
	The facility of interest subvention (subsidy) of 2 per cent, currently available for handicraft, handlooms, carpets and SMEs, is being extended to some specified products in leather and leather manufacturing, jute making, including floor covering, engineering goods and textiles for the current financial year.        
	The government made it clear that the popular Duty Entitlement Pass Book (DEPB) scheme, which has been in vogue for over a decade, is being extended for the last time.        
	Recognising the fragile recovery and the prevailing uncertainties (in the global markets), I have been able to obtain extension of DEPB one last time for a further period of six months till June 30, 2011, Sharma said.        
	Experts said the end of the DEPB scheme was inevitable as it was considered incompatible with global trade rules under the WTO. However, Khullar told reporters that the ministry might formulate an alternative scheme.        
	The government also extended the zero-duty Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme by a year to March 31, 2012. The scheme for technology upgradation, which was announced in August last year, was to expire on March 31, 2011.        
	Chairman of the Council for Leather Exports Habib Hussain said, Commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma has stepped in at the time when it needed the most. A very positive step towards inclusive growth.        
	Special focus to the labour-intensive sectors is most welcome. The focus on reducing transaction is very critical and therefore a laudable step, CII director-general Chandrajeet Banerjee said.

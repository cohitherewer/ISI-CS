	Mumbai, Sept. 11 (PTI): Foreign exchange reserves continued to rise for the second consecutive week, jumping by $2.49 billion to $285.33 billion on the back of a healthy increase in foreign currency assets and gold reserves.        
	The forex reserves stood at $282.84 billion in the previous week, according to data released by the Reserve Bank.         
	Foreign currency assets, a major component of the countrys forex reserves, grew a healthy $1.73 billion to $258.38 billion for the week ended September 3, from $256.64 billion the week earlier.        
	Foreign currency assets expressed in US dollar terms include the effect of appreciation or depreciation of the non-US currencies, such as the euro, pound and yen, held in the reserves, the apex bank said.        
	Meanwhile, gold reserves jumped $730 million to $4.63 billion for the reporting week, while both the special drawing rights (SDRs) and reserve position in the International Monetary Fund saw only a marginal rise.

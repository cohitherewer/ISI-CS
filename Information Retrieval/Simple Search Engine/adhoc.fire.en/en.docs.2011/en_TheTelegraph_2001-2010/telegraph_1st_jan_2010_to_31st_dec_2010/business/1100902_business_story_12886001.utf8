          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Indias trade deficit in April-July increased 39 per cent to $43.58 billion from $31.42 billion a year ago and is expected to reach $120 billion this fiscal, the government said.        
	The surge in the import of gems and jewellery, chemicals, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals and metal ore indicates growing domestic demand, potential export push and industrial recovery. The trade deficit at current levels is not worrying, a senior commerce ministry official said.        
	As long as it does not go over the top it can be financed, he said.        
	Exports during the period grew 30.1 per cent to $68.6 billion, while imports were up 33.3 per cent to $112.2 billion.         
	In July, trade deficit stood at $12.9 billion against $7.38 billion a year ago. Imports surged 34.3 per cent to $29.1 billion, while exports rose 13.2 per cent to $16.2 billion  the lowest expansion so far this fiscal  as major markets such as the US and Europe are facing fragile economic recovery.        
	Commerce secretary Rahul Khullar had said the slowdown in growth might continue for the rest of the fiscal as the developed countries might go for fiscal consolidation by partially rolling back stimulus packages.        
	Exports had grown at a robust pace in April (36.2 per cent), May (35.1 per cent) and June (30.4 per cent).        
	A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said, The growth trend will continue but the only worrying aspect is the crisis in the euro zone, which is likely to affect exports.        
	Oil imports in July grew 4.4 per cent to $7.6 billion, while non-oil imports jumped 49.6 per cent to $21.5 billion.        
	N.R. Bhanumurthy, economist with the National Institute of Public Finance Policy, said, The country has to live with higher trade deficit if it plans to grow at 8.5 per cent with domestic demand alone as the global economy is yet to recover.         
	The economy grew 8.8 per cent in the quarter ended June, its fastest in nearly three years, and is expected to grow 8.5 per cent in this fiscal.

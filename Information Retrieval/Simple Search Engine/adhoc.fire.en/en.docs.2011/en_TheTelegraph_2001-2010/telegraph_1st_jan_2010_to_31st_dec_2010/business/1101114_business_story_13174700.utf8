          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: All retail investors of mutual funds will have to comply with KYC (know-your-customer) norms from January.         
	Registrar and transfer agent Computer Age Management Services has asked distributors to inform their clients in advance so that they can comply with the norm in time.         
	Till now, retail investors who invested less than Rs 50,000 were not required to follow the KYC procedures. The rule was applicable to non-resident Indians and other non-individual investors as well. However, KYC rule was made mandatory for all NRIs and other non-individual investors from October.        
	CDSL Ventures Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Central Depository Services (India) Ltd, will process the KYC documentation.         
	The Association of Mutual Funds in India has said in a circular that KYC documentation will be mandatory for all retail investors, irrespective of the investment amount, from January 1, 2011.        
	Mutual fund distributors have been asked to carry out the task on behalf of their investors and submit the necessary documents with CDSL Ventures, which will then issue an acknowledgement to investors. On the basis of this acknowledgement, investors will be allowed to make the investments.         
	KYC norms were first implemented in February 2008 for all investors investing Rs 50,000 or more in mutual funds.

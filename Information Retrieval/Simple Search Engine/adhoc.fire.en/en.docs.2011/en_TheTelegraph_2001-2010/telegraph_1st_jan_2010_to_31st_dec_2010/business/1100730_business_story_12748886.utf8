          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Curtain call                                  
	New Delhi, July 29: BP is keen to exit its lone coal bed methane block in the country at Birbhum in Bengal because of low prospects.        
	BP has put up a request that they would like to walk away from the Birbhum coal bed methane (CBM) block in Bengal. In their view, the prospect is not good. A decision is yet to be taken on it, S.K. Srivastava, director-general of hydrocarbons, told reporters.         
	The methane block in Birbhum was awarded to BP in 2006, which owns a 100 per cent stake in the block.        
	Drilling results indicate the presence of much lower gas content than anticipated with the absence of commercial gas in all depositional lows in the block according to our assessment, BP said.        
	Industry sources said Oil India was interested in the block. Oil India chairman N.M. Borah declined to comment. The PSU has set aside $2 billion for overseas acquisitions.         
	We are currently conducting a due diligence for 2-3 assets, Borah said. He said the company was looking at acquiring stakes in Myanmar and Bangladesh.        
	Africa assets        
	Essar group CEO Prashant Ruia told reporters here that it was interested in buying BPs fuel marketing assets in east Africa, which Reliance Industries was also said to be eyeing.        
	BP is running a process (to sell its interest in east Africa). It is the early part of the process, it will take six months (to conclude), Ruia said.        
	BP is selling its retail outlets, terminals and aviation fuel stations in Botswana, Tanzania, Namibia, Malawi and Zambia to cover costs related to the worst oil spill in US history.        
	These are some 150 (retail) outlets. They (BP) are looking at selling (interest) in 5-6 countries (in east Africa). They are inviting participation for all, Ruia said.        
	Essar in Raniganj        
	Essar Oil will begin gas production from its Raniganj CBM block in Bengal by September and will achieve peak output in late 2012.        
	Production will begin this quarter ... either by end-August or early September, Essar oils head of E amp;P, Shishir Agrawal, said.        
	The Raniganj CBM block will produce 90,000-100,000 cubic metres per day of gas initially and will touch a peak output of 3.5 million standard cubic metres per day by the fourth quarter of 2012, he said.

	Calcutta, March 1: Andrew Yule is likely to go in for a follow on public offer to bring down the governments holding below 90 per cent.        
	The government, which holds 94.42 per cent in the diversified public sector firm, may offload 5 per cent stake.        
	Going by the closing price of the Yule scrip on Friday, the stake sale may fetch the government around Rs 75 crore.        
	The money is likely to be used by Yule to settle various non-financial support extended by the government.        
	At present, Yule has three business divisions  engineering, mechanical and tea. It also holds 26 per cent in lubricant maker Tide Water Oil.        
	Yule has repaid a loan of Rs 73.76 crore to the government by selling stake in DPSC and Phoenix Yule. Chairman Kallol Datta said the company would not pursue the sale of Tide Water as its objective of loan repayment had been met.

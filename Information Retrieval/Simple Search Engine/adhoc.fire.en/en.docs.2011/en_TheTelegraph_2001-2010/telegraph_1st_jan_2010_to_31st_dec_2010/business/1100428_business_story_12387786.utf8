          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 27: City-based Visual Securas Ltd, which started operations in 2005 as a security agency, has obtained the Reserve Bank of Indias permission to protect cash and other valuables with banks.         
	IndusInd Bank is the first customer to which the company will offer services nationally. We will soon become a pan-India service provider in cash and valuables management and security services, including vaulting facility, chairman and managing director Anjan Chowdhury said.        
	Besides IndusInd Bank, the company offers security cover to Standard Chartered, Kotak Mahindra, Karnataka Bank, the Bank of Baroda, the Central Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Vijaya Bank.         
	Negotiations with all these banks and others, which are not yet our customers, have been initiated to extend cash management services, he said.        
	The cash and valuables services management involves the creation of a fleet of armoured cash vans, including bullet-proof vehicles fitted with GPRS and co-ordinated wireless communication network.         
	With over 4,000 security guards on its rolls, Visual Secura has established its network in almost all states barring a few in south India.

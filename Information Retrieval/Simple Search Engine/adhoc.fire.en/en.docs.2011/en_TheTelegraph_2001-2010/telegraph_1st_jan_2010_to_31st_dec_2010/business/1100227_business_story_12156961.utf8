	The mood of the Indian IT companies has moved to that of cautious optimism. The Indian IT services industry is on a rebound mode and needed a budget that would aid this rebound. Large scale recruitments have begun. Campus building activities in SEZs are on. In this environment, the IT industry did not want to see measures that would fuel negative sentiments. The finance minister has certainly not disappointed the industry. The current budget proposals have removed all ambiguities on the taxation front and offer clear directions and benefits to drive growth.         
	The increased focus on SEZs to drive exports and boost employment is welcome. A huge positive from the current budget proposal is the clarity in the tax regime.         
	The IT industry has been asking for the need to resolve the dispute between the finance and commerce ministries over tax exemption for export profits from SEZs under Section 10AA dealing with SEZ benefits. After much deliberation, the finance minister has resolved this controversy. This would remove all existing ambiguity and would lay out a clear guideline that would aid savings for IT companies. We do not expect any major impact of the increase in MAT on export-focused IT outsourcing companies. However, small and mid-sized companies with a deeper domestic focus are likely to get impacted.         
	The global slowdown has had a tremendous pan-industry impact. The cascading impact of the slowdown has been on the individual. The broadening of the income tax base would benefit the employees.         
	This becomes even more relevant in an inflationary market. A broader personal tax regime would lead to higher consumption. We know that the multiplier rate when it comes to IT professionals is very high.        
	However, the FMs decision to leave the STPI scheme untouched means that the tax holiday on STPIs will expire at the end of the current fiscal. This would significantly increase the tax burden especially on smaller players.                                 THE AUTHOR IS CFO OF TCS

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 30: Standard Chartered Plc  the first overseas bank to list on the Indian bourses  is seeking to introduce the concept of a scrip dividend.        
	Shareholders usually receive dividends in the form of cash. But in markets such as London and Hong Kong, listed entities give their shareholders the option of accepting a dividend either in cash or by the way of shares.        
	StanCharts draft red herring prospectus, a mammoth 804-page document, filed with regulatory watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) speaks about the possibility of offering the scrip dividend option to investors who put their money in the countrys first issue of Indian Depositary Rights (IDRs).        
	But the bank recognises that it may face regulatory hurdles in introducing the concept in India and has, therefore, put in a number of caveats in the draft prospectus.        
	If Sebi clears the document in its present form, it might be seen as a tacit approval of a concept that has found favour with investors in other developed markets.        
	StanChart says that additional shares may be deposited in the IDR facility in the event that such shares are issued as dividend.        
	However, in its risk factors, the foreign bank went on to point out that IDR holders may not be able to receive additional shares from the company in a rights offering or a bonus issue of shares or a scrip dividend.        
	If the company offers scrip dividends or a bonus issue of shares to IDR holders, the same could be considered as a further issue of IDRs by the company. Such further issue of IDRs would require permission from the stock exchanges and may require registration of a new prospectus in India, it said.        
	StanChart will issue 220 million units of IDRs and it is planning to at least garner $500 million from the issue with the ceiling kept at $750 million. The bank has, however, not yet disclosed how many shares will underlie each IDR.        
	Officials from the bank said the proceeds from the issue would be repatriated to the parent, and that the issue was not being made for capital-raising purposes but to strengthen its presence in India and enhance its market visibility and brand perception.        
	StanChart has said that though holders can convert IDRs into shares, the conversion may be considered as a taxable transfer in the absence of specific exemption in the income tax act. Besides, the income tax act and other regulations do not specifically refer to the taxation of IDRs.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tripathi: Reaping gains                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: State-run GAIL (India) Ltd has reported a 30 per cent jump in net profit during the second quarter ended September on higher revenues from the transmission and sale of natural gas and a better price for liquid hydrocarbons (LPG).        
	Net profit rose to Rs 924 crore from Rs 713 crore during the same period of the previous year, chairman and managing director B.C. Tripathi said. The increase in net profit was mainly because of a higher realisation on liquid hydrocarbons, increase in the transmission of natural gas, trading and margin earned on gas and a slight improvement in petrochemical margins.         
	Tripathi said GAIL was in talks with Advent Energy to buy a stake in the Australian firm as part of a consortium.        
	We are in talks about taking equity in Advent, he said. Refusing to share further details, he said, It is too premature to comment on it at this point of time.        
	The consortium, comprising Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India and GAIL, are in talks to buy a 25 per cent stake in the unlisted Australian explorer, and the deal could be worth more than $1 billion.        
	Advent Energy has large gas reserves, including a block in Sydney Basin, which has an estimated 13.2 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas.        
	Meanwhile, GAIL and Petronet LNG are eyeing a stake in liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Nigeria.        
	Oil minister Murli Deora discussed the possibility of buying a stake in the $8-billion LNG project in the west African countrys Niger River delta with Emmanuel . Egbogah, special adviser to the Nigerian President.

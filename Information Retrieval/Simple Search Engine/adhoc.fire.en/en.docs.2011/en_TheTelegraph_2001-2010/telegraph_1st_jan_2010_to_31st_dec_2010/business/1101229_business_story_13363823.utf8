          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 28: The National Housing Bank (NHB) has taken a cue from the Reserve Bank of India and tightened norms governing housing loans dispensed by the entities under its control.        
	The regulator of housing finance companies (HFCs) raised provisioning on teaser loans, stipulated a higher loan- to-value ratio, raised risk weightages on loans above Rs 75 lakh and asked the lending entities to set aside 0.40 per cent of the total outstanding loans given to entities other than individuals.        
	Companies such as HDFC, GIC Housing, LIC Housing Finance and others come under the purview of the NHB.         
	According to the new set of rules, HFCs will have to make a 2 per cent provision on the total outstanding amount pertaining to teaser loan schemes. However, the provision will be reset after a period of one year or from the date on which the teaser loan attracts a higher rate of interest.        
	In other words, the provisioning of 2 per cent applicable in the first few years where there is comparatively lower rates of interest will fall to 0.4 per cent after the interest rate is reset at a higher level against the benchmark rate.        
	The RBI, which also raised the provisioning requirement on such schemes to 2 per cent, had recently said banks could revert to the provisioning of 0.4 per cent when the interest rates were reset.        
	It is estimated that the total amount outstanding in the case of teaser rate schemes for HFCs is Rs 34,000 crore. Of this, the total dual rate loans outstanding in the balance sheet of HDFC is about Rs 20,000 crore, on which a 2 per cent provision will be Rs 400 crore, sources said.

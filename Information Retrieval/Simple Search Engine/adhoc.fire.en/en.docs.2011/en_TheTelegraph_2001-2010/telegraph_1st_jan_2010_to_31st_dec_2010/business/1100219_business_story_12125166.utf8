          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: The government today approved a nutrient-based subsidy regime, which would allow firms to fix fertiliser prices.        
	The new fertiliser subsidy policy was cleared by the cabinet, presided over by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, overcoming some resistance from key UPA ally DMK in the run-up to the policy formulation.        
	The cabinet also cleared a proposal to increase the price of urea by nearly 10 per cent to Rs 5,310 per tonne from Rs 4,830 per tonne, with effect from April. Urea, which has the maximum tonnage consumed on nitrogenous fertiliser in the country, will continue to be under the current maximum retail price regime, an official note issued after the meeting said.        
	Under the new regime, the subsidy on four essential nutrients  nitrogen, phosphorous, potash and sulphur  as also other secondary fertilisers will be fixed individually. This will encourage the use of only those nutrients that are actually needed.         
	At present, companies sell fertilisers at a fixed price to farmers and not according to the manufacturing cost. The government compensates them for the losses through subsidies.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had laid the groundwork for the new regime in his budget speech in July.        
	Since the subsidy on the subsidised nutrients, and consequently the subsidised fertilisers, will be fixed, the retail prices at farm gate will be fixed by the companies, officials said.

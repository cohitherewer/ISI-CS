	Mumbai, June 11: At a time when media magnate Kalanithi Maran is close to buying a little under 40 per cent in budget carrier SpiceJet, WL Ross and Istithmar Capital World  the investment arm of Dubai World  are converting bonds of the airline into equity shares.        
	SpiceJet today told the stock exchanges that it was allotting 6.4 crore shares of the company to these investors upon conversion of their foreign currency convertible bonds.         
	Among the two, shares of the carrier were allotted to various entities of WL Ross that included WLR Recovery III (India) Ltd, WLR Recovery IV/ESC (India) Ltd, India Asset Recovery Fund Ltd and WLR/GS (India) Ltd.        
	Around 2.21 crore shares were allotted to Istithmar World PJSC. The 6.4 crore shares allotted to these two entities will translate to around 19 per cent equity of SpiceJet of which around 13 per cent will be picked up by firms from the WL Ross stable.

Among other shareholders, Ajay Singh holds around 4 per cent in SpiceJet.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Money matters                                  
	Hyderabad, Dec. 11: The Andhra Pradesh government today introduced a bill to regulate the working of microfinance companies in the state, retaining all the provisions that were there in the ordinance issued in October.        
	The bill, on being passed, will replace the ordinance issued by the government on October 15 following a spate of suicides by many borrowers.        
	The Andhra Pradesh Microfinance Institutions (Regulation of Money Lending) Bill, 2010, introduced in the assembly by legislative affairs minister D. Sridhar Babu seeks to protect the women self-help groups from exploitation by MFIs.        
	State minister for self-help groups (SHGs) Sunita Lakshma Reddy said nearly 10 lakh SHGs had 1.1 crore rural poor women and the MFIs were using the women groups to expand their business by giving loans at usurious rates of interest, which in some cases extended up to 54 per cent, without verifying their capacity to repay.        
	The act was necessary as the existing law against money lending do not cover the activities of the MFIs.        
	The MFIs were also using coercive methods with the help of recovery agents to recover the loans. This has resulted in many cases of suicide of rural and urban poor and molestation of the borrower or the family members, the government said in the statement of objects and reasons of the bill.        
	The bill, however, does not talk about any interest cap on the MFI loans though it makes registration of all MFIs with the registering authority in each district mandatory.        
	The new law bars MFIs from seeking any form of security in the form of pawn, pledge or other from a borrower nor charge any other amount except that prescribed in the rules.         
	The state government, in consultation with Andhra High Court, may establish a fast-track court in each district for settlement of disputes of civil nature between the borrowers and the MFIs in respect of loans granted, according to a provision in the bill.

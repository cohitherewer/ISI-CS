The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jharkhand double treat for Mittal 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Jharkhand double treat for Mittal 
          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, April 5: ArcelorMittal has been granted a prospecting licence in Jharkhand. The move is a major boost to the companys plans to invest over Rs 40,000 crore in a proposed steel project in the state.        
	The Union mines ministry gave the approval after the state government sent two separate recommendations for the grant of prospecting licences to ArcelorMittal in mineral-rich West Singhbhum.        
	Agency reports from Delhi quoted Union mines minister B.K. Handique as saying that the Centre had approved one of the proposals to grant licence for 662.95 hectares in the Karampada area of West Singhbhum.         
	The company, which is yet to make a headway for setting up the steel mill in Jharkhand, already has a mining lease for 202 hectares in another part of Karampada. It has been granted a coal block in Latehars Seregarha region covering 3.5 sq km.         
	The grant of a prospecting licence in Karampada has been hanging fire since 2007 when the then chief minister Madhu Koda had recommended to the Centre that 1,000 hectares in Karampada be handed over to ArcelorMittal.         
	But of the 1,000 hectares, 416.93 hectares came under the non-notified category (area that has no legal sanction for mining) and the Centre turned down the proposal in 2009. Later, Jharkhand sent two separate proposals in December 2009. The Centre sent back one of the proposals concerning the non-notified area to the Jharkhand government for clarifications while approving the other.        
	We have received a letter from the Union mines ministry on the proposal sent by the state for non-notified areas of Karampada. We are looking into the matter and will reply soon, Jharkhand mines director B.B. Singh said.         
	ArcelorMittals general manager (mines) P.S. Prasad told The Telegraph that he was aware of the latest developments. The company is pursuing the Jharkhand project seriously, he said.

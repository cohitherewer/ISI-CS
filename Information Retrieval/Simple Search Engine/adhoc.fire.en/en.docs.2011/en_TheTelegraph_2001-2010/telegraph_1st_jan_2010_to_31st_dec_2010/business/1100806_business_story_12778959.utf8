The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Online job demand takes a hit in July 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Online job demand takes a hit in July 
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Jarring note                          
	Calcutta, Aug. 5: Online hiring has seen a decline in July , though the market has been robust in the last six months, according to recruitment service firm Monster India.         
	Monsters assessment is from the findings of its online employment index that slipped 6 points to 129 in July from 135 in June.         
	July is the first month since November 2009 to witness a decline and it is just because of some cyclical and seasonal factors, Sanjay Modi, managing director (India/ West Asia and Southeast Asia) of Monster, said after releasing the index.        
	According to Modi, the slowdown can be attributed to cyclical and seasonal factors such as firms being busy with their quarterly result announcements and the completion of training and post-hiring formalities after recruitment in the previous month.        
	Despite the month- on month decline, the six-month average of the employment index remained strongly positive with 20 out of 27 sectors exhibiting positive growth.        
	Twelve out of 13 cities registered a decline in recruitment.         
	Bangalore registered the steepest decline of 11 per cent followed by Calcutta at 10 per cent. Delhi-NCR was the only city to maintain a steady recruitment level in July, the study showed.        
	Companies across sectors remain enthusiastic about hiring and the fresher-level recruitment has remained stable from the last month, Modi said.        
	Education was the top growth sector, growing 6 per cent in July.         
	Though online recruitment activity in the IT sector dropped 5.4 per cent over June, BPO/ITeS maintained its previous hiring levels.        
	According to the study, demand for healthcare professionals grew 6 per cent, while real estate recorded the sturdiest medium-term growth, gaining 79 per cent above the January level.        
	Online job opportunities in banking, finance and insurance declined 8 per cent in July, its first dip since March 2010.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: The government is worried about the burgeoning trade deficit, which at $13.06 billion in August is the highest in almost two years. Trade data for August show exports growing 22.5 per cent to $16.64 billion, but imports have risen much higher by 32.2 per cent to $29.7 billion.        
	Prior to August, the trade gap was the highest in September 2008 at $15.35 billion.        
	Trade deficit is a matter of concern but the balance of trade situation is at manageable levels now, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said.        
	Officials said that if the deficit continued to grow at the current rate, the government might have to come out with incentives for exports or discourage imports.        
	Exports during April-August grew 28.7 per cent to $85.2 billion, while imports were up 33.1 per cent to $141.9 billion, taking the deficit to $56.62 billion.        
	Khullar said the deficit could touch $135 billion during this financial year, higher than his earlier forecast of $120 billion.         
	N.R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy said, The country has to live with a higher trade deficit if it plans to grow at 8.5 per cent.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Oil India weighs foreign buys
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: Oil India plans to buy assets overseas for around $1 billion soon. The PSU is exploring buys in Australia, South America and Africa.         
	Definitely some opportunities are being evaluated and we are hopeful that something should click very soon, director (finance) T.K Ananth Kumar said on the sidelines of an Assocham conference.        
	We are looking for small and medium-size assets in the range of $1 billion or less and not multi-billion ones. We think the Chinese and South Koreans wont be interested in these smaller assets.         
	Declining to name a particular region, Ananth Kumar said, We are looking at assets in Australia, South America and parts of Africa.        
	On recent media reports that Oil India along with GAIL (India) Ltd and ONGC are looking to acquire Australias Advent Energy, he said, It is news for us.        
	The consortium, comprising ONGC, Oil India and GAIL, is said to be in talks to buy a 25 per cent stake in unlisted Australian explorer and the deal could be worth more than $1 billion.        
	Advent Energy has large gas reserves, including a block in Sydney Basin that has an estimated 13.2 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas.        
	The government has asked Oil India and ONGC to make at least one acquisition each in this fiscal.        
	Energy analyst Kalpana Jain of Deloitte India said, The energy firm needs to aggressively look for assets abroad and join hands with global players to reduce the risk. With the economy growth nearing double digits, the need for energy resources is likely to increase further. To be successful, oil firms needs to reduce their response time to clinch the deal.        
	The Centre is pushing PSU oil firms to secure overseas assets to meet domestic demand, which is expected to grow over 40 per cent over the next 10 years.        
	Indias oil consumption far exceeds domestic supply. The worlds second-fastest growing economy consumed 138 million tonnes (mt) of fuel in 2009-10, while domestic production was just 34mt.        
	Meanwhile, the government today said it would seek Parliaments approval in the budget session for further expenditure to compensate oil PSUs for selling products below cost this fiscal.

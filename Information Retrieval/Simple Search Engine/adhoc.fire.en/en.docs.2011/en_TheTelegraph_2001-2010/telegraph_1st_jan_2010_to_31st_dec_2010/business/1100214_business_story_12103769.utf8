	 Hyderabad, Feb. 13: Mahindra Satyam need not necessarily be merged with its new owner Tech Mahindra, and it could well be the reverse, Mahindra Group vice-chairman and managing director Anand Mahindra said today. Obviously the end goal is to merge the two companies. We have not yet decided which company will merge with which.

        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay decodes the yellow metal that has caught investor fancy                                      
	Anuradha, my friends wife, wanted to buy some gold coins this Diwali. She approached her brother who works in a private sector bank that sells gold coins.         
	As an employee of the bank my brother would have got a fair discount. But he prevented me from buying gold coins. I had invested some money in a mutual fund through SIP three years ago. But it failed to give me good returns. So, I redeemed the units and decided to buy gold with the money this Diwali. After all, gold price now has touched an all-time high, Anuradha grumbled.        
	Anuradha is not a pro when it comes to investment. But the fact that gold has given a return of 23.52 per cent in rupee terms compared with 20.6 per cent yielded by the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange sensex between the Diwalis last year and this year is luring enough for any common man to consider investing in the precious metal.         
	Between September 2009 and September 2010, the number of retail portfolios in gold exchange-traded funds has grown 136 per cent to 2,35,218 from 99,454, while the asset under management of gold ETFs increased 187 per cent to Rs 856.23 crore from Rs 298.07 crore.         
	The yellow metal continues to attract investors globally as it touched an all-time high of $1,395.50 (London Fix afternoon) in international markets on Friday.        
	But can investment in gold make you wealthier? Why is gold now trading at $1,397.80 a troy ounce while it was only at $780 a troy ounce on September 15, 2008, when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy?         
	What is prompting investors to rush for gold as a safe-haven investment?         
	Down the years        
	Let us look at the annual average gold price movement (see charts) from 1833 till 1999 and from 2000 till 2010.        
	Till 1933-34 gold price remained relatively stable at around $20.65 a troy ounce. The price then started moving up following the Great Depression and World War II.         
	In July 1944, the Bretton Wood system of monetary management was agreed upon by 44 nations, including industrial powerhouses, to rebuild the international monetary system that had almost broken down during World War II.         
	Under the system only the US dollar was pegged and made convertible to gold at $35 a troy ounce, while the currencies of other countries were required to fix the exchange rate of their currencies against the US dollar, one per cent up or down.         
	The Bretton Wood system, thus, restricted the international mobility of capital and relied solely on a well-managed US economy with the dollar as the base currency for sustainability of the international monetary system.         
	However, the US started witnessing high inflation since the late 1960s after the Vietnam War. On August 15, 1971, US President Richard Nixon terminated convertibility of the dollar to gold without consulting other countries that had signed the Bretton Wood treaty.         
	This made the US dollar the sole backing of currencies and a reserve currency for the member countries. There has been a slew of currency crises in different parts of the world since then.         
	Price fluctuations        
	By 1973, gold prices touched $100 an ounce when the oil crisis hit global economies. The prices zoomed to $850 an ounce by January 1980 as high oil prices led to high inflation in many countries and investors flew for a safe haven in gold. However, after that gold prices started falling and was down to $252 an ounce by August 1999 as central banks started selling gold.         
	In October 1999, 15 European central banks agreed to limit their gold sales every year and the gold prices recovered to $340 an ounce. Then came the dotcom bubble burst followed by the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US and the US War in Iraq. Gold prices soared to $480 an ounce in December 2004.        
	During this period (1980-2004), the US followed a low interest rate regime, initially through tax cuts and later by printing the greenback, to bridge the high fiscal deficits created by the war against Vietnam, the Cold War with the then Soviet Union and the war with Iraq. The US government funded its high trade deficit by floating treasury bonds that were subscribed hugely by developing nations, such as China.         
	The regime of near-zero interest rate and easy credit availability in the US for a long time resulted in the sub-prime crisis and the collapse of big institutions such as Lehman Brothers, snowballing into the global financial crisis in 2008 which bolstered the demand for gold. All this while, on the back of an ample liquidity the US dollar depreciated against almost all currencies.         
	Gold prices started surging more steeply from July-August this year after the announcement by the US Federal Reserve of a second round of quantitative easing wherein the Fed will buy back treasury bonds worth $75 billion every month till June 2011.         
	The additional $600 billion over the next six months will increase the liquidity and push up commodity prices, including gold.        
	Dollar-driven        
	The gold price movement has always been dollar driven. Since the financial crisis, investors and the central banks of emerging economies in particular are showing less confidence on the US dollar as the reserve currency of the world. This is reflected in the gold prices.         
	However, once the interest rates in the US starts moving up with the economic recovery there, gold prices will start falling again.         
	Gold is a safe investment, so long-term returns from it cannot be high. In fact, gold investment is not suitable for retail investors.         
	In the last three years ended November 4, 2010, gold ETFs, which closely track the price movement of physical gold, gave a compounded annual return of 23.69 per cent. In contrast, the sensex has given a return of 40.19 per cent, and the BSE smallcap index has yielded 64.21 per cent.         
	So, you would have made more money investing in equities rather than in gold.         
	Since 1971 till date (before 1970s gold saw little increase in value), gold has given an annual compounded return of 9.74 per cent. BSE Sensex, which was formulated with a value of 100 as on April 1, 1979, has given an annual compounded return of 18.83 per cent.        
	The historic price trend for gold is also not encouraging. The price was quite volatile over the years and saw increases in 66 per cent of the years and decreases in 33 per cent of years (see chart).        
	Just a weak dollar should not prompt you to rush for the yellow metal.         
	Gold is a good buy in the long term but if you are looking for handsome returns, equities should be your call.

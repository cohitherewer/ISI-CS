The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panel report to decide fate of MFIs
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Panel report to decide fate of MFIs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 2: Micro-finance institutions (MFIs)  which have come under a cloud after recent complaints against their usurious lending practices and weak corporate governance standards  face the prospect of regulatory scrutiny.        
	The Reserve Bank of India today said a sub-committee appointed by the central bank would make recommendations  relating to regulation of micro-finance activities of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), especially with regard to issues impinging on borrowers interests.        
	Last month, the Andhra Pradesh government had passed an ordinance seeking to restrain MFIs from adopting coercive loan recovery processes that had reportedly sparked a spate of suicides by a number of poor people in rural areas.        
	The sub-committee, which is headed by noted chartered accountant Y.H. Malegam, is expected to submit its report by the end of January.        
	RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao said there were a couple of concerns pertaining to MFIs. These included high rates of interest charged and coercive practices adopted by these institutions.         
	Responding to a query, the RBI governor said the MFIs posed no threat to the stability of the financial system as loans to the sector were small. At the individual level, there may be some strains, he added. In October 2009, the central bank had established a working group under V.K. Sharma to examine the pros and cons of issuing priority sector lending certificates.

          SAMBIT SAHA                                         
	Calcutta, Nov. 28: Jai Balaji Group hopes to start work on its Purulia steel plant by early next year as it approaches the financial closure of the first phase.         
	The company has estimated an initial investment of Rs 1,800 crore to set up a 1-million-tonne (mt) plant within two years.         
	It has received 1,200 acres in Raghunathpur from the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and tied up a loan of Rs 1,300 crore mostly from public sector banks. The remaining Rs 500 crore will come in as promoter equity.         
	We hope to achieve financial closure of the first phase by next month once our board approves the borrowing terms and conditions. Work on the ground will start by January-February, a senior official of Jai Balaji said.         
	If the plan materialises, the homegrown firm, which operates facilities in Durgapur and Raniganj, will be the first among the 14 big-ticket metal investment proposals in Bengal  Videocon, Kalyani, Bhushan, Vedanta are among others  to take off. Sajjan Jindals JSW Bengal Steel has promised to start construction from April.         
	Jai Balaji plans to put up an electric arc furnace to produce sponge iron and roll it to billets in the first phase. The company will also set up a 75-mega-watt (MW) waste heat recovery plant. Associated infrastructure such as a railway siding and water pipeline will also be built.         
	The company had signed an agreement with the state government in October 2007 to build a 5mt steel plant, 1,215MW thermal power plant and 3mt cement plant at a total investment of Rs 16,500 crore. The company hopes to meet such capacities in phases and has asked for 4,000 acres.         
	It has been allotted four coal mines in Bengal by the West Bengal Mineral Development and Trading Corporation and the central coal ministry.         
	Jai Balaji expects to start production from some of the mines within two years. It will then build a power plant to fire the electric arc furnace and sell the excess to the state government for distribution.         
	A company official said they might also set up a blast furnace once they managed to get a coking coal mine. Blast furnace, where coal is charged, helps to enlarge production capacities compared with electric furnace.

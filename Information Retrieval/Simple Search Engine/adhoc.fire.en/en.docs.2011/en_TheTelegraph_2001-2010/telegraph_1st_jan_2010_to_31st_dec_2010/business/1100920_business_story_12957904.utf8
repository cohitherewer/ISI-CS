          JAYATI GHOSE                          Sikka: Charting growth                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: Reliance Mutual Fund is betting big on first-time investors to boost its business and expand asset base.        
	There is huge potential in first-time investors who have not participated in the success of capital markets in India because of lack of simple mutual fund products in the market, Sundeep Sikka, CEO of Reliance Capital Asset Management, told The Telegraph.        
	The fund house has launched a new index fund, which, according to Sikka, does not charge any asset management fee and provides investors an opportunity to participate in Indias growth story by investing in a well-diversified portfolio of fundamentally strong, highly liquid and well-known companies.        
	The countrys largest fund house also has a separate unit for getting business from smaller towns and cities.        
	While the base is at present small in this segment, we are seeing an increased growth and interest every month from smaller towns and cities, said Sikka.        
	He said foreign investors were also showing good interest in Indian shares, and fund houses were expecting a significant amount of money from overseas investors in India-based offshore funds.        
	Analysts said India-focused funds had managed superb returns over the past one year, making it very popular among foreign investors.        
	Overseas investors have made net purchases of around $13 billion worth of shares this year, with more than $8 billion of it flowing in the past three months.        
	Domestic mutual funds have made net sales of $3.3 billion worth of shares in the past three months.        
	After the ban on entry loads imposed by market regulator Sebi last year, fund houses are reinventing their business models.        
	Multiple channels including distribution networks, customer service models and product innovations need to be reinvented to adapt to the new industry regulations, said Sikka.        
	Reliance Mutual Fund is pushing its products through online channels (whereby a customer can buy mutual fund through the Internet) and PSU bank networks.        
	The Rs 6.66-lakh-crore mutual fund industry witnessed an increase of 3.3 per cent in its average assets under management to around Rs 6.87 lakh crore by the end of August 2010 from Rs 6.65 lakh crore in July.        
	Reliance MF saw an addition of Rs 2,332 crore, or 2.28 per cent, to its average assets at Rs 1.04 lakh crore, data by the Association of Mutual Funds in India showed.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tata Motors chairman Ratan Tata and CEO and managing director Carl Peter Forster in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 1: Luxury car maker Jaguar is designing an entry-level model that will make the British marquee brand more accessible to its buyers.        
	At Tata Motors annual general meeting here today, chairman Ratan Tata said, We are looking at an entry-level Jaguar in India.        
	A Tata Motors executive said Jaguar was moving towards designing a car with a smaller engine that would make it affordable. Worldwide, the trend is to focus on smaller cars and Jaguar is exploring the potential of adapting to this shift, he said.         
	Tata said the company was planning to introduce three variants of the Nano. These are a model for the UK and the US, a diesel version and a Nano with a three-cylinder engine.         
	The company plans to invest Rs 3,000 crore every year over the next three years to build new products, Tata said. These investments will include the new Nano variants and efforts to bolster luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover.         
	The company is also conducting detailed investigations into the Nanos that caught fire. In August-end, Tata Motors reported that a third Nano had caught fire in New Delhi.        
	Tata justified the buyout of British luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover by saying, Last year, there was tremendous criticism on the acquisition of JLR that it is burdening this company with losses but I believe this perception (to buy JLR) is vindicated. JLR has posted an impressive performance. It should be proud of its achievement.        
	Tata Motors returned to profit in the year ended March 31, and JLR posted a pre-tax profit during this period.        
	The countrys largest automobile maker with a two-thirds market share will focus on markets such as Africa, Russia, China and West Asia, Tata told shareholders. We hope to increase market share in these economies and widen the passenger car and the commercial vehicles range from Tata Motors, he said.        
	In the passenger car and commercial vehicles range, the company will look at electric and hybrid vehicles that will focus on fuel efficiency.        
	He said the companys debt had been pared to $1.98 billion from $3 billion.

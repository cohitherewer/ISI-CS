          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, July 15: The US Exim Bank today gave preliminary approval for $600 million in loan guarantees to Reliance Powers Rs 20,000-crore project at Sasan in Madhya Pradesh.        
	The estimated Rs 2,800-crore guarantee will support the sale and export by US firm Bucyrus International.         
	The approval will create around 1,000 jobs in the US, prompting the Exim Bank to reverse its earlier decision.        
	We are confident that the remaining steps of this process, including the financial review, will be completed expeditiously to allow RPower to proceed with its project plan, Bucyrus International president and CEO Tim Sullivan said.         
	The Exim Bank of the US approved the financing arrangement after RPower committed to cap the emission at 850 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour. The firm also agreed to develop a 250MW renewable energy facility in India.        
	We are pleased that RPower is making this commitment to renewable energy, which allows us to sustain US jobs and promote both conventional and renewable energy exports, said Exim Bank chairman and president Fred P. Hochberg.        
	On June 24, the board of the bank had decided not to proceed with the application for the Sasan project on environmental concerns.        
	American environmental groups led by the Friends of the Earth have said the reversal of the Sasan decision will set a dangerous precedent for other coal projects in the Exim Bank pipeline.

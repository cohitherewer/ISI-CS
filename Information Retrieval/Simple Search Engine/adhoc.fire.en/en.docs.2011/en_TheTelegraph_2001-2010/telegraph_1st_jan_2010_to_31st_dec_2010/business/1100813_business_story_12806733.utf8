The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ranbaxy MD calls it quits
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ranbaxy MD calls it quits
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Atul Sobti in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Ranbaxys managing director and CEO Atul Sobti will step down from next week after just a year in office.        
	Arun Sawhney, president of the companys global pharmaceuticals business, will replace Sobti.         
	There are opinions to run a company. When you believe you dont have a consensus, you move out. The differences were substantial and basic, but there was no immediate trigger, Sobti said.        
	This is the second major reshuffle in the Gurgaon-based company after Daiichi Sankyo bought out the founding familys 35 per cent stake in Ranbaxy to increase its holding to over 64 per cent.        
	Daiichi Sankyo had then asked Malvinder Singh to continue as CEO and made him a member of the Japanese firms senior global management team. However, Malvinder resigned prematurely in May 2009 after pocketing $10 million as severance package.         
	Sobti then took over as the CEO under a three-year contract. His sudden departure came as a surprise to analysts and company insiders.         
	Sobti, who had headed sales of two-wheeler maker Hero Honda before joining Ranbaxy five years ago, did not divulge his future plans. It will not be in the pharma sector. I have never gone back to the same industry, he said.        
	Sources said the sharp fall in quarterly profit by 52 per cent did not go down well with the Japanese owners.         
	Ranbaxy reported an April-June net profit of Rs 330 crore compared with a profit of Rs 690 crore a year ago. Sales for the quarter rose 22 per cent to Rs 2,100 crore.

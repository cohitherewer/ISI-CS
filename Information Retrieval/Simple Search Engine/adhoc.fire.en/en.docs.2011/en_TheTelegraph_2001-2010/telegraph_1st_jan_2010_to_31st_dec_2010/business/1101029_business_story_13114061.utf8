                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      PNB ups deposit rates
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: Punjab National Bank (PNB), the countrys second largest public sector lender, is raising deposit rates to mop up funds to meet credit demand in the second half of 2010-11.        
	Credit growth in the next two quarters of 2010-11 is likely to increase by around 27-30 per cent. So we are mobilising funds to cater to the larger borrowing demand, M.V. Tanksale, executive director of Punjab National Bank, told The Telegraph.        
	The expected boom in infrastructure, manufacturing and retail is fuelling credit growth, said analysts.        
	The New Delhi-based bank, keen to maintain its deposit growth at around 25 per cent, today announced two term deposit schemes  7.5 per cent for 555 days and 7.6 per cent for 1,000 days.        
	PNB also raised interest rates on fixed deposits by 0.25-0.50 per cent across various maturities in October. PNBs peak deposit rate is 8 per cent for the 8-10 year maturity bracket.        
	Company executives said another round of hike in deposit rates was likely after the RBI credit policy in November, when the central bank was expected to tinker with key interest rates.        
	PNBs deposits at the end of September amounted to Rs 2,73,394 crore, a year-on-year increase of 18 per cent from Rs 2,30,823 crore in September 2009. Advances grew 27 per cent year-on-year to Rs 2,08,764 crore.        
	Analysts said many other banks, including the State Bank of India, IDBI Bank and Karur Vysya Bank, were also increasing deposit rates by 0.75 per cent across various maturities to attract depositors.        
	Profit path        
	PNB today posted a 15.9 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 1,075 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2010. It had posted a net profit of Rs 927 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Net interest margin, a key measure of efficiency, was 4.06 per cent during the quarter.

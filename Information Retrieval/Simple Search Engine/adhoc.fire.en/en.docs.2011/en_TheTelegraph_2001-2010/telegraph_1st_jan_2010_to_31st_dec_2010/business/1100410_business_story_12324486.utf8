The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Solid start to 3G spectrum auction
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Solid start to 3G spectrum auction
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 9: The auction of third-generation (3G) spectrum got off to a rousing start today with total bid values touching Rs 16,000 crore for pan-India coverage.        
	Five rounds were completed in the nine-and-half hours of bidding today.        
	The Delhi circle, for which the reserve price is set at Rs 320 crore, generated the maximum interest from bidders with the winning price at the end of the fifth round being Rs 373.29 crore. Mumbai and Maharashtra were a close second at Rs 362.66 crore each.         
	Category A circles such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu also saw aggressive bidding on a par with the top metros at Rs 362.66 crore each.        
	The Calcutta circle attracted a bid price of Rs 135.99 crore, a 13 per cent rise over its base price of Rs 120 crore.         
	Nine circles, including West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Assam and Northeast, saw negative demand, which means fewer players were interested to bid for these circles than the number of slots up for sale.        
	The base price for pan-India 3G auction is Rs 3,500 crore.         
	The telecom ministry expects to garner anything between Rs 35,000 crore and Rs 45,000 crore from the sale of these high-speed radiowaves.        
	The bid levels are on expected lines. Five rounds were held today, said DoT officials, adding that the auction is expected to continue for at least two weeks before the price discovery is complete.        
	The online auction is being conducted simultaneously for all 22 circles through a simple computer interface.         
	The auction would end only when the number of bidders equalled the number of slots in all 22 circles.         
	All circles will remain open for bidding till the last round and bidders can exit or enter a circle at any given time.        
	Industry players said the pace of the auction on the first day suggested that the entire process could reach completion in the next three to five days.        
	The only concern is the low level of interest in certain Category C circles. The auction will not end till all circles have demand equal to supply, said an executive from a leading telecom firm, which is part of the auction process.        
	Rating comfort        
	Crazy bidding for 3G spectrum wont dent the ratings of telecom operators, said rating agency Crisil, as successful bidders will be able to enhance their business profile.        
	The rating agency, which forecast that telecom operators were unlikely to bid for all circles, cautioned that large debt funding might exert pressure on the financial profile of these companies.

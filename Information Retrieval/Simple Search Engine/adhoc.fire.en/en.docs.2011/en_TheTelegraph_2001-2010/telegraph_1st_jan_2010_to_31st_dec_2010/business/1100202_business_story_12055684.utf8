          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 1: Telecom minister A. Raja is not in favour of state-run BSNL issuing a fresh tender to buy GSM equipment for expansion.         
	Raja has written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh saying a further delay in expansion will have a deteriorating impact on BSNLs revenue and market share.        
	BSNL has been through one controversy after another ever since it floated the $10-billion tender in 2007 for buying GSM and 3G equipment as part of its expansion plans.         
	The Central Vigilance Commission has now told BSNL that it should scrap the ongoing tender for buying GSM equipment to support 93 million subscribers and go for a quick re-tender for procuring the gear.         
	However, Raja said, BSNL needs these lines badly in view of its rapidly declining market share. In this regard, you will appreciate the trend where corporate rivalries are buffering decision-making in many ways in the government, he said.        
	BSNLs project had hit a rough patch after it disqualified three of the five bidders on technical grounds.         
	Ericsson and Huawei were the only ones shortlisted for the contract. Those disqualified included Nokia Siemens, Alcatel Lucent and ZTE.         
	Nokia Siemens challenged the disqualification in court on grounds that it had been supplying equipment to the PSU in the past and, therefore, met the requirement.

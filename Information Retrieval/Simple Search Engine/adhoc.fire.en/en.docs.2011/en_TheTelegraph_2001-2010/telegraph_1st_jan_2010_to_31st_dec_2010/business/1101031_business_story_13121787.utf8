                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Refining margins provide the boost   Robust rise in RIL profit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 30: Reliance Industries  the countrys largest private conglomerate  today reported a 27.8 per cent increase in net profits for the second quarter ended September 30 at Rs 4,923 crore buoyed by the resurgence in gross refining margins.        
	In the same quarter last year, RIL had reported a net profit of Rs 3,852 crore.        
	Brokerages had estimated that RIL would post a profit between Rs 4,800 crore and Rs 4,990 crore on the back of an anticipated ramp-up in natural gas output from its fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin and higher gross refining margins (GRMs).         
	GRM is the difference between the value of petroleum products and the price of crude.        
	Gas output from KG-D6 in the first half of this fiscal rose to 10,669 million metric standard cubic metres (MMSCM), a 122 per cent increase over that a year ago.        
	Crude oil output also rose in the first half to 583,348 tonnes, a 163 per cent increase over that in the same period a year ago.        
	However, on a sequential quarter basis, both gas and crude oil output were down. Gas output in the second quarter amounted to 5,323 MMSCM against 5,376 MMSCM reported in the first quarter ended June 30, a decline of just under 1 per cent.         
	The quarter saw RIL posting a turnover of Rs 59,962 crore, up nearly 23 per cent over Rs 48,843 crore in the same period last year.         
	Of this, the highest growth came from the oil and gas segment which posted revenues of Rs 4,303 crore (Rs 2937 crore). This was followed by refining which generated revenues of Rs 49,672 crore (Rs 39,5654 crore) and petrochemicals Rs 15,096 crore (Rs 13,340 crore).        
	However, the oil and gas segment accounted for just 6.2 per cent of its gross turnover (including inter-segment revenues) of Rs 69,226 crore.        
	Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director, said, Improved refining margins and high operating rates at all our manufacturing facilities led to a record quarter. We are focused on identifying opportunities that leverage Indias unique demographic and market potential.        
	The company said the exploration and production business saw a nearly 47 per cent year-on-year growth in turnover on account of higher quantities of oil and gas production from KG-D6. However, it said the growth was partly offset by lower production from Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields.         
	The refining and marketing business, which is the biggest contributor to RILs topline, saw the GRM rise to $7.9 per barrel from $7.3 per barrel in the preceding quarter.         
	In the first half of the year, RIL posted a 30 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 9,774 crore from Rs 7,518 crore in the same period last year. Turnover in the six months ended September 30 was Rs 120,969 crore, an increase of 48.8 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year.        
	The companys cash chest  signified by the amount of cash and cash equivalents it holds - also swelled to Rs 29,354 crore ($6.5 billion). It is the largest cash trove held by any company in the country.        
	During the quarter, the company also increased the number of its subsidiaries to 21 with the addition of five companies to the list: Mark Project Services Pvt Ltd, Reliance Energy Generation and Distribution Pvt Ltd, Reliance Marcellus II LLC, Reliance Industries Investment and Holding Private Ltd, and Reliance Security Solutions Pvt Ltd.        
	The formation of the new company  Reliance Energy Generation and Distribution Pvt Ltd  is interesting.         
	After the Supreme Court verdict in the gas dispute in May, the Ambani brothers had scrapped the old and contentious non-compete agreement and signed a new one that gave Anil Ambanis group exclusive rights to gas-based power generation till March 31, 2022. Attention will almost certainly focus on the fledgling company in the next few quarters.

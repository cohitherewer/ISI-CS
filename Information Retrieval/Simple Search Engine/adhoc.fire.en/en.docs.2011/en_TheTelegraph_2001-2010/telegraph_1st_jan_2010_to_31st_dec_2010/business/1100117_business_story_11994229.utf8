          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Hard times                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 16: UltraTech Cements third-quarter profit fell 17.64 per cent to Rs 196 crore compared with Rs 238 crore in the corresponding period last year. The AV Birla group firm posted higher net sales of Rs 1,652 crore against Rs 1,631 crore in the same period last fiscal.        
	UltraTech Cement said a slowdown in demand growth in southern India, which constitutes around 30 per cent of the companys sales, had affected profits.        
	Moreover, new plants in the south have led to a drop in cement prices. The period also witnessed a drop in clinker exports because of reduced demand from West Asia. All these factors cumulatively impacted the companys margins.        
	Despite the disappointing results, UltraTech Cement is optimistic about the road ahead. The company sees industry demand growing over 10 per cent because of government initiatives to boost rural development, infrastructure and housing.        
	The cement industry may experience a surplus situation over the next 18 to 24 months, resulting in a pressure on margins. However, UltraTech hopes its focus on higher volume growth coupled with cost efficiency will partially offset the impact.        
	During the third quarter, the company produced 4.4 million tonnes of cement compared with 3.98mt in the year-ago period, registering a growth of 10 per cent year-on-year. Domestic sales at 4.34mt (3.88mt) reflects a rise of 12 per cent.        
	UltraTech Cement saved variable costs by 8 per cent by paring energy expenses. Gains from new thermal power plants commissioned during the calendar year were added to this.        
	In November last year, the board of UltraTech approved the amalgamation of Samruddhi Cement with the company. The appointed date of the amalgamation is July 1, 2010. Samruddhi constitutes the demerged cement business of Grasim Industries. A swap ratio of four shares of UltraTech for every seven of Samruddhi has been okayed.        
	On completion of this scheme, UltraTech is expected to emerge as the largest cement and ready mix concrete entity in the country, and the tenth largest in the world in cement capacity.        
	Meanwhile, the board has inducted .P. Puranmalka as additional director with immediate effect.         
	Puranmalka will take over as whole-time director of the company with effect from April 1.

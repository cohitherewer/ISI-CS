          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Soaring food prices have pushed inflation to a years high of 8.56 per cent in January that is above the RBIs forecast of 8.5 per cent for the year and cast a shadow on the stock and bond markets, who are fearing a rate hike.        
	There is a tough balancing act in the budget. If he (finance minister Pranab Mukherjee) withdraws stimulus it will put pressure on inflation. However, withdrawing stimulus is necessary to reduce fiscal deficit, said D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil. Inflation in December was 7.31 per cent, and it stood at 4.95 per cent in January 2009.        
	Prices of food articles leapt 17.4 per cent in January, after the weakest monsoon in nearly four decades hit harvests. The government has sought to tame food prices by selling reserve stocks of wheat and rice in the open market and allowing duty free imports of white sugar.        
	On the Bombay Stock exchange, the sensex did a U- turn in response to inflation as investors feared a rate hike by the RBI. The sensex had opened 74.45 points higher and peaked at 16227.04 for the day only to end 114.38 points lower at 16038.35 points because of prices.        
	Sugar prices rose 58.96 per cent in January year-on-year, while potatoes turned costlier by 53.39 per cent and pulses, 45.64 per cent. Prices of masur increased 9 per cent, arhar 6 per cent and wheat 4 per cent.        
	An increase in domestic fuel prices looks likely. We expect inflation to rise to double digit by March, said Sonal Varma, economist with Nomura. The fuel index rose 1.8 per cent because of higher prices of naphtha, which rose 21 per cent. Furnace oil rose 6 per cent while bitumen, non-coking coal and light diesel oil rose 3 per cent each.        
	Inflation took its toll on the bond markets as well, with yields rising, though they came off later in the day.         
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year security rose to 7.97 per cent, following which it ended at 7.87 per cent. Bond market circles, however, expect yields to remain higher and also breach the 8-per-cent mark shortly because of concerns that the Reserve Bank may hike key rates by April this year. Prices of most manufactured items were in control, and some of them even declined on a yearly basis.

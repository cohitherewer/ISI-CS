  - Cut in fiscal deficit tops Manmohans agenda        JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                                  
	New Delhi, June 1: The economy is on a steady growth path and is expected to expand 8.5 per cent this year, but the governments focus now is on trimming the fiscal deficit.        
	Measures to curb deficit include cutting subsidies on fuel and fertilisers over the next few years, besides rolling back the remaining tax breaks in the next budget.         
	A meeting of the group of ministers on fuel prices later this month could partially free prices, while the government is working on a fertiliser subsidy rationalisation plan by bringing in a nutrient-based subsidy policy.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who today released a report card of his government for the first year of UPA-II, said, The economy is expected to grow at 8.5 per cent ... this is one of the best performances in the world and reflects (our) strong fundamentals.        
	Data released yesterday showed Indias $1.2-trillion economy growing 7.4 per cent in 2009-10, after having slowed down to 6.5 per cent in 2008-09. These figures came after four years of average 9 per cent growth. Factory growth posted double-digit figures in the last quarter of the financial year gone by.         
	In contrast, China  the worlds fastest growing economy  reported that its factory growth had started slowing. The purchasing managers index issued by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing eased to 53.9 in May from 55.7 in April.        
	Singh also promised firm action to tackle rising prices. Indias annual wholesale inflation was at 9.59 per cent in April, coming off a 16-month high of 10 per cent in February, while prices of food articles rose over 17.4 per cent.         
	We will monitor the situation carefully and take whatever corrective steps are necessary, the Prime Minister said.         
	Growth during the year gone by had depended on pent-up demand from consumers who had tightened their belt during the economic slowdown and on stimulus packages in the form of increased government spending and tax breaks.         
	The government sanctioned a total tax giveaway of Rs 40,000 crore and an all time high expenditure budget worth Rs 10,20,838 crore, 40 per cent of which came from borrowings.        
	Like other countries we resorted to fiscal stimuli to deal with the fallout of a global slowdown. It worked well, but now we must return to the path of fiscal prudence leading to a calibrated reduction in our deficit, Singh said.        
	Several European nations, including Greece, Spain and Italy, which borrowed beyond their means, are now facing bankruptcy, and some are being forced to accept bailout packages from international bodies.        
	Top financial officials said the government had already plotted its return to fiscal prudence and would be soon announcing measures to slowly cut fuel subsidies.         
	Moves to rationalise fertiliser subsidies will come by December. Subsidies on fuels and fertilisers are expected to be over Rs 1,16,000 crore.

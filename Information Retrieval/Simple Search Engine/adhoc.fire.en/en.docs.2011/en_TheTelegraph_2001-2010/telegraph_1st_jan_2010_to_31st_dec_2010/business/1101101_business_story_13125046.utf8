The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coal warmth for retail 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Coal warmth for retail 
          SAMBIT SAHA                                             
	Calcutta , Oct. 31: Coal India, which completed the allotment of its shares today, gave retail applicants a maximum of 199 shares, higher than most marketmen had predicted.         
	The company wrapped up the process in less than a week given that the investors had the option till October 25 to change or withdraw their bids.         
	Coal India had come out with a customary post-issue announcement on October 26.         
	Retail investors will get shares at Rs 232.75 apiece after a discount of 5 per cent on the issue price of Rs 245.         
	Pundits had predicted 173-183 shares for retail investors after factoring in two things  subscription of 2.31 times in the category and under-subscription in the employee quota.         
	The government has decided to distribute the unsubscribed portion of the shares in the employee quota proportionately among the qualified institutional bidders, high net worth individuals (HNIs) and retail investors.         
	According to that formula, retail shareholders will get 35 per cent of the unsubscribed shares.         
	Of the 6.32-crore shares on offer for the employees, only 0.1 per cent were subscribed because of the persistent campaign by some Coal India unions who did not let employees apply for shares.         
	The overall IPO was subscribed 15.28 times, attracting funds worth $53 billion. The government will rake in Rs 15,200 crore from the sale.         
	The shares are expected to get listed on November 4, a day ahead of muhurat trading.         
	There has been widespread speculation about the listing price with the range varying from Rs 275 to Rs 300.         
	Some have predicted that Coal India may slip below the issue price as many investors will cash in on the euphoria over the listing.         
	This is especially true for HNIs who borrowed from the market to apply for the shares.         
	Link Intime is the registrar of the issue, while the refunds are being handled by ICICI Bank, HDFC and the State Bank of India. The investors are likely to be refunded before the listing date.

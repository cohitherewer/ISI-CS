          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Money matters                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 28: The government may float 15-year bonds to pay for its share of the proposed Rs 20,000-crore rights issue by the State Bank of India.         
	Top officials said the government was exploring the option as it could not by law let its shareholding fall below 51 per cent.         
	At present, the government holds over 59.4 per cent and is likely to let this holding fall somewhat but not below 51 per cent in any case, preferably above 55 per cent, said officials.         
	Earlier, the SBI act had mandated that the government should have a 55 per cent stake in the countrys largest bank. However, an amendment to the act has lowered the minimum holding to 51 per cent.         
	The last time the government subscribed to an SBI rights issue, it floated a 15-year, 8.35 per cent special bond that only the SBI could subscribe.        
	This meant the State Bank lent money to the government to buy fresh equity in the bank. This is a strategy which could be used once again  it gives the bank a paper which it can use in the repo or later reverse repo market, said officials.         
	Yesterday, finance secretary Ashok Chawla had told reporters that the government needs to support the rights issue but in what form and how is yet to be decided.        
	Officials said the SBI issue could not come before 2011 and at the earliest in the first half of the year.         
	Several steps have to be taken before the SBI can be given permission to float the issue and we also have to take into account the calendar for divestment in other PSUs and flotations by other PSU banks, officials said.        
	Officials estimate that PSU banks will need about Rs 35,000 crore of capital through issues by 2012 to keep pace with their expansion and the new Basel norms.         
	The government has already negotiated a $2-billion loan from the World Bank to provide capital support. However, that would pay for only a fraction of the money required. The government has in its budget agreed to give about Rs 16,500 crore this fiscal towards bank capitalisation.         
	Time it right        
	Since this will be a very big issue, the government does not want it to clash with any other major PSU or PSU bank issue. If it does, then while the SBI issue will succeed, the others may suffer, officials said.         
	The SBI, which is the largest state-run bank in the country, reported a 20.74 per cent increase in its gross advances during the first quarter of 2010-2011 at Rs 6,63,828 crore. Deposits rose 6.78 per cent to Rs 8,15,297 crore.         
	Indias No. 1 bank reported a net profit of Rs 2,914 crore during the quarter, a growth of 25 per cent over the corresponding period. Non-performing assets rose marginally to 1.7 per cent from 1.55 per cent.

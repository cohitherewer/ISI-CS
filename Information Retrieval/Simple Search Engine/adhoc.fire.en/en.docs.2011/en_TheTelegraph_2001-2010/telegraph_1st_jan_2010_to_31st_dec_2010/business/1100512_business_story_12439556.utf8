          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kanoria: Growth plans                                  
	Calcutta, May 11: Srei Infrastructure Finance will invest Rs 500 crore over the next three years to pick up equity stakes in road projects, a senior official of the company said.        
	We look at equity participation in road projects that we finance, said K.K. Mohanty, a whole-time director of Srei Infrastructure.         
	Last year, we got five such projects  two in Orissa, one in Uttar Pradesh, one in Haryana and one in Jammu amp; Kashmir. We shall pick up a stake in each of these projects varying between 26 per cent and 49 per cent, he added.        
	The total investment in these five projects, which have been awarded on a design-build-operate-transfer basis, has been estimated at Rs 5,000 crore.         
	Srei already has a share of 10 per cent to 49 per cent in 13 other road projects of 1,020 km, of which three have already started generating income from tolls.         
	The remaining projects are under implementation, Mohanty said. Last year, we have been awarded the project to convert the four-lane Bhubaneswar-Jagatpur-Chan-dikhol expressway into six lanes and the project is expected to collect toll in another two to three months.        
	According to Mohanty, Srei had already invested Rs 250 crore towards equity in these projects. The total investment in these 13 road projects has been estimated at Rs 13,000 crore.        
	Srei Infrastructure today reported a 90 per cent growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 156 crore for 2009-10.         
	We are targeting a net profit growth of 20-25 per cent in the current financial year, said Hemant Kanoria, chairman and managing director of Srei Infrastructure Finance.

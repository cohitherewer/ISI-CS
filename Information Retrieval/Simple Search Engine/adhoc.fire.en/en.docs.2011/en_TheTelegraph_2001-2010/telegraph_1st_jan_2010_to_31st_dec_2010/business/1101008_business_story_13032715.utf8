The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | JFE to shell out more for Jindal stake
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      JFE to shell out more for Jindal stake
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 7: JFE Steel Corporation of Japan, which entered into a stake purchase deal with JSW Steel in July, will have to shell out more if it wants to hold a 14.99 per cent stake in the Jindal company.         
	Under the agreement signed between the Japanese firm and Indias largest private sector steel maker on July 27, JFE had brought in Rs 4,800 crore by way of debentures that were to be converted into equity after 18 months.         
	Every debenture was to be converted into an equity share of Rs 1,331 giving JFE a 14.99 per cent stake in the Jindal company. However, there is a rider attached to this agreement.        
	According to the rider, the Japanese company will have to pay Rs 1,500 per JSW share instead of Rs 1,331 if the scrip closes above Rs 1,365 for five consecutive trading sessions any time during the 18-month period after the issuance of the debentures.        
	Starting October 1, the JSW Steel stock has closed above Rs 1,365 for five consecutive trading sessions on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	As a result, Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW will allot around 3.2 crore shares to JFE at Rs 1,500 apiece, giving the Japanese major a 14.61 per cent stake in the company.        
	The day the agreement was signed between the two sides, the JSW Steel scrip closed at Rs 1,162.         
	However, there has been a rally in the markets thereafter, buoyed by a strong foreign institutional investor inflow. Metal stocks such as JSW rallied 17.9 per cent compared with a 12.3 per cent rally in the sensex.        
	Potential upside        
	The recent surge in JSW Steel stock price coupled with the fact that Sajjan Jindal has agreed to infuse cash in the company by way of preferential allotment of 1.75 crore warrants  which will be converted into equity shares of Rs 1,210 apiece by December 2011  may prompt JFE to pump in more money to scale up its stake to 14.99 per cent in the Jindal company.         
	JFE has agreed to infuse Rs 600 crore to scale up its holding to 14.99 per cent in case Jindal converts warrants into equities.         
	The Japanese company may have to shell out Rs 300 crore more if outstanding foreign currency convertible bonds of JSW Steel get converted into equity.        
	The FCCBs will come up for maturity in June 2012 and the strike price for conversion will be Rs 953.

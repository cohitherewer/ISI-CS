The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | AI venture with Singapore takes off
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      AI venture with Singapore takes off
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ground work                                  
	New Delhi, April 17: Air India has joined hands with ground handler Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS) to form a 50:50 joint venture company, which will take over their three existing ground and cargo handling joint ventures in Bangalore and Hyderabad.         
	The new venture, to be named Air India SATS Airport Services, will be incorporated in Delhi and is expected to be completed next month.         
	The plan to spin off Air Indias ground and cargo handling into a single entity has been in the offing for some time and the state-run flagship carrier has faced strikes by employees protesting the plan.         
	The joint venture was planned two years back after the government changed ground handling rules at airports, limiting the number of ground handlers at airports to just three. The new rules were, however, kept in abeyance but would kick in from next year.         
	Air India may spin off more joint ventures in non-core areas such as engineering, sources said.         
	Airline unions had earlier described the joint venture as a backdoor attempt to privatise.         
	However, AI top brass today said they expected unions to work in tandem with them as all of us realise we are merely trying to be realistic in the face of new rules limiting the number of competitors in the ground handling business. The number of ground handlers are being curbed keeping security considerations in view.         
	AI chairman Arvind Jadhav said, SATS is a world class ground handler... Combining our knowledge of the market and the SATS strengths, we are confident this JV will gain superior competitiveness.        
	The collaboration is in line with Air Indias plans to select a ground handling partner at other metro airports in India such as Delhi and Mumbai, officials said.         
	While Air India picked SATS to be its joint venture partner for ground handling in India in 2008, the two were already collaborating in Hyderabad and Bangalore under three separate ground and cargo handling joint ventures.        
	SATS chief executive officer Clement Woon said SATS looked forward to growing its presence in India to serve key customers at more locations. We seek to deepen our participation in the privatisation of Indias aviation sector and contribute to the growth of the industry, Woon added.         
	SATS has been providing comprehensive airport services encompassing air freight handling, passenger services, ramp handling, baggage handling, aviation security and aircraft interior cleaning.         
	It also offers airline catering, food distribution and logistics, industrial catering, chilled and frozen food manufacturing as well as airline linen laundry.

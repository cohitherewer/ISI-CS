The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIM talks tough on security
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RIM talks tough on security
                            
	Boston, Sept. 17 (PTI): Amid discussions with India on interception of data sent from its BlackBerry devices, Canadas Research In Motion (RIM) has said it cannot compromise the security architecture of its enterprise solution.         
	The firm is in talks with the governments of India, UAE and other countries, as well as with service providers, and believe we have made good progress, co-CEO Jim Balsillie said. I am optimistic that a positive and constructive outcome can be achieved.         
	Lawful interception of BlackBerry messenger service will be possible only after three to four months, but RIM has refused to provide any technology for accessing its mail service, sources in the Indian government said.        
	While the entire interception process will be initially handled manually, the process of having automated information in real time for the BlackBerry messenger service will be possible after three to four months only, the sources said. RIM has assured the government of using a cloud computation method to create a separate server to give real time information.        
	India had threatened to ban corporate emails and BlackBerry-to-BlackBerry messenger services amid fears that encrypted communications could be used by militants to plan attacks.        
	Robust performance        
	RIM has posted a net income of $796.7 million for the second quarter ended August 28, up from $475.6 million last year.

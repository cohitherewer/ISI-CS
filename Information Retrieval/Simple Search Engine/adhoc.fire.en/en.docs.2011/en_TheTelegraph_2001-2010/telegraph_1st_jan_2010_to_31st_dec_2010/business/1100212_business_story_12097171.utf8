          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          NEW VISTA                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: A consortium led by ONGC has bagged a 40 per cent stake in a project to develop a major oil block in Venezuela.         
	ONGC Videsh (OVL), Indian Oil Corporation and Oil India Limited along with Spains Repsol YPF SA and Malaysias Petroliam Nasional BDH (Petronas) won the rights to develop the Carabobo-1 block in Venezuelas Orinoco belt, the company said in a statement here.        
	OVL, Repsol and Petronas, will have an 11 per cent stake each in the jointly-held company, which will develop the Carabobo-1 Norte and Carabobo-1 Centro blocks, while IOC and OIL will split a 7 per cent stake in the project equally.        
	The group will pay $1.05 billion to Venezuela as the signing amount and initially invest another $9 billion in the block that can produce 400,000 barrels of oil per day. Total spending on the block over 25 years will be $19 billion, ONGC officials said.        
	It will also extend $1.05 billion credit to Venezuelas state oil company Petroleos De Venezuela Sa, which has a 60 per cent interest in the project.        
	Venezuela yesterday announced the winners of two of the three Carabobo blocks it had auctioned last month. The Latin American nation gave out a 40 per cent stake to international firms, the largest oil investment in President Hugo Chavezs 11-year rule.        
	Chevron Corp will develop the Carabobo-3 block along with Mitsubishi Corp, Inpex Corp and Suelopetrol Ca of Venezuela after paying a signing amount of $500 million. The third oil block in the Carabobo area of the Orinoco will be assigned at a later date.

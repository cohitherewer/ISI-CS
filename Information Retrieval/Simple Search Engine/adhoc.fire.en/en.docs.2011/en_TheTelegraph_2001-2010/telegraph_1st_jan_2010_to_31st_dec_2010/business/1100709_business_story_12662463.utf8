          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 8: Dunlop-owner Pawan Kumar Ruia has sought more time to complete due diligence to acquire bankrupt South Korean automobile firm SsangYong Motor.        
	We have asked for some more time to complete the due diligence. Only after getting a response from them (SsangYong), we can decide on the next step, a senior official of the Ruia group told The Telegraph today.        
	Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M), which is also in the race for SsangYongs buyout, has said it will take a call before the July 20 deadline for the submission of bids.         
	The Ruia group and M amp;M are among the six suitors shortlisted for buying out the South Korean firm.         
	The Ruias have appointed global consulting firm Deloitte as an adviser.        
	SsangYong, which has been undergoing a restructuring programme following an order from the Seoul Central District Court last year, is looking for a buyer to stay afloat with fresh capital.         
	Chinas SAIC Motor Corporation owns about 10 per cent in SsangYong. About 70 per cent are held by creditors, led by state-owned Korea Development Bank. Their debts have been converted into shares.         
	Meanwhile, M amp;M is yet to decide on bidding for SsangYong  a decision will be taken once the due diligence is complete. The Mahindras have also not finalised the possible bidding price.         
	According to industry analysts, Mahindra and Mahindra is interested in the South Korean firm as the homegrown utility vehicle major can gain technological benefits from SsangYongs range of SUVs.        
	The SsangYong sale process was kicked off in May by the Seoul court and the deadline for the letters of intent is May 28. SsangYong is expected to select the preferred bidder in August.        
	In December, Ruia had acquired German auto component firm Henniges Automotive Grefrath.

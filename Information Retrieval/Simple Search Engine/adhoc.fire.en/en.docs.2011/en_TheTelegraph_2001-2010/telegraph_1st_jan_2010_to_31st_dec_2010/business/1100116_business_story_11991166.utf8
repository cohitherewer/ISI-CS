The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal spots five port sites
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bengal spots five port sites
          OUR BUREAU                          Search is on                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 15: The Bengal government has shortlisted five sites for a deep sea port to facilitate the operations of the proposed petrochemical hub at Nayachar.        
	State chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti today discussed the locations with NRI businessman Prasoon Mukherjee, who has floated a consortium  New Kolkata International Development Pvt Ltd (NKID)  to develop Nayachar. Indonesias Salim group is part of the consortium.        
	After todays meeting the chief secretary said: We held preliminary talks with Mukherjee on how to go about with our plans for the construction of a deep sea port. Its a time-consuming exercise and the real problem is the location of the proposed project.         
	We have identified five places where such a port can come up. Among them, the most probable places are Digha and Mandarmoni in East Midnapore and Sagar in South 24 Parganas. But we havent taken a final decision on the location and it will take a few more months to sort it out, Chakrabarti said.        
	Nandini Chakravorty, CEO of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, said it would be a private port and NKID would build it.        
	On the outcome of todays meeting, Mukherjee said: Calcutta Port Trust had shown me some areas where a deep sea port could be set up. But we are still undecided in this regard. Silt deposition in the Calcutta and Haldia ports has affected the navigability of the Ganga. So, an alternative port is required. Today, we had preliminary talks with the state government. Lets see how to proceed.        
	The deep sea port is a critical component for the petrochemical hub Mukherjee wants to build at Nayachar.        
	In the absence of a deep drafted port, very large crude carriers will not be able to bring cargo to the hub, affecting the viability of the entire project.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Exclusivity trap
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Exclusivity trap
        Wealth managers make you feel special only to unnecessarily lure you into complex investments, says Dhirendra Kumar                                            
	One of the terms that financial advisers like to use is asset allocation. Almost every financial planning begins with an exercise in asset allocation. Entities that are pitching themselves as wealth managers put special emphasis on this.         
	Generally, a wealth manager will ask you certain questions related to your life, your earnings and your future plans and then come up with a strategy that tells you how your savings and investments should be divided into different kinds of assets.        
	Based on what people tell me of their experience with these outfits, I have learnt that over the last few years, the asset allocation exercise has become increasingly complex.         
	Complex exercise        
	Earlier, a few rudimentary questions about your income and your risk tolerance would suffice with the wealth managers advising investments that could earn them the maximum commission.         
	These days, wealth managers flood you with dozens of questions about your past, present and future income and then come up with a long and complex financial plan, mostly recommending investments that would earn them a fat commission.        
	However, there is little doubt that we have come a long way. Earlier, financial plans were typically a sheet of paper that you could just read. Now, you are likely to get a text document and an Excel spreadsheet.         
	Some wealth management outfits may even throw in a PowerPoint presentation.         
	Thats not all. The wealth managers themselves have undergone a significant change with their growing importance. Theres considerable anecdotal evidence to suggest that the proportion of financial planners who wear neckties has increased sharply in recent years.        
	Clearly, the age of serious financial planning and wealth management is in. So often when one reads a newspaper or watches a business channel, one would come upon some worthy captain of the wealth management industry explaining why Indians need more and more of their services and how hard they are striving to provide those services. Unlike the necktie-wearing financial planner who actually visits you, the high priests who speak to the media wear business suits!         
	These are serious men, and they are seriously focussed on your wealth.        
	The basic premise is that rich people have complex financial needs and need special services to manage their money.         
	Special treatment        
	Like any consumer product, the advisers will liberally use terminology that will make you feel special. If you get attracted by a fancy advertisement or brochure for wealth management or high-end private banking, then the first thing to do is to close your eyes and count to ten.         
	The most important thing is to tell yourself that these people are using words such as wealth and private to manipulate your feelings, making you feel that they are going to do something special for you. Basically, these services are not about selling money management but a feeling of exclusivity, the same as any expensive product.         
	The idea is to tell you that since you are wealthy, you must have something exclusive, something specially designed for you.         
	How can you feel rich while investing in the same old things that ordinary people do? Its an easy trap to fall into since many consumer products and services are also sold through this kind of appeal. However, to fall for this exclusivity for a watch or a pair of shoes is a lot less harmful than it is for investment advice.        
	Think of it this way. If you are a good potential customer for such schemes, it definitely means that you have more money than the average Indian. Almost certainly, you didnt earn that money by being unsmart about your resources. You have a better chance of being able to figure out your investments yourself than the random marketing guy some bank may send to wheedle your money out of you.

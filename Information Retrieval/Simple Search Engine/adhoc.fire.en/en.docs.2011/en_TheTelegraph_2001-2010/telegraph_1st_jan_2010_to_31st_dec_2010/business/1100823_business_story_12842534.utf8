	New Delhi, Aug. 22 (PTI): A decision on infusing Rs 1,200 crore as equity into Air India is likely to be taken by the end of this month, official sources said today.        
	The government intends to look at equity induction in a phased manner and based on the performance parameters of Air India, the sources said.        
	Civil aviation secretary M. Madhavan Nambiar had met finance secretary Ashok Chawla last week and is understood to have discussed the airlines restructuring plan and related issues.        
	A group of ministers, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, may also meet in a couple of weeks to deliberate on the steps taken by National Aviation Company of India Ltd, the holding firm of Air India, to reduce costs and enhance revenue as part of its four-year turnaround plan.        
	Last month, Air India CMD Arvind Jadhav had said operations would break even by 2015 after presenting the financial restructuring plan before the board of directors.

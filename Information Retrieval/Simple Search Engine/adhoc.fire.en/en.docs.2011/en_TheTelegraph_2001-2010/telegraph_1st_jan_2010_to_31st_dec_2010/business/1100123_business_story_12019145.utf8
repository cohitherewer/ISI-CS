                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sunil Mitra appointed revenue secretary
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Mitra: New role				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The government has appointed disinvestment secretary Sunil Mitra as the new revenue secretary.         
	He will replace P.V. Bhide, who retires on January 31.        
	The appointments committee of the cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, also named Sumit Bose, secretary of the 13th Finance Commission, as the new secretary of the disinvestment department.        
	As revenue secretary, Mitra will play a crucial role in the making of the budget proposal.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is expected to present the budget for 2010-11 on February 26.        
	Mitra, a 1975 batch IAS officer from the Bengal cadre, is a close confidant of the finance minister and will play a crucial role in tapping new revenue sources as the government plans to reduce its fiscal deficit.        
	The budget for the current fiscal has forecast an unprecedented fiscal deficit (the gap between the governments income and expenditure) at over Rs 4 lakh crore, or 6.8 per cent of GDP.        
	The stimulus measures given by the government to shield the economy from the global financial crisis have left a yawning gap between revenue and expenditure.        
	In July, Mitra, who was the Bengal power secretary, was chosen by Mukherjee as secretary in the disinvestment department.         
	Sumit Bose, a 1976 batch IAS officer from Madhya Pradesh cadre, was with the Finance Commission for nearly two years.         
	The commission had recently submitted its report to President Pratibha Patil.        
	The government plans to sell Rs 25,000 crore of shares belonging to PSUs in this fiscal, more than half the amount sold through disinvestment since 1991.        
	On the sell-off list are iron ore producer NMDC, power generator NTPC and hydroelectric power producer Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam.              
	Meanwhile, the member of the 13th Finance Commission briefed Finance Minister on its recommendations on sharing tax receipts between the centre and the states, which are likely to have some ramifications in the budget.               
	Today Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee was briefed on the recommendations of the commission. From here, it would go to the cabinet, officials said.              
	The recommendations (of the Finance Commission) will be reflected in the Budget, Mukherjee has said.              
	Apart from suggesting a formula for sharing tax revenues, the finance panel was asked to look into the impact of the proposed Goods and Services Tax scheduled to be introduced in April 2010.              
	Currently, states and the union territories get Rs 1.64 lakh crore in a year, or around 30 per cent of the shareable taxes collected by the Centre. The total tax revenue of the government, which include shareable and non-shareable taxes, has been estimated at Rs 641,079 crore during 2009-10. The twelfth finance commission had recommended that 30.5 per cent of the shareable central taxes should be shared among the states and the union territories.              
	The finance commission report assumes significance in view of the ongoing reforms in indirect and direct taxes, which will have a bearing on the tax collections. The government proposes to introduce the goods and services tax (GST) which will subsume levies like excise, vat and service tax next year.              
	ends

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Firms prepare to take a call on 4G tech
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Firms prepare to take a call on 4G tech
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Ready to connect                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 14: Broadband service providers are gearing up to launch fourth-generation (4G) wireless data services from the second quarter of 2011-12, amid a raging debate among operators on whether to use WiMax or long term evolution (LTE) technologies.         
	4G will allow users to access the Internet at a much faster speed, facilitating the seamless use of many value-added applications.         
	WiMax and LTE are both supported on the 2.3GHz band of spectrum, recently sold by the government as wireless broadband radiowaves. WiMax is an established technology, while LTE is still under trial. The equipment supporting LTE is also expensive.         
	Reliance Industries-backed Infotel, the only operator to get a pan-India broadband licence, has said it will roll out services by the middle of 2011-12 and is likely to use LTE.         
	The other winners such as Bharti Airtel, Aircel, Tikona Digital Networks and Augere have all set similar timelines without committing to any specific technology.         
	There is confusion among BWA spectrum winners on the use of technology. The service providers also need time to put infrastructure in place and establish manpower, so a timeline for the second quarter of 2011-12 seems a fair projection, C.S. Rao, chairman of the WiMax Forum India, told The Telegraph.        
	Some equipment vendors, including Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson and Nokia Siemens, have given up on WiMax, but Samsung, Intel and Huawei still support the technology.        
	US-based chip maker Beceem said operators had shown interest in initially using WiMax because of its low cost and then switching to LTE in two to three years.         
	For a price-sensitive country such as India, operators are looking for a technology, which allows them to immediately provide low-cost wireless Internet to enable mass adoption and eventually upgrade to a newer technology, said Lars Jonsson, vice-president of Beceem Communications.        
	A call on whether to invest in LTE over WiMax, considering the fact that there are few networks up and running, will be taken only after 3G services stabilise, said an official of a leading domestic telecom firm.        
	Telecom gear maker Alcatel-Lucent is confident that the issues on technology will be resolved and operators will deploy networks as early as the second quarter of next year.         
	The government targets to achieve 100 million broadband subscribers by 2014. At the end of March, India had just 8.3 million subscribers.

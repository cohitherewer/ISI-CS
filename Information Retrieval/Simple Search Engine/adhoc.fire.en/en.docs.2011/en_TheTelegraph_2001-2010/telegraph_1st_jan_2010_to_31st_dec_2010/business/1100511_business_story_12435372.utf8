                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Europe package lifts mood 
  Global stocks surge          AGENCIES                                                  
	New York, May 10: European leaders and major central banks announced an array of emergency lending measures over the weekend aimed at easing the sovereign debt crisis.         
	The $1-trillion package gave Wall Street the push it needed after weeks of uncertainty over the European debt crisis, and on Monday it jumped into the rally in equity markets that the good news had fuelled.         
	The relief package consists of 440 billion euros in guarantees from euro area states, plus 60 billion euros in an European stabilisation fund that could be disbursed to help euro zone states if needed on strict austerity conditions.         
	EU finance ministers said the International Monetary Fund would contribute up to 250 billion euros, taking the total to 750 billion euros, or around $1 trillion.        
	Officials were hoping the size of the programme  a little more than a trillion dollars  would signal a shock and awe commitment to such troubled countries as Greece, Portugal and Spain, in the same vein as the $700 billion package the US government provided to help its own ailing financial institutions in 2008.         
	On top of the unprecedented sum, the European Central Bank reversed its position of just a few days ago and said it would buy government and corporate debt. And the worlds leading central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, announced a joint intervention to make more dollars available for interbank lending. Central bank purchases of eurozone government bonds began on Monday.        
	Traders wasted no time exploiting the opportunity. Market strategists held conference calls with institutional investors and investors lined up conference calls and scheduled meetings to discuss strategy.         
	At 23:50 (IST), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 342.21 points, or 3.30 per cent. The broader Standard amp; Poors 500 stock index rose 3.59 per cent, and the technology heavy Nasdaq was up 3.88 per cent.         
	European shares closed with gains. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, rose 10.35 per cent, while the FTSE 100 index in London rose 5.16 per cent.         
	The CAC-40 in Paris rose 9.66 per cent and the DAX in Frankfurt, 5.30 per cent.         
	Asian markets also rose. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average rose 1.6 per cent, while the Sydney market barometer S amp;P/ASX 200 rose 2.7 per cent. In China, Hong Kongs Hang Seng index gained 2.5 per cent, and the Shanghai composite index added 0.4 per cent.         
	The mood is incredibly positive, said Marc Harris, co-head of global research at RBC Capital Markets.         
	The agreement basically covers what could potentially be European debt payments for the next couple of years. But at least for the moment it puts aside any concerns.

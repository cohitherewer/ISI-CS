The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Tele quits GSM lobby
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata Tele quits GSM lobby
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Connection error                                  
	New Delhi, July 12: Divergent views on 2G spectrum pricing have split the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI)  a GSM lobby  into two groups, the old and new players.        
	Tata Teleservices  a new entrant in the GSM arena  today resigned from the core membership of the COAI, stating that the association represented the views of only the older players. Other new GSM players are likely to follow suit.        
	New operators are planning to form a rival association, which will give them a better platform to voice their views.        
	Besides Tata Tele, the other new unified access services licence holders are Loop Telecom , Etilasat DB, Uninor and STel. The established operators are Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular.        
	According to analysts, the two groups are divided over telecom regulator Trais recommendations on 2G spectrum pricing that linked the price of spectrum beyond 6.2MHz to the price of 3G radiowaves. While the new operators are in favour of the recommendations, firms such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Essar have vehemently opposed the move.         
	New players maintain that Trais proposals are aimed at bringing about a level-playing field.         
	The COAI has, however, been opposing the move and voicing only in favour of the incumbent players, said a senior executive of a new GSM operator.        
	The COAI is not a transparent association and it has been extremely disappointing, even frustrating, for us to see the autocratic, undemocratic, non-transparent, unethical and even biased manner in which it functions, while staking claim to be the representative of the collective and unified voice of all GSM operators in the country, Tata Teleservices said.        
	Last week, Sanjay Kapoor, CEO (India amp; South Asia) of Bharti Airtel, was elected chairman of the COAI, while Idea Cellular managing director Sanjeev Aga became the vice-chairman.        
	Last year, the UAE-based Etisalat had accused the organisation of representing the views of just two major players, Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Oct. 4: Senior bankers have assured RBI governor D. Subbarao that the growth in deposit collections should pick up pace following the recent spate of rate hikes.         
	Deposit growth rate in the first half of the fiscal at 14.78 per cent is much below the RBIs forecast of 18 per cent.         
	At a meeting ahead of the RBIs half-yearly monetary policy review scheduled for November 2, bankers said growth in advances could also turn strong with the economy looking up.         
	However, for the entire fiscal, it could be in the range of 18-19 per cent, falling marginally short of the central banks projection of 20 per cent growth.         
	At present, credit growth stands as 19.8 per cent.         
	Some of the bankers who attended the meeting included S. Sridhar, chairman and managing director of the Central Bank of India, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt, ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, Neeraj Swaroop, India head of Standard Chartered Bank, and HDFC Bank managing director Aditya Puri.         
	We are through with the September (quarter). It was a pre-policy meeting we had with the RBI, Sridhar said.         
	Recently, the State Bank of India had raised deposit rates by 25-75 basis points.         
	Its peers such as Punjab National Bank, IDBI Bank and Indian Bank raised deposit rates by 50-75 basis points.

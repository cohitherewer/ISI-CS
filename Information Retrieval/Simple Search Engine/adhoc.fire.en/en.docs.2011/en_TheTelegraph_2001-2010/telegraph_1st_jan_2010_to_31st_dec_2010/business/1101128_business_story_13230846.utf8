The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court upholds Sebi power
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Court upholds Sebi power
                              Winning ways                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 27 (PTI): In a landmark order, the Supreme Court held that the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) cannot give exemption to a company or an investor from following the disclosure and investor protection guidelines of market regulator Sebi.        
	The apex court said yesterday that such exemption to companies and individuals could only be given by the Securities and Exchange Board of India under the Sebi Act.        
	A bench headed by the Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia said the order passed by the SAT directing the Bombay Stock Exchange to list shares of S. Kumars Nationwide was not valid under the law. Earlier, in 2005 Sebi had rejected such an approval to the company for not following disclosure and investor protection guidelines.        
	The contention of Sebi appears to be correct. The observations to the contrary in the impugned (SAT) order does not appear to be correct in law, said the bench which also comprised Justices K.S. Radhkrishnan and Swatanter Kumar.        
	The apex courts direction came over a petition filed by Sebi challenging the orders of SAT, which had on August 7, 2009 directed the Bombay Stock Exchange to grant an in-principle approval to the issue, allotment and listing of shares issued by S. Kumars Nationwide to its promoters on a preferential basis.        
	This was challenged by the company before the SAT, which upheld its contention that it could not comply with DIP guidelines for reasons beyond its control. The tribunal then invoked the exemption clause (17.2.A.1) itself and noted that the company need not go to Sebi for the same.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 25: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) today signed a revised gas supply agreement in compliance with a recent Supreme Court order.        
	While handing down a verdict on May 7 in favour of RIL in the gas supply dispute between the Ambani brothers, the apex court had directed the two sides to sign a fresh gas supply master agreement. RNRL was seeking gas at a cheaper price than what was fixed by the government for production from the KG-D6 basin where RIL was the contractor.         
	The said gas supply master agreement is compliant with the gas utilisation policy and empowered group of ministers (e-GoM) decisions, RIL said in a statement today.        
	The terms of the revised gas supply agreement have not been made public. RIL will reportedly supply 28 million metric standard cubic metres of gas a day (mmscmd) to RNRL at a price of $4.2 million British thermal units (mBtu) for a period of 17 years. No confirmation was available on these numbers.        
	A statement by RNRL to the stock exchanges said, RNRL will now take appropriate steps requesting the Government of India for expeditious allocation of natural gas to facilitate implementation of the same.        
	Fridays development, however, throws up several questions. Analyst S.P. Tulsian, who has been tracking the tussle, said, Will the revised pact be tenable or does it need to be entered into with the ultimate user which could be Reliance Power?        
	Recently, Reliance Power acquired 433MW of generation assets from Reliance Infrastructure for Rs 1,095 crore. These assets comprise 200MW at Samalkot in Andhra Pradesh, 165MW at Kochi in Kerala and 48MW at Zuarinagar (Goa).        
	Tulsian said the Anil Ambani group might take between 36 and 60 months to create 9,000MW capacity that can absorb a gas supply of 28mmscmd. Then there is the question of the tenure of the pact which has reportedly been signed for 17 years.         
	The KG basin gas production will come to a halt by March 2025, Tulsian added.        
	Deepak Pareek, Angel Brokings oil and gas analyst, said the revised gas pact would be seen as a positive for ADAG companies but will be viewed as neutral for RIL. An assured supply of gas will ensure that ADAG can achieve financial closure for its power projects.        
	The RNRL stock shot up 7 per cent after the announcement of the revised gas pact and closed 3 per cent higher at Rs 65.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. RIL closed 1.14 per cent higher at Rs 1,063.25.

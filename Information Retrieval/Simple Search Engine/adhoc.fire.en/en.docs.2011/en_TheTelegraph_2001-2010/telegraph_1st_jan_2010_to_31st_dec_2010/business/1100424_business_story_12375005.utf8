The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Food bill only after BPL review
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Food bill only after BPL review
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pawar: Pragmatic                          
	New Delhi, April 23: A ministers panel today asked the Planning Commission to prepare comprehensive data on families living below the poverty line (BPL) to enable it to finalise the food security bill.        
	The Planning Commission has been tasked to give a detailed presentation on the BPL families, a member of the eGoM (empowered group of ministers) said after the meeting today. The group is headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Asked about a much expected decision on the food security bill, being reconsidered following Congress president Sonia Gandhis intervention, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said food security was not on the agenda.        
	The eGoM discussed whether we can improve the allocation of food grains through the PDS (public distribution system), Pawar told reporters after the meeting.         
	Home minister P. Chidambaram, defence minister A.K. Antony, commerce minister Anand Sharma and rural development minister C.P. Joshi also attended the meeting.        
	Storage facilities were discussed by the group. The question is where to store? We have selected various storages where we can secure food. We have taken the help of the private sector, Pawar said.        
	The minister said the India Meteorological Departments (IMD) projection of normal monsoon this year is very good for the agriculture sector.        
	The eGoM had earlier met on March 18 and then again on April 5 to deliberate upon incorporating the suggestion of Sonia Gandhi, who is also the chairperson of the National Advisory Council, to provide 35 kg of rice or wheat per month to each BPL family at Rs 3 a kg. The eGoM had initially proposed 25 kg of foodgrain to each BPL family in the draft food security bill.         
	The ministers deferred a decision on the bill till the Planning Commission gave a report on BPL families.        
	The plan panel is working on fresh numbers and the financial implication of implementing the proposed law.        
	Disturbing fact        
	As many as 78.2 crore Indians will be living on less than $2 a day by 2015, a joint report by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund said here today.         
	The report, however, said the number of poor Indians living on less than $2 would moderately decline to 68.6 crore by 2020. The report says that by the turn of the next decade as many as 26.8 crore would be living on less than $1.25 a day, while in 2015 the figure would be 29.5 crore.

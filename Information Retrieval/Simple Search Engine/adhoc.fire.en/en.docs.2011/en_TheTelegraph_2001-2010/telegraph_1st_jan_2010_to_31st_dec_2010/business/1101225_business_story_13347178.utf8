          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the economy had the capacity to absorb heavy capital inflows beyond the level of $38 billion reached till November.        
	We have the capacity to absorb these levels (of capital inflows). If this goes beyond a point, that would be a matter of concern but that may be in future but not right now. Therefore, I am not pressing a panic button right now, Mukherjee said at an industry meet here today.        
	The FIIs have pumped over $38 billion into the capital markets so far this year, encouraged by the prospect of sizable returns amid uncertainty elsewhere in the world. RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn had said inflows were not a concern as the trade gap  which stood at $9.7 billion in October  was high.         
	Mukherjee said the governments fiscal policy and the RBIs monetary actions were in tandem and would help the economy achieve a higher growth trajectory.         
	He said growth during this and the next quarter would be as encouraging as the 8.9 per cent recorded in the previous two quarters.        
	The Reserve Banks decision to inject Rs 48,000 crore into the system, according to the finance minister, is a sign of the apex banks awareness of the requirements of higher growth.         
	High credit needs had sucked out liquidity from the system, which the RBI replenished in its last weeks policy review by injecting cash, while keeping its rates intact.

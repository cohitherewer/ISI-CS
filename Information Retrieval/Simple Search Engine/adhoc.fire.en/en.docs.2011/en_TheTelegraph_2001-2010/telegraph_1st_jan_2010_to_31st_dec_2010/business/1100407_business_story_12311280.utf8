The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IPO listing in 12 days
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      IPO listing in 12 days
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 6: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today cut the time between the closure of an initial public offering and its listing to 12 days from 22 days.        
	In a statement today, the market regulator said the revised timeline would be applicable to issues opening on or after May 1.         
	Sebis move is expected to make the process more efficient. The shorter time gap may affect the grey market (unofficial buying of shares before its listing) for IPOs, which has witnessed a spurt in activity because most maiden offers have listed at a premium.        
	Analysts said Sebi was fast moving towards its target of bringing down the time period to seven days by the end of this calendar year.         
	Last year, Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave had floated the plan to reduce the gap between a issue closing and its listing to one week. He had then said that the primary market issuance process was not as efficient as the secondary market. At present, it takes around 15 days from issue closing to the allotment of shares and one more week for the listing of shares.        
	We need to do something there. At present, it takes 20 days for an IPO to get listed after its closure. The delay in listing is a risk that investors and issuers carry. So the regulators aim is to reduce the time frame to one week within a year, he had said.        
	According to Bhave, the key bottleneck in speeding up the IPO process is the payment and settlement mechanism. To address this, Sebi had introduced the ASBA (application supported by blocked amount). Under this system, investors can apply for an IPO without transferring the money. The application amount stays in the investors account, and is debited when the shares are allotted.

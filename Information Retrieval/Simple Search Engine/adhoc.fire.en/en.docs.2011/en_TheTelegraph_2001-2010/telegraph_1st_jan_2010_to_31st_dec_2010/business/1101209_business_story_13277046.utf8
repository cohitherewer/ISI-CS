          ANASUYA BASU                               
	Pune, Dec. 8: Mercedes-Benz expects to clock an 86 per cent growth in sales at 6,000 units this year against 3,250 units sold in 2009. Mercedes had sold 5,461 units till November.         
	The premium car market grew 65 per cent during this period. BMW, the main competitor of Mercedes, is planning to sell 5,000 units this year.         
	Mercedes took 13 years to produce 20,000 cars, two-and-a-half years to produce the next 10,000 cars and we would take less than two years to produce another 10,000 cars, outgoing chief executive Wilfried Aulbur said, while rolling out the 30,000th car from its Chakan facility in Pune today.        
	The company plans to invest Rs 200 crore in the next 18 months to set up a paint shop at its manufacturing facility.         
	Mercedes will invest Rs 200 crore to set up a paint shop capable of water-based painting, Aulbur said.         
	The companys total investment in its Chakan facility, in Maharashtra, will go up to Rs 600 crore with this additional amount.         
	The paint shop has an annual capacity of 20,000 units that can be extended to 40,000 units. It will be operational by the second half of 2012.         
	Mercedes will also start the second shift at its facility, having exhausted the capacity to produce 5,000 cars annually in the first shift. Within two years of starting production at the Chakan facility, we have exceeded the first-shift capacity, said Aulbur.         
	Mercedes will expand CKD (completely knocked down) production in India from 2013 after the operations begin at the paint shop.        
	We will definitely produce more locally assembled cars in India by 2013 when we significantly ramp up our production facility, Aulbur said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Mumbai, Dec. 9: Panic over rumours that more market operators may figure in cases of price rigging and apprehensions over rising interest rates and scams in the country saw the sensex plummet 454 points to 19242.36 with mid-cap and small-cap stocks taking a sharp knock.         
	Investor wealth as measured by market capitalisation on the BSE was shaved off by Rs 2,06,935 crore to Rs 6,851,560 crore.         
	Observers were apprehensive in their outlook for tomorrow, pointing out that unless the Securities and Exchange Board of India came out with a clarification as to whether it was investigating any more cases of price manipulation or individuals in this regard, equities would continue to remain in the red.         
	Another factor worrying them is the heavy selling by foreign institutional investors. While foreign investors have been net sellers over the past couple of sessions, the worry is that their selling may increase if the current bout of weakness continues. Though todays fall was attributed to various reasons, the principal factor according to market circles that led to panic was speculation that names of more entities may soon come out in relation to price manipulation.         
	Over the past few days, the market regulator has pulled up four listed companies, high net worth individual Sanjay Dangi and other entities for their role in market manipulation. What is worrying the market now is an Intelligence Bureau report that has named certain market operators who have allegedly indulged in manipulating prices of various stocks. It is feared that more names will now come out.         
	Texts citing different names are doing the rounds, a broker said. Certain companies named by the Intelligence Bureau whose share price was rigged had seen their values tumbling.         
	The fall came on a day when global markets were positive. The sensex opened at 19746.15, dipped to an intra-day low of 19160.87, a fall of 536 points, and thereafter ended at 19242.36, a drop of 454.12 points.

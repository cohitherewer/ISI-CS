The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Union Bank defers fund-raising plan
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Union Bank defers fund-raising plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           On hold                                  
	Mumbai, April 14: Public sector Union Bank of India has deferred a move to raise around $350 million through the issue of bonds.         
	Proceeds from the issue, part of its $2-billion medium-term note programme, were to be used to fund the banks international operations and lending in India.         
	Sources close to the bank said the postponement came in the wake of the crisis in Greece that had resulted in investors seeking more returns on bonds, a demand that it was not inclined to oblige.         
	It is learnt that Union Bank will hit the markets once it is confident of raising money at better rates.         
	The bonds, denominated in dollars, carry a BBB-rating of Standard amp; Poors.         
	The bank had appointed Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, Standard Chartered Plc and Barclays Plc as the lead arrangers.         
	Union Bank is not the only financial institution looking to raise money abroad to fund asset growth, primarily in overseas operations.         
	Recently, Bank of Baroda (BoB), Bank of India (BoI) and Axis Bank had raised between $300 million and $350 million through such issues.         
	BoB had raised $350 million through its London branch by way of over five years and six months senior unsecured bonds maturing on October 7, 2015. The bonds carried a coupon of 4.75 per cent.         
	Similarly, BoI had raised $500 million through the issue of senior notes under its medium-term note programme on March 31 at the same coupon rate.         
	According to bankers, many other banks are also likely to hit the international markets in the current year following the recovery in global and domestic economies.         
	Union Bank had earlier raised around Rs 500 crore through the issue of redeemable non-convertible subordinated bonds having a 15- year tenure.         
	The PSU banks global advances grew 23 per cent for the year-ended March 31.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telenor stands by local entity credentials
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Telenor stands by local entity credentials
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: Norways Telenor, which owns over 67 per cent in its Indian venture Uninor, said it had done its due diligence before picking up a stake in the Unitech entity.        
	The telecom firm is under the scanner of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on allegations that it failed to meet the eligibility criteria for second-generation (2G) mobile licence.        
	Real estate player Unitech was given 2G licence and spectrum for Rs 1,651 crore in 2008 after which it sold a majority stake in its telecom subsidiary to Telenor for around Rs 11,000 crore. If the allegations are proved correct, Unitech may lose its licence.        
	The issue relates to a period before Telenor entered the picture. We also did our own investigation (before buying into Unitech) and are assured that all licence conditions have been met, Jon Fredrik Baksaas, president and CEO of Telenor, told The Telegraph.        
	Baksaas said Telenor would co-operate with the government to complete the inquiry, adding that it was not overtly concerned over the issue.        
	Government officials said even if the companies were found to be ineligible it would be difficult to terminate the licences as many consumers would be affected.         
	Meanwhile, mobile number portability may kick off soon in east and south India as the home ministry has cleared the FDI proposal of US-based Telcordia Technologies, which will implement the project, according to PTI. The approval comes with the rider that the company cannot employ in India any staff who has worked in its Pakistan operations at any point of time.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 2: HDFC Ltd, the countrys largest housing finance company, today came out with the third version of its dual rate product scheme, just two days after the State Bank of India extended its popular home loan scheme till September 30.         
	HDFC will offer home loans at a fixed rate of 8.25 per cent for the first year, 9.25 per cent for the second year and then the applicable floating rate for the remaining term.         
	The fixed rates are applicable for all new home loans irrespective of the loan amount.        
	However, compared with the second version of this scheme, the corporation is charging a higher interest rate in the second year.         
	In the earlier scheme, the interest for the first year was 8.25 per cent and 9 per cent for the second year.         
	Industry sources said in charging 9.25 per cent for the second year, the corporation was taking into account a possible hike in interest rates in the system.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 15: Bankers and economists arent just looking out for rate hike signals from the Reserve Bank of India tomorrow when its policy makers hunker down for the first ever mid-term monetary policy review.        
	They will also be keenly waiting to see whether the central bank  which has flagged inflation-busting as its highest priority this year  will trim its inflation forecast for the year ended March 2011 from the 6 per cent it projected in July.        
	The possibility of a revision of the inflation forecast has been raised by the robust monsoon this year and the recast of the wholesale price index earlier this week, which saw the inflation rate in the month of August dip to 8.5 per cent from 9.78 per cent in July.        
	Senior economists and treasury chiefs are not ruling out the possibility of the RBI lowering its inflation forecast for the year in its mid-term review tomorrow. While announcing the first quarter review of its monetary policy 2010-11 in July, the RBI had raised the inflation projection to 6 per cent from 5.5 per cent for March 2011.        
	The RBI may bring it (inflation forecast) down to 5.5 per cent, Abheek Barua, chief economist of HDFC Bank, told The Telegraph. Barua, who doesnt expect the central bank to raise its key policy rates tomorrow, added that the inflation trajectory had now improved with both manufactured and primary products showing a downward bias.        
	Barua expected inflation to come down to 5 to 5.5 per cent by the end of this fiscal because of the combination of the base effect which will work in favour of better inflation number and the good monsoon that is expected to have a positive impact on primary articles. By the end of this year, we should see a fairly soft inflation number, he added.        
	Such an outlook comes just a day after a revamped wholesale price index was released. The revision showed headline inflation for August at 8.5 per cent, lower than the estimates of 9.5 per cent according to the old index. Barua said the RBI might go with the new series.        
	Harihar Krishnamurthy, treasurer at FirstRand Bank, also felt that the apex bank might lower its inflation forecast. He said inflation was set to moderate due to supply side factors (good monsoon) and the base year comfort.        
	As regards any policy action, bankers are divided on the prospects of the RBI hiking the reverse repo and the repo. Many economists and bankers feel that the RBI will raise both by 25 basis points. Others, however, feel that only the reverse repo will be raised by 25 basis points.        
	D.R. Dogra of CARE Ratings said there would be no change in the rates as liquidity was under pressure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Market cop turns heat on Tayals 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Market cop turns heat on Tayals 
                                                      
	Mumbai, March 9: The Tayals  promoters of the Bank of Rajasthan and no strangers to controversy  are in trouble once again.        
	A day after the Reserve Bank of India ordered a special audit of the banks books, the capital market watchdog Sebi barred 100 persons and entities including four from the Tayal family from all stock market activity.        
	Pravin Kumar Tayal  the head of the Tayal family was among those barred. The others were Navin, Sanjay and Saurabh Tayal.        
	A Sebi investigations into share transactions in Bank of Rajasthan between June 2007 and December 2009 threw up startling facts about the ownership and control of the private sector bank that the Tayals had acquired from the Bangurs in the late 1990s.        
	The investigation revealed that the Tayal group had funnelled funds to two distinct groups  the Yadav group and the Silvassa group  which were then used to scoop up the banks shares either from the market or through off-market deals.        
	As a result, the promoters stake in the bank had leapt to 55.01 per cent by December 2009  after peaking at 60 per cent in June 2008. The bank, on the other hand, had claimed in a stock market filing last December that the promoters didnt hold more than 28.61 per cent.        
	The stake increase through an intricate skein of cash and stock transactions between 100 entities over a period of 30 months appear to have made a mockery of an RBI directive in February 2005 to all private sector banks to scale back the promoters stake to 10 per cent. The banks had been asked to come up with a realistic timetable to bring down the promoters holding to that level.        
	The Tayals  through their filings with the exchanges  claimed to have been complying with that directive and had brought down their holdings from a high of 44.18 per cent in June 2007 to 28.61 per cent by December 2009.        
	The Sebi investigation reveals that even these figures were false: it estimated the promoters holding in the bank at 44.71 per cent in June 2007 (slightly higher than the bank had claimed) and had actually shot up to 55.01 per cent by December 2009.        
	The stake increase had been carried out in a deceptive and fraudulent manner, said an ad interim ex-parte order prepared by K.M. Abraham, whole-time member of Sebi.        
	The persons and entities have been given 21 days to file their objections to the order that was issued late on Monday night and came into effect immediately.        
	It is not clear at this stage whether the RBI is contemplating any action based on Sebis investigation. Last month, the banking regulator had imposed a Rs 25 lakh fine on the bank for violation of regulations. It then ordered two Deloitte entities to trawl the banks books.        
	Sources from the bank distanced themselves from the controversy and claimed that the Tayals were not technically promoters of the bank since they didnt control its day-to-day affairs.        
	In an interview with a television channel earlier in the day, P.K. Tayal said he hadnt received a copy of the order and denied that there had been any fund transfers between entities under his control and other outfits to purchase the banks stock. He couldnt be reached later to reconfirm his stand on the serious charges levelled against the banks promoters.              
	The fronts               
	The Sebi report contends that the Yadav group  35 entities which had Girish Yadav and/or Sangeeta Sawant as directors  received money from Tayal group entities and certain other promoter group companies to buy the banks shares. Out of 35 Yadav group entities, 19 actively executed share transactions both on the stock exchanges and off-market, said the report.        
	The report revealed that the Yadav group held no shares in the bank in June 2007 but quickly scaled up to 11.69 per cent by December the same year.        
	The Yadav group had crossed the level of 15 per cent shareholding in BoR for three consecutive quarters during March September 2008, thereby attracting provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of Indias takeover regulations, the report added.         
	When an entity or a group of companies acting in concert crosses the 15 per cent threshold, it must come out with an open offer to buy another 20 per cent from the public at the same price.        
	The Yadav groups stake hit a high of 17.73 per cent in March 2008.        
	The investigation showed that the Yadav group had transferred its entire shareholding in the bank to the Silvassa group through a web of inter se transfers.        
	The Silvassa group  which comprised 34 entities  shared common addresses with Tayal group companies, the report noted.        
	The Silvassa groups stake in the bank grew from 0.53 per cent in the quarter ended June 2007 to 26.4 per cent on December 31 last year  which would have again triggered the open offer clause. No disclosures were made to the bourses about this.        
	In his order, Abraham said this was not the first time that the Tayal group had faced investigations leading to regulatory actions by Sebi.        
	It may be recalled that in 2007, certain entities in the Tayal group were debarred from dealing in the scrips of two companies belonging to the group.        
	This is a fit case where Sebi as a regulator needs to intervene sternly and immediately in preventing these entities to operate in the securities market, until further directions, Abraham added.         
	On Tuesday, the Bank of Rajasthan stock tumbled 6.66 per cent to close at Rs 62.35 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

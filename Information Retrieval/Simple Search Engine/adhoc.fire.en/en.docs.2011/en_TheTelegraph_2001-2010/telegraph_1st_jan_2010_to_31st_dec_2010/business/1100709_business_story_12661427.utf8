          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 8: The Central Vigilance Commission today said it would look into the allegations of bribery against the officials of some state-owned entities, including Bhel and NTPC, once the names are disclosed by the US department of justice.        
	The department of justice had told a US court that officials of Bhel and NTPC were among those who were bribed by California-based valve company Control Component Inc (CCI) for getting big contracts.        
	We have our chief vigilance officers in all organisations and they are supposed to carry out their job, the CVCs chief technical examiner, V. Ramachandran, told reporters.         
	He said, The case has not been registered with the CBI. As and when it comes to India, the CBI will refer the matter to us. Then, we will look into it.        
	According to the documents submitted by the justice department, officials of Bhel, NTPC, Bhilai Electricals and Haryana State Electricity Board were the beneficiaries of such illegal payments.        
	CCI had said between 2003 and 2007 it had made around 236 illegal payments in more than 30 countries. The company made net profits of around $46.5 million from sales arising out of these payments. India, China, the UAE and Qatar are some of the countries where CCI indulged in unfair practices to bag contracts.        
	According to court documents, the payments related to India were made between 2004 and 2007.        
	Once the allegation on the acceptance of bribery is proved, the commission will recommend legal action against the officials of NTPC and Bhel, Ramachandran said at an Assocham conference.        
	In June 2009, California-based CCI pleaded guilty before the US court for having committed bribery in 36 countries from 2003 to 2007.        
	While NTPC denied any involvement in the case, Bhel said it could not comment on the issue in the absence of details.        
	For the Sipat project (in Chhattisgarh), NTPC has not placed any direct order to the said company. NTPC is also not a party in the contract between any of the manufacturers and its equipment suppliers, NTPC said in a statement.        
	It is a general statement with no specific details. Bhel can comment only when full details (as put up by Control Component to the US court) are accessible, a Bhel official said.        
	Topping the list of allegations is the Sipat power plant of NTPC for which CCI paid a bribe of $163,449 in two installments to an official of a Moscow-based company identified as Vladimir Batenko in the documents submitted by the department of justice in the court.

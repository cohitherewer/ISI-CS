The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lending rate floor from April

	Mumbai, Feb 10: Banks have been directed to fix a base rate  or an interest rate floor  for all commercial loans from April 1.         
	The base rate will replace the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) system that has been in force since April 2003.         
	In a draft circular issued to banks today, the Reserve Bank of India said: The base rate will be the minimum rate for all commercial loans. Banks are not permitted to resort to any lending below the base rate.         
	The circular said that banks could determine their actual lending rates on loans and advances with reference to the base rate.         
	Banks will have the freedom to decide their own base rates. However, the RBI set out some common criteria to determine what the rate should be. It will be determined by each banks cost of deposits, adjustments for any negative carry in their cash reserve ratio or statutory liquidity ratio deposits with the central banks, unallocable overhead costs including directors fees and auditors expenses, and profit margins.         
	For quite some time, the central bank has viewed with concern that the BPLR reference rate has ceased to have any relevance as a very large proportion of commercial loans were being offered below this rate.         
	The RBI had formed a committee under Deepak Mohanty to review the BPLR system and suggest changes. The central bank came out with these guidelines after considering the committees recommendations and suggestions from various stakeholders.         
	The base rate will also serve as the reference benchmark rate for floating rate loan products, apart from the other external market benchmark rates. The floating interest rate based on external benchmarks should, however, be equal to or above the base rate at the time of sanction or renewal, the circular said.         
	The BPLR used to serve as the ceiling rate for loans up to Rs 2 lakh. That stipulation is now being withdrawn. It is expected that deregulation of lending rates will increase the credit flow to small borrowers at reasonable rate, the RBI said.         
	The circular said that in the interests of transparency, banks will have to provide information on the actual minimum and maximum lending rates charged to major categories of borrowers to the RBI on a quarterly basis. Apart from transparency, banks should ensure that interest rates charged to customers are non-discriminatory in nature.         
	The base rate system will be applicable to all new loans and for those old loans that come up for renewal. However, if the existing borrowers want to switch to the new system before the expiry of the existing contracts, the bank and the borrower should agree on the new or revised rate structure.

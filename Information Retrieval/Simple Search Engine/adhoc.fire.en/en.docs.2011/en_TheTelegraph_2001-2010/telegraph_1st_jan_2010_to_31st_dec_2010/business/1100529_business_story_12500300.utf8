                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      IOC float hinges on fuel pricing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          B.M. Bansal in New Delhi on Friday. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	New Delhi, May 28: Indian Oil Corporations plan to launch a follow-on public offer (FPO) will depend on the governments decision on free market pricing of auto fuel.        
	An empowered group of ministers (eGoM) will meet in the first week of June and is likely to take a call on the recommendations of the Kirit Parikh committee on fuel pricing.        
	We are hopeful the eGoM will take some positive decision, IOC chairman B.M. Bansal said.        
	The maharatna firm today reported a 246 per cent jump in net profit for 2009-10. Net profit rose to Rs 10,220.55 crore in 2009-10 from Rs 2,949.55 crore in the previous year, Bansal said.        
	If auto fuel prices are deregulated, we can consider an FPO, S.V. Narasimhan, director (finance), said.        
	The FPO will provide the required cash for different projects and capital expenditure for expansion. However, this could happen if the eGoM favours free market pricing of auto fuel as at present the pricing mechanism is not transparent, he added.        
	The state-owned firm has capex plans of Rs 13,000 crore for the current fiscal and plans to invest Rs 13,000-14,000 crore annually over the next few years. The FPO will be quite useful in generating resources, he said.        
	At present, the government owns 80.35 per cent of IOC. A follow-on public offer of up to 10 per cent may be considered by the end of the current year if the eGoM decides on market pricing of petrol and diesel.        
	IOC said it was losing Rs 105 crore in revenues a day on selling fuel below cost.        
	The under-recovery (revenue loss) on petrol is Rs 5.06 per litre, Rs 5.31 a litre on diesel, Rs 18.80 per litre on kerosene and Rs 254.37 per domestic LPG cylinder, Bansal said.        
	The eGoM, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, includes oil minister Murli Deora, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, chemical and fertiliser minister M.K. Alagiri, railway minister Mamata Banerjee, road transport minister Kamal Nath and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.        
	The three state-owned oil marketing firms IOC, BPCL and HPCL may end the current fiscal with a revenue loss of Rs 90,000 crore.        
	The three firms had lost Rs 46,051 crore on the sale of petrol, diesel, domestic LPG cylinders and kerosene in 2009-10. Of this, Rs 14,430 crore was the loss on petrol and diesel, which is entirely being met by upstream firms such as ONGC and OIL.        
	Of the Rs 31,621-crore loss on LPG and kerosene, the finance ministry has agreed to give Rs 26,000 crore. The remaining Rs 5,621 crore is being absorbed by the retailers.         
	ONGC profit        
	ONGC Ltd today reported a 71 per cent rise in net profit for the quarter ended March 31 as it earned more on crude oil it produced. Net profit in January-March rose to Rs 3,776 crore from Rs 2,207 crore a year ago, R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director of ONGC, said.        
	The profit rose even after paying Rs 4,999 crore for fuel subsidies compared with Rs 852 crore payout in the fourth quarter of 2008-09.        
	ONGC reported a 4 per cent rise in full-year profit at Rs 16,768 crore in 2009-10.                          
	, maintaining its leadership as the nations most profitable company.              
	Sharma said the government move to raise gas price to $ 4.20 per mmbtu from $1.79 per mmbtu would add Rs 5,500 crore in revenues and about Rs 3,500 crore to bottomline.        
	With this price increase, we will be able to wipe out entire under recoveries (revenue loss) on gas business, he said.              
	He said the firm lost Rs 4,775 crore in 2008-09 on selling about 50 million standard cubic meters per day at $1.79 per million british thermal unit.              
	Sharma said it paid Rs 11,554 crore to subsidise auto and cooking fuel. But for this payout our net profit would have been higher by Rs 6,551 crore.              
	Ongcs crude oil production declined 2 per cent to 27.13 million tonnes while natural gas output rose marginally from 25.43 billion cubic meters to 25.6 bcm. It made 21 discoveries in the fiscal.

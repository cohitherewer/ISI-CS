          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: The government may extend incentives to textile and handicraft exports in the annual foreign trade policy review to be announced by commerce minister Anand Sharma later this month.         
	The trade policy will contain a mix of fiscal incentives and simplification of procedures, officials said.        
	While the struggling export sectors such as textiles, readymade garments, leather and handicrafts are likely to get more incentives, those sectors doing well, including petroleum, engineering and chemicals, may lose the sops they enjoy at present.        
	The sops follow extensive consultations by the commerce minister with business chambers and exporters body, including CII, Ficci and Fieo.        
	The minister had asked the Fieo to undertake a study on the extent of export diversification to non-traditional markets because of incentives provided in the focus market scheme and the market-linked focus product scheme.        
	The Fieo has sought the continuation of schemes such as duty drawback, advance authorisation, duty entitlement passbook, duty-free import authorisation and export promotion capital goods. It has also asked for capping export credit at the base rate so that exporters were able to get the credit at about 8 per cent.         
	Meanwhile, merchandise exports rose 30.4 per cent at $17.75 billion in June, while imports grew 23 per cent to $28.3 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $10.55 billion.

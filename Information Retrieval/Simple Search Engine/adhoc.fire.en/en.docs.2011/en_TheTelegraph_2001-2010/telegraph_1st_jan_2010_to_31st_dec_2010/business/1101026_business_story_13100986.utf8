          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: Bharti Airtel today said it would launch high-speed third generation (3G) mobile data services in two months.        
	The telecom operator, which earlier this year won 3G spectrum in 13 circles for Rs 12,295 crore, said it was in the process of rolling out the networks. Bharti is in talks with other operators to ensure seamless roaming in 3G. The 13 circles constitute 68 per cent of Bhartis revenue market share, the company said.        
	3G services will mark the beginning of the next phase of Indias telecom growth story and elevate the telecom sector on a par with most advanced markets in the world, Sanjay Kapoor, CEO (India and South Asia) of Bharti Airtel, said.         
	Tata Teleservices, which was the first to announce its 3G launch date, will roll out the services on November 5 in nine service areas. Vodafone Essar will launch 3G in nine circles in January-March and plans to spend up to $500 million within two years.         
	Besides meeting the growing demand for high-speed surfing and wireless entertainment, Airtel will introduce a suite of products in mobile commerce and health segments. Analysts said the 3G launch was likely to boost Bhartis revenue amid falling call tariffs for basic services.        
	Bharti will be deploying high speed HSPA networks of Ericsson, Nokia Siemens Network and Huawei.

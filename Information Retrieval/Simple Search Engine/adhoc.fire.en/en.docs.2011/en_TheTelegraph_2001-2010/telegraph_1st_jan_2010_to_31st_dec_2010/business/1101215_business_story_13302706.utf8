	Calcutta, Dec. 14: Vale  the worlds second largest mining company by market value  is in talks with leading Indian steel mills to sell coking coal from its Moatize mine in Mozambique.        
	The Brazilian company plans to start exporting the hard coking coal by August, Binod K. Singh, managing director of Vale India, said.        
	There is a lot of interest from Indian buyers. You name a company and it is likely to have shown keenness, he said.         
	The list of steel firms is likely to include Steel Authority of India Ltd, JSW Steel and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd companies that are expanding capacities in India but mostly depend on Australia to source coking coal.         
	However, Vale is yet to sign any offtake agreement with any domestic steel maker.        
	The company  the worlds largest exporter of iron ore  is keen to grow its coal portfolio to 40 million tonnes (mt) a year from 10mt within six years, and Mozambique will play a pivotal role.        
	The Moatize mine is expected to produce around 8mt coking coal and 4mt of the thermal variety within three years.        
	Vale is keen to own assets in India as well.         
	It wants to participate in coal block auctions, Singh said. However, Vale is not the only one. S amp;T Mining  a joint venture between SAIL and Tata Steel  is also looking forward to it.        
	Sandeep Kumar, managing director of S amp;T, said there were not many deposits in India, but given the wide demand-supply gap, any new mine would be good.        
	Kumar and Singh were attending a steel raw material seminar organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry and IPF Online.

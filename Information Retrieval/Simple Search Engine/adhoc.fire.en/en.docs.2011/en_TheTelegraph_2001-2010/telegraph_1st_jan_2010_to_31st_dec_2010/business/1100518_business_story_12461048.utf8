                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata Motors loses key man
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dube: Bidding adieu                                  
	Mumbai, May 17: Rajiv Dube, president of Tata Motors passenger cars business unit, has resigned, a company statement said on Monday.        
	Dube will pursue other interests outside the Tata group. His resignation follows several changes in key executive positions over the past year within the company.        
	The Tata Motors statement said S. Krishnan, senior vice-president (commercial), responsible for sales, marketing and customer support, would take on the additional responsibility of the premier cars division.        
	Girish Wagh, head of the small car project, who is also in charge of the Nano, will look after the manufacturing operations and product development activities of the passenger cars business. Both Krishnan and Wagh will report to P.M. Telang, the managing director, India operations.         
	Dube, who joined the Tata group in 1983, was reassigned to Tata Motors in 1998, once the passenger car division was put into place. He was closely involved with the launch of the Nano.        
	Dube has played an instrumental role in the growth of the companys passenger car business, the company statement added.        
	Over the last 12 months, the countrys largest automobile company with consolidated revenues of $14 billion has appointed P.M. Telang as managing director (India operations), while Ravi Pisharody was made president (commercial vehicles business unit). These appointments followed the retirement of Ravi Kant as CEO in June 2009.        
	Ravi Kant, who led the acquisition of British brands Jaguar and Land Rover, was thereafter appointed as vice-chairman of the company and continued to play a strategic role in Tata Motors.        
	In February 2010, former General Motors head (Europe) Carl Peter-Forster was inducted into the company and thereafter anointed managing director and group chief executive officer within a month. Forster has overall responsibility of the companys global operations, including Jaguar and Land Rover.         
	Tata Motorss sales have shown a sharp recovery after the economic slow down.

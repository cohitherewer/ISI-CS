          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 13: Standard Chartered Plc, the British bank, will hit the domestic capital markets with the countrys first Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs) from May 25 to May 28 to raise between $500 million and $750 million.         
	The bank will issue 24 crore IDRs, the price band for which will be set in reference to its stock price on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).        
	Ten IDRs will represent one share of Standard Chartered Plc. Market circles expect that based on the current market price of the StanChart scrip on the LSE of around 17 and the exchange rate, the price band will be around Rs 120 per IDR.        
	StanChart will announce the price band for the IDRs a day prior to the issue opening. It will be based on the closing price of its scrip at the LSE on May 21.        
	IDRs are depository receipts denominated in Indian rupees that have shares of foreign companies as the underlying assets. Just as Indian companies raise money overseas through American depositary rights (ADRs) and global depositary rights (GDRs), foreign entities can raise funds in India through IDRs. The foreign entity will issue depository receipts to domestic investors. The underlying shares are secured with a custodian.        
	The IDR issue is a strategic move to reinforce our commitment in the market ... allowing investors in India direct access to our performance, Standard Chartered Group chief executive, Peter Sands told reporters here today as the bank kicked off roadshows for the IDRs.        
	India is a key market for StanChart and profit before tax from the country was at $1.06 billion in 2009, second after Hong Kong. Even as Indias share in the StanChart group profits is now at 20.5 per cent, the bank employs 17,500 people, which accounts for nearly a quarter of its global work force.        
	Sands added that the principal objective behind the listing was to grow the StanChart brand and enhance its profile in the Indian market. Proceeds from the IDR will be used mainly to support the banks business growth.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      EXPANSION DRIVE                          
	Mumbai, Sept. 10: Alibaba.com, a leading e-commerce portal targeted at small businesses, is launching its customer service operations in India.        
	The portal that provides an online marketplace for small and medium businesses will initially set up a team in Mumbai to focus on customer training programmes.         
	The idea is to help small and medium Indian exporters to set up and optimise their presence on the Alibaba marketplace. We will offer our Indian customers far more support on the ground with this initiative, said Alibaba.com head (global sales) Brian Wong.        
	This support will include helping customers setting up and managing an online business account and generation and management of leads and technical support.        
	India is one of Alibaba.coms largest markets with an average of 30,000 new users having registered per month in the first half of 2010. A statement put out by Alibaba.com said as of June 30, more than 1.45 million users from small businesses in India were using Alibabas services to reach out to more than 13.6 million registered buyers and suppliers overseas.         
	Alibaba.coms customer service operations will be headed by Sandeep Deshpande, an ex-Yahoo! hand and the company expects to expand into multiple offices across the country shortly.        
	For Indian businessmen, the most popular areas of business include textiles, gems and jewellery, agricultural products, chemicals and building materials, said Wong.

										      GUEST COLUMN: Koushik Chatterjee                        
	A good corporate budgeting and planning exercise starts with the macro assumptions and concludes with the ways and means statement for the next 12 months. One of the tenets of an effective planning process is to have a robust strategy that continues beyond the immediate planning period.         
	A key element of the planning mindset is to test the current state and push our thinking for a more competitive tomorrow. Undoubtedly, the leadership for the planning process sets the tone for the thinking and actions for the enterprise in the future. All of the above holds true for a countrys budgeting process.         
	The economic survey and the 13th Finance Commission report set the backdrop for the finance minister to present his budget today.         
	To start with, the finance minister articulated in his characteristic style, the priorities of the government to achieve the pre-crisis growth of 9 per cent and continue with the social sector investments. The governments willingness to accept the 13th Finance Commissions recommendation towards fiscal consolidation and bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent of the GDP is critical for Indias long-term sustainability. This can be done by dual emphasis on growth and expenditure.        
	The government perhaps needs to take very significant steps in controlling its administrative expenditure if we are to move towards the target recommended by the 13th Finance Commission.         
	The direction of the fiscal deficit target also assumes significant importance in the context of the governments intention to continue the dis-investment programme through capital market sale. The foreign institutional investors need to remain interested in the India story and provide the depth to the markets to absorb the substantial quantum of equities that will be offered.         
	While the Bharat Nirman programme continues to be a flagship initiative of the government and have substantial outlay in the budget, one needs to ensure that the execution targets are met in a timely manner and within the budgeted costs. The governments ability to execute the infrastructure projects would be critical for Indias future competitiveness in the global economy. With several bills pending in Parliament or at the draft stage, the finance minister seems to be acutely aware of the current shortcomings and gave an indication of the governments priority to improve the delivery mechanism of the announced programmes and reforms.         
	As one sees the economic trends across the world, there is no doubt that India has weathered the storm extremely well. A combination of state-owned banking system with prudent practices along with a high deposit ratio, gave India the political and fiscal ability to tide over the crisis very effectively.         
	As the world is still grappling with the after-effects of one of the worst ever financial crisis, there is an opportunity for India to take an aggressive view of its aspiration to widen the relative growth rates with the rest of the world and close the absolute GDP gap with the other countries.         
	We should not rest at merely restoring our growth levels to the pre-storm period. There are times in the history of development where the constellation of all factors systematically provides the opportunity to a country to surge ahead of others.         
	The time has certainly come for India to aspire and work towards a double-digit growth for the next decade. This budget though not a game changer certainly lays the foundation for the country to realise its targets in the near future.

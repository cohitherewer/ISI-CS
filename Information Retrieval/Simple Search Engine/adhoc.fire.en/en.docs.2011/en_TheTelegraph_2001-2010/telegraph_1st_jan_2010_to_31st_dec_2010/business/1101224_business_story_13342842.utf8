	Sydney/ New Delhi, Dec. 23 (Agencies): Setting the stage for a possible takeover war, Indias ICVL has appointed Citibank as the merchant banker to explore the possibility of bidding for Riversdale Mining, which is being courted by Rio Tinto with an Aus $3.9 billion bid.        
	International Coal Ventures Ltd (ICVL) is a consortium of five state-run companies  Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), Coal India, NTPC, RINL and NMDC.        
	We have appointed Citibank (as merchant banker). They will submit their report in about two weeks time on the proposal to bid for Riversdale, C.S. Verma, chairman of both ICVL and SAIL, told reporters in New Delhi today.         
	Tata Steel, which holds over 24 per cent stake in Riversdale, is the largest shareholder in the Africa-focused entity.        
	When asked whether ICVL would tie up with Tata Steel for the bid, Verma said, Let the report come, then our board will meet again.        
	On December 10, iron ore miner NMDC, which is part of the consortium, had ruled out the possibility of joining hands with Tata Steel.        
	Meanwhile, Rio Tintos offer price of Aus $16 per share  valuing the company at around Aus $3.9 billion  was recommended by all of Riversdales board, barring the director appointed by Tata Steel.        
	N.K. Misra, Tatas nominee on the board, abstained from voting on the Rio Tintos bid.        
	We noted the development. At this point we dont have any comments, a Tata Steel spokesperson said.        
	Speculations are rife that Tata Steel may bid for Riversdale, which owns high-quality coal mines in Africa.        
	Rio Tinto today said it had secured the support of Riversdales shareholders  including senior executives and institutional investors  who own 14.9 per cent of shares in the company.         
	Riversdales executive chairman and founder Michael Keeffe and managing director Steve Mallyon have offered their shares in a pre-bid agreement        
	Asia demand        
	Rios first big acquisition since its ill-timed Alcan buy in 2007 is a play on soaring Asian demand for the key steel-making ingredient, but needs the backing of at least one the target companys three large shareholders, including Tata Steel and Brazilian steel group CSN.         
	Rio, which wants access to Riversdales coking coal deposits in Mozambique, raised its offer to Aus $16 per share cash on Thursday from an earlier indicative bid of Aus $15.

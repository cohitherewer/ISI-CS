          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 6: The stock markets today surprised investors by posting gains of about a percentage point on the back of positive cues from the European markets and news of the monsoon covering the entire country.         
	The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange bellwether index rose 173 points to close at 17614.48, while the broader Nifty climbed 53 points to end the day at 5289.         
	In my opinion, there were no positive cues in play as the United States was closed on Monday, Europe was down and Asia proved to be a mixed bag. In this context, Tuesday turned out to be a very surprising day, said Manish Sonthalia, equity head of brokerage house Motilal Oswal.         
	Several analysts had predicted that the sensex would fall on Tuesday.         
	Banks, metals and IT companies were the biggest gainers during the day.         
	In the beginning of the trading day, the markets were largely range bound but once the European markets started performing well, the domestic markets were quick to pick up the cues, said Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president of Karvy Stock Broking.         
	The news of the monsoon also provided a boost to the markets. The meteorological department said the rains had covered the country nine days before schedule. The overall rainfall deficit was also reduced to 13 per cent as of Monday.

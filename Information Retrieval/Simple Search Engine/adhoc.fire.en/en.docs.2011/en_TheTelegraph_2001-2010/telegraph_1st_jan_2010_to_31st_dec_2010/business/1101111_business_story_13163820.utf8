          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Strong point                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 10: Tata Motors will offer existing customers of the Nano the option to equip the $2,500 car with additional protection in the exhaust and electrical systems to make it even more robust.         
	The company insists that this initiative is neither a recall nor a reaction to a spate of incidents in which the cars have caught fire. Customers can rest assured that there are no generic defects in the Tata Nano, said a statement issued by the company. Six incidents of the small car catching fire have been reported so far in the country since it was launched early last year.         
	Beginning the third week of November, each owner will be informed about these measures. Options lie with our customers on whether they would like to avail themselves of these measures, the statement said.         
	The decision to fit the Nano with additional safety measures is a result of detailed investigations that the company has conducted on the cars that have caught fire in Mumbai, Lucknow and New Delhi.        
	Internal and international experts have pointed out that the reasons for the incidents are specific to the cars where the fires have been reported, according to the company.         
	Tata Motors said it had noticed instances of additional foreign electric equipment installed on the exhaust system. The company also believes that as the Nano sells in bigger numbers, it will be bought by users in the hinterlands who are not familiar to cars.        
	Taking all this into account, we have decided to make the car even more robust, the statement added.         
	The additional safety measures will be installed at no cost to customers. On Tuesday, Tata Motors group CEO and managing director Carl Peter Forster had hinted that the company planned to install more safety measures in the Nano.        
	By the end of October, Tata Motors had concluded delivery of over 70,000 Nanos.         
	Open sales have been announced in Kerala, Karnataka, Bengal, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh and the company hopes to extend open sales gradually.

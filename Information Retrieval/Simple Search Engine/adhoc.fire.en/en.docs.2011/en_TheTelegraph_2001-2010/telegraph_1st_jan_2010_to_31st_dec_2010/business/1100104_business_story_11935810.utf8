The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Claim deduction
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Claim deduction
                                I have invested Rs 1 lakh in the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme during the current financial year (2009-10). Can I claim deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act?          Basudeb Mukherjee, Kalyani
                    Yes, you can claim the deduction. Investments made in the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme on or after August 1, 2008, are eligible for deduction up to Rs 1 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. However, the interest earned on SCSS deposits is chargeable to tax.                                  Redemption worry      Five years ago, I invested in IDBI Infrastructure (Tax Saving) Bonds. The bonds are now coming up for maturity. The head office of IDBI Bank is in Mumbai. I wrote to the registrar of the issue enquiring about how to transact the redemption. Since they (the registrar) have no office in Calcutta, what do I do next? Can IDBI Bank in Calcutta be of any help?        Biswanath Gangopadhyay, Calcutta
                    You can contact IDBI Bank in Calcutta. You have done the right thing to write a mail to the registrar. Whenever you send your original bond certificates for redemption, make sure that you keep a photocopy of the same for future reference. The registrar must have a phone line. Talk to them if you dont get reply to your query soon.                                  Investment guide      I would like to invest about Rs 1 lakh. I am 69-years-old and I dont have taxable income. Where should I invest the money?        S. Dasgupta, Barisha
                      Since you are 69-years-old, investments that are fraught with risks, such as mutual funds and unit-linked insurance plans, wont suit you. You better consider assured/fixed income investments such as Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, Post Office Monthly Income Scheme, or bank fixed deposits. While there is no TDS in post office savings schemes, TDS is applicable in bank deposits and SCSS. So make sure that you submit Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source on interest income.

          OUR BUREAU                          C.B. Bhave                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: Market regulator Sebi today said the numerous forthcoming public offers could absorb the huge FII inflows into the equity markets and act as a balancing factor.        
	If the inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) chase the same numbers of papers, obviously prices will rise. Issue of new papers can absorb the inflows, Securities and Exchange Board of India chairman C.B. Bhave told reporters here. I am not saying whether FII inflows are a concern or not. I am saying the balancing factor is the issuance of papers.         
	On the need to curb the massive capital inflows, Bhave said it was for the government and the Reserve Bank of India to monitor the situation.        
	Meanwhile, Sebi has given approval to the National Stock Exchange and the United Stock Exchange to trade in currency options, a move that will facilitate hedging against currency fluctuations. Both the exchanges have been granted approval for trading in options on the dollar-rupee pair.        
	Currency option is a derivative instrument that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to exchange money denominated in one currency into another at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date.

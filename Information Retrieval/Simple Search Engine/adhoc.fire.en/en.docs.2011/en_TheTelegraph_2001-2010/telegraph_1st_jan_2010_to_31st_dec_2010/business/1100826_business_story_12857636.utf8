The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax code awaits go-ahead
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tax code awaits go-ahead

	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The cabinet is likely to clear the direct taxes code tomorrow.        
	The proposed code, which had undergone several revisions since it was released last year, is expected to simplify rules, widen the income tax slabs and raise the ceiling on tax-free savings.         
	Finance ministry officials said a bill would be introduced in Parliament next week. If cleared on time, the new rules would be implemented from the next financial year. The current session of Parliament ends on August 31.        
	Top officials said the main feature would be raising the threshold for taxation. The discussion paper put out last year had recommended that the three-tier rates of 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent be continued with a widening of the slabs.        
	Earlier, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had told The Telegraph, In the past, whenever we have reduced taxes, we have had better compliance.        
	The officials said the revised rates were indicative  no tax for income up to Rs 1.6 lakh, 10 per cent tax on income between Rs 1.6 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, 20 per cent on income up to Rs 25 lakh and 30 per cent on income beyond that. Women and senior citizens will enjoy greater relief.        
	The draft code has proposed exemption on investments up to Rs 3 lakh in government approved securities that are likely to include fixed deposits, small savings, insurance and other savings products. Assessees, therefore, will not pay tax on Rs 4.6 lakh if they invest Rs 3 lakh in tax-saving instruments.        
	The officials warned that incentives for savings might not be as generous as indicated in the discussion paper. We cannot say how much but it will be better than the current ratesthe government wishes to encourage savings, the officials added.        
	Retirement benefits and pension savings also wont be taxed. The draft had proposed to do away with the EEE (exempt-exempt-exempt) feature of pension and PF schemes that allowed savings to be tax-free at all stages, and replace it with an EET (exempt-exempt-tax) provision, which taxed the savings at the time of withdrawal on maturity. Mukherjee decided to restore the EEE method for the benefit of senior citizens.         
	The government had invited public comments twice on the tax code, which will replace the Income Tax Act, 1961.

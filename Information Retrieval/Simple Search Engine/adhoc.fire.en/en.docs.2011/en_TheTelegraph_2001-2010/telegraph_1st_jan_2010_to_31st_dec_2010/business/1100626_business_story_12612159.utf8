                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Change in Fortis plan 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 25: Fortis Healthcare is planning to create a larger war chest of funds to ward off Khazanah of Malaysia as the two contenders prepare to wage a bidding war for a controlling stake in Parkway Holdings, the Singapore-based hospital chain.        
	As a first step, Fortis Healthcare has decided to defer a planned preferential allotment of shares to Government Investment Corporation (GIC) of Singapore. Instead, Fortis plans to come out with a larger issue of shares in which GIC will consider investing its money.        
	It may be recalled that Fortis was planning to sell a 6.58 per cent stake in the firm to GIC for Rs 380 crore. The stake sale was to be done through a preferential allotment of 2.23 crore equity shares. At an extra-ordinary general meeting held earlier this month, Fortis shareholders had approved the preferential allotment at a price of Rs 170 per share to Lathe Investment Pte Ltd, an affiliated investment arm of GIC Special Investment Pte.        
	However, Fortis today said, GIC will like to consider participating in larger fund-raising by the company according to the resolution passed in a board meeting dated June 9.        
	The notice quoted GIC as saying: Like any other major investor, we constantly review our investments and will evaluate participating in the larger fund-raising by the company... and defer the current preferential investment until such time.        
	Fortis is locked in a battle with Khazanah for the control of Parkway Holdings. On June 9, the Indian entity announced its intention to raise additional funds by way of issuance of further securities aggregating up to Rs 2,750 crore apart from raising its borrowing limit to Rs 6,000 crore.        
	It is now speculated that GIC may pick up a much higher stake (over 6.58 per cent) by participating in the funding programme of Rs 2,750 crore. Company officials refused to comment on this speculation.                          
	Back In March, Fortis had acquired a 25 per cent stake in Parkway Holdings Ltd, from TPG Capital. Last month, Khazanah, which holds a little over 24 per cent in Parkway, made an offer to increase its stake to 51.5 per cent at a price of S $ 3.76 per share.         
	Under the Singapore regulations, Fortis will have to make an offer for the entire remaining stake in Parkway. Observers say this could cost it around $ 2 billion. It is learnt that apart from the issuance of securities and hiking of its borrowing limit for which it has already approached banks, Fortis is looking at a war chest of Rs 10,000 crore.        
	The battle for control has now reached an interesting stage with reports saying that three Parkway Holdings directors voted against Khazanahs offer to buy a majority stake in the company. Separately, Morgan Stanley had said that the Khazanah offer was not compelling.

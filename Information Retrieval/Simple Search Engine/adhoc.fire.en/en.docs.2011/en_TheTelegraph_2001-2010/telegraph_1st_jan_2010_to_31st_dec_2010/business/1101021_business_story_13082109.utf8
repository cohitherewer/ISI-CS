The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Metaliks plans more units
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tata Metaliks plans more units
          SAMBIT SAHA                      Jha: Growth focus                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 20: Tata Metaliks, Indias largest pig iron manufacturer, has decided to set up a sinter plant, a coke oven unit and a waste gas recovery power plant at Kharagpur to lower the cost of raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal.        
	The company, a subsidiary of Tata Steel, also plans to set up another coke oven plant and a power plant at its unit in Reddi, Maharashtra.        
	The sinter plant will come up at an estimated investment of Rs 75 crore by the last quarter of 2011-12.        
	The coke oven plants together will cost around Rs 80 crore but Tata Metaliks wont put in the money.        
	Harsh K. Jha, managing director of the company, said the coke plants would be farmed out on build-own-operate (BOO) basis.        
	We will provide land while investors will put up the plant and operate it. Tata Metaliks will provide coking coal and buy metallurgical coke. They (investors) will act as a converter for us, Jha said.        
	Tata Metaliks owns a coke oven plant in Reddi but its operated by a third party. This time, the company has decided not to invest in building a plant.        
	We have seen this arrangement works fine. The company plans to save the money for some other purpose, Jha said.        
	He said an order had been issued and a layout made for the Reddi coke plant, while the plan for Kharagpur will be prepared shortly. Both plants will have 1.2-lakh-tonnes of capacity each.        
	Sources in the company said Tata Metaliks also planned to set up two 10 mega watt power plants in both Kharagpur and Reddi using the waste gas from coke oven units.         
	They will cost around Rs 80-100 crore and will be funded by Tata Metaliks.        
	The units will not only meet internal requirement of power for the company but will also help reduce carbon footprint.        
	All the initiatives are designed to keep raw material costs in control.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: The board of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd is likely to meet again in early September to fashion its response to Vedantas acquisition of Cairn India, with whom the PSU has a contractual relationship.        
	If a counter-offer for Cairn is on its agenda, the ONCC board must meet before September 7. The terms of Vedantas open offer for Cairn India puts September 7 as the cut-off date for a rival offer. The board had met today.        
	We have been tracking the development and examining all legal and contractual implications of the issue on production-sharing contracts inked with them, ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said.        
	In todays board meeting, I apprised the members of the status since the Cairn-Vedanta deal was made public, he said. On whether ONGC will make a counter-offer, Sharma said, I will not like to comment.        
	A senior oil ministry official said there would not be any counter bids by PSU firms as the valuation done by Vedanta for Cairn India is already very high.        
	Officials said the ministry was awaiting a response from Scotlands Cairn Energy  the promoters of Cairn India  on certain financial and technical commitments made under the production-sharing contract.

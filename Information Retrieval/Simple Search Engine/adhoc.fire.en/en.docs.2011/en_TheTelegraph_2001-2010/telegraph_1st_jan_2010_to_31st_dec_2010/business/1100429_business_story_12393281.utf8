	Calcutta, April 28: RPG group company Phillips Carbon Black (PCBL) has sought duty concessions from Vietnam before it sets up a facility in that country, its first outside India.        
	The company wants to set up a 60,000-tonne carbon black unit and a 12MW power plant for $63 million (Rs 280 crore) in Vietnam, one of Asias fastest growing economies. Vietnam does not produce carbon black used in tyre manufacturing. Hence, there is zero duty on the import of carbon black. However, there is a 10 per cent import duty on the raw material used to make carbon black.        
	We have requested the government to reduce the duty on raw material to zero, while raising the duty on the finished product to 5 per cent, Sanjiv Goenka, chairman of PCBL, said today.        
	Indias largest carbon black producer is in the process of acquiring land for which it has also made some payments.        
	State-owned tyre companies in Vietnam own 20 per cent in the venture with PCBL, which hopes to meet the entire demand for carbon black in the South Asian country. We hope the government will give us this concession to help grow in the domestic industry, Goenka said after announcing the financial result.        
	In India, PCBL is adding another 50,000-tonne carbon black and 8MW co-generation power capacities at Mundra, Gujarat, apart from expanding in Kochi by another 10MW. The total investment for this is Rs 155 crore.        
	Goenka said PCBL, the 8th biggest in the world with a 450,000-tonne combined capacity, might set up another unit, possibly in the south, with an initial production of 50,000 tonnes.         
	Alternatively, it may chose to expand in any of its four existing units at Durgapur, Mundra, Palej and Kochi. The decision will be taken in the next 4-6 weeks.        
	Profit show        
	PCBL posted a net profit of Rs 122.69 crore in 2009-10 against a loss of Rs 64.84 crore in the previous fiscal. Total income stood at Rs 1,235 crore during 2009-10 compared with Rs 1,077.36 crore in the year before.

	Mumbai, Nov. 21: The Central Bank of India is looking to         
	offer a range of financial services, including broking, through a recently formed subsidiary as part of a diversification exercise that includes lending to infrastructure, expanding in the interiors and venturing overseas particularly in Asia and Africa.         
	The nearly 100-year old PSU bank is also sharpening its focus on retail lending, which accounts for only 11 per cent of its advances, and small and medium enterprises.         
	The bank is looking to grow the proportion of retail loans to 20 per cent in the next fiscal, with a focus on home, cars and education, S. Sridhar, chairman and managing director of the Central Bank of India, told The Telegraph in an interview.         
	Though the bank does not offer any teaser loans, Sridhar is confident of growing the retail-lending book.         
	The bank has identified affordable housing as a thrust area and brought down the processing time for loan applications to a week. It is looking for tie-ups with leading builders.         
	Sridhar, who took over as the chairman in March last year, has been credited for a sharp improvement in the banks performance. His principal objectives when he joined were to restore profitability, revive a technologically lagging brand and focus on business structure and processes.        
	There were gaps in the system and procedures. The bank was not visible, considering its size, history and linkages, he said.         
	Sridhar had launched Operation Navchetana in April 2009 that was pivotal for the banks good show. In 2009-10, Central Bank posted its best-ever performance on all parameters including profitability, total business done and asset quality. Net non-performing assets (NPAs) of the bank had declined.         
	After the success of Operation Navchetana, Sridhar is now concentrating on the growth of other business lines such as capital markets for which the bank has set up a separate merchant banking subsidiary. This unit will provide loan syndication and underwriting and other capital market related services such as equity placement, financial advisory and custodial services. A venture into broking by joining hands with a brokerage is also in the cards.         
	At the bank level, branches will be will be linked via core banking solution by December. Central Bank has a network of over 3,600 branches and only 150 branches are yet to start core banking.         
	The bank is also looking at government projects as a separate business stream.

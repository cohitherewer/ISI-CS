	Calcutta, Sept. 3: The Andrew Yule management is making a strong pitch to keep lubricant maker Tide Water Oil off the governments divestment list.        
	Yule owns 26.22 per cent in Tide Water, valuing its holding at around Rs 220 crore. We have paid back everything to the government. There is no need to divest in Tide Water, Kallol Datta, chairman of Yule, said. The central government holds 94.4 per cent in Yule.        
	Yule had borrowed Rs 87 crore from the government. It raised Rs 112 crore by selling its stakes in power generator DPSC Ltd and conveyor belt maker Phoenix Yule.         
	The Centre had put Tide Water  the maker of lubricants such as Veedol  on the block so that Yule can repay.        
	At the annual general meeting of Tide Water today, Datta said he had written to the government to scrap the divestment proposal but was yet to get a response.        
	We can take this company to a different level, Datta said. We are targeting a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore and a profit of Rs 100 crore by 2011-12. The company reported a Rs 564.72-crore turnover and a Rs 57.79-crore profit in the last fiscal.        
	The Tide Water stock hit the upper circuit of 10 per cent today, gaining Rs 870.10 to close at Rs 9,571.50 on the BSE.        
	Tide Water is an illiquid stock with a small capital base. Two industrial groups, one headed by Calcutta-based Mahendra K. Jalan and the other by the Hindujas-owned Gulf Oil, have large stakes. Datta said Tide Water would strengthen its lubricant business.

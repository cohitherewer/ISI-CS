	Calcutta, May 25: Buoyed by a robust growth in the sales of single premium policies, the life insurance industry has clocked a 60 per cent increase in premium income from new businesses in April.        
	Usually April is not considered a good month for life insurance firms because more than 70 per cent of all policy sales take place in the January-March quarter when people rush to make tax-saving investments.         
	It was worse this time as market regulator Sebi had banned 14 out of 23 life insurers from launching unit-linked plans (Ulips) without obtaining a certificate of registration from it.        
	However, this April, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) registered a 97.51 per cent jump in first premium income at Rs 4,173.69 crore against Rs 2,113.10 crore in April 2009.         
	The first premium income of private insurers, however, grew marginally by 5.65 per cent to Rs 1,572.64 crore from Rs 1,488.47 crore in the same month a year ago.        
	A closer look at the business figures provided by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority reveals that the LICs premium income from individual single premium policies increased 277.29 per cent to Rs 1,610.67 crore from Rs 426.90 crore in April last year.         
	For private life insurers, too, single premium policy sales grew 58.55 per cent to Rs 115.38 crore. Usually, Ulips make up a large proportion of single-premium policies sold by the insurers.        
	While the sales of regular premium policies also witnessed a good growth (38 per cent for private life insurers and 91.12 per cent for the LIC), the rise in single premium policy sales came primarily through mutual fund distributors who turned life insurance agents.        
	Since Sebi slapped a ban on upfront commission in mutual fund distribution last year, a number of mutual fund agents switched to selling Ulips. These distributors are selling single premium policies as investment options to their existing clients, said a financial product distributor.         
	Single premium policies are easily sold because of the higher investment and low life cover in these Ulips. Besides, the withdrawals from a life insurance policy is exempted from tax, he added.        
	According to S.B. Mathur, general secretary of the Life Insurance Council, the agency commission in case of single premium policies is as low as 2 per cent compared with 30 to 40 per cent in case of regular premium policies.         
	Mutual fund distributors-turned-insurance agents are happy to get a 2 per cent commission on selling a single premium policy. They were getting almost the same commission selling mutual funds, the distributor said. The highest NAV (net asset value) guaranteed Ulips were the favourites as equity markets have been quite turbulent for some time now, the distributor added.

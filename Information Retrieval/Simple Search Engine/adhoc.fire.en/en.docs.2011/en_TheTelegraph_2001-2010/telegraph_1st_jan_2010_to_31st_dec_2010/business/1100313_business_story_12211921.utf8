	New Delhi, March 12: The gas field offered by the Russian authorities to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is not to the Indian PSUs liking.        
	Though the Yamal fields in the Arctic region, in which ONGC has been offered a stake, hold reserves vast enough to meet the demand of the whole world for five years, the PSU is not keen on them because they require huge investments and the gas cannot be brought back to India.        
	ONGC, which operates abroad through ONGC Videsh Limited, is keen on the Sakhalin-3 (close to Japan), Vankor (east Siberia) and Trebs and Titov (Timan Pechora in northwest Russia) fields. Energy-hungry India is keen on sourcing one million barrels per day of oil and gas from Russia.        
	India wanted a 10-20 per cent stake for ONGC in the giant Sakhalin-3 oil and gas field in far east Russia.         
	A case was also made for ONGC joining hands with Russian firm Rosneft to explore and develop some fields in east Siberia. Joint bidding for the Trebs and Titov oil fields was also considered.        
	Officials said Indian firms were invited to join Russian gas monopoly Gazprom in Yamal.         
	ONGC Videsh has a 20 per cent stake in Sakhalin-1 oil and gas fields and in 2008 acquired Imperial Energy, which has fields in Siberia.         
	Sources said the Russians did not appear to be keen on exempting Imperial Energy from high taxes. ONGC Videsh had acquired Imperial in December 2008 for $2.1 billion. High taxes in Russia mean the company gets less than one-fourth of revenue from crude oil sales.        
	Analysts said the move to strengthen energy ties with Russia was in line with the goal of securing supplies from a wide range of sources. Currently, 70 per cent of Indias oil imports are from West Asia.

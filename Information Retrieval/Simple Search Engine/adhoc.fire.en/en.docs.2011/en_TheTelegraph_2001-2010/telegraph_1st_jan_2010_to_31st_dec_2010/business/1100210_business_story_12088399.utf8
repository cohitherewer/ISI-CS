          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Racing ahead                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Car sales jumped 32.28 per cent in January to 1,45,905 units from 1,10,300 units a year ago, according to available data.        
	Overall, auto sales at 11 lakh units were the highest in a month as customers bought vehicles ahead of a possible tax hike in the budget.        
	Sales were boosted by the easy availability of retail finance and soft interest rates.        
	Two-wheeler sales in January grew 43.43 per cent to 8,34,383 units from 5,81,729 units a year ago.        
	Sales of commercial vehicles rose over two-fold to 53,447 units from 23,154 units in the year-ago period.        
	Total sales in the domestic market stood at 11,14,157 units against 7,68,698 units in the year-ago period, a jump of 44.94 per cent.        
	This is the highest ever sales by the auto industry. Economic growth, reduced interest rates and better money supply have helped the industry to clock higher sales, said Dilip Chenoy, director-general of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.        
	Last years low base also contributed to the high growth in terms of percentage. Reduced commodity prices compared with last year also helped, Chenoy said.         
	The earlier highest sales by the industry were in October 2006 at 10,17,198 units.        
	Asked about the prospects in February, Chenoy said, It will depend on multiple factors such as pent-up demand and the price rise. Still we will have good growth in the month.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          On fast track				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: Auto sales jumped 68 per cent in December on the back of strong economic growth and the easy availability of loans.        
	Car sales were up 40.27 per cent in the month, while the sales of motorcycles and scooters rose 76.70 per cent and 41.39 per cent, respectively.         
	According to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), total sales rose to 10,00,500 units last month against a mere 5,97,241 units in the year-ago period.        
	Automobile majors Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motor India, Tata Motors, Hero Honda and Bajaj Auto registered healthy growth that was also fuelled by the low base effect of 2008 on account of the slowdown.        
	According to a survey by consultancy firm KPMG, Chinese and Indian companies will have a substantial market share, globally, along with Koreas Hyundai, Japans Toyota and Honda, and Germanys Volkswagen. In passenger vehicles, India was the third highest growing market in the world after China and Germany in 2009, said Pawan Goenka, president of Siam.        
	Goenka said sales in 2009 were also boosted by as much as 11 launches, the highest in recent years. Car sales stood at 1,15,268 units in December against 82,174 units a year ago, up 40.27 per cent.        
	Emission deadline        
	Siam today said the implementation of the new emission norms, scheduled to be effective from April 1, should be postponed by six months if there was no clarity on the availability of upgraded fuels by this month.

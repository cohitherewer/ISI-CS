The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sun Pharma turns heat on Taro directors
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sun Pharma turns heat on Taro directors
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Jan. 11: Sun Pharma chairman Dilip Shanghvi today urged the directors of Taro Pharmaceuticals to reverse their position on some of their actions.         
	He cautioned the directors that supporting the promoter Levitt family would constitute a further breach of their fiduciary duties to Taro and its shareholders.         
	In his first letter to the directors of the Israeli firm since its annual general meeting last month, Shanghvi said the results of the voting showed that over 75 per cent of the Taro shareholders had rejected the control of the Levitt family over the companys board.         
	On December 31, the minority shareholders of Taro had voted against the election of its external director nominees and indemnification proposals mooted by its management.        
	It is now clear that an overwhelming majority of Taros public shareholders demand a change in the control of Taro, Shanghvi said in the letter to the Taro directors today.         
	He said repeated claims by the directors about the legal proceedings initiated against Sun Pharma to protect the minority shareholders were completely untenable.        
	It has been apparent to Sun that your real interest in commencing the various litigations on behalf of Taro was your misplaced and unexplained desire to help only the Levitt family avoid their contractual obligation to sell their shares in Taro to us, he said.         
	Shanghvi said while the public shareholders of Taro had now recognised this, the litigations had not advanced the interests of the silent minority shareholders of Taro, as is wrongly claimed.

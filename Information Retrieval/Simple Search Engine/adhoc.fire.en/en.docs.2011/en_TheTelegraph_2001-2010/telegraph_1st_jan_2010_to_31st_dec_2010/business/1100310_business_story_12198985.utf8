The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jindals stick to Bolivia plan
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Jindals stick to Bolivia plan
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, March 9: Jindal Steel amp; Power Ltd (JSPL) said it was committed to developing Bolivias El Mutun iron ore mine and setting up a steel plant in that country, amid reports of the Bolivian government being unhappy with the company.        
	Jindals is one of the largest proposed investment in the Latin American country. It had signed an agreement in 2007 to put in $2.1 billion to develop the mine, which is said to be one of worlds largest with reserves of 40 billion tonnes.        
	JSPL has a 50 per cent stake in the mine along with a state-run firm. It had also agreed to build a sponge iron pellet facility and a steel plant in a time-bound manner. But the company is yet to make any headway on the steel plant.        
	Sushil Maroo, director of JSPL, said the company was committed to the Bolivian project. We will build the steel plant within the specified time. There are no issues with the government, he told The Telegraph. JSPL believes it has time till 2014 to set up the facility there. The company needs to build the 1.7-million-tonne steel plant within five years of the agreement. Going by that, JSPL has to complete the project by 2012-end. However, the company could not start work because of the absence of environmental clearance. The Bolivian government was also unable to provide land in time.         
	The company has, however, started mining in a small way. The EL Mutun iron ore deposit is located in the remote German Busch province in the Santa Cruz department in Bolivia covering an area of 75 square kilometres. The ore is of inferior quality and has a high phosphorus content. So far, JSPL has invested about $100 million in the venture.        
	According to the agreement, JSPL was required to invest $300 million in each year of the first five-year period and $200 million, annually, over the next three years, amounting to a total investment of $2.1 billion in over eight years.         
	The Indian company is believed to have sought relaxation in investment terms. It is keen on spreading out the investment over a longer time period.        
	Some Chinese firms are keen to grab the El Mutun resource and will benefit in case the Bolivian government breaks the contract with the Jindals. JSPL won the right to develop the mine through competitive bidding. El Mutun is a rare instance when an Indian firm could fend off Chinese companies to acquire an overseas natural resource.

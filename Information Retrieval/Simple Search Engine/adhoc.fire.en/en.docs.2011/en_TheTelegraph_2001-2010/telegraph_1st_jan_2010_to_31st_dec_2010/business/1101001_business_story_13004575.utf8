                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SBI raises bar in rate race
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 30: The State Bank of India today raised deposit rates by 25-75 basis points, while keeping the base rate unchanged at 7.5 per cent.         
	Base rate is the minimum rate below which banks cannot offer loans. Banks switched over to base rates from July  all loans after this date must be benchmarked with the new system. The base rate is reviewed once every quarter.        
	The twin steps of the countrys largest lender are likely to make both depositors and borrowers happy.        
	After the Reserve Bank raised the short-term lending (repo) and borrowing (reverse repo) rates by 25 and 50 basis points to 6 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, during its mid-quarter policy review on September 16, there was widespread expectation that commercial banks would increase their base rates.        
	In fact, state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Allahabad Bank today raised the benchmark rate by half a percentage point to 8.5 per cent from tomorrow. PNB has also upped its deposit rates by 25-50 basis points across maturities.        
	Experts say banks will be under pressure to follow the SBI as a hike will make their loans costlier.         
	Another section of analysts believe margins will be hit if banks do not increase rates.        
	The SBI raised its term deposit rates by 25-75 basis points in select maturities from tomorrow.         
	Deposits of 91-180 days will fetch an interest rate of 5.50 per cent against 4.75 per cent earlier.        
	Interest rates for deposits between one year and 554 days have been hiked to 7 per cent from 6.75 per cent, while deposits for 555 days will attract 7.50 per cent (7.25 per cent).         
	The new rate for deposits from 556 days to less than 2 years stands at 7.25 per cent. Rates on deposits of 2 years to 999 days have been raised to 7.50 per cent. Indias No.1 bank will pay an interest rate of 7.75 per cent for deposits of 1,000 days.        
	PNB said it took note of the concern shown by RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao on the negative real rates to savers, in view of high inflation, in the mid-quarter review of the credit policy. The maximum rate offered on retail deposits will now be 8 per cent for a maturity bucket of 8-10 years, PNB said.        
	On the hike in the base rate, PNB said, Such a hike is aimed at better transmission of monetary policy rates to lending rates.        
	Debt transfer        
	The Supreme Court today set aside a Gujarat High Court order that prohibited banks from transferring debts, including non-performing assets, to one another.        
	A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia held that the transfer of debts between banks was legal.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 30: Nokia is offering push email and instant messaging facilities in its low-cost handsets, starting from Rs 2,700. Users need to download a free software from the companys website.         
	The Finnish company has about 35 handsets that are enabled with the push email and instant messaging facilities.         
	We aim to make push email and instant messaging available to all. It is free of cost for Nokia devices and consumers just need to pay data charges to the service providers, Viral Oza, head of activation, media and online sales, and marketing, Nokia India, said here today.        
	Nokia messaging enables users to set up, access and use email on GPRS-enabled devices. With this application, one can read, compose, reply or delete emails instantly.         
	Users can configure and manage up to 10 accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo mail, Windows Live Hotmail, Rediff mail, Sify mail, Indiatimes mail, Oza said.         
	Subscribers can toggle between multiple accounts so that signing in every time is not required.         
	With Nokia messaging, users can view, edit and send attachments along with reading html-formatted mails.        
	So, the next time if some modification is required in an important document, one need not wait to get access to a desktop or a laptop. All these can be done on the Nokia device itself, Oza said.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Write complaint
                                I submitted a transaction slip for purchase of IDFC Premiere Equity Fund to the IDFC Mutual Funds registrar and transfer agent Computer Age Management Services in Calcutta. Finding no response for 15 days, I checked up with IDFC MFs city office and I was told that lump sum purchase of the particular fund was suspended for the time being. When I asked why CAMS accepted my application if the purchase had been suspended, I was told to check with CAMS once again. CAMS officials straightway declined to give any written clarification. What should I do now?          Dhruba Roy, Calcutta
                    Check with your bank if the cheque has been encashed. You must also be having the cheque number. Write a complaint to CAMS, with copies to Sebi, the NSE and the BSE. E mail applications will do. Follow it up with Sebis city office at British Council building on Camac Street.                                  Pension eligibility      I am a primary school teacher. I joined on October 24, 2005. Shall we get pension after retirement? If not, why?        Swapan Kumar Mondal, Mograhat
                    Your employment agreement should have a mention of whether you are eligible for pension or not. Please refer to the notification issued by the finance department of the Bengal government on payment revision for teaching and non-teaching staff: http://wbfin.nic.in/writeread-data/ROPA,%202009%20for%20Teachers.pdf.                                  Tax for elders      I am 70-years-old and my annual income will be Rs 2.18 lakh in the financial year 2010-11. I shall get another Rs 2 lakh from redemption of Ulip units. What will be my tax liability for assessment year 2011-12?        T. Guha, Calcutta
                    There will be no tax liability on your annual income of Rs 2.18 lakh as you are a senior citizen under the income tax rules. Maturity proceeds from a life insurance plan is also tax-free provided the sum assured is five times the annual premium. If you satisfy this condition, your income from Ulip will also be tax-free.                        If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 29: Genpact, the countrys largest back-office service provider, is keen to list on the Indian bourses.         
	Genpact had listed itself on the New York Stock Exchange in 2007  the third Indian BPO to do so after WNS Global Services and EXL Services.         
	Cross-listing is something we have just started discussing. But it will take time for this to materialise as we dont have enough float and market conditions are difficult. But yes, we are very keen on listing in India, said Pramod Bhasin, CEO of Genpact.        
	Cross-listing allows a company to be listed on the stock exchanges of different countries. With cross-listing, shares trade in multiple time zones and in multiple currencies, giving issuing companies more liquidity and a greater flexibility to raise capital.        
	The BPO firm, whose 2009 revenues stood at $1.12 billion, employs over 40,000 professionals globally. The company has its headquarters in New Delhi.        
	Genpact (then called Gecis) was set up in 1997 to manage US conglomerate GEs back-office processes such as finance and accounting, procurement, collections and customer service.         
	In January 2005, Genpact emerged as an independent BPO firm with total revenues of $419 million and 19,500 employees.         
	Soon after being spun off as a third-party vendor in December 2004 (GE sold 60 per cent stake to private equity firms General Atlantic and Oak Hill), Gecis was renamed Genpact (the change happened in September 2005).         
	GE recently reduced its stake in the BPO firm to 9 per cent from 18 per cent, which it held from January 2007, and collected over $300 million from the transaction.        
	Along with GE, the other major investors  General Atlantic, Oak Hill Capital Partners and Wells Fargo amp; Company  also offloaded part of their holdings to cash in on the current attractive valuation of the company. Together they sold 33.6 million shares in a secondary public offering for $15 a share.        
	According to Alok Shende, principal analyst and founder director of consulting firm Ascentius, Value creation and capital appreciation have already happened for the major investors.         
	The BPO firm traded (March 26) on the NYSE at $15.67, up 1.23 per cent over the previous days close.         
	India-centric service provider Genpact, which recently bought data management firm Symphony, plans to shell out around $300 million from its cash reserves to buy out companies in key domain areas such as travel, hospitality, and infrastructure management services.        
	In India, the company may hire 5,000 employees in financial year 2011 and dole out wage hikes of 7-10 per cent across the board. Genpact is also looking to spend up to Rs 800 crore on expanding its presence in the tier-I and tier-II cities.         
	Analysts said the company might also be planning a strategic deal with a major player in the industry.         
	Genpact is an attractive investment for global infotech firms looking to increase their presence in BPO services. With stake of PE firms down and increased free float, a strategic deal at market rates cannot be ruled out, said an IT analyst from a top consultancy firm.        
	Late last year, there were reports of discussions between private equity investors in Genpact and IT services provider Cognizant Technology Services for a possible stake deal.         
	However, the talks fizzled out although Cognizant was interested in increasing its footprint in BPO services, industry watchers said.         
	Genpact, with 40,000 employees globally, has added about 4,000 employees in the past year and is expanding outside India in places such as the US, Guatemala and the Philippines. The company aims to hire 10,000 people worldwide in 2010.         
	According to Gartner, the domestic BPO market will grow 19 per cent through 2013 into a $1.8-billion sector.        
	The domestic BPO services market grew 7.3 per cent year-on-year in 2009 primarily because of the global economic uncertainty which led to some price and volume pressures.        
	Gartner said in a statement that the Indian domestic BPO market would grow into a $1.2-billion market by 2011 and a $1.8-billion one by 2013.        
	Lever stake        
	Hindustan Unilever has exited BPO firm Capgemini Business Services India by selling its remaining 49 per cent stake to IT consultancy firm Cap Gemini SA for an undisclosed sum.         
	Hindustan Unilever has now divested its 49 per cent stake in Capgemini Business in favour of Cap Gemini SA, HUL said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Capgemini Business, formerly known as Unilever India Shared Services, was set up as an in-house BPO unit of the FMCG leader.

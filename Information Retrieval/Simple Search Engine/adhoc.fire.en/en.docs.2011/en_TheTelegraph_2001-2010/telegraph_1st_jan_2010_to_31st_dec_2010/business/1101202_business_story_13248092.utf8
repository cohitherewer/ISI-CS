The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fresh cash prop for PSU banks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fresh cash prop for PSU banks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: The government today approved a fresh capital infusion of around Rs 6,000 crore in 10 public sector banks, which will give them a greater leverage to raise funds from the market and feed the credit demands of an economy that is expected to grow 9 per cent.        
	With government holding in the region of 51-54 per cent in them, the 10 banks (see chart) were in no position to raise sufficient funds from the market as the governments stake would have then gone below 51 per cent. After the recapitalisation, the government holding in the state-run lenders will increase to 58 per cent, which will give them more headroom to mop up cash.        
	The move will enhance PSU banks lending capacity to meet the credit requirement of the economy in order to maintain and accelerate the growth momentum, said officials.        
	The increased availability of credit is likely to benefit employment-oriented sectors such as agriculture and exports.        
	After notching up near 9 per cent growth in the first and second quarter, the economy is expected to grow at this rate both in 2010-11 and 2011-12.        
	During 2008-09, the advances of PSU banks increased over 25 per cent against 10 per cent of private banks and around 4 per cent of foreign banks.        
	In June, the government approved an infusion of Rs 6,211 crore into five public sector banks, a move that helped them to lend an additional Rs 77,637 crore.        
	Officials said the exact amount, mode of capitalisation and other terms and conditions would be decided in consultation with the banks.        
	The additional capital support is over and above the Rs 16,500 crore announced by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in his Union Budget 2010-11 to enable state-run banks to maintain a minimum 8 per cent Tier I capital by March 31, 2011.        
	Though the minimum regulatory requirement of capital to risk weighted assets (CRAR) for banks is 9 per cent, the government has mandated CRAR of 12 per cent, with 8 per cent Tier I capital.        
	Meanwhile, the Central Bank of India is planning to come out with a Rs 2,500-crore rights issue in the January-March quarter this fiscal, its chairman and managing director S. Sridhar said today.

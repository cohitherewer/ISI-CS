The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Industry picks up pace to grow 13.8% in July
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Industry picks up pace to grow 13.8% in July
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The countrys industrial output grew 13.8 per cent in July, dousing fears about a slowdown in demand and boosting chances of a further interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank to curb high inflation.        
	Capital and consumer goods grew 63 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, on the back of a rising demand for cars, refrigerators and television sets. The sales surge prompted firms to spend the money they had been planning to invest on new machinery and plants, analysts said.         
	I expect average industrial growth to be between 12 per cent and 13 per cent this year. Manufacturing, which generates employment, is doing well, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said. Industry growth stood at 7.1 per cent in June and 7.2 per cent in July 2009.        
	Fears about falling demand had set in after an official bungling in the calculation of first quarter GDP (gross domestic product). Data released last month had put economic growth during the April-June quarter at 8.8 per cent based on actual expansion without accounting for taxes.         
	However, index of industrial production (IIP) data for July showed that output of capital goods soared 63 per cent from 1.7 per cent a year ago.        
	The Planning Commission believes the robust performance will help the economy to beat the governments overall growth projection of 8.5 per cent for this fiscal. The news is good. I had thought industrial growth would slow down in July. It has not happened. Thats a great thing, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said.        
	Analysts, however, beg to differ. Most of them had predicted factory output to fall to single digit in July because of waning demand. This is almost double the market expectations. The July figures may not sustain and can prove to be a blip. I dont see the IIP growth beyond 9 per cent this fiscal. These high numbers are not sustainable. Crisil chief economist D.K. Joshi said.        
	Though 12 out of 17 industries, which constitute IIP, posted a positive growth in July, it was manufacturing, which stole the show with a 15 per cent rise compared with 7.4 per cent a year ago, data from the ministry of statistics showed. Manufacturing constitutes about 80 per cent of IIP. Mining expanded 9.7 per cent compared with 8.7 per in July 2009, while electricity grew 3.7 per cent against 4.2 per cent a year earlier.                           
	Among the top performing sectors were capital goods, which grew the fastest at 63 per cent, 9.1 per cent in intermediate goods and 5.1 per cent in basic goods.         
	During April-July, industrial output has risen 11.4 per cent against a mere 4.7 per cent in the corresponding year-ago period.         
	On whether the RBI may further tighten rates to combat rising inflation, Mukherjee said, The government and the RBI are watching. Lets see. We will take actions as the situation demands.        
	Analysts said the central bank would remain focused on dealing with inflation rather than any concerns about the potential impact of weaker global growth while reviewing key interest rates.        
	The apex bank is slated to review its monetary policy stance on September 16, amid expectations that it may raise key rates to tame near double-digit inflation.         
	The RBI has raised key rates thrice this year to put the lid on inflation. Wholesale prices based inflation was 10.55 per cent in June and the government expects this to drop to 5-6 per cent by December helped by good rains that will boost food production.

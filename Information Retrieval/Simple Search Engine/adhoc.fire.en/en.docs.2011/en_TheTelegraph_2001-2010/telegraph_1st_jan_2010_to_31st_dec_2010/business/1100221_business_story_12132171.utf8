The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Corus halts work at Teesside mills 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Corus halts work at Teesside mills 
                            
	London, Feb. 20 (PTI): Work at the Teesside Cast Product (TCP) site of the Tatas-owned Corus steel plant in Redcar came to a grinding halt yesterday leading to a loss of 1,600 jobs.         
	Hopes of an 11th hour deal to stop the partial shutdown of the plant faded last night and the unions warned they were preparing to ballot members in response.        
	Corus is blaming the mothballing on an international consortium, which pulled out of a contract halfway through a 10-year deal.        
	Corus issued a statement saying it would partially start mothballing steelworks today.        
	This is the direct result of the decision in April 2009 by a consortium of four customers responsible for almost 80 per cent of the plants business to renege on a binding 10-year contract.        
	Since then, Corus has worked tirelessly to find an alternative long-term solution for Teesside Cast Products, it said.        
	There has been speculation about potential last-minute bidders for the plant. Corus position remains unchanged. This is a mothballing, not a permanent closure. TCP will be kept ready for a restart. Corus remains open to credible offers for TCP, the statement said.        
	Keith Hazlewood of the GMB  the workers union  said, I have written to our general secretary seeking permission to ballot our members in the steel industry.        
	International media reports suggest that prominent investor and venture capitalist John Moulton, who had once bid to buy UKs MG Rover and failed, had expressed his interest to buy the Teesside plant. The reports also quoted UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown as saying that the government too was facilitating the search to find new owners for the Teesside plant.         
	Last week, Tata Steel Europe (formerly Corus) managing director and CEO Kirby Adams said, We cant go on. We are mothballing the Teesside plant at the end of the week.         
	He said the Teesside had run out of raw material and there were no external orders. However, he hoped that they would be able to revive the plant at some point in the future.                     
	 quot;If the economic circumstance should change, then Teesside can be unmothballed, quot; he said.         
	Teesside employees will receive redundancy packages under the UK law and retirement benefits. However, the British unions are expected to resist the move.

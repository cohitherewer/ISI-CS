The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Daimler set to end ties with Tata Motors
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Daimler set to end ties with Tata Motors
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 8: German car maker Daimler AG is selling its entire 5.3 per cent stake in Tata Motors to raise around Rs 2,000 crore.        
	The stake sale marks the end of a 56-year-old relationship between the German company  formerly DaimlerChrysler  and the $71-billion Tata group.         
	The two joined hands in 1954 when Tata Motors built its first trucks in association with Daimler.        
	According to sources, the share sale is expected to be struck at a price between Rs 737.4 and Rs 761.3 per share for 2.56 crore shares, which will yield anywhere between Rs 1,889 crore and Rs 1,949 crore.         
	Citigroup is managing the share sale for Daimler and the block deal is likely to be completed by Tuesday.         
	A Tata Motors spokesperson declined to comment on the transaction.         
	In the past, several media reports had predicted the end of this relationship, especially after Daimler readied for its foray into India on its own.         
	Daimler is setting up a production facility in Chennai that will make its world famous trucks.         
	This facility is expected to come up by 2012. Daimler, which shares a good relationship with Tata Motors, obtained a no-objection certificate before it decided to launch its own trucks in the sub-continent.         
	Sources said Daimlers move had been probably prompted by the need to raise cash and streamline its portfolio.         
	Daimlers Mercedes Benz unit competes with premium car Jaguar that was bought along with the Land Rover by the Tata group for $2.3 billion. So in a sense, both Daimler trucks as well as luxury cars will compete with offerings from the Tata Motors stable.         
	Last April, Daimler AG and the Munjals-owned Hero group abandoned plans for a truck venture in Chennai in which the latter was supposed to hold 40 per cent.        
	Daimler has already invested 24 million euros in the Indian entity and hopes to raise its investment to 700 million euros in the next four years.        
	The Tata Motors scrip rose 0.18 per cent on Monday to close at Rs 796.75 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

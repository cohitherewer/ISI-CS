          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Saxena: Growth push                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: Hyundai Motor India is expecting a jump of 8-9 per cent in its domestic sales this year, backed by a strong product line-up and shift in the production base of compact car i20 to Turkey.        
	Year 2010 should be good for us, provided the growth momentum continues. In fact, we should be able to cater better to our domestic market this year since we have a strong product line-up and we plan to shift the production of i20 to Turkey. Domestic sales should go up by around 8-9 per cent, Arvind Saxena, director (sales amp; marketing) told The Telegraph.        
	Hyundai Motor India reported a 14.4 per cent rise in car sales at 5,59,880 units in 2009 (January-December) against 4,89,343 units in 2008.         
	Domestic sales increased 18.1 per cent to 2,89,863 units in 2009 from 2,45,397 in 2008, while overseas sales accounted for 2,70,017 units (2,43,946 units), up 10.7 per cent.        
	For this year, Hyundai hopes its domestic sales and exports will be in the ratio of 55: 45.         
	The company will reduce its exports to 2.5 lakh units this year from 2.7 lakh units in 2009.        
	Hyundai expects to increase its domestic sales to 3.1 lakh units from 2.9 lakh units last year.         
	On an average, the company manufactures about 5,000 units of the i20. Saxena said later this month Hyundai would start exporting the car to Australia and New Zealand.        
	The company has two manufacturing facilities in Chennai with a total installed capacity of six lakh units per annum.         
	Asked about the companys plans to manufacture diesel engines in India, Saxena said, We are still evaluating our options. It is an important part of our strategy.        
	While the company manufactured the 1.1 and 1.2 litre petrol engines here, he said manufacturing a 1.1 litre diesel engine locally for the Santro or the i10 would prove to be expensive.        
	On the companys expectations from the forthcoming budget, he said, Reduction in excise duty as part of the stimulus package has helped us to sail through the year and we expect the Centre to continue the current level of excise relief and if possible add some export benefits too.

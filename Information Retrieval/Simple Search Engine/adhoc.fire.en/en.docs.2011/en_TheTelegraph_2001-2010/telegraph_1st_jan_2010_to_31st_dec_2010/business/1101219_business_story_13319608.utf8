	Calcutta, Dec. 18: Bengal Shipyard may revive its Rs 2,000-crore ship building project in Bengal after the Assembly elections.        
	Bengal Shipyard is a joint venture between Mumbai-based Bharati Shipyard and the city-based Apeejay Group.        
	P.B. Roy, director of Bharati Shipyard, said, We have decided to postpone the project till the middle of next year.        
	The company had planned to build a shipyard in Geonkhali, east Midnapore, in 2008 but the project did not make any headway because of political conflicts. The project failed to get a 400-acre plot following protests by the Trinamul Congress.         
	Against the earlier deadline of 2012, the project is now expected to be completed by 2014, Roy said.        
	Bengal Shipyard is looking to rework the whole project with a view to making it bigger. The company may build offshore rigs used for drilling at oilfields apart from ocean-going vessels.         
	The investment may go up 10-15 per cent. Moreover, we will require a 550-acre plot, Roy said on the sidelines of a CII meet here.        
	The company is building another shipyard in Orissa near Dhamra port. The Bengal project can come up earlier if it gets the land.         
	The company, like many other investors, is waiting for the Assembly elections of 2011 before committing big investments.         
	Though Roy hinted that the project would come up at Geonkhali, Apeejay Group chairman Karan Paul had in August said he was looking for an alternative land for the shipyard.        
	Meanwhile, at the CII meet, Bengal governor M.K. Narayanan urged the military and the bureaucracy to involve the private sector in defence.

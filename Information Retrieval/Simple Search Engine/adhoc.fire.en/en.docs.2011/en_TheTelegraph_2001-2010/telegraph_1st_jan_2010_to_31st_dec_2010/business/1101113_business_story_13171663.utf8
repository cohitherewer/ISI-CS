          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          H.M. Nerurkar in Mumbai on Friday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 12: Tata Steel, the worlds seventh largest steel producer, beat Street estimates by reporting a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,979 crore in the second quarter ended September 30 compared with a net loss of Rs 2,707 crore in the corresponding quarter of last year.        
	Net sales rose 11 per cent to Rs 28,090 crore during the three months ended September 30 from Rs 25,276 crore a year ago.         
	Tata Steel announced that it planned to raise long-term capital up to Rs 7,000 crore by issuing either ordinary shares, those with differential voting rights (DVRs), global depository receipts or debentures.        
	Tata Steel is likely to be the second company in the group to float DVRs.         
	Two years ago, Tata Motors had floated its DVR stock along with an issue of ordinary shares. The ordinary shares were fully subscribed, but the DVRs found no takers and devolved on the underwriters. However, the Tata Motors DVR has done well since then riding the crest of an automobile boom this year.         
	In a notice sent to the bourses, Tata Steel said it would be seeking shareholders approval through a postal ballot to raise its authorised capital to Rs 8,350 crore from Rs 8,000 crore.         
	The steel makers results were once again buoyed by its performance in India.        
	We registered strong sales in India in the second quarter, aided by growing strength in industrial activity and intensifying demand from the infrastructure, construction and auto sectors, said managing director H.M. Nerurkar.        
	On a standalone basis, net profit stood at Rs 2,065 crore compared with Rs 902 crore in the year-ago quarter.        
	In Europe, where the companys Corus unit is located, Tata Steel implemented cost and restructuring measures as demand picked up.         
	In September, our lenders showed their confidence in the groups future prospects by agreeing to a refinancing package to stabilise our debt arrangements, said Tata Steel Europe managing director amp; CEO Karl-Ulrich Kohler.         
	But with an uncertain demand outlook in Europe, our operations also remain focused on cost control and stable manufacturing, he said. The Tata Steel scrip fell nearly 4 per cent to Rs 606 on Friday on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

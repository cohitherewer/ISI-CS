          OUR BUREAU                           New deal                                  
	Mumbai, May 16: Reliance Industries has formed a joint venture with Russias leading petrochemical firm SIBUR to make butyl rubber.        
	RIL, which signed a memorandum of understanding with the Russian company, said butyl rubber would be produced at its integrated petrochemical site at Jamnagar in Gujarat.        
	SIBUR will provide proprietary technology for butyl rubber polymerisation and its finishing, while RIL will supply monomers and its infrastructure and utilities, a company release said.        
	The Indian rubber industry is growing rapidly on the back of automobile demand in the country. This step reinforces RILs commitment to the synthetic rubber industry in India, RIL said.        
	SIBUR, which is a leading player in Russia and eastern Europe, operates across the entire petrochemical value chain, from gas processing to the production of monomers and plastics, synthetic rubbers, mineral fertilisers, tyres and industrial rubber goods.        
	KG audit         
	The Comptroller and Auditor General has said the audit of the D-6 oil block in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin operated by RIL was likely to take four to five months more to be finished, according to PTI.        
	We require four to five months to complete the audit. The process will take time, as this is the first time that we are looking at a private players books. Its a very detailed process, Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai said.        
	The CAG is auditing Rs 45,000-crore capital spending by RIL to tap natural gas from the KG-D6 block, following a request from the petroleum ministry in 2007.

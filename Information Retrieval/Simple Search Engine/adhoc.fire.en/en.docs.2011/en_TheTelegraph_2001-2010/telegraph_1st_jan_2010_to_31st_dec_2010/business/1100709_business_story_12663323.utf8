The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Car sales to grow at a slower pace this fiscal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Car sales to grow at a slower pace this fiscal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, July 8: Domestic car sales are expected to slow down to 12-13 per cent this fiscal after rising as much as 33 per cent in the April-June quarter.        
	The Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) today indicated that sales would not be so robust in the coming months because of rising interest rates. Sales are forecast to touch 1.71 million units this year, Siam president Pawan Goenka said.        
	Total sales of cars and sport-utility vehicles are likely to reach 2.19 million units, he said.         
	Last fiscal, car sales had increased 25 per cent to 1.53 million units, the highest gain in six years.         
	There is some slowdown, but still we hope to see robust growth somewhere in the mid-teens for rest of the quarters, the Siam president said.        
	Commodity prices have been on the rise. Natural rubber rose 40 per cent between November and May, he said.         
	Input costs have been stable in the past four weeks, but if they rise further then the industry will be under pressure to revise prices, which can impact sales.        
	Higher inflation is driving interest rates up and this, too, is expected to act as a dampener.         
	In June, car sales stood at 141,184 units against 107,948 units a year ago, while trucks and buses grew 44 per cent to 52,211 units.        
	New models, stimulus measures by the government and rising income have boosted sales in Asias third-largest automobile market in the recent months.         
	The Indian auto market is forecast to increase three-fold over the next decade to six million cars a year from two million now.        
	Besides rising commodity prices, supply constraints from component makers and a declining low-base effect are the major factors impacting growth, Siam said.        
	This is the first attempt by Siam to forecast after considering all the relevant demand drivers for each segment, although I personally think we have a good chance of outdoing the forecast, Goenka said.        
	While the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal has witnessed good growth, it is likely to slow down in the second quarter as a high base effect from last year will start kicking in, he said.        
	During the April-June quarter of this fiscal, car sales increased 33.43 per cent to 4,33,641 units from 3,24,985 units in the year-ago period.        
	Goenka said rising interest rates and a possible increase in the prices of vehicles when Bharat Stage III norm is implemented across the country by October pose a challenge to the industry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coal price irks cement firms

          SAMBIT SAHA                          Seeking relief                                  
	Calcutta, July 12: A section of cement manufacturers has asked the government to bring parity in coal prices.         
	Some of the older players enjoy the advantage of assured coal linkage from Coal India Limited (CIL), while about 55 per cent buy it through the e-auction route.         
	CIL offers coal at Rs 800 per tonne under assured linkage, while others pay Rs 1,500 per tonne in e-auctions.        
	The industry had proposed that CIL should distribute its cheap coal among all players on a pro rata basis according to their production.         
	Alternatively, CIL should do away with the linkage system altogether.        
	Everyone should pay the same price for coal as it contributes nearly 55 per cent of the cost. There should be a level-playing field, said the owner of a mid-sized cement company who did not wish to be identified.        
	According to industry estimates, cement players use around 45 million tonnes of coal every year. Of this, around 15 million tonnes is the assured supply from CIL.        
	It could be difficult for CIL to scrap the old contracts as the recipients of the assured supply could challenge the move in court.         
	The public sector coal miner is also unlikely to push more coal to cement under the fuel supply agreement, which has replaced the old linkage system. Power is the priority sector according to the new coal distribution policy.        
	Margin squeeze        
	Cement companies are expecting a sharp erosion in profitability.         
	Brokerage firm CLSA has predicted an excess capacity of around 55 million tonnes by 2012. Industry veteran Hari Mohan Bangur, managing director of Shree Cement, said the excess capacity would remain till 2015.         
	There will be pain for the industry for the next few years, but demand should catch up as the economy grows, he said.

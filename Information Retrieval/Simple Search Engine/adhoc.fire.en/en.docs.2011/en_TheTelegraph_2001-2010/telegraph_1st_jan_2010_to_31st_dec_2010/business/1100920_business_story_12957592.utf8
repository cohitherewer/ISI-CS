	Mumbai, Sept. 19: The sensex and gold are vying to reach the 20000-mark first.        
	Standard gold was at Rs 19,135 per 10 gram at the Mumbai bullion market on Saturday, while the sensex closed the week at 19594.75 points.         
	Last week, the benchmark index gained around 800 points, the biggest absolute rise in over a year, and looks closer to the 20000 level than the yellow metal.        
	Experts feel the stock index has a slight edge over gold, bogged down by a sluggish demand on account of high prices. Market mavens feel the index can breach the crucial level quickly, while a few optimists believe the feat can be achieved in the coming week itself.        
	They are not without reason  the benchmark index has gained around 13 per cent this calendar year, and the crucial factor fuelling the current rally are the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) who have invested over Rs 68,000 crore in the domestic capital markets this year.         
	It is highly unlikely that the foreign investors will pull out. Therefore, the sensex will easily breach the 20000 level in the next few trading sessions, an analyst said.        
	Dinesh Thakkar, chairman and managing director of Angel Broking, said the sensex would continue its upward march gradually thereafter and hit the 21000-mark by March. According to Thakkar, though the recent surge has been driven by the FIIs, retail investors may enter the fray soon.         
	He said stocks might not crash after reaching 21000 as the markets would be fairly valued this time compared with January 2008 when the sensex had last reached 21000.         
	With the markets inching towards 20000, the retail investors might enter if the markets continue to move upwards, Thakkar told The Telegraph.        
	If the FIIs are driving stock prices, the yellow metal is also ruling above Rs 19,000 because of a bullish mood globally.         
	Domestic prices of gold are largely determined by international rates. International prices of the metal recently crossed $1,280 a troy ounce as traders rushed for the safe haven asset. One reason for the increasing attractiveness of gold as a safe investment is the feeling that the US central bank will go for further monetary easing. There are also apprehensions over Europes sovereign debt problems.        
	Recently, metal consultancy firm GFMS said gold would touch $1,300 per ounce before the end of this calendar year.         
	In such a scenario, prices in India can touch Rs 20,000, said analysts here. However, Suresh Hundia, president of the Bombay Bullion Association, told The Telegraph that there could be some immediate correction in the gold price, though it could touch Rs 20,000 per 10 gram by Diwali.

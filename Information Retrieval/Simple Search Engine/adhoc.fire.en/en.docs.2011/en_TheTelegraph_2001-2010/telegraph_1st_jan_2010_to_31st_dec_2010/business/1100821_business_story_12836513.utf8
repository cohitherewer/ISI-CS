                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Soros pays $35m for 4% holding in BSE 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Soros: Bourse calling                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 20: Billionaire investor George Soros has picked up a 4 per cent stake in the Bombay Stock Exchange for around $35 million (Rs 160 crore).         
	It is learnt that Soros Quantum hedge fund acquired the stake from Dubai Financial, part of state-run Dubai Holdings, for an estimated Rs 380 per share.         
	The deal, therefore, values the BSE, where over 5,000 companies are listed, at over Rs 3,900 crore.         
	At present, foreign investors hold a 30 per cent stake in the BSE, lower than the permissible limit of 49 per cent.         
	While the BSE declined to comment on the deal, sources said the stake sale process was started by Dubai Financial around six months back.        
	Dubai Financial had appointed merchant bankers for the sale six months back. A host of foreign funds had expressed interest. Finally, Soros Quantum outbid others, sources said.         
	Dubai Holding is a group owned by Emirates ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.         
	In February-March 2007, Deutsche Boerse AG and Singapore Exchange Ltd had acquired 4.98 per cent each of the BSE when the bourse was demutualised.         
	The Deutsche Boerse group had picked up the stake for nearly Rs 189 crore.         
	According to the regulations, an institution cannot hold more than 5 per cent in a stock exchange.         
	The investment by George Soros is yet another instance of growing foreign interest in the domestic financial markets.         
	Earlier this year, Singapore governments investment arm Temasek had picked up 5 per cent in the National Stock Exchange.         
	Temasek acquired the stake from the New York Stock Exchange, which exited Indias top bourse after it entered into a cross-listing agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.         
	The NYSE had acquired 5 per cent of the NSE in 2007 for $115 million, valuing the stock exchange at over $2 billion.         
	Under the agreement between the NSE and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, S amp;P Nifty-50 index has been made available to the Chicago bourse for the creation and listing of US dollar-denominated futures.

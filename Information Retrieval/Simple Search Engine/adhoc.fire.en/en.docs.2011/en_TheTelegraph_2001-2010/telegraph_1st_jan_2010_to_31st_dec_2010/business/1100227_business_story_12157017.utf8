The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Road infrastructure gets its due

										      Guest Column - Satish Aggarwal                         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee unveiled the budget for 2010 today. As expected, infrastructure reforms were high on the agenda.         
	Given a growth rate of 18.5 per cent in the manufacturing sector, being the highest in the last two decades, the budgetary allocation in 2010-11 for infrastructure sector stood at Rs 173,552 crore accounting for over 46 per cent of the total planned allocations for infrastructure development in the country.         
	To make a visible impact on the road infrastructure, the government has targeted construction of national highways at the pace of 20 km per day. To accelerate the pace of implementation, changes have already been proposed in the policy framework relating to projects being executed through the public-private partnerships.         
	For the year 2010-11, the planned budget allocation for road infrastructure has been raised by over 13 per cent to Rs 19,894 crore and a further allocation of Rs 66,100 crore for development of rural infrastructure has been proposed.         
	The government has also accorded a high priority to the power sector. This is evident from doubling of the annual plan allocation to Rs 5,130 crore for the power sector together with increased outlays in the renewable energy space. A proposed outlay of Rs 1,000 crore for renewable energy, an increase by 61 per cent over last years allocation, is a welcome step towards achieving the ambitious target of 20,000 MW of solar power by the year 2022 under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission. Indias commitment towards green environment is clearly reflected by the proposed plan to set up a National Clean Energy Fund India for funding research and innovative projects in clean energy technologies.         
	From a corporate tax perspective, a reduction in the rate of surcharge from the existing 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent brought some cheer for the industry. However, the proposed increase in the minimum alternative tax from the existing 15 per cent to 18 per cent could well prove to be a dampener, especially for the road and power sector.         
	A deduction of Rs 20,000, in addition to the existing limit of Rs 1 lakh, has been allowed to individual tax payers on investments in long-term infrastructure bonds to be notified by the central government which will help in fund mobilisation in addition to planned allocation.         
	From an indirect tax perspective, excise duty has been increased from 8 per cent to 10 per cent and accordingly, the peak effective customs duty rate has increased from 24.42 percent to 26.85 percent, thereby increasing the construction cost for the industry.         
	On the positive side, resale of machinery used for road construction (imported at nil customs duty), which was earlier barred for a period of 5 years, has been allowed on the payment of import duty at depreciated value of such machinery. Also, allocation of such machinery for undertaking other road projects has been allowed.         
	To give the much needed impetus to the renewable energy sector, custom duty rates have been reduced for important components used in hydro electric, solar and wind energy generation projects.

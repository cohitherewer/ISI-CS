          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, March 17: The US Food and Drug Administration has warned Glenmark Pharmaceuticals against marketing unauthorised nitroglycerine tablets, used to relieve chest pain.         
	Failure on Glenmarks part to promptly correct violations may result in legal action, including seizure and injunction, the US regulator said. It said other federal agencies could take its warning letter into account before awarding contracts.         
	Glenmark said it was evaluating the situation and would take appropriate measures. It added that the move would not have a significant impact on its results for 2010-11.         
	The US regulator on Tuesday issued warning letters to Glenmark Generics (the US subsidiary of Glenmark) and its partner Konec Inc to stop the marketing of unapproved nitroglycerin tablets, stating they have not been proven safe and effective. The tablets are placed under the tongue to relieve chest pain or to stop a heart attack and are marketed in 0.3 mg, 0.4 mg, and 0.6 mg dosages, the regulator said.        
	Glenmark has 15 days to respond and is expected to submit a plan to withdraw the product from the market. It has to stop manufacturing the product within 90 days and halt the shipment of the existing products within 180 days of the letter.         
	If you no longer market the products referred to in this letter, your response should so indicate, including the reasons that, and the date on which, you ceased production, the drug regulator said.        
	On the BSE today, the Glenmark scrip ended 3.34 per cent higher at Rs 242.75.

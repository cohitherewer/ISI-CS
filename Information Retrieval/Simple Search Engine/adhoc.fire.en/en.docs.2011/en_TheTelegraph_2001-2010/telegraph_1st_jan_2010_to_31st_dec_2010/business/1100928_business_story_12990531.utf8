          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 27: On a day the sensex resolutely stayed above the 20000-mark, shares of Mahindra Satyam crashed nearly 4 per cent as nervous investors dumped the stock after last weekends decision to delist the American depository receipts (ADRs) from the New York Stock Exchange.        
	The delisting decision  taken as the firm slipped once again on the final deadline set by the US market regulator for an accounting restatement under American accounting rules  had seen the ADRs plunge nearly 24 per cent to $4.64 on the NYSE on Friday.        
	Mahindra Satyam had said it was unable to file the restated financial accounts by the deadline of October 15 under the US accounting standards, or US GAAP. We do not anticipate that we will be able to file restated US GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial statements by the deadline, it had said.         
	The stock tanked on the local bourse just two days before Mahindra Satyam is due to unveil its audited results for 2008-09 and 2009-10, after nearly 21 months. The fear is that the auditors are likely to qualify even these results, especially those transactions that were concluded by the earlier rogue management.        
	There is already some uncertainty relating to its financials as we approach September 29 when it will declare results for the two years. On top of that, the market has been spooked by the decision to delist the ADRs from the NYSE, said an analyst with a domestic brokerage.        
	On the BSE, the Mahindra Satyam scrip closed at Rs 96.45, a fall of around 3.65 per cent. The stock had opened lower at Rs 94.70 and crashed to a low of Rs 90.60.        
	Mahindra Satyam, earlier known as Satyam Computer Services, has not reported financial accounts since January 2009 when its promoter B. Ramalinga Raju confessed that he had padded the firms accounts by Rs 7,100 crore.         
	The last financial numbers reported by Satyam were for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 when it reported revenues of Rs 2,819 crore and a net income of Rs 581 crore.        
	In a report, CLSA Asia Pacific analysts Bhavtosh Vajpayee and Nimish Joshi said they did not expect the firms growth to follow the sector prospects in 2010-11, or even in the next fiscal. On Mahindra Satyams likely merger with Tech Mahindra, the analysts said it would help reduce overhead costs, but we do not see either firm being stronger post the merger.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | G20 chases accord

	Seoul, Nov. 11 (Reuters): The Group of 20 today laboured to agree on how to put the world economy on a sounder footing as renewed fears over Irelands ability to pay its debts underscored the lingering fallout of the global financial crisis.        
	The G20 had hoped to use a two-day summit to recapture the unity forged in the depths of the crisis two years ago in order to soothe tensions over exchange rates generated by imbalances between cash-rich exporting nations and debt-burdened importers.        
	But even as US President Barack Obama voiced the confidence that leaders would find a formula for a more balanced and sustainable growth, negotiators squabbled over the language in a closing statement to be issued when the summit ends on Friday.        
	The persistence of these imbalances is a problem in the long term and these things have to be addressed, said Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.        
	Will they be addressed at this conference? Im not so sure, but I think were getting a more frank discussion on some of these matters, that they do have to be resolved, Harper said.        
	The meeting has been billed as a chance for rich nations to strike a grand bargain on how to rejuvenate the world economic order with emerging powerhouses such as India and China. But leaders appeared unlikely to venture far beyond agreements reached by their finance ministers last month.        
	The real issue is, given that it is a problem, how do we coordinate policy? I dont think you should be too demanding because such policy coordination has never been attempted before, Indias chief G20 negotiator, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, said.        
	A major irritant in the run-up to the summit has been the Federal Reserves $600-billion bond-buying spree to revive the US economy, which emerging markets fear will trigger a flood of money into their markets, boosting inflation and asset prices.        
	Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan stirred that pot, saying the US central banks policy was deliberately weakening the dollar.        
	The US will never do that, US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner shot back in an interview with a television channel.         
	We will never seek to weaken our currency as a tool to gain competitive advantage or to grow the economy, Geithner said        
	Geithner criticised Chinas currency policies, saying the worlds second-largest economy risked stoking inflation pressures. China earlier reported that consumer price inflation had hit a 25-month high in October.        
	Yu Jianhua, an official with Chinas ministry of commerce, said Beijing had no intention to confront the US over currencies or trade issues.        
	But, Yu added, Washington should not politicise the yuan issue, should not blame others for its domestic problems and should not force others to take medicine for its own disease.        
	A source with Russias delegation weighed in, criticising unilateral decisions by some countries to weaken their exchange rates that could spark fears of global currency wars.        
	Obama, speaking after a meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, said he was confident that leaders would support a programme for promoting balanced growth, building on a agreement reached at a G20 summit in Pittsburgh in 2009.        
	I dont think this is a controversial proposition, he said.        
	The world has been spared an outbreak of protectionism since the crisis. But the cocktail of low growth and high unemployment is making it harder for politicians to muster support for opening their markets wider.         
	Despite the presence of Lee and Obama, South Korea and the US failed on the sidelines of the summit to finalise a long-stalled free trade deal.        
	Lee said a little bit of progress had been made since G20 finance ministers met in Gyeongju, South Korea, last month but deep divisions remained over how best to reduce imbalances.

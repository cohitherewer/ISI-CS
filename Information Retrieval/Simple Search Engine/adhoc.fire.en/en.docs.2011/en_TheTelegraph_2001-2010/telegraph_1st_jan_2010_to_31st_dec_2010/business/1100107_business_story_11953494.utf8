	New Delhi, Jan. 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today took stock of the economy, cash demands of ministries in the forthcoming budget and food inflation at his meeting with Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and other members of the plan panel.        
	The Prime Minister, who is also the chairman of the Planning Commission, directed the panel to complete the mid-term appraisal of the Eleventh Plan (2007-12) by March.         
	The commission is slated to complete the review by the end of this month.         
	Officials said the meeting would help in prioritising the sectors that needed support in the budget, which is facing a huge demand for funds from the ministries.        
	The demand for gross budgetary support this time is 82 per cent higher than the 2009-10 allocations.         
	The UPA is faced with a large gap in fiscal deficit amid increasing demands for funds for flagship schemes such as the NREGA, Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission and the National Rural Health Mission.        
	Farmer demand        
	The Consortium of Indian Farmers today lobbied for a lower rate on farm credit and import duty on edible oils at its pre-budget meeting with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	It said increasing the role of the private sector in agriculture would enhance investments as well as increase efficiency.         
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal today told the PTI that the budget was likely to be tabled on February 27, a Saturday.

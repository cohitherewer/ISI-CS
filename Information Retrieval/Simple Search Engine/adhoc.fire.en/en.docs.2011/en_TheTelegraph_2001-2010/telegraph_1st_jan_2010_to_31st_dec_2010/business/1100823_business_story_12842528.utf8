The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lupin sniffs for buys in US 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Lupin sniffs for buys in US 
          VIVEK NAIR                          Gupta: Upbeat                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 22: Pharmaceutical company Lupin is looking to buy American firms in the branded generics business.         
	Branded generics are off-patent drugs but enjoy better margins because of the relatively higher price compared with pure generic drugs.         
	Though generics have delivered good returns, competition has impacted their prices.         
	Lupin entered the US through Suprax more than five years ago. Suprax contains cefixime, which is an oral cephalosporin that treats common infections. The company now has four brands  Suprax, AeroChamber Plus, Antara and AllerNaze.         
	The Rs 4,700-crore firms branded business contributed 37 per cent to its overall US revenues of $127 million (around Rs 571 crore) in 2009-10, registering a 72 per cent growth over the previous fiscal.         
	Vinita Gupta, CEO of Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc., said, What really differentiates Lupin from most generics players, not to forget our Indian peers, in the US is the fact that it has built a highly profitable and substantial brands business. Being a late entrant in the US in 2005 it was evident to us that the company could not depend on price and a generic business model alone in the long term. This led us to focus on niche segments and products, which will be close to our strengths.         
	Gupta said the firms experience, understanding of the market and marketing strategies have resulted in the success of the brands. Lupin has a 160-member sales force to promote these products.         
	However, the company is aiming for more. We will continue to scout for more brand buys in the US to boost growth. Our identified targets in the past have had annual sales in the region of $20-100 million a year, she said.         
	Gupta is optimistic on the prospects of the companys generic drug portfolio. Lupin is the fastest mover in the US, growing at 51 per cent by prescriptions and ranking among the top five. It has 26 generic products, of which 13 are market leaders. In terms of market share, it figures among the top three for 25 products.         
	Gupta said its policy of focussing on niche areas have paid dividends. One such area is oral contraceptives, the generic market for which is valued at $1 billion. Analysts expect Lupin to enjoy good margin in this segment once it begins to launch products from September next year because of limited competition.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 11: Reliance Industries today sold another cache of treasury stock  its third sale from this pool in the past four months  to raise Rs 3,465 crore. This is the biggest sale of treasury stock by the company so far.        
	The sale of 3.30 crore shares at a price of Rs 1,050 per share will swell RILs cash chest of approximately Rs 25,000 crore which analysts speculate will be used to fund the buyout of bankrupt Netherlands-based LyondellBasell (LB).         
	RILs decision to sell another chunk of treasury stock comes soon after it sweetened the offer price for LB from $12 billion to $13.5 billion.         
	Mondays sale price is slightly higher than what RIL garnered in a previous transaction concluded a week ago (See table). The sale of treasury stock held by the Petroleum Trust in three tranches has fetched Reliance Rs 9,328 crore.         
	RILs treasury stock was created in 2002 when the company effected a merger with Reliance Petroleum Ltd that had set up the first crude oil refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat.        
	Sources said RIL was expected to sell more of its treasury stock in the coming weeks but declined to give a clear time frame. After Mondays sale, the Petroleum Trust holds 12.04 crore shares of treasury stock.        
	RILs share sale on Monday was made to funds that reportedly include Fidelity and Janus.        
	The RIL stock fell 1.9 per cent to Rs 1,081. 55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) as Mondays sale indicated that the company might suffer a higher cash outgo as it prepared to pay more to acquire LB.         
	Reliance has recently submitted its revised bid of $13.5 billion to LyondellBasells existing management that has the option of presenting it to a US bankruptcy court as an option in a reorganisation plan.        
	Lyondells management is in the process of pushing a reorganisation plan that will forgive debt of around $18 billion by converting it into equity.

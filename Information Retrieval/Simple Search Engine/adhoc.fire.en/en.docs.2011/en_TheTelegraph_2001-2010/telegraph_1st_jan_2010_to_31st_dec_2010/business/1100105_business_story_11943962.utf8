The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | 3G auction drill to begin on Sunday
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      3G auction drill to begin on Sunday
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Call waiting                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: The government will invite bid applications for the much delayed auction of third-generation spectrum from Sunday.         
	Earlier scheduled for January 14, the auction has now been postponed to next month. The bidding is expected to be over by February. The government expects to rake in Rs 25,000-35,000 crore from the sale by March.         
	The government hopes to plug part of its fiscal deficit from the proceeds of 3G auction. The fiscal deficit for 2009-10 is estimated at a 16-year high of 6.8 per cent of GDP, or Rs 400,000 crore.         
	Four slots in each of the 22 telecom circles have been put up for sale, with the base price set at Rs 3,500 crore for a pan-India spectrum.        
	Winning bidders may have to pay the entire amount upfront within 20 days of the auction, said officials. However, spectrum will be available only in August.         
	Officials said the department of telecom (DoT) would soon provide the details on the auction, including the exact availability of spectrum in each circle and the payment schedule.        
	Applications for participating in the auction will be accepted till the last week of January, while mock auctions will be held around February 10, said DoT officials. A fresh schedule with all the dates will be issued soon.         
	Third-generation radio waves will enable telecom firms to offer high-end services such as the Internet, video-conferencing, interactive gaming, mobile TV and high-speed downloads.        
	The defence forces, which currently occupy a significant amount of spectrum, have agreed to vacate them by August, enabling the telecom ministry to allocate radio waves to operators by that time. Thirteen firms are jostling for space in the domestic telecom market and three more companies are due to launch services by next year.         
	Number portability  that allows customers to retain their mobile numbers while changing an operator  is scheduled to be implemented from mid-2010. This could affect operators without 3G air waves as high-end customers may turn to their rivals.

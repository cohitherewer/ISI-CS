	Calcutta, Sept. 17: The United Stock Exchange will go live on Monday. An official of the countrys first exclusive bourse for currency trading said some foreign exchanges had evinced interest in picking up an equity stake.         
	We are talking to a few foreign exchanges, said Gaurav Arora, director of the United Stock Exchange as well as of Jaypee Capital.        
	Jaypee is one of the many promoters of the United Stock Exchange (USE).        
	In fact, we have recently signed a non-disclosure agreement with a foreign exchange willing to pick up a stake in our exchange, he said.        
	Besides Jaypee Capital, 25 public sector banks, including the State Bank of India, and five private banks  ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Yes Bank and Federal Bank  are the promoters of the USE.         
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India is yet to approve Bank of America and Standard Chartered Bank as our shareholders, Arora said.        
	MMTC and India Potash are also the shareholders of the USE.         
	MMTC is the countrys largest trader and it has a $7-billion exposure to foreign currencies. India Potash also has a wide exposure to foreign currency. These two shareholders will be the initial buyers, while banks will be the suppliers, said V. Balasubramaniam, the chief operating officer of the United Stock Exchange.        
	The Bombay Stock Exchange, where George Soros  the worlds most high-profile investor in the currency market  recently picked up a 4 per cent stake, is another promoter shareholder.        
	The 75-year-old chairman of Delaware-based Soros Fund Management made his first billion in 1992 by betting against the British pound.        
	Soros is likely to invest in the Indian currency soon with the rupee and the Chinese yuan grabbing global attention.        
	At present, Sebi and the RBI allow trading only in futures contracts for the dollar, euro, British pound and Japanese yen vis--vis the rupee.         
	The daily turnover in currency trading on the NSE is around Rs 14,000 crore and we expect to surpass this volume very soon, Arora said.         
	Trading in currency derivatives, however, has not picked up because futures contracts limit the pricing ability of exporters and importers who want to hedge their foreign currency exposure. Among the currencies, only the dollar-rupee pair is mainly traded. We expect trading in options contract to begin in October this year and then the trading volume will pick up significantly, he added.        
	Worldwide, the currency derivatives market is bigger than the commodities market, which is bigger than the equity market.         
	We are offering free membership tickets to start with, Balasubramaniam said. When the NSE started, it distributed first 100 tickets for free. The value of a membership ticket in the NSE is now over Rs 10 lakh.

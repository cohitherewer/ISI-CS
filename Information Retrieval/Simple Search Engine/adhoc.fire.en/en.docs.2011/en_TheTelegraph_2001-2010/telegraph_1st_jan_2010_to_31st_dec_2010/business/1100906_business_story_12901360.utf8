          JAYATI GHOSE                           Recycling mode                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: Manufacturers of electric and electronic products have started the recycling and disposal of e-waste as part of their environment-friendly initiatives.         
	Samsung, Nokia and HCL Infosystems are among those to join the green bandwagon.         
	As a responsible corporate citizen, environmental protection is one of our key priorities. This initiative reaffirms our commitment towards building awareness for responsible consumption, waste management practices and ensuring proper end-of-life treatment to reduce the burden on the planet, said J.S. Shin, president and CEO of Samsung (Southwest Asia).         
	Under the Samsung Take- Back and Recycling (STAR) programme, consumer durables such as television sets, DVD players, home theatre systems, mobile phones, cameras, computer monitors, printers and home appliances can be disposed of at 235 locations in 20 cities.         
	Nokia and HCL also allow customers to return handsets, and computer peripherals at specific pick-up points from where they are sent for recycling and disposal.         
	Most companies, including Samsung, Nokia and HCL, have partnered e-waste recyclers authorised by the ministry of environment and forests. The recycling partners are committed to not incinerating, landfilling, or exporting toxic wastes to developing countries.         
	Electronic waste  or e-waste  refers to old, end-of-life electronic appliances, which have been dumped by their users.         
	Electrical and electronic equipment are made up of components which contain toxic substances that can have an adverse impact on human health and the environment if not handled properly, said a Greenpeace activist.        
	A survey by an international NGO said India generated 4 lakh tonnes of e-waste every year.         
	According to E-Parisara, Indias first recycler, 99 per cent of the e-waste can be recycled in the country, with less than 1 per cent toxic waste emanating, which is sent to landfills.         
	The governments recently drafted e-waste policy proposes to make manufacturers and dealers of electrical and electronic products accountable for the disposal of the goods.

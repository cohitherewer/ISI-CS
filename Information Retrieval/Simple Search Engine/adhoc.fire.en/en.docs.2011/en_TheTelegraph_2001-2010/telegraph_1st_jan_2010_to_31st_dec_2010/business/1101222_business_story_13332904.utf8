          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          OVL managing director R.S. Butola (right) and Sistema chairman Vladimir Evtushenkov in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: ONGC Ltd has signed an initial agreement to barter its stake in its Russian unit Imperial Energy for a 25-30 per cent interest in Sistema-owned JSC Bashneft.         
	The agreement will give the state-owned firm access to the lucrative Trebs and Titov energy fields.        
	Bashneft is developing the largest discovered fields Trebs and Titov in the Arctic circle.        
	The partnership should provide synergy to the growth plan of the two groups in the Russian oil sector, ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said.        
	ONGC has long been seeking to broaden its oil and gas base in Russia  the worlds top energy exporter.        
	Bashneft produces 13 million tonnes (mt) of oil from Russian fields and owns refineries with a combined capacity of 20mt.         
	ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas arm of ONGC, will also get a part of Sistemas 49 per cent stake in RussNef, which has fields in Russia producing 12mt oil as well as a stake in Trebs and Titov fields that Bashneft won recently. In exchange, OVL would give away its 100 per cent interest in Imperial Energy, which it had acquired for $2.1 billion in 2008.        
	Sistema holds over 75 per cent in Bashneft, and together with persons acting in concert, controls over 90 per cent.        
	OVL said the potential transaction involves Sistemas majority stake in JSC Bashneft and 49 per cent stake in RussNeft, each of which owns and operates numerous fields and refining assets in Russia (and) OVLs 100 per cent stake in Imperial Energy Corp, which owns and operates fields in Russia.        
	ONGC proposes to lead a consortium of Indian oil PSUs to acquire the stake offered by Sistema under the agreement.        
	ONGC and Sistema would also look at any other oil and gas assets which the companies may acquire before agreements are signed. The parties further agree to consider joint investments in each others existing and future exploratory assets in certain third countries, an ONGC release said.        
	The two firms have agreed to formulate the terms of the deal by June.

	Calcutta, June 28: Health-plus-life combo products may hit the market in a couple of months. Such policies will provide life cover along with health insurance.        
	In December 2009, the insurance regulator issued guidelines on heath-cum-life cover to be jointly offered by life and non-life insurance companies.        
	Insurers said they were in the process of filing documents with the regulator and hoped to launch the products in a couple of months after getting approvals.        
	Future Generali Life Insurance Companys managing director and chief executive officer Deepak Sood today said the company had signed a memorandum of agreement with group entity Future Generali General Insurance to offer the combo product.         
	We are in the process of filing the product documents with the insurance regulator and hopefully in a couple of months we shall be able to offer this product, Sood said.        
	Future Generali Life Insurance will be the lead insurer. Only composite agents, who have the licence to sell both life and non-life policies, will sell this product, Sood said.        
	Last week, Bharti Axa General Insurance Companys chief executive officer Amarnath Ananthanarayan said the groups two insurance outfits had signed an agreement for combo products and were studying the market demand.         
	We are planning to offer 3-4 products in this category and shall file a prospectus in the next two-three months, Ananthanarayan said.        
	The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority gave its approval to such integrated products so that life and non-life companies could leverage each others marketing and operational strengths.        
	Policy buyers will also benefit as they will get dual cover under a single plan from one insurer. However, one life insurance company can tie up with only one non-life insurer. The two will also have to sign a memorandum of agreement.         
	We have not yet decided whether Bharti Axa General or Bharti Axa Life will be the lead insurer, said Ananthanarayan.         
	Depending on the sum assured and health insurance offered in a plan, it can cater to people from high-income to the low-income groups, Sood said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ten-year term for tax-saving core bonds
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ten-year term for tax-saving core bonds
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 9: The government today said tax-saving infrastructure bonds would have a tenure of 10 years and a lock-in period of five years.        
	Individuals will be able to claim tax relief on investments up to Rs 20,000 in these bonds over and above the deduction of Rs 1 lakh from annual income for the purpose of calculating taxable income, allowed under various provisions of the income tax act.        
	Investments in long-term infrastructure bonds of the Industrial Finance Corporation of India, the Life Insurance Corporation of India, Infrastructure Development Finance Company and non-banking finance companies classified as infrastructure finance firms by the Reserve Bank of India will be eligible for deduction up to Rs 20,000 under a new Section 80CCF introduced in the Finance Act 2010-11.         
	It will be mandatory for the subscriber to furnish a permanent account number (PAN) to the issuer for investment in the bonds.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in his budget this year had said subscriptions to long-term infrastructure bonds during 2010-11 would be allowed as deduction in computing the taxable income of an individual or a Hindu undivided family.         
	This deduction will be over and above the existing overall limit of deduction of up to Rs 1 lakh under section 80C, 80CCC and 80CCD of the act.        
	However, the word subscription in the proposed Section 80CCF is important because it seems deduction will be allowed only to those who obtain these bonds by application and allotment process and not to those who acquire it from an existing holder of the bonds.        
	We are waiting for a final notification by the Central Board of Direct Taxes on this, said a senior official of L amp;T Infrastructure Finance Company that has recently been classified as an infrastructure finance company by the Reserve Bank. However, we hope that these tax-saving bonds will hit the market before the end of this calendar year, he said.        
	The company in April raised funds through the issue of bonds carrying a coupon rate of 8.91 per cent.         
	Market analysts believe that the rate of interest on these bonds may be between 7 per cent and 8 per cent and vary from issuer to issuer.        
	The interest rate on these bonds will primarily depend on the yield of available investment instruments, such as government securities. The yield on 10-year government paper is 7.5 per cent at present, if it goes down to 6.5 per cent tomorrow, the interest rate offered on infrastructure bonds will also decline, said Sanjay Sinha, chief executive officer, L amp;T Mutual Fund.                          
	Mobilising money from retail investors is always costlier than raising it from institutional investors. Besides, investors will be able to save tax by investing in these bonds.        
	From both the perspectives, the interest rate on these infrastructure bonds will be lower than alternative investment instruments.                                                  
	If you remember, when IDBI and ICICI used to offer infrastructure bonds, they used to do it in tranches. We can see similar exercise now and the interest rate will also vary from issuer to issuer as in case of tax-saving bank fixed deposits, he added.        
	The government aims to spend $500 billion on infrastructure in the five years to March 2012, and is considering doubling that figure in the five years after that.

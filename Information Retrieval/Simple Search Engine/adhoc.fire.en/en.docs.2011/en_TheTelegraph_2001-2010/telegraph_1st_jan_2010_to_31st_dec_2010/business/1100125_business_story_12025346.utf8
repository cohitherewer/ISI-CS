The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Australian mine deals beckon Indian firms
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Australian mine deals beckon Indian firms
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 24: Australia wants Indian companies to acquire more coking coal mines Down Under to restrict Chinese dominance.        
	Most of the coking coal mines in Australia are privately held. So, they just offload the stake to whoever pays them the best. Indian firms are a bit conventional in mergers and acquisitions. But the Chinese companies are aggressive, Peter Linford, senior trade commissioner (South Asia), Australian Trade Commission, told The Telegraph.         
	If over 50 per cent of the coal mines go to the Chinese firms, it will be a major problem for Australia, he said.         
	According to him, all deals should be beneficial for Australia. We want more Indian firms to invest in a structured manner in Australia. Linford was in the city to attend a seminar on mining IME 2010.        
	Earlier this month, Australia and China signed a $3- billion coal deal after a rocky year in which the former had blocked a series of Chinese takeovers. The deal  purchase of Felix Resources of Australia by Yanzhou Coal Mining  could open the door to more acquisitions.         
	The buyout was the biggest by a Chinese firm in Australian mining history and among the top 10 mergers and acquisitions in Australia in 2009. The resources sector is Australias biggest export earner and miners regularly pursue Chinese funding, only to be overruled by Australias Foreign Investment Review Board.        
	Last year, Australia formulated new investment guidelines, which did not favour majority foreign stakes in mining, raising Chinas concern.        
	Indian firms such as L amp;T, Coal India, NTPC, Steel Authority of India, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, NMDC, JSW and PTC India are among the companies looking for coal assets in Australia, either individually or through joint bids.

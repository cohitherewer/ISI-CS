	New Delhi, Nov. 25: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel today warned private airlines of strict action if they failed to reduce fares.        
	We shall certainly try our best to bring discipline in the aviation sector. In the last few weeks, airlines have been charging exorbitant prices from passengers on most routes. This is a phenomenon that has been taken serious note of by the ministry as well as by the DGCA (directorate general of civil aviation), Patel told reporters.        
	The minister said the aviation regulator had provisions to check such malpractices and would invoke them if the airlines did not fall in line. The DGCA has sent notices to all the airlines and this kind of predatory pricing cannot be justified and it cannot be allowed to continue. The DGCA has special powers and they can certainly invoke them if the airlines do not act responsibly in the days to come, Patel said.        
	While almost all routes saw a seasonal 15-25 per cent rise in fares recently, the hike in the Delhi-Mumbai route had been as high as 300 per cent.        
	Patel said airlines should publish a price band  having a floor and ceiling rate  for all routes on their websites, which would make the process transparent. They cannot go for a free run and ask for any kind of price from a customer at the last minute. This kind of predatory pricing cannot be justified, it is unfair to the passengers, the minister said.        
	The DGCA had recently asked airlines to furnish a copy of the route-wise tariff across its network in various fare categories, in the manner it is offered in the market, to the DGCA on the first day of every calendar month.         
	The circular said any significant and noticeable change in the established tariff already filed, should be reported to the DGCA within 24 hours of effecting such changes.         
	The regulator also asked the airlines to publish fares on their websites or in the newspapers on a regular basis.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi clampdown on Ulip
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sebi clampdown on Ulip
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cash control                                  
	Mumbai, April 9: Market regulator Sebi tonight banned 14 private insurance companies, including SBI Life, ICICI Prudential and Tata AIG, from raising money from the public for any unit-linked insurance plan (Ulip).         
	While passing the order late tonight, Sebi said the entities had not obtained any registration from the market regulator, though the Ulips launched by them had an investment component akin to mutual funds. Henceforth, insurance firms keen on offering Ulips will have to take permission from Sebi. The order, however, will not affect the existing unit-linked plans of the 14 companies.        
	I hereby direct the entities...not to issue any offer document, advertisement, brochure soliciting money from investors or raise money from investors by way of new or additional subscription for any product (including Ulips) having an investment component in the nature of mutual funds, till they obtain the requisite certificate of registration from Sebi, said Prashant Saran, wholetime Sebi member, in an order.        
	The other insurance companies against whom Sebi passed the order are Aegon Religare Life, Aviva Life, Bajaj Allianz, Bharti AXA, Birla Sunlife, HDFC Standard Life, ING Vysya Life, Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life, Max New York Life, Metlife India and Reliance Life.         
	In his order that ran into 11 pages, Saran said the insurance entities by their own admission had stated that there were two components of Ulips  an insurance component where the risk vests with the insurer and an investment component where the risk lies with the investor.        
	This establishes conclusively that Ulips are a combination product and the investment component needs to be registered with and regulated by Sebi, he stated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | G-20 focus on balanced growth

                              Manmohan Singh arrives in Toronto on Saturday. (Reuters)                            
	Toronto, June 26 (PTI): Leaders of the worlds developed and major emerging economies are meeting here tomorrow to discuss strategies for ensuring a balanced and sustainable growth, even as India favours calibrated exit strategies and is opposed to any universal tax to fund bailout of banks.         
	The meeting comes against the backdrop of an emerging sovereign debt crisis in some European countries which are caught in conflicting pulls on continuing the global stimulus package.         
	From the Summit in Washington at the height of 2008 financial crisis to the 2009 spring Summit in London when they decided on a global stimulus package to pull the economy out of depression, the leaders are now facing conflicting demands  from the US against early exit to European demand for heavy cutting down of government spending to eliminate deficits on the heels of euro zone crisis.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who heads a high-power delegation to the fourth Summit of G-20, is expected to put forth the Indian view that it is necessary that the global economy continue to recover in a stable and predictable manner. For that there is need for investment and capital flows as well as an open and rule-based trading system that does not succumb to protectionist tendencies.         
	At the same time, the Prime Minister is conscious that the recovery is still fragile and uneven as new worrying signs have emerged in the euro zone.         
	The challenge of the Toronto Summit, being hosted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada, is three-fold, according to Singh. They are  to ensure that global economic recovery is durable, balanced and sustainable, to calibrate exit strategies in the light of growing concerns over expansionary fiscal policies and to focus on medium and long-term structural issues relating to governance issues.         
	The theme of the Toronto Summit is Recovery and the New Beginning in which it is expected to deliberate on a framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.         
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and top officials, including finance secretary Ashok Chawla, are already here ahead of the Prime Ministers arrival, working with negotiators on issues like how much stimulus should be continued and how much should be pulled back.         
	It all depends on fiscal consolidation of the individual countrys economy vis-a-vis the global economy. The countries which are still sluggish want the stimulus to continue and those like India, which have recovered fairly well from the 2008 crisis, would like a phased withdrawal, Indian officials say.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RBI ups rates, signals pause
   Balancing inflation, growth tops priority          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 2: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today raised key short-term rates by 25 basis points to tame inflation but hinted that it would now pause after its sixth rate increase this year.         
	The likelihood of further rate actions in the immediate future is relatively low, the RBI said in a statement issued after todays second-quarter monetary policy review.        
	RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao adopted a widely-anticipated decision to raise the repo rate and the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points each to 6.25 per cent and 5.25 per cent, respectively.         
	The reverse repo is the rate at which the RBI absorbs liquidity from banks, while the repo is the rate at which it provides money to banks.         
	The policy rate hikes came hours after the Australian central bank surprised the markets by raising its benchmark overnight cash rate by a quarter point to 4.75 per cent in Sydney.        
	The US Federal Reserve is expected to announce a plan tomorrow to buy at least $500 billion of long-term securities triggering a second round of quantitative easing in developed countries that is expected to send another tidal wave of cash into emerging markets such as India.        
	The RBI said it was raising the two key short-term policy rates to control rising inflationary expectations without trammelling an economy that is expected to grow 8.5 per cent this year.        
	Banks are expected to pick up the cue and raise deposit and lending rates, though senior bankers such as State Bank of India chairman .P. Bhatt said it might not happen immediately. Banks had recently raised their lending rates by 25 to 50 basis points.        
	Subbarao told reporters that inflation and inflationary expectations remained high as both demand side and supply side factors were at play.         
	The RBI said despite some moderation in recent months, headline inflation remained above its medium-term trend and well above its comfort zone. On the other hand, food inflation had also not shown the expected post-monsoon moderation, partly reflecting the structural demand-supply mismatches in several commodities. This had elevated inflation expectations.        
	Reacting to the RBI move, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said, This tightening may have some negative impact on the growth rate, but I expect such an effect to be only a short one. In the medium to long term, the changes announced today should actually help the Indian economy do better in terms of growth.        
	Significantly, the RBI hinted that it might not take further rate action in the immediate future based on the current growth and inflation trends. This is the first time in recent years that the RBI is giving such a guidance. Subbarao clarified that by immediate future, the central bank meant a period of three months.        
	However, the RBI added that it would respond to any shocks that might emanate from either the global or domestic environment.        
	Asked whether the rising interest rate differential between domestic and international markets would result in greater capital inflows, Subbarao said the Indian economy had the capacity to absorb more capital.        
	There was some good news for urban cooperative banks with the RBI deciding to relax the branch licensing policy and permitting banks with a minimum networth of Rs 50 crore to extend their operations beyond the boundaries of the state in which they are registered.

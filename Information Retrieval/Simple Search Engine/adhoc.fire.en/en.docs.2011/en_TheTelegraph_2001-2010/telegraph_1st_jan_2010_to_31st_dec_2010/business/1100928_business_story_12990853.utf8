          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Market move                                        
	Calcutta, Sept. 27: The State Bank of India is planning to tap the retail bond market before its rights issue in the January-March quarter of the current fiscal.        
	The countrys largest lender wants to raise Rs 1,000 crore through bonds to shore up its debt capital. This will be the first bond issue by a bank for retail investors.         
	The Reserve Bank of India has allowed banks to launch retail bonds to mobilise tier-II capital, which is the debt component of a banks capital.        
	According to the draft prospectus, the bonds will have a face value of Rs 10,000 each and will be listed on the National Stock Exchange to provide liquidity.        
	The Rs 500-crore issue will be launched in two series. It will also have a greenshoe option to retain oversubscription up to Rs 500 crore (by issuing additional bonds), aggregating Rs 1,000 crore.         
	Bonds issued under the first series will have a call option, meaning the bank may recall the purchased bonds from investors.         
	Bonds under the second series will have a put option, which will enable the investors to redeem the bonds at the end of five years.         
	Series 1 bonds will have a maturity period of 10 years, while Series 2 bonds will have a 15-year term. However, there will be no lock-in period.        
	The interest rate will be decided at the time of issue of these bonds, a senior official of the bank said.        
	According to the official, the issue is likely to hit the markets by the end of October or in November.         
	Depending on the success of the offering, the SBI will consider follow-on issues, the official added.        
	Investment experts believe the interest rates on the bonds will be 8 per cent or more.         
	Infrastructure bonds also have a 10-year maturity and the IFCI issue last month offered a coupon rate between 7.85 per cent and 7.95 per cent. Since these infrastructure bonds offer tax benefits, the SBI will have to give a little higher interest to attract investors, said a bond market analyst with Enam Securities.

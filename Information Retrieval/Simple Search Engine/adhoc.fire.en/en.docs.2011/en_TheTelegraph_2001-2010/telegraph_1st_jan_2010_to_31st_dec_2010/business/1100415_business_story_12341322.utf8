The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | African coal for Corus soon
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      African coal for Corus soon
          SAMBIT SAHA                          In the pipeline                                  
	Calcutta, April 14: Tata Steel has started mining coal in Mozambique and hopes to feed its European operations under Corus from these fields by the end of this year.        
	The groundbreaking ceremony at the Tete province of the African country was attended by Mozambiques president Armando Emilio Guebuza, who officially inaugurated the Benga coal project yesterday.        
	Tata Steel owns 35 per cent of the project, while the rest is with Riversdale Mining, a Sydney-based company. However, the Tatas have a right to buy 40 per cent of the produce.        
	The mine is expected to excavate two million tonnes of coal in the initial stage. This will include about 1.7 million tonnes of good quality hard coking coal and 0.3 million tonnes of low ash thermal coal.        
	The company expects production to nearly quadruple in the next few years. The same level of production is likely to continue for 25 years at least.        
	Incidentally, Tata Steel also owns around 21 per cent in Riversdale, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.        
	Apart from the Tatas, Brazils CSN is also a big stakeowner in Riversdale with nearly 17 per cent equity.        
	While the Mozambique deal was concluded in the middle of 2007, Riversdale later found the coal reserves to be double that of its earlier estimate.        
	Tata-Riversdale will spend nearly $1 billion to develop the Benga coal project.        
	The production in Mozambique is going to start at a time when Tata Steel is already under pressure because of high iron ore and coking coal prices.        
	Iron ore prices are likely to go up by 70-80 per cent from this fiscal from $65 a tonne to $110 a tonne.         
	Similarly, coking coal prices are expected to touch $220 a tonne from $125 a tonne as the global economy turns around.        
	Corus buys its raw material from miners, unlike Tata Steels local operation that sources its entire iron ore supply and half of its coking coal from its own mines. Once the Benga coal project gets going, it will help Corus to cut cost.

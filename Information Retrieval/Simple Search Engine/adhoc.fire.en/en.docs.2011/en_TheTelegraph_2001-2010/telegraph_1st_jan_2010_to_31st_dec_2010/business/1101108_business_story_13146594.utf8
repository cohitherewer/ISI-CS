The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | No tax for heir 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      No tax for heir 
                                I am a senior citizen and pensioner. Are the maturity amounts of investments in NSC and Senior Citizen Savings Scheme taxable in the hands of the legal heir of a pensioner?          Ratan Chandra Bisvi, Calcutta
                      Any amount received either as a legal heir or as a nominee on the death of a person is not taxable in the hands of the recipient, as it is not an income at all. Therefore, there will be no liability of income tax on the legal heir or the nominee for the amount he/she receives from the investment of the pensioner.                                       Liability count      I am 60-years-old and a retired person. My gross annual income for financial year 2010-11 is around Rs 4 lakh after deductions under Chapter VIA of the Income Tax Act. I reside in a rented house and pay a rent of Rs 3,000 per month. What shall be my net tax liability?        Bishnu P. Gayen, Calcutta
                    If you have a pension income, you can claim house rent allowance. You shall have to pay tax on income in excess of Rs 1,60,000, which is the basic exemption limit. So, your tax liability will be on the income of           Rs 2,40,000 and the tax rate will be 10.3 per cent, including the education surcharge, that is Rs 24,720.                                  Time for pension hike      I am a former South Eastern Railway staff. My date of birth is September 1, 1931. I understand that the Sixth Pay Commission has recommended a 20 per cent hike in basic pension at the age of 80 years of the pensioners. Please clarify whether the increase is applicable upon attaining the age of 80 or upon completing the age of 80?        Samir Kumar Biswas, Calcutta
                    The Sixth Pay Commission headed by Justice B.N. SriKrishna had recommended that central government pensioners would get an additional 20 per cent of the basic pension on attaining the age of 80 years and the pension amount would be subsequently raised with the increase in age. That means you should start getting the increased pension from September 2011.

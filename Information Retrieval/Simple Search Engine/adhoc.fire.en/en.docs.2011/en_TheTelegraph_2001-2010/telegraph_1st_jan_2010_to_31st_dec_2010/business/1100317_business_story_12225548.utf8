The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance loses out to BP in Canada
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Reliance loses out to BP in Canada
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 16: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has been turned down twice this month by global companies that it was keen to acquire.        
	Value Creation Inc (VCI), a Canadian oil sands company for which RIL was reportedly ready to offer $2 billion, has found another suitor. BP Canada will take a controlling interest in Value Creation Incs mega Terre de Grace project spread over 290 square miles of land north of Calgary.        
	RIL declined to comment on the development.         
	According to reports, BP Canada offered $1.2 billion to acquire a controlling interest in the Terre de Grace project. However, BP Canada has not offered any financial details on the transaction. There were other global majors interested in Value Creation Inc, including Petro China.         
	Value Creation chairman and CEO Columba Yeung confirmed to the international media that the company had received several solicited and unsolicited offers of interest but the BP deal worked as it not only resolved the companys debt, but also allowed Value Creation to retain control over other projects in the region.        
	We agreed to have a vigorous programme to define (the reserves) before the final value is established, Yueng said. Along the way they will be contributing capital. However, the final amount is dependant on the outcome (of the drilling) ... But it will be a very significant capital investment.        
	The development comes as a major relief to Value Creation. A VCI subsidiary BA Energy Inc  where VCI is the majority shareholder  had approached bankruptcy courts last year as it was finding it difficult to repay a loan to the parent.        
	This partnership blends a strong asset, world-class operator, high calibre talents and market security, besides financial stability, said Yeung in a statement to the global media.        
	RIL, which has been keen to expand its global footprint, was interested in Value Creation Inc as the company would not only offer access to a vast acreage of oil sands and earth but also give the Indian company technology to extract oil from sands and upgrade bitumen economically.        
	The Mukesh Ambani-led company has raised a substantial amount of cash by selling its treasury stock in recent months.         
	However, it will continue its pursuit for global assets. Sources said that RIL was on the lookout for shale assets in North America that they term as new emerging technology.         
	That may be so but in early March Reliance had to bow out of the race for Dutch petrochemicals company LyondellBasell. A disclosure statement filed at the bankruptcy court in the southern district of New York by the Lyondell management revealed that the company thought that its own restructuring plan was more valuable than a $14.5 billion offer by RIL.

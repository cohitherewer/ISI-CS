The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Haldia Petro gets makeover
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Haldia Petro gets makeover
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 11: Haldia Petrochemicals capacity expansion project is nearing completion, and the company is likely to start production over the weekend.        
	Once the operations get fully stabilised within a month, the companys polymer making capacity will increase by a third.        
	HPL has invested close to Rs 1,200 crore in Project Supermax against an initial estimate of Rs 675 crore, made three years ago.        
	The company will get the full benefit of the additional capacity from the next fiscal. HPL may clock a turnover of Rs 12,000-13,000 crore if the present price level remains.        
	The margin is nothing exceptional, but it will make money at the present price, a state government official said.        
	After work on the project started on October 30, when the plant took a planned shutdown, HPL faced an unprecedented labour trouble leading to a four-day strike.         
	It destabilised the expansion work and led to a substantial loss. HPL had set January 15 as the date to resume production. Instead, it will start production a month later, irking The Chatterjee Group (TCG), a shareholder of the company. Purnendu Chatterjee, chairman of TCG, is believed to have voiced his displeasure at the delay.         
	He had visited the plant with Subrata Gupta, managing director of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation.        
	The state government and TCG, the two main promoters of HPL, are engaged in a legal battle for the control of the company.        
	The HPL management, backed by the state government, had said the delay was not unusual given the complexity of the job.

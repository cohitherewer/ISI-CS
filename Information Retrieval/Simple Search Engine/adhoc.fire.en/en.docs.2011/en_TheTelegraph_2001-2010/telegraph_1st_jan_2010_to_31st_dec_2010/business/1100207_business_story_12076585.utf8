          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 6: Weary stock investors got a respite during Saturdays special trading session when overnight gains on Wall Street saw equities ending in positive territory.         
	The sensex ended nearly 125 points higher at 15915.65 and the broader Nifty by 38.60 points, a day after both these indices were rattled by worries on European sovereign debt and the recovery in the US.        
	In the special 90-minute trading session held by the stock exchanges to test NSEs upgraded trading system, the participation was low with foreign institutional investors largely absent.         
	On the BSE, the benchmark index opened marginally higher at 15807.75 and then traded in a tight range. It was only towards the close of the session that the index consolidated its gains and it subsequently closed at 15915.65, a gain of 124.72 points or 0.79 per cent over the last close.         
	Cautious analysts feel short-covering was also responsible for the positive close.         
	They said markets were likely to remain under pressure over the next few days and investors would watch for news coming from Europe.

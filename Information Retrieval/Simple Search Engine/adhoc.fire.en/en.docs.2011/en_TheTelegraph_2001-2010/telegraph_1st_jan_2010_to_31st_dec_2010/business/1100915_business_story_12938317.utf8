                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mallya firm buys Pioneer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 14: United Spirits Ltd, part of Vijay Mallyas UB Group, is acquiring a majority stake in Pioneer Distilleries Ltd in a bid to raise its distillation capacity.         
	It will initially buy 54.69 per cent of Pioneer Distilleries (PDL) at a price of Rs 101 per share and subsequently come out with an open offer.        
	United Spirits Ltd (USL) said it would acquire over 73.22 lakh shares of Pioneer Distilleries, representing 54.69 per cent of its equity capital, for a total consideration of nearly Rs 74 crore. The price of Rs 101 per share, marks a premium of 40 per cent to the market price of PDL.         
	In accordance with the Sebi regulations, United Spirits will make an open offer for the acquisition of nearly 27 lakh shares, representing 20 per cent of PDL. The proposal to acquire this stake was approved by the board of directors of USL today, and the company had executed a share purchase agreement with the existing promoters of PDL.        
	Pioneer Distilleries has a 160 kilo litres per day spirit facility located in Maharashtra. This includes a 100 kilo litres per day plant that uses molasses as feedstock and a 60 kilo litres per day plant under commissioning which uses grain as input. PDL has also received a letter of intent for making Indian Made Foreign Liquor from grain.        
	With this acquisition, USLs in-house capacity of primary spirit distillation is slated to go up to nearly 23 per cent of its requirement and thus provide further supply side security. Shoring up of the primary distillation capacity will enable USL to gain a better control over the upstream supplies of extra neutral alcohol, which is the primary ingredient in the manufacture of Indian Made Foreign Liquor. Earlier in this fiscal, USL had acquired a 40 kilo litres per day facility through the acquisition of Tern Distilleries in Andhra Pradesh.

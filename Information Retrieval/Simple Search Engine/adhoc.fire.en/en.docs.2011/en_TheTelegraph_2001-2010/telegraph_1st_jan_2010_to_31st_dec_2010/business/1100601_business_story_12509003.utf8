          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 31: McLeod Russel India Ltd has set a target to treble its turnover to Rs 3,000 crore and double production capacity to nearly 200 million kg over the next five years, managing director Aditya Khaitan said here today.        
	Global black tea production is around 2 billion kg per annum. McLeod Russel produces about 4 per cent of that. Our target is to double this in five years, he said.         
	The company is on the lookout for acquisitions in Africa and India. We will like to consolidate and grow mainly in India and Africa, he said.        
	The company expects its total output during this fiscal to be at 102 million kg and pegs exports at 50 million kg.         
	The firm may also raise prices by Rs 15 per kg in 2010-11.        
	During 2010-11 our total output will increase considerably to 102 million kg from 81.5 million kg last year, mainly on account of the contribution from Ugandan operations amounting to 16.5 million kg, Khaitan said.         
	The Indian and Vietnam operations will contribute around 80 million kg and 5.5 million kg, respectively.         
	According to Khaitan, the company, which started the previous fiscal with a debt of Rs 415 crore, has reduced it by Rs 135 crore to Rs 280 crore.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      StanChart sets listing price at Rs 104
                          Way to the bourses                    
	Mumbai, May 30 (Agencies): British banking major Standard Chartered today said it had fixed the price of its Rs 2,490-crore issue of Indian depository receipts at Rs 104 apiece, at the lower range of the Rs 100-115 price band.        
	The lender, the oldest foreign bank in the country, had come out with a public offer of 24 crore IDRs, including the 3.6 crore receipts reserved for anchor investors.         
	The IDRs are expected to be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange by June 11.        
	Every 10 IDR will represent one Standard Chartered ordinary share. These shares will be allotted on or around June 7, the bank said.        
	The issue, which opened for subscription from May 25-28, was oversubscribed 2.2 times amid good demand from institutional investors, though the response from retail investors was lukewarm.        
	The response to the IDR offer has been excellent. We have achieved a book that is well over two times covered despite market volatility. The IDR listing will further build on our brand presence in India, one of our key markets, Richard Meddings, group finance director of Standard Chartered, said.        
	The offer, which is the countrys first IDR issue, received a total demand for 44.68 crore receipts against 20.4 crore units on offer, thereby getting subscribed over two times.        
	Though the issue generated a relatively small demand in the first three days of the offer, the final day of the flotation saw healthy participation from both institutional and retail investors.        
	An IDR represents ownership in shares of a foreign company. An IDR is bought and sold just like a regular stock. The bank is giving a special 5 per cent discount to retail investors and employees.        
	Standard Chartered Bank is the countrys largest and the oldest foreign bank. It opened its first branch in April, 1858, in Calcutta.         
	India accounted for over 20 per cent of the banks profit before tax in 2009.         
	Earlier, the emerging markets-focused bank has said the offering was aimed more at building its brand and presence in its second-largest market than about raising funds.

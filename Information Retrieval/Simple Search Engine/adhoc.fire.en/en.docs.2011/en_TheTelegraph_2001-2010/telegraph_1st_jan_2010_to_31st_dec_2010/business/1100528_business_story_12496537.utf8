	Mumbai, May 27: Tata Motors today beat Street estimates to post a net profit of Rs 2,571.06 crore for the year ended March 31 as sales picked up, the company hiked prices and raised funds by divesting stake in a subsidiary.        
	Tata Motors had suffered a net loss of Rs 2,505.25 crore in 2008-09.         
	The company earned Rs 1,057.92 crore by divesting its 20 per cent stake in Telco Construction Equipment Company on March 30, beefing up its other income for the year. Consolidated income grew 30.5 per cent to Rs 92,519.25 crore from Rs 70,880.95 crore in the previous year.         
	The year was significant for the vehicle maker as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)  British brands that Tata Motors acquired in 2008  witnessed a turnaround with automobile sales picking up in an improved market environment. Pre-tax profit from JLR business in 2009-10 was 32 million. JLRs wholesale volume grew 16 per cent. Land Rover sales in the UK were up 25 per cent year on year.         
	In India, the companys commercial vehicle sales rose 41 per cent to 3,73,842 units. The sale of passenger vehicles, including Fiat, Jaguar and Land Rover, in the country grew 25 per cent to 2,60,020 units. Total vehicle sales stood at 6,67,971 units against 5,06,421 units a year ago.         
	Volume recovery led by product launches and continued growth in the existing portfolio, continued focus on cost efficiencies and price increase undertaken to combat strengthening commodity prices, aided the company to grow realisations and deliver double-digit operating margin of 11.74 per cent, a company statement said.        
	Challenges, however, continue to persist. Tata Motors chief financial officer C. Ramakrishnan said, We will face challenges ahead. In JLR, we may encounter currency volatility and the fallout of the uncertainty in Europe.        
	In India, there are bound to be competitive pressures. We have plans to counter these challenges by strengthening our leadership team, continuing to transform our product launches and seeking long-term growth in emerging markets, he added.        
	The annual results include earnings of its subsidiaries and units such as Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co, Tata Technologies and Telco Construction Equipment.

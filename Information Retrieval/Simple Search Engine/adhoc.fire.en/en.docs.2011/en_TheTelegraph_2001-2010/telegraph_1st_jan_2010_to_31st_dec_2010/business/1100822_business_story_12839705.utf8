	New Delhi, Aug. 21: Life insurance companies are focussing on higher efficiency, more renewals and traditional products to overcome the pressure on margins they may face after the changes in the cost structure of Ulips from September.        
	An important area to focus will be to increase efficiency in sales, distribution and back-end operations to optimise the current cost structure. This is crucial to be able to operate within the new limits on charges for Ulips, Mayank Bathwal, chief financial officer of Birla Sun Life Insurance, told The Telegraph.        
	In July, the insurance regulator put a limit on the amount that insurers can charge from Ulip policyholders. This is expected to affect private insurers margin from new businesses.        
	We are planning to raise the commission on renewals by up to 100 per cent to encourage persistency, said an executive of a private insurance firm, adding that acquisition cost cannot be recovered unless the policies are retained for longer duration.

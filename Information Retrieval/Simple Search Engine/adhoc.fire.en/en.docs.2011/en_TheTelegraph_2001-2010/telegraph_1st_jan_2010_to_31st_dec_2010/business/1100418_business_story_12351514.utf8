          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 17: The railways are considering allowing private players to lay railway lines connecting coal and iron ore mines with ports. The draft policy will be formulated soon, sources said. There are no private railway lines in the country and if such a proposal is approved, it will give a boost to public-private partnership in railways.        
	The railways are also considering allowing private funding for the dedicated freight corridor in the east. The World Bank is supposed to fund a part of it. There are certain sections which the multilateral funding agency will not cover. Private funding is being considered for that, source said.        
	Meanwhile, the railways had an interactive session to discuss the proposed automobile and ancillary hubs, development of private freight terminals and laying of rail tracks with private participation.

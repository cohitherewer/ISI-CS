	Mumbai, July 16: Nikhil Gandhi of SKIL Infrastructure is reported to be in talks to pick up a strategic stake in Everonn Education Ltd  a Chennai-based company specialising in virtual classrooms. The buzz is that Gandhi may come out with an open offer after picking up the stake.        
	The Everonn stock surged over 13 per cent on the speculation that swirled the markets.The rumours were fanned by an Everonn communication to the bourses, which said its board of directors would meet on Monday to consider and approve the issue of redeemable optionally convertible debentures to persons not forming part of promoter/promoter group.        
	Everonn officials could not be reached for comment on the developments.        
	On the BSE, the Everonn scrip rose Rs 70.15 to Rs 598.75 after touching a new 52-week high of Rs 613.40. The counter also witnessed transactions of nearly 30 lakh shares. Gandhi, who is the chairman of SKIL Infrastructure (formerly Sea King Infrastructure), will first pick up more than 15 per cent in Everonn and later make an open offer to acquire an additional 20 per cent.         
	The market talk is that the open offer will be made at a price of around Rs 600 per share. Although the vehicle that is likely to be used by Gandhi could not be ascertained, market circles said the stake purchase was likely to be routed through SKIL Infrastructure, which incidentally had been looking to enter the education space. SKIL Infrastructure is the promoter firm of Pipavav Shipyard and also develops other infrastructure projects such as ports.         
	Everonn, an education company, provides its services through VSAT-enabled virtual and interactive classrooms and other means.

	Washington, Aug. 5 (PTI): The US is in touch with India, the UAE and Saudi Arabia to understand their concerns over the security features of BlackBerry with these countries seeking greater access to messaging data.         
	There are issues attached to freedom of information, the flow of information, the use of technology. We are in touch with these governments, US state department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.         
	Were going to try to understand what their concerns are, the nature of the ongoing negotiations that they have with this particular company. There are number of countries that are in the midst of these negotiations and well see what the implications are, Crowley said.        
	The Indian government has asked Canada-based firm Research in Motion to allow it to monitor BlackBerry services, citing security concerns.         
	Saudi Arabia has ordered local cellphone providers to halt the BlackBerry service, saying it failed to meet regulatory requirements.         
	The UAE has also decided to suspend some BlackBerry services from October 11 as the company failed to bring its operations in line with local telecom regulations.                           
	Crowley said there are legitimate security concerns attached to certain technologies and the flow of information around the world. We understand those concerns. We want to best understand whats behind those concerns.         
	At the same time, we do support the flow of information, the available technology which does empower people. We are in touch, given that this issue has come up in a variety of countries, we are reaching out to those countries  have a discussion to understand the nature of their concerns and see if we can find solutions, he said. Noting that it is about not only the free flow of information, but its the availability of technology, he said the cell phone in its various iterations has, in fact, opened up a new world of information to people around the world. Devices like a cell phone can be empowering in terms of providing market information, details on crops  disease-resistant crops, and how people in small communities in the middle of Africa can benefit from the information thats now widely available around the world, Crowley said.        
	So it is not about any one device. Its not about any one network. Were trying to see how we can make these technologies more broadly available and they can be utilised in a variety of different ways to help build institutions, accountability, and other trends in key countries, he said.

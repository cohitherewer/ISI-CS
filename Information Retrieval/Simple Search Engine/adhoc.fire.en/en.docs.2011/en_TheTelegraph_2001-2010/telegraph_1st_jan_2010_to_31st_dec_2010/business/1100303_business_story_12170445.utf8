The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Five-man panel to pick next HPL chief
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Five-man panel to pick next HPL chief
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Strategic move                                  
	Calcutta, March 2: Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL) managing director Swapan Bhowmik will be in charge of the company till a new executive is found.        
	The company board, which met in Mumbai today, set up a five-member search committee to look for a new person to head HPL. The panel is expected to finalise its choice within three months.        
	The committee will be headed by chairman Tarun Das. Other members include Purnendu Chatterjee, chairman of The Chatterjee Group (TCG) and a principal promoter of HPL, and Bengal industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen.        
	Bhowmiks three-year extension as the managing director comes to an end on March 31, 2010.        
	TCG had in the past opposed the management style of Bhowmik and disputed his position as director on the HPL board. It had also opposed the extension given to him in 2007.        
	Bhowmik, however, had the support of the Bengal government, the leading shareholder of HPL.         
	TCG and the state government are locked in a legal tussle over the ownership of the company in the Supreme Court.        
	Bhowmiks extension post March 31 would be on an ad hoc basis. It is near certain that Bhowmik will retire, but only when a new chief executive is found.         
	TCG had expressed its displeasure on why the board did not start looking for a replacement earlier as Bhowmiks term was coming to an end.        
	However, the state nominees on the board reportedly said the company was in the midst of a major expansion programme and it would not have been prudent to destabilise the management.        
	In all likelihood, the new candidate will be an outsider. There is hardly a chance of anyone being elevated from within the companys ranks. Bhowmik had joined the company as president (polymer) in 2001.

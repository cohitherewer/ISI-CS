	Mumbai, Oct. 15: Higher cost of deposits may force the State Bank of India to raise its lending rates, chairman .P. Bhatt said today. The countrys largest bank is likely to up the base rate at its next review.         
	Recently, when many banks had raised their base rates as the Reserve Bank of India raised key short-term rates in its mid-quarter review, the SBI was among the few that kept it unchanged at 7.50 per cent.         
	Banks switched over to the base rate regime from July 1, following which loans disbursed after this date were benchmarked against the new system. The base rate is reviewed every quarter.         
	Speaking to reporters after announcing the launch of SBIs bond issue, Bhatt said while the bank fixed this new benchmark rate based on cost of deposits, this cost had begun to inch up. He said the bank did not hike its base rate early this month as cost of deposits did not warrant an increase. However, with deposits now turning expensive, the base rate might have to be revised upwards.         
	On lending rates, Bhatt said the bank might also hike its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR). In August this year, the bank had hiked this rate by half a percentage point.         
	They (lending rates) were raised about two months ago. There has been a huge amount of pressure on liquidity... its not just getting tighter, but liquidity has become more volatile in the system. I think the interest rates will go up on the lending side, he said. BPLR is for lenders who have taken loans prior to July and not switched over to base rate.        
	The SBI today said it expected to launch its Rs 20,000-crore rights before the culmination of this fiscal as only a few issues needed to be ironed out with the government.        
	We will be raising up to Rs 20,000 crore through the rights issue. The map has to be put in place properly. We have had a discussion with the government on it, Bhatt said.                          
	Bhatt said he was hopeful of a final decision on the issue by December-end.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Sept. 4: The Andhra Pradesh government today signed a concession agreement with L amp;T to develop the Rs 12,132-crore Hyderabad metro rail project under public-private partnership.        
	This would be the first project with the single-largest investment in Andhra Pradesh, chief minister K. Rosaiah said, as T.S. Appa Rao, state principal secretary (municipal administration), and V.B. Gadgil, managing director of L amp;T Hyderabad Metro Rail Pvt Ltd, signed the agreement this evening.        
	The Andhra Pradesh government awarded the Hyderabad metro project to Larsen and Toubro on August 4, after the $9.8-billion company emerged as the lowest bidder, seeking only Rs 1,458 crore as viability gap funding (12 per cent of project cost of Rs 12,132 crore) and a lease period of 35 years with a clause for extension of another 25 years.        
	The amount for the viability gap funding will be released by the Centre, while the Andhra government will spend Rs 1,980 crore to acquire 204 acres at two places in Hyderabad and to offer relief and rehabilitation to the affected people.        
	The state will release Rs 500 crore as the first installment in the current fiscal to acquire the required land for the project.        
	L amp;T Hyderabad Metro Rail Private Limited is the special purpose vehicle formed by L amp;T to execute the project on a design, finance, build, operate and transfer basis.

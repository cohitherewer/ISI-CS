  - IPO, expansion keep Manganese Ore on its toes        OUR BUREAU                          MOILs independent director Sanjeeva Narayan (left) and director (commercial) A.K. Mehra in Calcutta on Wednesday to announce the companys entry into the capital market. (PTI)                                        
	Calcutta/New Delhi, Nov. 24: Manganese Ore India Ltd (MOIL), which will enter the capital market on Friday with its IPO, is scouting for an overseas acquisition.         
	G.P. Kundargi, MOILs director (production and planning), said a top management team had visited Turkey and Indonesia to look for a mine with good grade of manganese ore.         
	MOIL, which produces 50 per cent of the countrys manganese ore, is looking for a foreign asset with an output of 2 lakh tonnes per annum or more. A mine with a smaller production capacity would not merit the setting up of an establishment abroad, Kundargi said.        
	However, most mines in Turkey and Indonesia are smaller in size, he added.        
	Gabon, a central African state, is also on the menu.         
	We have not yet earmarked any fund for overseas acquisition, Kundargi said.        
	The state-run firm will spend Rs 1,000 crore to expand its existing mines and develop its joint ventures with SAIL and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd at Bhilai and Visakhapatnam, respectively.        
	MOIL produces 1.1 million tonnes (mt) of manganese ore and plans to increase it to 1.5mt in the next five years. For this, the company has earmarked a capital expenditure of Rs 986 crore.         
	Domestic demand for manganese ore is expected to grow to 45 lakh tonnes by 2012 from 24 lakh tonnes now, with steel production estimated to increase to 125mt from 65mt.        
	In 2012, the countrys steel capacity will expand to 120 million tonnes, so manganese ore needed would be 4.5-5 million tonnes. At that time, there might be a deficit, MOIL chairman K.J. Singh told reporters in New Delhi.        
	The Nagpur-based firm is looking at Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra for setting up wind energy farms. The company has two such farms producing 20MW electricity.        
	MP project        
	Six months ago, the company has been allocated 841.71 hectares in Madhya Pradesh.         
	This is 30 per cent of our existing mining area of 1,800 hectares, Kundargi said. Recently, we had applied for a prospecting licence for the area. Once we get it, we shall approach for environment and forest clearances.         
	IPO status        
	The Manganese Ore IPO with a price band of Rs 340-375 a share is expected to raise up to Rs 1,238 crore.         
	MOIL will be the first PSU to come out with a public offering where retail investors can invest up to Rs 2 lakh. Retail investors and employees will get a 5 per cent discount.        
	The Centre will dilute a 10 per cent stake, while the Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra governments will shed 5 per cent each through the offer that closes on December 1.        
	Disinvestment secretary Sumit Bose said in New Delhi that the issue had been priced after taking into account a number of factors, including the strength of the company, its management and assessment of its peer firms.        
	On bringing in anchor investors, Bose said, We are not going for anchor investors in this issue. There is adequate demand from FIIs.        
	Steel secretary Pradeep Kumar Misra said MOIL was likely to be listed by December 13. Tentative date for listing will be 10-12 days after the issue closes, Misra said, adding that the market for MOIL is fairly assured.        
	MOILs turnover in the first half of this fiscal was Rs 635 crore compared with Rs 430 crore a year ago.         
	Profit after tax for the first half stood at Rs 330 crore against Rs 201 crore in the year-ago period.

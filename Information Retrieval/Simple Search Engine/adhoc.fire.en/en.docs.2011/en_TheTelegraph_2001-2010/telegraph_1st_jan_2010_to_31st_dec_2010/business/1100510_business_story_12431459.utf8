The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pressure remains on Anil group stocks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Pressure remains on Anil group stocks
          VIVEK NAIR                                            
	Mumbai, May 9: Shareholders of Reliance Natural Resources Ltd, Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure  three Anil Ambani group firms  may have to brace themselves for more pain this week.        
	On Friday, after the Supreme Court ruled against Anil in the gas case against brother Mukesh, the RNRL share tanked nearly 23 per cent to Rs 52.75. Reliance Power ended up with a loss of around 9 per cent at Rs 140.10, while Reliance Infrastructure fell 7 per cent to Rs 979.70.         
	RNRL and RPower got hammered as they were directly impacted by the apex court ruling that denied them KG gas at a cheap rate of $2.34 per million British thermal unit.        
	The decline in Reliance Infrastructure was on account of its 45 per cent holding in RPower.        
	Market experts said the three stocks might see further depreciation because of the negative impact of the judgment. RPower and Reliance Infrastructure could see a drop of 5-10 per cent from their current levels. The decline will be much more in RNRL.        
	Since April, shares of RNRL had climbed nearly 17 per cent on hopes of a favourable verdict. Apart from domestic investors, institutions had also bought into the stock.        
	Now that the judgment has gone against the company, it will face intense pressure over the short term. We may see more institutions making an exit and panic sales from retail investors, a research head from a prominent brokerage told The Telegraph.         
	The markets will wait for the details of the negotiations that is to take place between RNRL and Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries. The uncertainty over the outcome of the talks will drag down the stock, the research head added.        
	The verdict, he observed, has also raised fears of RNRL being reduced to a shell company. Questions are being raised about its business model.         
	RNRLs main operation involves sourcing gas from RIL and supplying it to the gas-based power generation units of the group companies. However, the Supreme Court ruling that gives the government the sole right to fix the price of gas as well as the quantity and the tenure of the supply will have a major impact on the financial health of RNRL, analysts said.        
	The top management of RNRL may have to come out with some statement on the business model to assuage fears. Otherwise, the share will gradually see its value coming down, a broker who did not wish to be identified said.        
	In RPower, uncertainty over the Dadri power project will put the stock under pressure. The generation cost of the project is likely to escalate, while doubts over gas supply remain.         
	Some analysts said the company would either have to shift the project or put it on hold; others said that it might be turned into a coal-based unit.

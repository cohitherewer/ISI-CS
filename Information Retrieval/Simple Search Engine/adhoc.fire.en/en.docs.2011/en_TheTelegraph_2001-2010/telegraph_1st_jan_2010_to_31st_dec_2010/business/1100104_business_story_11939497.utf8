          SOUNAK MITRA                          Tech move                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 3: Bengal is looking for a developer to set up IT infrastructure on land that belonged to the scam-hit Satyam Computer Services.        
	The land, in Salt Lakes Sector-V, is spread over 2.77 acres and was returned to the state by Satyams new owner the Mahindras in November.        
	On December 24, West Bengal Electronics Industry Development Corporation Ltd (Webel)  the nodal agency of the Bengal government for developing information technology amp; ITeS industries  floated a tender inviting bids for sub-leasing a plot of approximately 2.77 acres at plot no. G-2, block GP, SectorV, Bidhannagar, Calcutta to establish electronics, IT amp; ITeS industries.        
	The land was handed over when Satyam was still under the Rajus.         
	The memorandum of understanding was signed in the presence of Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the then Satyam chairman Ramalinga Raju in Hyderabad on January 30, 2004. The foundation stone for the project was laid on February 24, 2006.         
	Almost a year ago, on January 7, 2008, Raju admitted to a more than Rs 7,000-crore fraud in Satyam. The Indian government was forced to take over the affairs of the company and had put the company up for sale.         
	On April 13, Tech Mahindra outbid Larsen amp; Toubro and US billionaire Wilber Ross to become the owners of Satyam, which was subsequently renamed Mahindra Satyam.        
	The Bengal plot was unused for four years. In November, the Mahindras expressed their unwillingness to develop the centre and returned the plot in November.        
	According to the tender document, the total buildable area on the site would be, approximately 712,000 square feet. The last date of submission of the request for proposal is January 21.        
	We have floated the tender and are waiting for the responses from the developers. Lets see what happens, state IT minister Debesh Das said. Webel managing director Tamal Dasgupta could not be reached for comments.        
	At the time of returning the land, a Mahindra Satyam spokesperson had said, The Calcutta pull-out was inevitable as the company is going through a phase of consolidating infrastructure. Rather than hold on to something it knows it cant find a use for, the company did the best thing by returning the land to the Bengal government so that the plot can be given to someone who needs it.        
	Besides, Tech Mahindra is building its own campus within Jagmohan Dalmiyas IT SEZ at Bantala.         
	Satyam had originally announced that the Salt Lake facility would employ 2,000 associates.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Singh in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, May 19: DP World has asked the state and the Centre to clear the hurdles in developing a container port at Kulpi in the South 24-Parganas.        
	Anil Singh, country head of the Dubai-based firm that operates a large number of ports across the globe, said it was ready with the money.        
	It has been a long time. I am here to see what is happening. We need traction, Singh, who visited the site today, said.        
	DP World is the largest shareholder in Bengal Port, a joint venture with Keventer, owned by city-based industrialist Mahendra Jalan.        
	Work on the project was stalled even as a concession agreement was signed with the state government in 2004 after getting clearance from the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT).        
	CPT has asked for a high share for dredging the river Hooghly. Bengal Port was earlier ready to share the cost to maintain the channel up to its port. But now it feels accepting the CPT demand would make its operations financially unviable. Without the CPT consent, no port can operate on the river.        
	Moreover, the delay in appointing a full time chairman for CPT over the last one year has not helped the situation either.        
	Singh said he expected the state to provide a four-lane expressway to connect the port. He also hoped for rail connectivity.         
	DP World will invest $350 million to build the port, which can carry 1.2 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit, which is the standard for measuring container size, ship capacity and volume) a year. There will be a special economic zone adjacent to it.

	Calcutta, Feb. 18: Kumar Mangalam Birla is not willing to oblige his grandfather Basant K. Birla just as yet.        
	The chairman of the AV Birla group today said he did not have any plan to join the boards of Kesoram Industries and Century Enka as of now.         
	Kumar will inherit Kesoram, the BK Birla group flagship, and Century Enka from his grandfather, who had publicly expressed his eagerness to hand over these companies.        
	BK Babu, as he is affectionately called in the industry circle, celebrated his 90th birthday last month. He is the chairman of all group companies and takes active interest in them.         
	He has been coaxing Kumar to join the boards of Kesoram and Enka for the last few years.        
	Kumar says I should continue as long as possible, B.K Birla had said last year.        
	However, Kumar Birla today reiterated his plan to turn down the offer.         
	I dont have plans to join them, he clarified on the sidelines of the annual conference of the National Institute of Personnel Management.         
	Kumar had joined the board of Century Textiles, the second largest company of the BK Birla group, in 2006. He is set to inherit the company as well.

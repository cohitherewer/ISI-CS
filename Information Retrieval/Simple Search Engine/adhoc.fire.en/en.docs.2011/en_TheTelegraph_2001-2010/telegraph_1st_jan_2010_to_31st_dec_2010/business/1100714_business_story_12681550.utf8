                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Infosys upsets market mood
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 13: Infosys Ltd, the countrys second largest software maker, disappointed the Street today when it reported a 2.4 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 1,488 crore in the first quarter ended June 30 against Rs 1,525 crore in the same quarter a year ago.        
	Net profits fell 7 per cent over the previous quarter ended March 31.        
	The stock market had turned fiercely bullish in the week ahead of the Infosys results in the hope that the infotech giant would stun the markets with robust numbers even though it had forecast a tough quarter in its guidance three months ago.        
	The stock, which had climbed to a 52-week high on Monday, plunged over 3 per cent in mid-morning trades and dragged down other IT players such as Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro. Infosys closed 3.44 per cent lower on the Bombay Stock Exchange at Rs 2,795.30 on Tuesday.         
	The company reported a 13.3 per cent year-on-year growth in total revenues at Rs 6,198 crore.        
	The Infosys management soothed investors concerns over the weak profit numbers by giving a strong guidance for the second quarter. It said income in the next quarter ending September was expected to surge 18.6 per cent to Rs 6,626 crore.        
	It also revised guidance for the full year, which signalled that the company expected to return to the high growth path. It anticipated that the full years income in 2010-11 would be in the range of Rs 26,441 crore to Rs 26,885, while the earnings per share would hover between Rs 112.21 and Rs 116.73.        
	JPMorgan said the Infosys margins were below expectations and attributed pricing pressures and a wage hike as the reasons for the wilting margins.        
	The company fared well on the topline but profit after tax was badly hit. A high tax rate for the current year and an annual wage hike impacted margins, said Vaibhav Agarwal, vice-president (research) of Angel Broking.        
	While the global environment remains uncertain, we continue to see greater demand for services from our clients. The challenge for the industry is to enhance the investment to grow the business, given the uncertainty in the environment, said Infosys managing director and CEO S. Gopalakrishnan.        
	The company also continues to have concerns on currency fluctuations. The volatile currency environment is a concern for the industry, said Infosys chief financial officer V. Balakrishnan.         
	North America remained the biggest market and accounted for 67.3 per cent of the total revenues. Europe  which is going through a deep financial crisis  came next with a 20.3 per cent revenue share. The company earns only 1.7 per cent of its revenues from India.        
	The company with its headquarters in Bangalore is sitting on a cash mountain, which swelled 33 per cent to Rs 16,005 crore.         
	During the quarter, Infosys saw a high attrition rate of 15.8 per cent compared with 13.4 per cent in the previous quarter and 11.1 per cent in the same period of last year.        
	With the market opening up, attrition has increased this quarter. We have taken several steps to reduce attrition, including a compensation hike and are enhancing lateral hiring, said Infosys head-HRD and education and research T.V. Mohandas Pai. In the first quarter of 2010-11, the company saw a gross addition of 8,859 employees, while the number for net addition stood at 1,026 implying that 7,833 employees had quit the company.        
	Infosys is still cautious on business from Europe and analysts hope that the management will use other levers to bolster business.         
	The Infosys management expects to focus on business from emerging economies and has already established a steady stream of business from West Asia and Asia-Pacific, said a company statement. The company added 38 new clients during the quarter compared with 27 in the year ago period.         
	The company said the number of clients who had yielded revenues of over $100 million in the last 12 months had risen to 8 from 4 a year ago. In the previous quarter, there were 6 clients who were clubbed in the premier group of clients.

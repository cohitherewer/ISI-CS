          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 15: Home loan financier HDFC today ratcheted up the battle over teaser rate loans by offering an attractive 8.25 per cent fixed interest rate in the first year and 9 per cent in the second.        
	From the third year onwards, a floating rate of interest will kick in that will be linked to its prime lending rate.        
	HDFCs dual rate scheme takes the battle to the State Bank of India (SBI), which extended its teaser rate loan by one month till April 30.        
	The home loan financier said it would offer a fixed interest rate of 8.25 per cent on all loans up to March 31, 2011.         
	Called Dual Rate Product-2, the special offer is applicable to all new home loan customers who apply before April 30 and take at least a part disbursement before June 30. Interestingly, while the fixed rate will remain the same irrespective of the loan amount, the floating rate will vary with the loan amount.        
	The floating rate from the third year will be different for two separate slabs. While loans up to Rs 30 lakh will have an interest rate of 9 per cent, those above Rs 30 lakh based on the current prime lending rate (PLR) will be 9.25 per cent.        
	HDFCs special scheme comes days after the SBI extended its teaser home loan plan till April 30.         
	Although the countrys largest bank did so, loans up to Rs 50 lakh have become costlier as the bank brought down the band to BPLR minus 1.75 per cent from BPLR minus 2.75 per cent in its earlier scheme.        
	Observers now contend that in terms of the effective rate that the customer has to pay over the loan period, HDFC is the most economical compared with its competitors. They added that the effective rate a customer has to pay in HDFCs dual rate home loan product varies between 8.9 to 9.1 per cent (on various loan amounts) compared with 9.35 per cent in the case of the SBI.        
	Renu Sud Karnad, managing director of HDFC Ltd, explained that while the response to the earlier dual rate scheme was strong, the corporations cost of funds permitted it to offer a lower initial fixed rate and, therefore, the DRHL-2 was introduced.        
	Customers applying for the loan before April 30 can pay a fixed rate of 8.25 per cent up to March 31, 2011, 9 per cent for the period between April 1, 2011 and March 31, 2012. For the balance term, the applicable floating rate will apply.        
	HDFC said the existing floating rate product continues without any change. Here the rates applicable are 8.75 per cent for loans up to Rs 30 lakh, 9 per cent for loans between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 50 lakh and 9.25 per cent for loans of Rs 50 lakh and above.        
	While the fixed rate will remain the same irrespective of the loan amount, the floating rate will have two slabs: loans up to Rs 30 lakh where the rate will be 9 per cent and above Rs 30 lakh where the rate will be 9.25 per cent.        
	Our effective rate over a 15-to-20-year term is very attractive and is much better than other large players in the market offering similar products, HDFC added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      New innings                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: State-owned Power Finance Corporation Ltd (PFC) plans to foray into banking, encouraged by the Reserve Bank of Indias discussion paper on new private banks.         
	PFC  a non-banking financial company (NBFC)  is in the process of appointing consultants.         
	Consultants will be appointed shortly. They will look at the possibility of converting PFC into a bank, a senior official said.        
	The official said PFC was keen on banking as growth prospects in infrastructure would not be attractive after about two decades.        
	PFC was set up in July 1986 as a financial institution for the development of power and its associated sectors.         
	The entity became a public financial institution in 1990 under the Companies Act, 1956. It was registered as an NBFC by the apex bank.        
	Analysts said the NBFCs regulated by the RBI would have an edge over industrial houses in getting banking licences.         
	The RBIs discussion paper on new private banks said, Since NBFCs are already regulated by the RBI and have a track record, the fit and proper concerns could be addressed more easily.         
	The NBFC model, particularly for those in lending activities, has been successful in expanding the reach of the financial system and, thus, by converting to banks, this model could be scaled up to better leverage the benefits and achieve the objective of financial inclusion, it said.        
	The RBI wants to know whether industrial and business houses could be allowed to promote banks, and if NBFCs could be permitted to convert into or promote banks.         
	The central bank has also sought feedback on the business model for new banks by the end of the next month.        
	Officials said the Navratna firms entry into banking would open up the access to cheap credit for core projects.        
	The power sector has huge funding requirements. In the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12), the private sector will contribute to 28 per cent of capacity addition; in the Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-17), its contribution will be 63 per cent.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Error in connection                                  
	New Delhi, March 24: Telecom operators who have sourced equipment from Chinese manufacturers are planning to buy from other foreign or domestic players as strict security rules of the department of telecom (DoT) are making it difficult to upgrade mobile networks.        
	The DoT has recently issued a directive asking operators to get a security clearance before placing any order to procure equipment or software from foreign firms.         
	While the directive applies to all foreign equipment makers, industry players admitted that orders for Chinese vendors such as Huawei and ZTE were undergoing extra scrutiny. The DoT had last year proposed to impose a ban on Chinese vendors which was later withdrawn following protests.         
	Most of the new operators source gear from Chinese vendors because it is cost effective. Lower equipment costs have enabled them to offer call tariffs at 1 paise per second. Moreover, operators may find it difficult to offer 3G services at a reasonable price if equipment costs increase.         
	Most of our equipment is from Chinese manufacturers, but for future orders we may have to go to European vendors as the delay in getting clearance is making it difficult to upgrade existing networks and roll out services in new circles, said an executive of a new telecom company.        
	The DoT issued its directive after security agencies expressed concerns that foreign vendors could embed spyware into the telecom network, which could be used by unfriendly countries to snoop into Indias communication set-up.        
	DoT officials said no distinction was made among different foreign vendors. Core telecom equipment bought from all foreign vendors will have to undergo a security clearance and the approval for a product of a particular brand and specification for one operator will be considered as benchmark clearance for the industry for two years.         
	Huawei Technologies does not expect the new rules to cause any problem. The Shenzhen-based gear maker clocked $2.4 billion in revenues in 2009 from India and expects the growth to continue.        
	The DoT has also asked service providers to ensure that their networks are operated and maintained by Indian engineers, with minimal or no dependence on foreign engineers.         
	In the budget, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has allotted resources to set up a national centre to test all foreign equipment before they can be sold to service providers in the country.         
	The Telecom Engineering Centre  the DoTs technical arm  will undertake this project that is similar to the steps taken in the UK and the US to block external elements from intruding into their networks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tech snag shuts down Haldia Petro
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tech snag shuts down Haldia Petro
          SAMBIT SAHA                                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 3: Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) has undertaken an unscheduled emergency shutdown from yesterday for at least seven days to fix a problem in the naphtha cracker complex.        
	The closure is the second after the company increased its capacity under Project Supermax earlier this year.        
	HPL has been facing problems with the cracker complex  the unit which processes the raw material naphtha to produce polymer  from August.        
	Production suffered as the complex could not operate to its desired capacity. HPL produces polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene used to make plastic products.        
	It is learnt that the cracker complex was underperforming by 20-25 per cent. Its rated capacity is 700,000 tonnes of ethylene.        
	The problem is likely to impact the financial health of HPL, which is a showcase project for Bengal.         
	Initially, the management could not determine the reason for the underperformance. It kept the unit closed for five days, but the problem could not be located. Subsequently, it called in the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre (BARC).        
	It was observed that there was a major restriction in one of the fractionating columns when operating at super cold conditions (-130 degree Celsius).        
	Manual inspection by entering the columns would have been hazardous, time consuming and expensive. Some workers had died during the Supermax project last year, adding to the problems.         
	After analysing all data, HPL and its technology licensor CBI Lummus decided to use the gamma ray screening technology from the BARC.         
	The gamma ray technology uses advanced radioactive screening to get an internal picture of the operating equipment from the outside.        
	BARC experts, after extensive data collection and a complex process of interpretation, have cited the presence of frozen icy mass as the reason for the block in the fractionator.         
	A scheme has been worked out for the removal of the obstruction without anyone having to enter the column.        
	The process will involve heating the column at a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius.        
	We are fortunate to have scientists from the BARC to work with us and detect the problem. There is no need to send anyone manually in a column laden with hydrocarbon, Swapan Bhowmik, managing director of HPL, said on Sunday afternoon.        
	Bhowmik said the plant should be back in production by this weekend.        
	Target slip        
	HPL is likely to miss its target of Rs 400-crore profit after tax for 2010-11 because of the teething trouble surrounding Supermax.        
	The Rs 1,500-crore expansion project led to HPLs production going up by 30 per cent. But the expansion got delayed by months because of a flash strike by Left trade union Citu.        
	Even as Supermax was officially said to be completed by early March this year, the plant produced only a negligible volume in the first quarter of this fiscal, resulting in losses.         
	The management stepped up production in June, but within a couple of months the problem at the cracker complex started.        
	Bhowmik said the July-September quarter was good in terms of sales and profit, but it would be difficult to predict whether the company would earn profit as the operation was restricted from August because of the present problem.        
	Market experts said the international margin has been in the range of $ 675-$700 a tonne.        
	A company like HPL can expect to keep Rs 30,000 every tonne if it buys a tonne of naphtha and produces polymer out of it. But this does not take into account any fixed costs such as interest and staff cost.        
	HPL may still make some profit this fiscal if such high margin continues.

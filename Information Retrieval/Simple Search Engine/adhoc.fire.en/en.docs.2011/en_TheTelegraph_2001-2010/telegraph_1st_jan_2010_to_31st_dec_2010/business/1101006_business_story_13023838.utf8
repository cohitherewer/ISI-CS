	New Delhi, Oct. 5: India is likely to take up its case of developing the Farsi gasfield in Iran with US President Barack Obama during his visit to the country next month as threat of sanctions looms over state-owned firms ONGC, Indian Oil and Oil India.        
	Sanctions against Iran by the US and the EU have jeopardised the $8-billion plan of ONGC, IOC and Oil India to jointly develop the Farzad-B area of the Farsi block as their consortium is finding it difficult to access technology and funding to execute the project.        
	Obamas visit has raised the consortiums hopes. Industry sources said sanction is still far away and we are hopeful that the US may give us exemption as we took the project much before the US sanctions (against Iran).        
	The US administration had in May named Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC Videsh, Oil India, Indian Oil Corporation, Hinduja Group and Petronet LNG among the 41 firms having energy ties with Iran, an act for which it may impose sanctions.        
	Oil ministry sources said, We would try to convince him of the need to develop the gas field to meet our energy needs. Hopefully, something could be worked out.        
	India, having lost out on the $7.5-billion Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) pipeline because of security, transit and geo-political issues, is looking to secure investment in the Farsi gasfields to meet its need for energy.        
	In September 2008, the Iranian government approved the exploitation of the Farsi block, with recoverable gas reserves over 12.8 trillion cubic feet. ONGC and IOC are equal partners with 40 per cent interest each to develop the Farzad-B area. Oil India is the third partner with 20 per cent interest.        
	The consortium won the right to explore the Farzad-B block under the umbrella of ONGCs foreign arm ONGC Videsh, initially investing $90 million. In the second phase, the three must invest about $5.5 billion to produce natural gas, from which they expect to earn a 15 per cent annual rate of return. Another $2.5 billion is needed to set up a liquefaction plant to transfer LNG to India.

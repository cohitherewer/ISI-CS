          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Aug. 18: Bajaj Corp Ltd today made a stellar debut on the stock exchanges by opening at a premium and finishing with gains of more than 14 per cent over its issue price.        
	On the NSE, the scrip opened at Rs 760 and touched a high of Rs 816.95 before settling at Rs 758.75 against the issue price of Rs 660 per share.         
	On the BSE, the share debuted at Rs 730, reached a high of Rs 812 and ended at Rs 758.25.         
	Bajaj Corp is the second issue this week after SKS Microfinance to make a smart debut. On Monday, SKS had listed at Rs 1,036 per share on the BSE  a gain of 5 per cent over the issue price of Rs 985 apiece  and ended at Rs 1,088.58, a premium of 10 per cent.         
	Market observers believe that strong gains in both these shares should be good news for upcoming offerings, though much will depend on their fundamentals and the pricing. The Shishir Bajaj group firm had come out with an issue of 45 lakh shares in the price range of Rs 630-660 apiece.         
	The IPO had managed to raise around Rs 300 crore and got a strong response from all investor categories, including retail.         
	Overall, the issue was subscribed more than 19 times, while the retail portion was subscribed over six times.        
	Market experts said the companys prospects in the light hair oil segment was the reason behind its strong listing. Bajaj Corp has five major brands with Bajaj Almond Drops being the flagship.

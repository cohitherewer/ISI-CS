The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coal ministry ups ante
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Coal ministry ups ante
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                             
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The coal ministry has sought a direction from the cabinet committee on infrastructure for clearance by the environment ministry to all blocks in forest areas meant for power and steel plants irrespective of whether they are in the go or no-go areas.         
	In a note to the cabinet panel, the ministry says it is felt that only the cases of pristine forests or wildlife sanctuaries should be considered where coal mining may not be allowed.        
	The note is likely to intensify the tussle between the coal ministry and the environment ministry, which had classified blocks in forest regions into go and no-go areas and had withheld permission to those in the no-go region.        
	On the basis of the ministrys latest proposal, only 10 per cent of the forests in the coal-bearing regions are out of bounds.        
	If the coal ministrys plea  which seems to have the support of its counterparts in power and steel  is accepted, it will almost end the go and no-go classification, or at least keep past projects out of its purview.        
	Negotiations are now on to bring more areas in the go category, but ministries are worried over go area projects getting delayed because of roadblocks posed by the environment ministry.        
	The coal ministry, in the note, says, The major reason for constraint in coal production has been delays in obtaining prospective and mining leases and other approvals from the state governments and on account of delays in securing environmental and forest clearance.         
	Forest clearances for mines are given in two phases  in-principle and final approvals. It takes about four-and-a-half years to get in-principle approval from the state government, and about 2 years for the Centres environment clearance. The final clearance takes longer  5.4 years from states and 1.6 years from the Centre.         
	According to rules, forest clearance by the Union government should take just 150 days in the case of new projects and 120 days in the case of projects whose mining lease is being renewed.         
	The coal ministrys fears that the ban on mining in areas marked as no-go will slow down development. There are 155 coal blocks in the no-go areas meant to feed as many projects, including 10 major power plants.         
	Debarring 155 coal blocks with a production potential of 660 million tonnes will adversely affect the projections of power generation or economic growth in the country that are being proposed, officials said.         
	The battle between the environment ministry and the coal ministry is not expected to end soon as both lobbies are believed to be strong.         
	Officials said the government would have to come up with a balancing act that would satisfy both the parties. Some recommend that stringent norms that will be reviewed at phases should be brought in. The mining areas will be split into parcels, each catering to the requirements of 2-3 years. Once a parcel has been mined, the area will be reforested.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, Aug. 29: Banks with a higher proportion of low-interest-bearing current and savings account (CASA) deposits will be in a better position to manage their margin, or profitability, at a time the central banks monetary policy is prompting them to raise deposit and lending rates, analysts said.        
	Particularly well positioned is HDFC Bank whose current and savings account deposit ratio to total deposits is at an industry high of 49 per cent.        
	Apart from HDFC Bank, the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank also have a strong CASA ratio.         
	Recently, banks have raised both their deposit and lending rates. While deposit rates were hiked 25-150 basis points, the benchmark prime lending rates were increased 50-75 basis points because of tight liquidity conditions.         
	The central bank in July had hiked the reverse repo, the rate at which it absorbs excess liquidity from the system, by 50 basis points to 4.5 per cent; and the repo, which is the rate at which it provides liquidity to banks, by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent.        
	This was when banks cost of funds had gone up for calculating the savings rate interest on a daily basis.        
	The hike in the RBI rates fuelled concerns that the banks net interest margin (NIM), or the difference between the return on advances and cost of funds, could take a hit.         
	Though banks can winch up their lending rates, the increase comes with a lag and the amount is less compared with deposit rates.         
	Moreover, banks are yet to revise their base rates  the benchmark rates against which new loans will be disbursed.         
	Bankers are also considering further hikes in deposit and lending rates, while liquidity is expected to remain tight till September.        
	In such a scenario, banks with a higher share of CASA will not only sustain but also improve their margins.        
	Right option        
	CASA will play a key role in determining a banks NIM, particularly in a rising interest rate scenario. Those with a strong CASA will find their margins sustaining over the course of the year, a senior official from a private bank said. Concurs Vaibhav Agrawal, an analyst at Angel Broking: Those with lower CASA could see a decline in their margins.        
	Some analysts, however, feel margins will be stable in the current quarter, irrespective of the hike in deposit rates. They explain that the recent round of lending rate hikes along with the possibility of further increases can push up the return on advances and help margins.        
	Banks are likely to maintain their margins on a sequential basis, Bhavesh Kanani, a banking analyst at Sharekhan said.

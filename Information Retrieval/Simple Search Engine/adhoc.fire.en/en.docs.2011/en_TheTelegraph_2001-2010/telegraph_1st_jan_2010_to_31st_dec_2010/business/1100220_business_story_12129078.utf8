	 Mumbai, Feb. 19: The RBI today asked banks to start calculating interest rates on savings accounts on a daily basis from April 1. The move will enable savings bank account holders to earn better interest rates since the banks currently calculate interest on these accounts on the lowest available balance, from 11th till the last date of a month.                            
	 Mumbai, Feb. 19: The follow-on offer of Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) got a listless response with the issue getting subscribed only 0.29 times on the first day of the offer. The issue, through which the government is divesting a 17.39 per cent stake, received bids for 4.97 crore shares against 17.17 crore shares on offer.                            
	 New Delhi, Feb. 19: HDFC Bank has hiked fixed deposit rates by up to 150 basis points across maturities, a move that follows a 0.75 per cent hike in the cash reserve ratio by the RBI last month.

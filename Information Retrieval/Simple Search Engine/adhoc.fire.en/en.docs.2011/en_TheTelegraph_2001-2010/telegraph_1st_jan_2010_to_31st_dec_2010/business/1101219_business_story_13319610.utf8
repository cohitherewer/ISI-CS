          OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec. 18 (PTI): The Union Bank of India (UBI) today increased its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 0.50 per cent to 13.25 per cent.        
	In view of the current microeconomic scenario and hardening of interest rates, the Union Bank has decided to revise its BPLR by 50 basis points with effect from December 20, the public sector lender said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Besides new borrowers, the rate increase will apply to old borrowers who have not migrated to the new base rate system, which was introduced from July 1 this year to make lending rates more transparent.        
	Apart from the increase in lending rates, the Mumbai-based bank has hiked its term deposit rates by up to 100 basis points.        
	It has launched a special 700-day product carrying an interest rate of 8.60 per cent, while the interest rate on a one-year deposit has been raised to 8 per cent from 7.25 per cent earlier.         
	IOB rate hike        
	The Indian Overseas Bank has raised its benchmark prime lending rate by 25 basis points today.        
	The bank, with its headquarters in Chennai, has increased the BPLR rate from the existing 13 per cent per annum to 13.25 per cent (excluding housing loans) with effect from December 16, the IOB said in a statement.        
	According to the bank, the board has approved the increase in the BPLR rate.

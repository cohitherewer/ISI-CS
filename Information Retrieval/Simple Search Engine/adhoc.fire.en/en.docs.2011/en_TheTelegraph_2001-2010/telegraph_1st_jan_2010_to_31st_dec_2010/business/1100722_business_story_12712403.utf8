                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Jolt to Fortis Parkway bid
                              Lot at stake                            
	Singapore, July 21 (PTI): Malaysias Khazanah today said it had received the approval of the majority of eligible shareholders of Parkway who have so far voted on its offer for a 51 per cent stake in the Singapore-based hospital chain.         
	The development could prove to be a blow to Indias Fortis Healthcare, which is trying to fully acquire Parkway.        
	We are very pleased that the majority of Parkway shareholders who have voted to date have chosen to approve our partial offer, said Quek Pei Lynn, director of Integrated Healthcare Holdings Ltd (IHHL), an arm of Khazanah.        
	Comments from Fortis Healthcare could not be obtained.        
	In a filing to the Singapore Stock Exchange, IHHL said its partial offer received 604,926,786 valid votes, representing 70 per cent of the eligible shareholders. However, only 5 per cent of the shareholders have tendered their acceptance so far.        
	IHHL launched a $835 million offer for a 51.5 per cent Parkway stake at S$3.78 per share. Fortis had launched a $2.3 billion counter-offer at S$3.8 per share to fully acquire Parkway.        
	As on July 20, IHHL has received an aggregate of 604,926,786 valid votes from shareholders on the partial offer, the IHHL notice said.        
	Of these valid votes received approximately, 50.5 per cent were to approve the partial offer. In addition, 15,661,986 shares have been tendered as acceptances, representing approximately 5 per cent of the 313,000,000 offer shares, it added.        
	The success of IHHLs partial offer will be subject to its approval by shareholders representing more than 50 per cent of the votes received, not considering its own vote; and also on valid acceptances for no less than 313,000,000 shares.        
	IHHLs offer is to close on July 26 or such later date(s) as may be announced from time-to-time by or on behalf of the offerer, the notice said.        
	On the other hand Fortis open offer is scheduled to close on August 12.        
	At present, Fortis owns 25.37 per cent in Parkway, while IHHL has a 23.32 per cent stake.

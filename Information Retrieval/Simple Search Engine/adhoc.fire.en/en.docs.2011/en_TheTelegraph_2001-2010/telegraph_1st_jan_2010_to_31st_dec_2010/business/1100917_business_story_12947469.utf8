          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 16: The Reserve Bank of India has left the door open for further rate hikes this year.        
	Many bankers had hoped that todays anticipated rate increases would spell the end of the monetary tightening cycle that began in October 2009.        
	Reading carefully through a nuanced statement from the RBI, bankers said it was clear that inflation targeting and the imperative to keep the economy growing would be the two factors that would determine the calibration of the policy rate actions over the next few months.        
	In its mid-quarter policy review, the central bank said that the tightening it had done so far had taken the monetary situation close to normal.        
	While some read this as a signal that the RBI would now prefer to hold its hand on further rate hikes, economists said the RBI statement should be only seen in the context of its desire to take the policy rates back to pre-crisis levels.        
	It may be recalled that the RBI had brought down the repo rate from 9 per cent in October 2008 to 4.75 per cent in April last year. During the same period, the reverse repo fell from 6 per cent to 3.25 per cent to cope with the situation arising from the global financial crisis in 2008.        
	The central bank has been raising rates in a non-disruptive fashion or taking baby steps to not only control inflation but also complete this process of normalisation.        
	The role of normalisation as a motivation for further actions is likely to be less important, the RBI said, clearly indicating that it would not place too much importance on this aspect while raising key rates.        
	It added that current and expected macroeconomic conditions would be more important considerations going forward. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor these conditions, particularly the price situation, and take further action as warranted, the apex bank said.        
	Rohini Malkani, economist at Citigroup, said that though the RBI would continue to hike rates, it would be lower than expectations. There is a change in tone to more positive as the RBI has said that tightening done so far has taken the monetary situation close to normal. Given that inflation remains significantly above trends, we expect one or possibly two more hikes in the next six months. This should take repo and reverse repo rates to 6.50 per cent and 5.50 per cent. respectively, she said in a note.         
	The RBI said the recovery was consolidating, and that the economy was converging to its trend rate of growth. However, it cautioned that the sharp volatility seen in the index of industrial production (IIP) raised some doubts about how effectively the index reflected the underlying momentum in the industrial sector.         
	Industry worry         
	Business association CII today said industry might now find it difficult to fund capacity expansions, and even some existing projects might become unviable.        
	If banks are unable to absorb the cost and pass it on to customers, it will have an impact, especially on weaker borrowers like small and medium enterprises, Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra said.        
	Assocham president Swati Piramal, however, said the hikes were in line with the predictions of industry. The industry has been expecting the RBI to raise the repo and reverse repo rates and leave the cash reserve ratio untouched as the economic conditions are still evolving.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | July date for EIL offer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      July date for EIL offer
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cash course                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The sale of 10 per cent of the governments equity in Engineers India Ltd to the public is likely to take place in July.        
	At the current market price, the government is expected to raise Rs 1,000 crore through the sale of its 10 per cent stake in EIL, said A.K Purwaha, chairman and managing director of EIL.        
	EIL stocks today hit the upper limit at Rs 2,079.70 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on news of the governments approval of the share sale, a bonus issue and a special dividend. The stock had yesterday closed at Rs 1,733.10 on the bourses. The cabinet on Thursday approved the stake sale. EIL provides engineering consultancy services mostly to oil and gas firms.        
	Before the offer, EIL will issue a 1,000 per cent (Rs 100 per share) special dividend. The government with a 90.4 per cent stake will be the biggest beneficiary, getting Rs 506 crore, besides a dividend tax of Rs 90 crore.        
	The public sector undertaking will issue two bonus shares for every one held after that and follow it up with splitting the Rs 10 share into two.        
	He said the EIL board was likely to approve the stake sale at its meeting on January 28, following which an extraordinary general meeting would be called.         
	Keeping in mind the formalities to be completed, I think the follow-on public offer is likely in the early part of the second quarter (of 2010-11). The first quarter will be challenging, but July is more realistically possible, said Purwaha.

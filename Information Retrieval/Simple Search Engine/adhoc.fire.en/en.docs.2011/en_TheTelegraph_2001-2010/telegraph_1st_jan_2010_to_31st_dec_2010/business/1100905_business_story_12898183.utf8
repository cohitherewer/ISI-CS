          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Sept. 4: After tasting success in packaged salt, the $70-billion Tata group is planning to foray into pulses.         
	Tata Chemicals, Indias largest packaged salt maker, plans to introduce packaged pulses in the domestic market, a top company official said here today.        
	The Tata company sees a big potential for branded pulses in future, R. Gopalakrishnan, executive director of Tata Sons and chairman of Tata Chemicals, said.        
	According to Gopalakrishnan, the countrys pulses requirement will touch 35 million tonnes by 2030, against 14 million tonnes at present.        
	We are doing a pilot project in Tamil Nadu, where 1,000 farmers are growing pulses in around 3,500 acres of land. We have given the farmers seeds to help them grow pulses and assured them that we will buy the crop. We have also tied up with dal millers, Gopalakrishnan told reporters here.        
	The project is being implemented in Pudukkotai and Somangalam in Tamil Nadu.        
	He said Tata Salt had been selling in three million outlets across the country and marketing would not be a problem.        
	We started selling branded Urad Dal under I-Shakti brand name in Chennai. We are open to partnerships in this (dal cultivation). We have already tied up with the Tamil Nadu government, the Tata executive said.

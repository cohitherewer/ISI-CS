          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 30: Consumer durables firms are targeting a 50 per cent growth in the sales of air conditioners and refrigerators this year, with the onset of summer.        
	Air conditioners are no longer a luxury item. They are a necessity. An early summer with record temperatures along with a rebound in the economy are driving increased consumer spending, said Ajay Bajaj, business group head (AC), LG Electronics India Ltd.        
	According to Bajaj, the AC market is estimated at 2.7 million units last year. It is expected to achieve a 50 per cent growth this year against 20-25 per cent earlier. Customers are shifting base to higher star-rated ACs, which are more energy-efficient. Our strategy to bring high-star rated ones is helping us to push sales this year, he said.        
	LG, which is targeting a 50-70 per cent jump in AC sales this summer, has already earned Rs 800 crore in the last two months. The company, which introduced 16 models this year, had sales worth Rs 1,600 crore in 2009. It is expected to achieve a revenue of over Rs 2,500 crore this year. LG aims to sell 12 lakh ACs this year against 8 lakh last year. As far as refrigerators are concerned, it hopes to sell 30 lakh units against 19.7 lakh last year.        
	Its closest competitor Samsung expects to sell 10 lakh ACs this year against 5 lakh last year. The company has witnessed a 30 per cent growth in demand for refrigerators and hopes to sell 17 lakh units this year.         
	The Japanese firms are also working on their growth plans. Panasonic, which expanded its AC range this year, has achieved a 400 per cent growth in the last two to three months.         
	AC business accounts for around 25 per cent of the companys overall turnover.                                            
	We are experiencing an increase in demand for our products and plan to invest $15 million. Of that, $10 million would be used in AC manufacturing plant and the rest in home appliances, said Ravinder Zutshi, deputy managing director of Samsung India.                           
	Till last year our product pipeline in the segment was not strong. This year we have widened our product range, catering to even the mass segment by introducing entry level products, said Manish Sharma, marketing head, Panasonic India.

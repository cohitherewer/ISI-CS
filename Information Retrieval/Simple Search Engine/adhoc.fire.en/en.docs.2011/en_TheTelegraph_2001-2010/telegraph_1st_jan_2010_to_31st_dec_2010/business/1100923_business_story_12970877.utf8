          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 22: The Avantha group plans to re-enter the paperboard business after exiting the segment by selling out to ITC seven years ago.        
	We are giving a serious thought to it, chairman and CEO Gautam Thapar said.        
	Unlike last time, the paperboard business will not be part of Ballarpur Industries Ltd (Bilt), the largest printing and writing paper maker in India.        
	When ITC bought the Coimbatore plant in 2003 for Rs 233 crore, it was part of Bilt.        
	Thapar said the paperboard business would be under a separate company. Printing and writing paper and paperboard are two completely different segments. So it will not be under Bilt, he said.        
	Thapar was speaking on the sidelines of the 37th national convention organised by the All India Management Association (AIMA) with The Telegraph as partner. Thapar will succeed Sanjiv Goenka as the president of AIMA.        
	The renewed interest in paperboard and packaging is part of a much bigger strategy of the Avantha group for the next five years.        
	Thapar said Bilt alone would invest about Rs 4,000 crore to double the printing paper capacity in the next five years to 2 million tonnes from 1 million tonnes now.        
	It will also scale up the pulping facility in Malaysia to 750,000 tonnes from 250,000 tonnes.         
	The group is also expanding its consumer business comprising paper and other stationery products. It has 13 retail outlets in the country. It will launch a B2C portal soon where consumers can place orders and get delivery within 24 hours.         
	Thapar said the Avantha group was likely to be worth $7-8 billion (Rs 35,000 crore) within the next five years on the back of a strong growth in power equipment manufacturer Crompton Greaves Ltd, Bilt and Avantha Power amp; Infrastructure Ltd.        
	Crompton Greaves is growing annually at 15 per cent and is expected to be a global firm with a presence in all continents. It is eyeing acquisitions in Latin America. We want to have a beachhead there. It should happen within one year, he said.        
	Bengal facility        
	Thapar, who was born in Calcutta and spent his early childhood here, is setting up a fly ash-based building construction material unit near Budge Budge, Avanthas first investment in Bengal.

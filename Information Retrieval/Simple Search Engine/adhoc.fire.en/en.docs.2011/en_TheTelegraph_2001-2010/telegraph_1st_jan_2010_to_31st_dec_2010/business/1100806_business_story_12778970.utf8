The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL strikes new shale gas deal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RIL strikes new shale gas deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 5: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is acquiring its third shale gas asset in the US. It is taking a 60 per cent stake in acreage held by Carrizo Oil amp; Gas, Inc.        
	Shale gas is a form of natural gas trapped in sedimentary rocks. RIL is not alone in tapping this reserve. Oil giants such as BP Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp have also acquired shale gas assets.         
	It is estimated that over the next decade, at least 20 per cent world energy will come from shale gas.        
	Under the proposed transaction, RIL will acquire a 60 per cent interest in Marcellus Shale acreage in Central and Northeast Pennsylvania that is now held in a 50-50 joint venture between Carrizo and ACP II Marcellus LLC, an affiliate of Avista Capital Partners.        
	Reliance will acquire all of Avistas interest and 20 per cent of Carrizos interest in the joint venture. This will result in Reliance and Carrizo holding 60 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, in a newly formed joint venture.        
	RIL will pay $392 million, comprising $340 million of cash and $52 million of drilling carry obligations (drilling cost).         
	According to RIL, the joint venture will have around 104,400 net acres of undeveloped leasehold in the core area of the Marcellus Shale in Central and Northeast Pennsylvania, of which Reliances 60 per cent interest will represent approximately 62,600 net acres.        
	The transaction is expected to close by mid-September this year.        
	In June, RIL had said it would pay $1.3 billion for a 45 per cent stake in US-based Pioneer Natural Resources shale gas assets. Earlier, it bought 300,000 acres of shale gas property from US-based Atlas Energy in April.        
	Oil sector analysts welcomed the deal, pointing out that the acquisition price for the Carrizo asset in per acre terms is much less than the earlier two deals.        
	The market initially reacted positively to the announcement. The RIL share rose to an intra-day high of Rs 1,028 after opening at Rs 1,014.70. However, it surrendered its gains in line with the overall market conditions and ended at Rs 1,006.96, a drop of 0.88 per cent over the last close.                                
	This acreage is expected to support the drilling of around 1,000 wells over the next 10 years with a net resource potential of about 3.4 trillion cubic feet equivalents. The deal allows for additional growth in the developing acreage at pre-agreed terms.        
	Carrizo will serve as the development operator for the joint venture and Reliance has the option to act as a development operator in certain regions in the coming years as part of the joint venture.               
	The drilling carry obligations will provide for 75 per cent of Carrizos share of development costs over an anticipated two-year development programme.

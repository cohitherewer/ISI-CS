          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 28: Auto component firms need to focus on innovation to stay competitive in the absence of tariff protection.         
	The government will try to protect the domestic industries as far as possible, but they have to grow to be competitive. The price competitive advantage may not be there for ever. The industry has to shape up to be in business, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said.        
	He said the sector needed to address issues such as rising raw material prices, climate change and regulatory compliance.         
	The industry should think about the product needs a decade later and initiate the process now.        
	Releasing a paper on auto and auto component exports, Khullar said India needed to enter into trade agreements with identified thrust markets.         
	The free trade agreement with Asean, the comprehensive economic partnership agreement with Korea and the comprehensive economic cooperation agreement with Singapore are, therefore, steps in the right direction and need to be undertaken for all the identified thrust markets, he said.

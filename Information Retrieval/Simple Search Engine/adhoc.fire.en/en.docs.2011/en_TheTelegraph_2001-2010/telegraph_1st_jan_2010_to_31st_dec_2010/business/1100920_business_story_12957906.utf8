        Start saving early to give your money more time to grow, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                             
	You may call Sahana, a college student from Khidderpur, an investment freak. While most other youngsters at her age will flip through newspapers for the latest movie releases or mobile handset launches, Sahana is more keen to understand whether the absolute return or the net asset value is more important to assess an equity mutual fund.        
	Instead of saving for a designer dress, she invested part of her money that she got as gift in a large-cap equity fund.        
	Most of us could take a few lessons from this young investor.        
	The best time to develop a habit of saving is when you are young.        
	Time is money        
	Its an old saying that time is money, but few actually follow it. Sahana is a perfect example. She started investing early. So, her investments will get more time to grow than most of us who start investing only after getting a job to save tax.         
	If you start investing at an early age, you stand a better chance to survive your investment flaws and volatility in asset prices over a longer period of time.         
	No one can take every investment decision right. Not even Warren Buffett.        
	At the age of 11, Buffet bought his first stock  six shares of Cities Service  for $38 per share but the price soon plunged to $27. Buffett sold the shares at $40 apiece by holding on to his investments for sometime, but he later repented for not holding the stock longer so that he could sell them for $200 per share.         
	Later on he told a family friend that he would either be a millionaire by the time he turns 30 or he would jump off the tallest building in Omaha.         
	He had learnt the virtue of investing at a young age  the longer the time you give your investment to grow, the richer you become, thanks to what is called in mathematics the compounding effect, which Einstein called the most powerful force in the universe.        
	Such lessons are not as obvious as you might think. My daughter splurges money on everything else but doesnt care about putting some money into savings. When I advise her to save, she says she has a well-paid job and has years before her to start saving, said a fifty-plus professional, who is looking for an annuity plan to ensure a pension-like income after retirement in five years.         
	Hazards of late start        
	The thought that Ill just save more later has its pitfalls. Such an attitude does not lead to good money management, for example, paying credit card bills or insurance premium on time.        
	Besides, in a society that is increasingly moving towards greater privatisation and away from a defined pension system, you may find the going difficult in the twilight years if you dont accumulate enough for your retirement kitty.         
	Let us illustrate this with an example. Karan, who is now 25, starts investing Rs 500 a month. He continues this investment till he is 40. He then stops investing and instead allows the investment that he has already made to grow till he is 60. Assuming a conservative 10 per cent rate of return on his investment, Karan will accumulate Rs 15,13,570 when he reaches 60 .        
	His friend Rahul, on the other hand, prefers to enjoy life till he is 40 and then start saving till he attains the retirement age. To accumulate a retirement kitty of Rs 15 lakh, Rahul will have to invest Rs 2,000 a month, or four times of what Karan saves, assuming the same 10 per cent rate of return.        
	The fact is when you are 40, you are already married, probably have a school-going kid and you must be looking to buy a house of your own. Thus, you will have a lot of financial liabilities, your monthly expenses will go up and your ability to save more will get reduced.         
	So, if you are 25 now and think that you can accumulate enough by starting to invest when you are 40, you may be wrong. What happens then?         
	Take Rahuls case. He cannot save Rs 2,000 a month  the maximum he can save is Rs 500 a month as Karan did. In that case, Rahul will have to park his investments in instruments that give 20 per cent return per annum to accumulate Rs 15 lakh before retirement.         
	One doesnt need to be an investment wizard to understand that an investment that yields a 20 per cent return is twice as much risky as an investment that gives a 10 per cent return. So, by beginning late, Rahul has no other option but to park his hard-earned money in risky instruments.        
	By starting investment at an early age you can not only accumulate a handsome amount for retirement, but you can also do it more comfortably with lower risks.         
	With age on your side when you start early, you have more time to recover any investment loss that might happen. Karan has 35 years before retirement to recover any investment loss, but Rahul has only 20 years.         
	Learning curve        
	Learn this basic postulate of investing and make sure your little ones learn it, too. After all, one need not be a Warren Buffett to teach the art of saving and investment to ones children.         
	Buy that ubiquitous piggybank for your kids. This will help them to grow the habit of saving a small part of the pocket money or cash gifts that they receive. Open a bank account for them and whenever possible take them to the bank with you to show them how banking transactions are carried out.         
	Saving is a habit, inculcate it in your children when they are young.

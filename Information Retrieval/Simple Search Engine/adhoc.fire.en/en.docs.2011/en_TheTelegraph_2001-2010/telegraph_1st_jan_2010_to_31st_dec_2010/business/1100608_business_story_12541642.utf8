          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 7: Two multilateral financial institutions         
	have projected around 9 per cent growth for India in 2011.         
	The World Bank has said the growth will be 9 per cent, while the Asian Development Bank sees growth at 8.2 per cent in 2010 and 8.7 per cent in 2011.         
	South Asia is poised to become the second-fastest growing region after East Asia and the Pacific, the World Bank added.        
	The region is expected to grow about 7 per cent in 2010 and nearly 8 per cent in 2011, the South Asia economic update 2010  the World Banks first yearly assessment of the economies of the region  said.        
	The ADB, in its Asian development outlook, said China and India  the two biggest economies  were expected to grow strongly in 2010.         
	China was forecast to grow 9.6 per cent in 2010 and 9.1 per cent in 2011, with the phasing out of stimulus measures.         
	India will be the leading country in South Asia.         
	The Indian economy expanded 7.4 per cent in 2009-10, and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has pegged growth at over 8.5 per cent for 2010-11.         
	The World Bank report said South Asias particular strengths and forms of global integration, not the lack of it, were the key factor behind its resilience following the financial crisis of 2008.        
	It said integration should be a key component of a sustained and inclusive growth strategy, with the emerging markets playing an increasingly important role.        
	Noting that the drop in growth in this region during the crisis was the smallest, the report said it would benefit from new engines of growth and adapting to a new normal. The bank urged South Asia to strengthen trade ties with East Asia, including China, to drive expansion, saying the relationship could help annual trade to triple to $450 billion.        
	Dipak Dasgupta, lead economist and principal author of the report, said, Rising domestic confidence combined with government fiscal and monetary stimulus packages and, in some cases, external assistance are helping to stimulate recovery.        
	Ernesto May, sector director for economic policy for South Asia, said, To ensure a sustained, durable and faster growth, countries need to create more fiscal space and contain rising inflation, while ensuring that the exit from fiscal and monetary stimulus is gradual and in tune with the recovery of private demand. Boosting agriculture will also be vital to keep food prices moderate.         
	The report said there remained some significant risks in the global environment  slowing worker remittances and exports in a still hesitant and uncertain global recovery and continuing volatility in global capital flows.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said the economy needed to grow 10 per cent in the medium term to address poverty and malnutrition, which continue to plague the country.        
	However, hopes of a high growth have been marred by inflation. Wholesale prices rose 9.59 per cent in April from a year earlier, although government officials said headline inflation had peaked.        
	The RBI had raised interest rates in March and April to fight high inflation.

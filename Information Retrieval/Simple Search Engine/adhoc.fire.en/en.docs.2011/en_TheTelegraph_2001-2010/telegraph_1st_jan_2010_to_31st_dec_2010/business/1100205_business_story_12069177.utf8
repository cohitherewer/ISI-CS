                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bail for PW auditor in Satyam scam case
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 4: The Supreme Court today granted bail to Price Waterhouse auditor Srinivas Talluri who was arrested in the Satyam fraud case for allegedly conniving with founder B. Ramalinga Raju and other aides.         
	A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan directed Talluri to furnish a personal bond of Rs 20 lakh and two sureties of a similar amount.         
	While granting bail to Talluri, the bench, also comprising Justices J.M. Panchal and B.S. Chauhan, directed him to appear twice a month before the CBI and not to leave Hyderabad without informing the agency.         
	The CBI, represented by law officer Haren P. Raval, argued that investigations were yet to be completed into the case. He could revive his bail application after six months, Raval said.         
	The court, however, said though the charges could not be called innocent mistakes, he could always be taken in for interrogation again if required.         
	The bench said he had to make himself available before the CBI as and when required by the agency for the investigation. Talluris passport has been impounded by the CBI.         
	On January 18, the CBI had opposed the bail plea of Talluri on the ground that he was part of the conspiracy in the Rs 7,136-crore accounting fraud at Satyam Computer Services.        
	Andhra Pradesh High Court had rejected the bail pleas of Talluri and another auditor S. Gopalakrishnan. The auditors were arrested on January 24 last year and are in judicial custody.         
	The CBI has already filed a chargesheet against them.

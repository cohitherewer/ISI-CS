The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Obama trip prompts rethink on FDI
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Obama trip prompts rethink on FDI
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Push for change                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: The government is looking afresh at relaxing caps on foreign direct investment in defence and retail, ahead of President Barack Obamas visit.         
	US diplomats have been seeking policy changes, while lobbying for the increased sales of defence items.         
	The Americans are keen on striking partnerships, and this may be partly prompted by a number of collaborations between European, Israeli and Russian defence firms and Indian companies.        
	Besides, a meeting of the supervisory board of Eurofighter GmbH in New Delhi last week was an indicator of the extent of competition for contracts in India.        
	Chief executives from Eurofighter partner companies such as EADS, BAE Systems and Alenia Aeronautica were among those who visited Delhi to encourage India to buy the Eurofighter jets.         
	Sources said the Eurofighter team had promised to collaborate with India to produce spares and subsystems.         
	The US business team accompanying President Obama will look at the possibility of collaborating with Indian firms to get an entry into the defence market. The US has already bagged defence contracts worth $9.3 billion.         
	The joint ventures in defence are BAEMahindra amp; Mahindra (defence vehicles and guns), SikorskyTata (helicopters), EADS  L amp;T (defence equipment) and Lockheed MartinTata. A large number of industry groups, including Reliance, are eyeing the sector, following the Indian governments plans of spending around $50 billion over the next five years.        
	Sources said the government was looking at relaxing the 26 per cent cap on foreign investment in defence industries and allowing up to 49 per cent FDI.         
	However, this would happen only after the US government lifted trade and collaboration restrictions on agencies such as Isro and the DRDO as well as Indian private firms which were their regular suppliers.        
	These restrictions had been placed in the wake of the Indian nuclear tests in 1998.         
	Currently, only 26 per cent FDI is allowed in defence industries. Though the commerce ministry has moved a note seeking to increase FDI to 74 per cent, the defence ministry and Indian firms such as M amp;M, L amp;T and the Tatas are opposed to the proposal.         
	Indian business argues that a 49 per cent stake offer is sufficient to attract top names for joint ventures.         
	In the retail sector, keeping in view the objections of various political parties, the government could look at allowing FDI in the back-end of food retail chains and multi-brand retail in select metropolitan cities, according to sources.         
	The commerce ministry, which wants to throw open retail trade to foreign investment, had some time back brought out a discussion paper that suggested that India could look at public-private partnerships in modernising its food markets and to facilitate more cash-and-carry outlets.

	Mumbai/London, Aug. 24 (PTI): Shares of Cairn India climbed about 6 per cent on the BSE today, but parent Cairn Energy Plc fell over 3 per cent in London, amid speculation of a counter-bid to its proposed takeover by Vedanta.        
	Shares of Cairn India jumped on hopes that the counter-bid may be at higher price than the Rs 355 for public shareholders. If there will be any counter-offer, it will be in favour of shareholders of Cairn India, CNI Researchs Kishore Ostwal said.        
	Contrary to this, Cairn Energy started the session with a loss of 3.55 per cent at 4.47. Investors are worried about a counter- bid and it has weighed on the stock, Ostwal said.

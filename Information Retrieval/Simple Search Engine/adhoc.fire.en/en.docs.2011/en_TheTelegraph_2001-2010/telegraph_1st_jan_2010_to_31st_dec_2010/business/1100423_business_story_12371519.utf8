                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Rupee rise hits tea exports
          SOUNAK MITRA                          Major Problem                                  
	Calcutta, April 22: The appreciation of the rupee against foreign currencies in the first few months of the year has hit tea exports to Europe this year.        
	Darjeeling tea  70 per cent of its production are exported  was affected the most though prices have increased significantly in foreign currency compared with last year.         
	However, the appreciating rupee meant the realisation was less in terms of the local currency.        
	Premium Darjeeling tea has fetched prices as high as 200 a kg in the beginning of this year compared with 80 a year ago.        
	To counter the rupee, exporters are holding back orders for a limited period, a Darjeeling planter said. Per kg prices have gone up but price realisation has certainly come down with the rupee appreciating, he said.        
	In 2008-09, total Darjeeling output was 8.2 million kg and the target for 2009-10 was set at 9 million kg.         
	However, less rain during the first flush season has resulted in lower production this year.        
	The rupee has appreciated about 13 per cent against the euro since November. Today, the euro traded around Rs 58.29, the dollar, 44.50 (it was 52.06 in March 2009) and the pound, 68.40.        
	Since 70 per cent of the (Darjeeling) produce are exported, the impact has been significant, said the Darjeeling Tea Association.        
	However, the Tea Board of India said it was yet to receive any official complaint on the issue.        
	According to the Tea Board, average prices in February have moved up about 6 per cent to Rs 130.75 per kg. In value terms, exports rose 7 per cent to Rs 160.06 crore in February. Between April last year and February, exports rose 14.13 per cent to Rs 2,504.70 crore.

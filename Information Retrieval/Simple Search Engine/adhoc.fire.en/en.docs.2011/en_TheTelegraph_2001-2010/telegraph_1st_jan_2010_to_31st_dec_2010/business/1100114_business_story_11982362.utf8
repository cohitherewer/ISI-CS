The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maruti cars to turn dearer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Maruti cars to turn dearer
          A STAFF REPORTER                          S.N. Burman in Calcutta on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 13: Higher input costs may force Maruti Suzuki to raise car prices.        
	On the back of rising commodity prices such as steel and copper, we are actively considering price increases across all our models in a couple of weeks, Maruti Suzuki commercial business head S. N. Burman said here today. He was speaking on the sidelines of the launch of its multi-purpose vehicle Eeco in the city.        
	However, he declined to disclose further details on the extent of the price rise.         
	The company had last raised prices by around 2 per cent in January last year.        
	Rival car makers Fiat India Automobiles and Toyota Kirloskar Motors have already announced a price hike following the rise in cost of inputs such as steel, rubber, aluminium and copper.        
	According to industry insiders, Maruti negotiates steel prices for six months with its suppliers, and the prices of other inputs are either hedged or left open.         
	Tata Steel has already increased spot prices of its products used in automobiles and appliances by Rs 1,500 per tonne.         
	Prices of rubber, aluminium and copper rose 15 per cent, 13 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, in the quarter ended December over the preceding three months.        
	The company is working closely with vendors to cut down on imported inputs. At present, about 25 per cent of total components are imported materials. Of this, 10 per cent constitute direct imports by Maruti and the remaining 15 per cent are through vendors.        
	As part of its localisation drive, the company also plans to reduce vendor imports by 5 per cent over the next 2-3 years.         
	Localisation reduces costs by about 20 per cent, a company official said.

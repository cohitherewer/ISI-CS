	New Delhi, Nov. 7: Exporters may be hit by the US Federal Reserves (Fed) decision to buy around $600 billion in treasury bonds at a time President Barack Obama is in India to clinch deals that will generate jobs in his country.        
	Indian companies could suffer from the deluge of dollars, which the US treasury would issue to buy back debt, leading to a depreciation in the greenbacks value vis--vis other major currencies.        
	The Feds decision was made on Wednesday just two days prior to Obama starting his India tour.        
	According to top finance ministry officials, the biggest losers can be the infotech companies, already irked by the US move to raise the visa fees for Indian software professionals.        
	The rupee surged to a six-month high against the dollar on Thursday and closed at 44.20, up from a low of 52.06, 18 months back. With the dollar likely to fall further against the rupee, IT firms will be hit hard as their products will become costlier.        
	Experts say medium-sized companies and BPOs will be most affected, with many jobs moving out of India to cheaper destinations such as the Philippines.         
	Larger companies are also worried. Last week, Infosys Technologies, Indias second-biggest software firm, sought a cap on the rupees strength, saying the currencys volatility could kill exports.        
	Finance ministry officials say the government understands the US need to lower the value of the dollar against most global currencies. Thats natural and we have to accept it.         
	However, the officials admit that if the rupee falls suddenly, or to a value below 43 to the dollar, there is a problem.        
	It is a little too far-fetched to term it a currency war (the US move to print more dollars) but it does make the US industry more competitive, on the one hand, and gives cheaper credit to it. The Mexicans and the Chinese have already spoken out against it. We may make our point at the G20 summit in Korea, said officials.         
	Heads of 20 of the worlds largest economies, including India, the US, Mexico, Russia and China, will be meeting next week in Seoul to discuss the global economy and the measures required to bring it on an even keel.         
	So far, India has ruled out any step to check foreign investment inflows into the country, which are expected to increase once the US releases more dollars into the market by printing more money to buy its own debt.        
	Analysts said the worst-hit would be China, which could lose out on part of its nearly $250-billion manufacturing exports to the US as well as see the value of its huge holding of US treasury bonds depreciate. Hence, Chinese officials are more forthright in opposing the US move.         
	Xia Bin of the Central Bank of China has said, As long as the world exercises no restraint in issuing global currencies such as the dollar  and this is not easy  the occurrence of another crisis is inevitable. Xia Bin said China would look out for itself and must think about what is good for us.

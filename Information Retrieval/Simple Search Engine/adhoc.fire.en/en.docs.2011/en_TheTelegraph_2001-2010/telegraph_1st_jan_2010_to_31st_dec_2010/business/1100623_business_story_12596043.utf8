	New Delhi, June 22: India and Bangladesh today finalised a draft deal on two projects.         
	Indian PSU NTPC Ltd will set up a 1,320 mega watt (MW) coal-fired plant at Chalna near Khulna in Bangladesh, while Power Grid Corporation will participate in a cross-border transmission line linking Behrampore in Bengal to Bheramara in Bangladesh.         
	The deal will be formally signed next month in Dhaka in the presence of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed.         
	NTPC and the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) will jointly develop the project. NTPC will operate the plant, but the BPDB is likely to have majority control. Sources said the facility would cost around Rs 5,000 crore.         
	NTPC and the BPDB will invest 25 per cent of the cost as equity, while the remaining 75 per cent will be raised by NTPC in India. The BPDBs equity will be in the form of land for the project.         
	NTPC has asked the BPDB to hire consultants to work on coal import and transportation plans. Coal will be imported through Mongla port, and the BPDB will build a depot and loading terminal spread over 1,800 acres.         
	For the transmission line, Bangladesh will build the 45-km stretch from Bheramara in Kushthia district to the border, while India will link the 75-km distance from the border to Behrampore in Bengals Murshidabad district.        
	The initial capacity of the transmission line will be around 500MW, which will be upgraded to 1,000MW, although Bangladesh and India had last month signed a memorandum of understanding for the supply of only 250MW. The countries had signed an MoU on the exchange of power in off-peak hours when Hasina came to India in January.        
	Bangladesh has been trying to attract foreign investments in a string of energy projects to narrow a widening energy deficit. The country is offering 15-year tax breaks and sovereign guarantees on payments to attract $10 billion over the next seven years.

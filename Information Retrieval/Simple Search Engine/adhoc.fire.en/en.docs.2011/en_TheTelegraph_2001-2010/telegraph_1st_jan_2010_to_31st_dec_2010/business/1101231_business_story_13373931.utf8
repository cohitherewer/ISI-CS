	Mumbai, Dec. 30: Sahara India today said its subsidiary  Amby Valley  had purchased Londons Grosvenor House hotel from the Royal Bank of Scotland for 470 million.        
	Sahara said the acquisition would help the group to establish its foothold in the international luxury hotel market. It plans to add restaurants, a business centre, a night club and other facilities to the property.        
	Grosvenor House, with 420 rooms, 74 suites and 27 meeting rooms, is located in the upscale Park Lane in London and is currently managed by Marriott International.        
	Sahara and Marriott will jointly run the 80-year-old five-star hotel that overlooks Londons Hyde Park.         
	Sahara, at present, operates the Sahara Star hotel in Mumbai and owns the Aamby Valley township.        
	Grosvenor House was once home to the Duke of Westminster. The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), took control of the property in 2001 by paying 1.2 billion for 12 Le Meridien hotels as part of a sale-and-leaseback deal.        
	RBS  which received bailout funds from the British government when the global financial crisis rocked Europe  has been looking to sell the hotel along with other assets in a bid to shore up its recession-ravaged balance sheet.        
	Grosvenor House has been frequented by royalty, celebrities and business leaders since its opening in 1929. It was built in the 18th century and became the Dukes London home in 1806. It was commandeered by the government during the First World War before being knocked down and rebuilt in 1927.        
	This acquisition is part of the major expansion plans of the group. In addition to the acquisition of Grosvenor House, London will be the gateway for Sahara to introduce some of its new business ventures, internationally, Sahara Group chairman Subrata Roy said in a statement.        
	The acquisition was brokered by Richard Lewczynski of Blandford Goldsmith, the statement added.

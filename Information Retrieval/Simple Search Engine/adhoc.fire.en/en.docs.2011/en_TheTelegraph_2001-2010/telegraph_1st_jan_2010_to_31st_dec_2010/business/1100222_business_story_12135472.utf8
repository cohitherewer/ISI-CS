          OUR BUREAU                                                Big Catch        
	New Delhi, Feb. 21: Anil Ambanis Reliance MediaWorks today made a public offer to buy an additional 52.48 per cent stake in multiplex chain operator Fame India for about Rs 180.14 crore, countering an existing takeover bid by rival Inox Leisure.        
	Inox Leisure had recently signed an agreement to acquire 43.28 per cent promoters stake in Fame, and earlier this month made an open offer to buy another 20 per cent stake for Rs 51 per share.        
	Three Anil Ambani firms  Reliance MediaWorks, Reliance Capital Partners and Reliance Capital  together hold about 10.26 per cent in Fame. In a public notice, Reliance MediaWorks said it would make an open offer to acquire 52.48 per cent in Fame.           
	The open offer is made for 2.16 crore shares at a price of Rs 83.40 apiece, much higher than that offered by Inox.  
	Inoxs open offer for a 20 per cent additional stake in Fame is priced at Rs 51 per share. Inox has 42.68 per cent shareholding in the multiplex chain operator.        
	Earlier this month, Reliance MediaWorks had said it would seek action against Fame for selling the promoters stake in the theatre chain to Inox at a price much lower than it had offered earlier.         
	Reliance MediaWorks also pointed out that it had offered to acquire the promoters stake in Fame for Rs 80 a share, representing an almost 100 per cent premium to the prevailing market price.        
	Reliances offer is made on a voluntary basis and is subject to regulatory approvals.        
	Reliance MediaWorks said the offer to get control of Fame would help in consolidating its position in the exhibition industry. The notice adds that after the acquisition, Reliance MediaWorks will continue to support Fames board of directors in their endeavour to develop the business.        
	Inoxs open offer for an additional 20 per cent stake in Fame is to begin on April 1 and end on April 20. The offer was made in the first week of February by Inox along with Gujarat Fluorochemicals.

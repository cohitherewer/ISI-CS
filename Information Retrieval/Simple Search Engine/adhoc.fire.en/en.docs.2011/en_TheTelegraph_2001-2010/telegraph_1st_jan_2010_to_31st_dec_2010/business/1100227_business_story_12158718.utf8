          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                         
	Calcutta, Feb. 26: Pranab Mukherjee wanted to make mothers with small children smile by exempting toy balloons from central excise duty while presenting his budget proposals.         
	But the mothers  struggling to balance their household budget because of high food inflation  were not smiling as some of Mukherjees proposals threatened to compound their price pain.         
	I saw on television that fuel prices would rise. My experience in managing the home budget has taught me that whenever fuel prices go up, they pull up other prices, said Dolon Ganguly, a mother of two.         
	Not just fuel prices, Mukherjees proposals will also make cars, air conditioners, television sets and gold and silver jewellery, a host of computer parts and fancy eyewear dearer.         
	The entire Opposition walked out of Parliament midway through Mukherjees tax proposals, calling the budget highly inflationary.         
	In his proposals on indirect tax, Mukherjee hiked basic customs duty by 5 per cent on crude petroleum and 7.5 per cent on diesel and petrol, besides raising excise duty on petrol and diesel by Re 1 a litre. The finance ministers proposal will make diesel dearer by Rs 2.66 a litre and petrol by Rs 2.83 a litre in Calcutta.         
	Some economists think that higher prices of fuel, which gets used in transportation, agriculture, industry and even in homes, tend to push up general price levels.         
	A comparison of the wholesale price index (WPI) for all commodities with that of the WPI for fuel, power, light and lubricant  which together have a 14.23 per cent impact on the overall figure  indicates a relation between fuel price rise and higher inflation rates (see chart).         
	At the beginning of his 100-minute-plus speech, Mukherjee mentioned how rising fuel prices had contributed to inflation in food and non-food items since December 2009.         
	Later in the day, he admitted that the budget would be inflationary to some extent.         
	But as fiscal consolidation ruled his list of priorities, he chose to hit petroleum products, besides hiking excise from 8 to 10 per cent across the board.         
	The ministers proposed new excise rates  between Rs 185 per tonne and Rs 315 per tonne  for cement would push up housing costs, the realty trade said. The increase in excise duty on cement as well as on petrol and diesel will have some inflationary impact, said Sumit Banerjee, managing director of ACC.         
	S.K. Roongta, chairman and managing director of SAIL, said the two per cent increase in excise would push up steel prices to Rs 600 a tonne and contribute to higher inflation.         
	The proposals on indirect taxes, according to Mukherjee, would mop up an additional revenue of Rs 46,500 crore. The reason behind the indirect tax tweaks was apparent in the budget estimates as his direct tax proposals  with concessions to the salaried class earning over Rs 3 lakh, real estate developers and hoteliers  resulted in a revenue loss of Rs 26,000 crore.         
	The underlying principle of this approach is regressive as rich people will get benefits due to direct tax concessions while the poorer people will have to bear the brunt of rise in indirect tax rates. There is an inherent class bias in the budget, said a professor of economics at the Indian Statistical Institute who did not wish to be named.         
	According to him, the reduction in fertiliser and food subsidies despite high food inflation would complicate problems for both the urban and rural poor.         
	In a year the finance minister claims that the food security bill is ready, such measures are shocking. Higher fertiliser price will surely affect farm output, which will further aggravate the supply-side bottlenecks in agriculture and fuel food inflation, added the economist.         
	Even the Economic Survey, which was released yesterday, had warned that overall prices would increase in the coming months.         
	According to sources in the finance ministry, however, as the government is expecting a softening of food prices with the arrival of the rabi crop, it decided to focus on the lesser evil and reduce the fiscal deficit.         
	As there are signs of early cycle recovery, the thinking in the government is a 2 per cent increase in excise is unlikely to change the growth momentum, said Samiran Chakraborty, head of research (India), Standard Chartered Bank.

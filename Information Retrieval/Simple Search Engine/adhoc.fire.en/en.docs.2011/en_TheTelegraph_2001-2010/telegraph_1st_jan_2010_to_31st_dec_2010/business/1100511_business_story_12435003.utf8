	Mumbai, May 10: Reliance Power may decide to relocate its showpiece project  the proposed 7,480MW plant at Dadri, Uttar Pradesh.         
	The move is significant as the Dadri plant, flagged as the worlds largest gas-based project at a single location, is central to the battle between the two Ambani brothers over the supply of KG basin gas.        
	The Dadri unit is also mired in a legal wrangle after farmers objected to the land buyouts. The delay in land acquisition may give added impetus to the companys decision to put in place an alternative plan.         
	Reliance Power may also consider splitting the proposed 7,480MW unit into smaller projects located in states close to the origin of gas  the KG basin off the Andhra Pradesh coast  to reduce the cost of transportation of the natural resource. If the company adopts this strategy, it will benefit in several ways.         
	Financing small projects of around 3,000MW each will be easier. It will also be faster to roll out smaller projects and speed up access to KG gas.         
	Reliance Power did not respond to a questionnaire on the relocation of Dadri and plans to split the project into smaller units.        
	One could debate both scenarios. A large plant in the north would make the pipeline costs viable and gas transmitted through a south-north pipeline could be distributed to other users as well. Smaller plants closer to the load centres will have lower transportation costs and much less time will be needed to set these up rather than a mega project, said PricewaterhouseCoopers executive director Kameswara Rao.         
	In a communiqu to his employees on the impact of the Supreme Court verdict, Anil Ambani said, The gas supply arrangement needs to be suitable not only to RIL, but also to the shareholders of RNRL.         
	He reiterated Reliance Powers pledge to set up large gas-based projects.

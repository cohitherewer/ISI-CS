          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pillai: Exit mode                                  
	Mumbai, April 28: Retail industry veteran Raghu Pillai, who helped establish Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Retails business in the country, will leave the venture by the middle of the year.         
	Raghu Pillai, who has been an integral part of Reliances foray into organised retailing, has decided to step down from Reliance Retail for personal reasons and will move on during the middle of the year, the company said.         
	Pillai, president and chief executive officer (operations, strategy and business development) of the company, has not yet decided what his next assignment will be.         
	He told The Telegraph, I have been discussing this with Mukesh Ambani for a while. At this point, I dont have anything concrete. The last four years have been very intense. Perhaps, its time to do something in a different sphere and at a different level.        
	The retail industry specialist, who has worked with the Kishore Biyani-controlled Future group and RPGs Spencer chain of stores, was moved to the chairmans (Mukesh Ambani) office earlier this year to look after joint ventures and business development from what was a key operational role.        
	Over the past few months, Reliance Retail has set in place a multicultural team that has been largely hired from Thailands Tesco Lotus. Reports suggest that around 10 Thai managers are now in key positions in Reliance Retails value business and more are expected to come aboard.         
	It is a competent and experienced team, which has done this before, added Pillai referring to the new management.

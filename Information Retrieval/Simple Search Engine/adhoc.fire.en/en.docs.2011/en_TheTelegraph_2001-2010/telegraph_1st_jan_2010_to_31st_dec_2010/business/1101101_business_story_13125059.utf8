The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | NTPC rush to sign purchase deals 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      NTPC rush to sign purchase deals 
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          ACTION TIME                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (NTPC) plans to sign power purchase agreements for 13,000 mega watt (MW) before the implementation of tariff-based competitive bidding in central power projects from January.        
	The state-run producer plans to sign agreements for 75,000MW. It has already entered into pacts for 62,000MW, officials said.        
	The agreements are legal contracts signed between an electricity provider and a power purchaser.        
	NTPC is likely to sign the agreements for projects in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.        
	From January 5, the Centre will award contracts for thermal power projects and transmission systems through tariff-based bidding, sources said. This is expected to bring down the cost of electricity and help the economy to achieve a double-digit growth.         
	The policy will force PSU firms to compete with private companies to secure contracts.        
	Until now, government projects were awarded to PSUs through a cost-plus system. State-owned firms used to factor project cost and a reasonable rate of return in the price. A power ministry official said,         
	It (tariff-based bidding) will be a level-playing field for all players and will benefit the consumers, too.        
	According to analysts, tariff-based bidding will set the base for building a long-term competitive market.         
	The response from private players to tariff-based bidding has been very encouraging. The competitive bidding for four mega power projects witnessed aggressive offers, which helped to keep the project costs low.         
	All the projects went to private players  three to Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and one to Tata Power. NTPC could not bag even one.        
	NTPC sources said they were prepared to meet any competition and were confident of clinching projects. They said the prices quoted by private players were unrealistic.

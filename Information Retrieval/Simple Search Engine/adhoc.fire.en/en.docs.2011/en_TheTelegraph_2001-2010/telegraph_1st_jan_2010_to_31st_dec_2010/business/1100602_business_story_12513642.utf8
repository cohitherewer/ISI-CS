The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gold shines, Re slips
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Gold shines, Re slips

	June 1: Gold and the rupee showed contrasting trends today with the yellow metal touching new highs and the Indian currency slumping to a 15-month low against the dollar.        
	Amid a firming global trend and buying in the marriage season, gold today sizzled across all the major domestic markets.        
	The rupee today crashed 80 paise, the biggest single-day fall in 15 months, against the dollar on a sudden bearish turn in equities amid stronger dollar overseas.        
	Pure gold in Calcutta moved past Rs 19,000 per 10 gm and closed at Rs 19,085 against Rs 18,690 yesterday; in Mumbai gold rose Rs 350 to Rs 18,840 per 10 gm against the previous close of Rs 18,490.        
	In the foreign exchange market, dollar buying by banks, to meet their clients demand, and corporate houses on expectations of a further rise in the value of the US currency abroad because of the current global crisis, also weighed on the rupee, dealers said.        
	The rupee closed at 47.17, a steep fall of 1.73 per cent. Earlier, the rupee had ended lower by 81 paise on March 2, 2009.        
	The benchmark sensex slumped 372.60 points, or 2.20 per cent, on worries over the slowdown in Chinas and South Koreas economic growth.        
	European stocks, too, were trading sharply lower while US stock index futures indicated remarkably weak opening on doubts over the global economic recovery. Some euro zone countries also expanded at a sluggish pace in May.        
	As a result, it forced investors to come out from the riskier assets and go for the dollar.         
	In Europe, gold found a renewed interest among investors, as a safe haven, after the European Central Bank warned that the euro zone banks could face a fresh wave of losses.        
	The surge in gold in the country was also because of the falling value of rupee and sluggish equity markets, traders said.        
	Globally, basic resources such as gold and copper began June in bearish mood after a dismal May, dented by prospects of lower demand in Europe and even in giant commodity user China, but traders sensed prices moving towards attractive levels.        
	Benchmark base metal copper hit a one week low, while oil headed towards $70 a barrel.

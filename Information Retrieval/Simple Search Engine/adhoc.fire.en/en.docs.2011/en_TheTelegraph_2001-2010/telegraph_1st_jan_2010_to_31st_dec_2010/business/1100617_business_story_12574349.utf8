          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 16: The Birla familys bid to not let Harsh Vardhan Lodha remain the chairman of Birla Corporation has been foiled again.        
	The Company Law Board (CLB), in its order dated June 14, has dismissed a petition filed by Birla Education Trust and other Birla group entities seeking a stay on the appointment of Lodha as a director in the annual general meeting next week.        
	CLB chairman D.R. Deshmukh has not only dismissed the petition but also the plea to stall the AGM and put a freeze on the voting rights of MP Birla group shareholders.        
	In October 2009, the CLB had quashed a petition filed by a small group of shareholders alleging oppression and mismanagement. The petition has an ulterior motive of ousting the Lodhas from the management, it had said.

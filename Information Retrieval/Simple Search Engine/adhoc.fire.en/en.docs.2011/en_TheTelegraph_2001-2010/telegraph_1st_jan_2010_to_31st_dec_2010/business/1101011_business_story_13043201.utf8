The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jindals to reveal Salboni road map
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Jindals to reveal Salboni road map
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Rao: Kick-off time                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 10: The board of JSW Steel is set to meet at the end of this month to finalise the details of the much delayed first phase of its Salboni project in Bengal.        
	Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of JSW Steel and JSW group CFO, said the board would spell out the financing plan.        
	Our project in Bengal will start from April 2011. But you will get a clear picture about the first phase  details of the project, financing and execution timeline  after the board meets at the end of the month, Rao told The Telegraph over the phone.        
	JSW Steel holds a 94 per cent stake in JSW Bengal Steel, the company which is expected to set up the 10-million-tonne plant. Indias largest private steel maker will also own a 26 per cent stake in a 1,600MW power venture, with the rest being owned by group company JSW Energy.        
	The Jindals are expected to initially build a 3-million-tonne plant and a 200MW power unit, but Rao declined to be specific. Wait for the clarity after the board meet.        
	The company has shifted goalposts several times after signing an agreement with the Bengal government in January 2007. It received around 3,900 acres from the state government by the middle of 2007 and acquired another 500 acres.        
	Had the original schedule been followed, the plant should have started production from 2011. Now, the production is likely to start in the middle of 2014.        
	Jindal and the state government did maintain the timeline till the groundbreaking ceremony in November 2008.        
	But a Maoist bomb attack targeting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on that day triggered a series of events that led to the Lalgarh insurgency and the deployment of central forces.        
	However, the chief minister told leading industrialists last week that the area had been cleared and the company was building a boundary wall.         
	Yesterday, local officials of JSW Bengal did another round of bhoomi puja at the site, the second in less than two years. Given that work on the ground will take at least six months to start, the puja looks more symbolic to comfort the government that had gone all out to support the project even as the promoters did not keep their promises.        
	Rao said the financial closure would be done before construction began in April.         
	There is a possibility of JSW Bengal Steel merging with JSW Steel. We have to see whether to raise finances in the subsidiary or arrange it in the parent, Rao said.        
	The company has distributed shares to those who gave land for JSW Bengal, which had planned to do an initial public offer when the first phase neared completion. If JSW Bengal gets merged, the land losers will get JSW Steel shares.

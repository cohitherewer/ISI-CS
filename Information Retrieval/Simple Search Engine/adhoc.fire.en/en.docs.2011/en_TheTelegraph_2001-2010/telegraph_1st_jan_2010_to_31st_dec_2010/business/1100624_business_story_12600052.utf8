          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rozanov: Big plans                                  
	New Delhi, June 23: CDMA player Sistema Shyam Teleservices expects the Russian government to invest $677 million for a 20 per cent stake in the company by October.         
	Russia will fund the acquisition by using the money under the rupee-rouble debt agreement.        
	The Russian parliament (Duma) has approved the proposal. Four or five ministries are now involved in processing the proposal, Vsevolod Rozanov, president and CEO of Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltd, said.        
	Sistema Shyam, which is 73.71 per cent owned by Russias Sistema with Indias Shyam Group holding around 23.79 per cent, wants to use the money to pay for new base stations to widen its subscriber base.        
	The Russian government had planned to pick up the stake in the company by the end of 2009; this was delayed as the countrys economy ministry had not approved the investment. Russias investment in Sistema had been written into the countrys 2009 budget.        
	Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has held rupee deposits in India. Sistema said the government was required to invest this money in Indian projects, and these were the funds earmarked in the 2009 budget.         
	The last time the Russians tried to use this fund was in the 1990s when Tyazhpromexport tried to buy Burnpur-based IISCO. However, the Indian finance ministry had shot down the proposal.        
	Indian finance ministry officials have refused to comment on whether the Russian government will be allowed to use the fund for Sistema Shyam.         
	Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had in March pledged state financial aid for Sistema Shyam. The company had earlier said the Russian governments cash injection would be a financing arrangement as it included a pledge by Sistema to buy the shares within five years.        
	The deal will reduce Sistemas holding in the venture to about 54 per cent. The Russian firm has invested around $1.5 million in Indian operations and plans to pump in a similar amount within a year.        
	On being the sole CDMA operator in a market where most companies are either GSM operators, or offering both the services, Rozanov said, CDMA is the technology of choice for data and the demand for data services will increase going forward.        
	He said Sistema Shyam was expected to turn EBITDA positive in 2013. The company is betting on the data segment to increase penetration and generate higher revenues.         
	The firm also expects call tariffs to fall further. Tariff war in the telecom space will continue.         
	Sistema Shyam offered services in 12 circles and had more than 5 million users at the end of May.

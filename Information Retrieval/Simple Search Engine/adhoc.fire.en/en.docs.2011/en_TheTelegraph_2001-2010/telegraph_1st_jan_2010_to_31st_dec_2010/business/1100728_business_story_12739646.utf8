                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stake shield clause in JFE-Jindal deal 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jindal: Share story                                  
	Calcutta, July 27: JFE Steel Corporation, the fifth largest global steel maker, will have an anti-dilution right over its 14.99 per cent stake in Indias JSW Steel.        
	This clause will ensure that JFEs voting rights will never fall below this level and the Japanese company will have to invest commensurately whenever there is fresh equity raising by JSW in the future.        
	The clause might force JFE to stump up Rs 900 crore more than what it had initially planned for JSW.         
	JSW said potential equity investment by JFE could reach Rs 5,700 crore from the initial planned investment of Rs 4,800 crore.         
	JSWs stock price, which closed at Rs 1,160 on the BSE today, will govern the share subscription by the Japanese company.         
	If the Indian companys stock rises above Rs 1,365 by August 31 and remains there for a certain period, JSW will issue shares at Rs 1,500 per share, which will mean a 13.5 per cent stake for JFE at the planned investment of Rs 4,800 crore. In that case, the Japanese company will have to bring in Rs 900 crore more in two tranches.         
	If the JSW stock price does not cross the Rs 1,365-mark by August 31, JSW will issue fully convertible debentures (FCD) which will be converted into shares after 18 months at Rs 1,500. In this case too, JFE will have to shell out more to raise its stake to 14.88 per cent.        
	However, if the stock price does not close above Rs 1,365 during the tenure of the FCD, the debenture will be converted into equity at Rs 1,331. In that case, JFE will gain 14.99 per cent stake without stumping up any more money.        
	JFE said it had no plans to raise its stake further in JSW where the promoter family, led by Sajjan Jindal, would have around 40 per cent.        
	JFE vice-president Shigeru Ogura in Tokyo said: JSW made it clear that they want money but dont want to be controlled by JFE. The high stock price was also a deterrent to a greater stake.

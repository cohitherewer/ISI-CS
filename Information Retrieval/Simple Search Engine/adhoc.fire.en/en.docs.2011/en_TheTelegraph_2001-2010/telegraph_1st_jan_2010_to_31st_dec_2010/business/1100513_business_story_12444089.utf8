The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telecom suffers Trai trauma
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Telecom suffers Trai trauma
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	New Delhi/Mumbai, May 12: Telecom operators today slammed the regulators arbitrary and retrograde proposal to force established GSM players to pay another sackload of cash for radiowaves they hold in the 900Mhz band above the licensed limit of 6.2Mhz.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has said the fee for excess spectrum will be linked to the auction of 3G radiowaves, clouding the fortunes of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular.        
	Shares of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular were pounded on the bourses after brokerage analysts estimated that the telecom pioneers would have to stump up anywhere between Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 15,000 crore if the government accepted the regulators recommendations.        
	Bharti Airtel is expected to bear the brunt of the fee hike  with estimates varying from a low Rs 2,700 crore to as high as Rs 8,700 crore. The stock plunged 8.29 per cent to close at Rs 261.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Idea Cellular tumbled 4.9 per cent to Rs 54.80.        
	Reliance Communications  the company that many felt would not be scarred by the Trai proposals  gained marginally at Rs 1,476.10.        
	Vodafone Essar accused Trai of cherry-picking dozens of incompatible elements (that) resulted in a set of proposals, which are opaque, illogical and illusory.        
	All the GSM players have accused the regulator of placing an additional financial burden on the pioneer companies through the arbitrary one-time charge on a portion of old 2G spectrum but linked to 3G spectrum prices.        
	Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular hold between 6.2Mhz and 8Mhz of radiowaves in the 900Mhz band in the highly profitable circles of Delhi, Mumbai, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.         
	In Delhi, both Airtel and Vodafone have 8Mhz of spectrum in the 900Mhz band. On Tuesday, the bid price for 3G spectrum in the Delhi circle closed at Rs 2,510.51 crore for 5Mhz (or Rs 502.10 crore per Mhz). At that price, the two operators would end up paying Rs 1,356 crore each for the extra 1.8Mhz spectrum they hold over the prescribed 2G spectrum limit of 6.2Mhz.        
	Hand back spectrum        
	The telecom operators also recoiled in horror when they learnt that Trai planned to force them to return all of the radiowaves in the efficient 900Mhz band when their 20-year licences come up for renewal in four to seven years time.         
	Trai has proposed that the spectrum in the 900Mhz band will be replaced with an equal amount of spectrum in the 1800Mhz band.        
	The regulator said the 900Mhz band should be used to provide 3G and LTE (long-term evolution) services, as is the norm globally. LTE is a step towards fourth generation of radio technologies designed to increase the capacity and speed of mobile telephone networks.        
	Spectrum in the 900Mhz band is seen as more efficient as it can accommodate a greater number of subscribers than the 1800Mhz band. Telecom operators also need to establish fewer base stations and other infrastructure in the 900Mhz band. All mobile operators also hold spectrum in the 1,800Mhz band.        
	We are confident that the department of telecom and the government will take a rational approach and summarily reject these arbitrary, impractical and perverse recommendations, Bharti Airtel said. Analysts said Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications would have to pay only a negligible amount if the Trai recommendations were accepted. Most brokerages estimated its outgo between Rs 9 crore and Rs 20 crore.         
	At a conference call late in the evening on Tuesday, senior R-Com officials said the cost of excess charges on the company would be only around Rs 20 crore based on the 3G auction closing price. The company has excess spectrum only in the Bihar circle.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Inflation nears 10%-mark
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Inflation nears 10%-mark
  - Steep price rise puts pressure on apex bank         OUR BUREAU                                                  
	March 15: Inflation jumped to a 16-month high of 9.89 per cent in February, sparking talk of a rate increase by the Reserve Bank of India, which had vowed last month not to adopt any policy measures in between scheduled dates for monetary policy review unless there was an unexpected development.        
	Most economists believe that the benchmark interest rate  the reverse repo  will be raised anywhere between 50 and 100 basis points when the central bank reviews its monetary policy on April 20.        
	But the rate action could come sooner for two reasons. First, inflation is now running higher than the RBIs forecast of 8.5 per cent though it might still choose to quibble over whether this is an unexpected development.        
	Second, and more important, the central bank and the finance ministry will be hunkering down to decide on the governments large borrowing programme that has been estimated at a gross level at Rs 4.57 lakh crore this year. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond has hovered above 8 per cent in anticipation of a rate hike.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda (BoB), said the RBI might go for a strong rate action in April and raise both reverse repo and repo rates by half a percentage point.         
	We are now seeing demand pull pressures coming. There are various sectors of the industry that are growing and pricing power is returning. Moreover, food prices are still high and by March end, the inflation should be between 10.5-11 per cent, she said.         
	Nitsure, however, feels the RBI wont raise CRR (cash reserve ratio) in its monetary policy as liquidity pressures are building on the system, investment is picking up and the government is more likely to front-load its borrowing programme for the next fiscal.        
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides funds to banks against government securities, and reverse repo is that at which it absorbs liquidity. The repo rate now stands at 4.75 per cent, and the reverse repo at 3.25 per cent.         
	The CRR, which is the portion of bank deposits which must be maintained with the RBI, is now at 5.75 per cent.         
	Pressure is also building on the government to roll back fuel prices  especially diesel  which has triggered fears of a flare-up in inflation.         
	However, the government expects food inflation to cool down in the months ahead as it expects the rabi (winter) crop to be much better.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, Planning Commission boss Montek Singh Ahluwalia and RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao have tried to soothe fears by arguing that inflation will moderate in the next few months.         
	According to Kaushik Basu, chief economic adviser to the finance ministry, I would expect another month of inflation roughly like this because the base effect is going to be very strong... after that inflation should begin to die down. Commerce minister Anand Sharma, too, was upbeat. The agriculture minister has said the prospects of the rabi crop was good and that would have a positive impact in containing inflation and bringing down prices, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cap on foreign experts
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cap on foreign experts
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, June 14: The government has decided that companies could engage a maximum of 125 foreign experts in a project, addressing concerns among security agencies about Chinese personnel coming in large numbers.        
	Companies such as Anil Ambanis Reliance Infrastructure, Adani Power, Sterlite Energy, Lanco Ampara are sourcing equipment along with project personnel from abroad.        
	An inter-ministerial committee has now said that starting this month an Indian mission abroad could issue up to 40 visas to experts for a project; however, it can issue 70 visas to a foreign equipment supplier and 125 visas to a project contractor.         
	A project in the power sector is defined as two units of 660mw capacity or more. The number of permitted foreign consultants will be higher if more units are set up.        
	All extra visas will be given after consulting the ministry of labour, which will check with other agencies on the need for more personnel.        
	The government had first sought to limit the number of foreign experts a firm could hire in 2009, after reports of large numbers of Chinese personnel flooding project sites, including in sensitive areas such as the Northeast, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.        
	Besides, Indian contractors and engineers have alleged that the Chinese have a tendency to bring in mechanics and semi-skilled workers in the name of experts, taking away jobs which should have gone to Indians.         
	It also helps the Chinese to cut costs as these people are paid lower wages compared with Indians.        
	In a letter to the finance ministry last year, power equipment maker Larsen amp; Toubro had complained that the import of Chinese power equipment totalled some $8.3 billion, while Chinas tax structure made it near impossible for Indians to export equipment.        
	The government is in no position to retaliate in the form of higher taxes as there is a need to bring foreign equipment to meet the countrys ambitious generation targets.         
	As many as 14 projects aggregating 4,813 mega watts (mw) are due to be completed by the next fiscal and another 15 of 8,940mw capacity by March 2012.        
	Imposing limits on experts have, therefore, emerged as an option that meets security concerns, while protecting local jobs.        
	However, the door has been kept open for experts arriving on troubleshooting missions on short-duration visas.        
	Officials said companies have sidestepped security concerns by bringing experts on tourist and business visas.         
	This will be checked by administrative ministries and state governments, who will be tasked to keep a check on such practices.

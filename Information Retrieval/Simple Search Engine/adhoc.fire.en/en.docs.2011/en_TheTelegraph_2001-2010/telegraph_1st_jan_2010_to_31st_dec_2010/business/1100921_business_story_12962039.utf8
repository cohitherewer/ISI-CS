The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mining concession for PSUs on menu
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mining concession for PSUs on menu
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh: Mood for tweak                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: The steel ministry could seek exemptions for PSUs such as SAIL and NMDC from sharing 26 per cent of their profits in mining ventures, which had been proposed in the draft mining bill.        
	Some special consideration has to be given to PSUs for the historical role (in developing tribal areas) being undertaken in different parts of the country, steel minister Virbhadra Singh said.        
	The minister, speaking on the sidelines of a seminar organised by a global grouping of engineers, however, made it clear that he wasnt in favour of a complete exemption.        
	Last week, a group of ministers approved the draft mining bill that says miners should share 26 per cent of their profits with the locals displaced by mining projects.        
	The draft bill will be an amendment to the Mines and Mineral Development and Regulation Act, 1957 and attempts to improve the condition of poor tribals, who are affected the most by mining projects.         
	The Maoist insurgency in the mineral-rich states of eastern and central India  home to many tribals  has forced the government to rethink its development policies.        
	Singh said the amendments could be sought to the proposed bill before it was placed in Parliament. Officials said it would be difficult to exempt only PSUs; relaxations should be given to all captive miners with a strong track record of promoting development projects among tribals.        
	The new bill, likely to be placed in the winter session of Parliament, seeks to expedite the grant of mining rights in a transparent manner .        
	SAIL chairman C. S. Verma had said last week in Calcutta, Captive mines should be kept out of its (new legislations) purview. We cannot sell what we mine. It is for our captive use.         
	SAIL has captive iron ore and coking coal blocks in various parts of the country.         
	Tata Steel vice-chairman B. Muthuraman said the proposal was in the right direction but suggested that funds for locals should be allocated as part of the cost and not as a result of profit.        
	Meanwhile, Singh said the government was not opposed to Posco getting a majority stake in the proposed Rs 12,000-crore joint venture between the South Korean giant and state-run SAIL. The duo are in talks to set up a 1.5-million-tonne plant in Bokaro. The agreement between the companies is expected in the next two-three months, Singh said.

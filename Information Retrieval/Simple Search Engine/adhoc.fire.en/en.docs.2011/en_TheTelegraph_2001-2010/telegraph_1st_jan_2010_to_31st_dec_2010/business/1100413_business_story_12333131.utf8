The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Strong PC demand to spur tech spend
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Strong PC demand to spur tech spend
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 12: Global infotech (IT) spending is expected to increase 5.3 per cent to $3.39 trillion in 2010 from $3.2 trillion a year ago, research and advisory firm Gartner said today.        
	Gartner has also predicted that IT spending will continue to grow in 2011 and is projected to cross $3.5 trillion, up 4.2 per cent from the 2010 figure. Strong demand for PCs and the weakening dollar are expected to drive growth in infotech spending.         
	Following strong fourth-quarter sales, an unseasonably robust hardware supply chain in the first quarter of 2010, combined with continued improvement in the global economy, sets up 2010 for solid IT spending growth, Richard Gordon, vice-president (research) of Gartner, said.        
	According to the Gartner study, about 4 percentage points of the growth will be the result of a projected decline in the dollar value, with spending in exchange-rate-adjusted dollars to rise 1.6 per cent this year, after a decline of 1.4 per cent in 2009.        
	Gartner sees global computing hardware spending rising 5.7 per cent to $353 billion in 2010. Enterprise hardware spending will grow this year, but it will remain below its 2008 level till 2014, the study said.         
	Spending in storage is projected to grow the fastest as the volume of enterprise data that need to be stored continues to increase.         
	Near-term spending in servers will be concentrated on lower-end servers, while long-term server spending will be curtailed by virtualisation, consolidation and, cloud computing.        
	The study indicated that software spending would rise 5.1 per cent to $232 billion, with growth in the majority of enterprise software markets.        
	Global IT services spending is projected to rise 5.7 per cent to $821 billion.        
	The industry experienced some growth in reported outsourcing revenue at the close of 2009, an encouraging sign for service providers, Gartner said, adding that it saw this trend spreading to consulting and system integration this year.        
	Global telecom spending is projected at $2 trillion in 2010, a 5.1 per cent increase from 2009.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bonds shine, banks whine
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bonds shine, banks whine
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 8: Yields on the benchmark 10-year bond surged to a 17-month high today at 8.02 per cent, sparked by worries linked to the governments Rs 4,57,000 crore gross borrowing programme for 2009-10 that begins in April.        
	The rising yields expose banks to the risk of losses in their bond portfolios, particularly in the next fiscal.         
	Yields on the benchmark 2020 bond settled at 8 per cent, higher than the 7.97 per cent close on Friday.        
	Bond market circles expect the uptrend to continue because of the heavy government borrowing next fiscal even as the RBI is expected to jack up interest rates to control inflation. Large-scale bond flotations are expected to depress prices. Yields on government bonds are inversely related to their prices.        
	Many feel that yields on the benchmark bond can hit 8.25 per cent shortly and that it may even touch 8.40 per cent. Government security prices have taken a beating ever since finance minister Pranab Mukherjee announced the Centres borrowing programme.        
	The government is working on an auction calendar jointly with the central bank, and this is expected to be released in a few days. However, it is largely forecast that the government will look to borrow 60-70 per cent of its gross borrowing requirement in the first half.        
	Analysts point out that treasury income of banks can come under pressure because of the rising yields. Banks that have higher proportion of low-cost current account and savings account (CASA) and lower investments will do well. It will be the PSU banks who will be badly affected, Vaibhav Agrawal, banking analyst at Angel Broking, told The Telegraph.        
	At present, banks are required to invest at least 25 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), or deposits, in government securities.         
	Banks investments in government bonds have risen in line with high growth in deposits and weak demand for credit in the current fiscal. Till January this year, banks holding of SLR securities stood at 29.9 per cent of their NDTL.        
	Within their investment holding, banks are permitted to have up to 25 per cent of their NDTL in held-to-maturity (HTM) securities. These securities are not marked-to-market. There are two other categories: available for sale (AFS) and held for trading (HFT). Investments under HFT must be sold within 90 days, whereas investments under AFS should be marked-to-market.         
	An analyst with a leading brokerage said at present 25 to 30 per cent of banks holding in government securities are in the AFS category.

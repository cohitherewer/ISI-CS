          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, March 30: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today called for imparting fresh impetus to economic recovery to revert to a 9 per cent growth rate.         
	The first challenge before us is to quickly revert to high GDP growth of 9 per cent and then to cross the double-digit growth barrier, Mukherjee said at a convocation of the Hamdard University here today.        
	Although the countrys growth story is going through an exciting phase, he said it faced challenges, which needed to be addressed. After growing over 9 per cent for three years till 2007-08, growth slipped to 6.7 per cent in 2008-09 because of the global financial crisis.        
	For the current fiscal, the economy is expected to expand 7.2 per cent. According to the recent estimates of the Planning Commission, growth can be 8.5 per cent in 2010-11 and 9 per cent a year after that.        
	The Planning Commission expects the private sector to contribute up to $500 billion for the development of infrastructure during the Twelfth Five Year Plan period (2012-17).         
	However, this will be nearly half of the total investment projected for the period.         
	We need to do a trillion dollar (investment in infrastructure in the Twelfth Plan. Fifty per cent of investment have to come from the private sector, a senior official of the commission said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           SBI chairman .P. Bhatt in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 24: The State Bank of India (SBI) will need to raise around Rs 40,000 crore over the next five years to meet the demand for loans as the economy gathers steam.         
	The countrys largest commercial bank is looking to mop up anywhere between Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore through a rights issue in the next fiscal for which it will need the support of the government, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said on the sidelines of a CII conference here today.         
	The Rs 40,000 crore that the bank needs to raise is in addition to tier II capital (bonds) and retail deposits.         
	We need to raise some equity and we will do it in the next fiscal. It will be a rights issue. It could be anywhere between Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore, he said.         
	The SBI chief said the rights issue could succeed only if the government subscribed to it.         
	At present, the government holds 59.41 per cent in the countrys largest bank.         
	Bhatt had earlier said the bank would work with the government on fundraising after the budget as it was expected to throw some light on the capitalisation of banks.         
	He said the bank would invest between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of its annual capital expenditure in technology over the next three years.         
	The SBI plans to open around 1,000 ATMs this calendar year. We are emphasising on mobile banking along with some major technology projects such as data warehousing this year. Tenders will be issued for the payment system gateway solutions to increase the use of technology, Bhatt said, adding that the bank has 70,000 branches and 20,000 ATMs that cater to 286 million customers.         
	Bhatt said Bharti Airtel was in talks with the bank to partly fund its acquisition of the African assets of Kuwaits Zain Telecom.

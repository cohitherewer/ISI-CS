The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Seven-year itch for Ulip surrender
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Seven-year itch for Ulip surrender
          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                              
	Calcutta, May 19: Unit-liked insurance policyholders will now have to pay a charge for surrendering a plan before seven years.         
	The insurance regulator capped the maximum limit on surrender charges (as a percentage of fund value) and extended the charge till the sixth year, marking a significant shift from its earlier stand.         
	In a circular issued last August on Ulip charges, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority had ordered that no surrender charge can be levied by an insurer for policies surrendered from the fifth policy year and consequently the policyholder will be entitled to receive the full fund value on such surrender. Fund value is units with a policyholder multiplied by their NAV.        
	However, according to the latest circular, surrender of a Ulip before the completion of six years will attract a maximum charge of 2.5 per cent. This provision is applicable only for Ulips having a policy term of more than 10 years. Holders of Ulips of less than 10 years maturity, however, can get the full fund value on surrender of the policy after five years.         
	The latest regulation also keeps the surrender charge for Ulips having less than 10 years term 2.50 percentage points lower than that in the case of Ulips of more than 10 years maturity.        
	Interestingly, the surrender charge will not be applicable on single premium policies and top-up premiums.         
	Investment experts feel the new regulations will put more funds in the hands of policyholders on surrender of their policies and encourage people to go in for short-term policies, particularly single premium ones.         
	There is already a sizeable section who prefer single premium policies over regular premium ones because they are not certain about income flow in the future. People working in the farm sector and software companies are cases in point. Even last year when I got a lump sum amount, I bought a single premium policy for my grandchild, said S.B. Mathur, general secretary of the Life Insurance Council.         
	The commission paid to agents in the case of single premium policies is only 2 per cent. Hence, the overall charges in these policies are quite low compared with regular premium policies. So, there was no point in levying a surrender charge in such plans, Mathur said.        
	According to him, some insurers used to deduct the entire premium paid if policyholders surrendered their policies in the first year. The maximum deduction has now been capped at 15 per cent for Ulips of more than 10 years and 12.5 per cent for less than 10 years if the policy is surrendered in the first year.         
	Insurers are not happy with the frequent change in Ulip regulations. In July last year, Irda came with the cap on Ulip charges. It modified it in August. Last month, the regulator increased the lock-in period from three to five years and on Tuesday it came out with another regulation on surrender charges, said a senior official of a private life insurer.

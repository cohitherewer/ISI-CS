The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dreamliner delay forces AI plan tweak
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Dreamliner delay forces AI plan tweak
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Strategy change                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: The Air India board is likely to hire four Airbus 330s for the South East Asian and West Asian routes till its Dreamliner jets arrive. The board will also decide on key appointments at its board meeting later this week.        
	Air India may rent the Airbuses for a year to fly to places taking six hours to eight hours. The airline, which has run up losses of over Rs 7,200 crore, is likely to get its first Dreamliner early next year and possibly four to five more in the same year as well as a hefty compensation for a two-year delay in the delivery of the wide-bodied planes built of carbon fibre reinforced plastic.        
	However, sources said, the loss-laden airline urgently needs medium haul planes on heavy traffic routes to South East Asia and West Asia, where AI is facing stiff competition from new entrants such as Air Arabia and Air Asia as well as older players who are improving their products while cutting prices.        
	Air India executives said the Dreamliner, which offers passengers more space, wider aisles and seats, besides a smoother and quieter flight, would be flown on medium-haul routes such as India-Hong Kong, India-Singapore as well as on long-haul ones such as Delhi-Melbourne, India-UK, India-Europe and India-US.        
	Foreign hub         
	The airline has decided to do away with its Frankfurt and London hubs and save about Rs 216 crore annually.         
	Air India plans to turn New Delhis new terminal 3 into its international hub by launching three non-stop international connections this winter  Delhi-Melbourne, Delhi-Toronto and Delhi-Chicago  and by resuming flights to Seoul.        
	Key posts        
	The Air India board is likely to pick three key personnel  chief operating officer of Air India Express, chief training officer and chief information officer  during its next meeting.         
	Captain Pawan Arora is tipped to be appointed as the Air India Express chief operating officer, while Stefan Sukumar may become chief training officer and former journalist Kamaljit Rattan is likely to become chief information officer of Air India.

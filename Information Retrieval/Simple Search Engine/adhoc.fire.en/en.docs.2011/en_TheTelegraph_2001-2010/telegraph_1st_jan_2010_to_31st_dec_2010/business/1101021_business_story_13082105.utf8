                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Allied to uncork Bengal fizz
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Roy: Expanding footprint                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Kishore Chhabria-promoted Allied Blenders and Distillers plans to set up two bottling plants in the country, including one in Bengal, at a cost of Rs 65 crore.        
	We have acquired 18 acres in the industrial area near Haldia and the plant will start bottling 200,000 cases per month from the next fiscal, CEO and executive vice-chairman Deepak Roy told The Telegraph.        
	Allied Blenders and Distillers plans to set up another bottling plant in Andhra Pradesh with a capacity of 500,000 cases per month. The company, which at present outsources bottling operations, wants to have a 30-35 per cent in-house bottling capacity within a year.        
	This apart, Allied wants to have its own distillation capacity.         
	All large companies have in-house capacity to make their own spirits. We have none. If we have to grow, we must have a distillation capacity of at least 15-20 per cent. For this, we have an acquisition target in Maharashtra, and we may put up a greenfield project in Bengal, he said.        
	The Mumbai-based firm is looking to invest around Rs 250 crore in the next 18 months to build distillation capacity and acquire a manufacturing facility.         
	The company is considering offloading up to a 10 per cent stake to private equity funds followed by an IPO in the next 24 months.        
	The company has four major brands with Officers Choice in the whisky segment, Wodka Gorbatschow and Class 21 in vodka and Jolly Roger in rum.         
	Allied Blenders and Distillers is the fourth largest player in the 200-million-case Indian made foreign liquor segment after Vijay Mallya-promoted United Spirits Ltd  the largest player selling 100 million cases last year  followed by Diageo and Radico Khaitan.        
	Roy said the firm expected revenues to grow 25 per cent to Rs 1,500 crore this fiscal from Rs 1,200 crore in 2009-10. It hopes to clock volumes amounting to 15.5 million cases by the end of this fiscal from 12.4 million cases last year. One case carries nine litres or 12 bottles of 750 ml each.        
	The firms flagship brand Officers Choice, which is the second largest brand in terms of sales in India, contributes over 85 per cent to volume sales and is growing at over 30 per cent annually.         
	Last year, we sold 12 million cases and the target is to cross 15 million cases this year, he said.

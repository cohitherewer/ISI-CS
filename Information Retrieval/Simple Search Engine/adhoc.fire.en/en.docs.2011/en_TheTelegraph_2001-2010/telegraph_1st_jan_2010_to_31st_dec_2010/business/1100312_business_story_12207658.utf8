          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Disrupted connection                                  
	New Delhi, March 11: BSNL employees are up in arms over the PSU telecom firm accepting the proposals of a high-powered committee to improve its financial health.        
	The employees union of BSNL has threatened a nationwide protest against the boards decision to accept the proposals of the Sam Pitroda panel that suggested divestment of up to 30 per cent and voluntary retirement of around one lakh staff.        
	All the officers associations and staff unions will hold demonstrations across the country on March 15 to protest the boards decision. If the government does not wake up to our protest, we will decide on the future course of action, including strike, V.A.N. Namboodiri, convener of a joint forum of executives and non-executives unions and associations, told The Telegraph.        
	Telecom services, however, will not be disrupted, Namboodiri said.        
	The Sam Pitroda committee  set up by the Prime Ministers Office to revive the deteriorating financial health of the company  has also suggested that the telecom firm raise funds from the sale of its infrastructure assets such as signal towers and real estate.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, worried about the steep decline in BSNLs profitability over the years, had appointed Pitroda as the head of the committee, which had banker Deepak Parekh and telecom secretary P.J. Thomas as members. The Pitroda panel had also said BSNL, which has over 40,000 towers in 20 circles, should follow private companies such as Bharti and Idea Cellular that raised their valuations by selling towers for huge sums.         
	BSNL has seen its profit fall to about Rs 570 crore in 2008-09 from over Rs 10,000 crore in the previous fiscal.        
	WiMAX franchise        
	The government today said it had shortlisted four companies, including Teracom and Adishwar India, for BSNLs WiMAX franchise.        
	The companies shortlisted for franchise of BSNL WiMAX are Teracom, Take Solutions, Adishwar India and Ampoules amp; Auto, minister of state for communications and IT, Gurudas Kamat, told the Rajya Sabha a written reply.

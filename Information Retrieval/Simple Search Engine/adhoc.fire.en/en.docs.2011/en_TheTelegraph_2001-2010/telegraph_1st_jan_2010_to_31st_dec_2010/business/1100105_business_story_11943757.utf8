	Calcutta, Jan. 4: Harsh Mariwala-led personal care products maker Marico Ltd today said its Malaysian unit had acquired hair styling brand Code 10 from Colgate-Palmolive Company for an undisclosed sum.        
	The deal marks Maricos entry into the Malaysian hair styling market, the company said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	It meets two requirements. It enables us to enter Malaysia and helps us to grow our strengths  hair cream and hair gels, Marico chief finance (HR and strategy) Milind Sarwate said.        
	The Malaysian hair styling market is estimated at 150 million ringgits ($43.86 million). Code 10 is No. 3 in Malaysia with a double-digit market share. Marico is present in Malaysia through flagship brands Parachute and Nihar. The current turnover of Code 10 is around Rs 12 crore annually, Sarwate said.        
	According to the company, Colgate-Palmolive will continue to distribute Code 10 products, comprising hair creams and gels, for six more months under a transition services agreement. Code 10 brings strong consumer equity. We believe that with investments behind the brand, it can chart a new growth trajectory for itself. It provides us with a platform in Southeast Asia, Vijay Subramaniam, CEO (international business) of Marico, said.        
	Marico is also vying with Godrej Consumer Products Ltd to buy British skincare brand Simple, one of the largest beauty product brands in the UK. Simple was recently put on the block by promoter Duke Street Capital, a private equity group in the UK. Its brand value is around $250 million.

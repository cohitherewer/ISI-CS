The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Vodafone moves Supreme Court

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Redial mode                                   
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: Telecom operator Vodafone today moved the Supreme Court against Bombay High Courts order upholding the jurisdiction of the income tax department to levy a tax of Rs 12,000 crore on its acquisition of a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in 2007.        
	Vodafone remains convinced that there is no tax to pay on the Hutchison transaction and we will continue to defend this position vigorously, the company said in a statement.        
	Last week, Bombay High Court had dismissed Vodafones petition challenging the claim slapped by the income tax authorities.         
	The tax department contended that Hutchison should be taxed for capital gains, since the assets of the acquired company were based primarily in India.        
	In May 2007, Vodafone bought Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltds 66.98 per cent stake in Indian telecom firm Hutchison Essar for $11.2 billion (around Rs 52,300 crore today).         
	Hutchison controlled its Indian subsidiary through a Cayman Island company called CGP, whose shares were sold to Vodafone.        
	Vodafone contends that the Indian law does not give tax authorities jurisdiction over the overseas transfer.         
	The tax authorities dispute the contention and maintain that Vodafone should have deducted tax at source before paying Hutchison.        
	Analysts said several countries had look through provisions in their legislation, which allowed the government to tax deals similar to the one between Vodafone and Hutchison.         
	Indian tax laws, however, do not have such provisions.         
	The direct tax code bill, 2010, which was introduced in Parliament recently, proposes to tax the transfer of shares outside India in a foreign company, in proportion to the market value of assets located in India.         
	This rule will apply if the market value in India exceeds 50 per cent of the value of all assets owned by the foreign company.

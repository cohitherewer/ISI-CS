	Calcutta, Oct. 31: Mercedes-Benz India plans to sell 500 used cars this year  which is 10 per cent of its target of 5,000 cars for the period. Sales will be undertaken through Proven Exclusivity, its global pre-owned car business, which was launched in the city recently.        
	Till September, Mercedes had sold 4,221 units countrywide, said Debasish Mitra, director (sales and marketing) of Mercedes-Benz India.         
	If the current sales trend continues for the rest of the three months, we can achieve the 5,000 figure easily, he said.         
	The company sold 3,200 cars in 2009, 400 less than what it sold in 2008.         
	The demand for cars has grown around 80 per cent, reflecting a buoyancy in the market. In a double-pronged approach, the company is pushing its used car business, which it launched in May.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      H.M. Nerurkar (second from left), managing director of Tata Steel, with NMDC chairman Rana Som (second from right) in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture				                                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 22: Tata Steel has entered into a grand pact with public sector NMDC Ltd that brings within its sweep a wide range of activities  from building steel plants and setting up iron ore beneficiation units in India to scouting for mines both within and outside the country.        
	Moreover, the combined strengths of Indias No. 2 steel producer and No. 1 iron ore company could scythe through the seemingly insurmountable problems, such as acquiring land, that dog any large project in the country.        
	Rana Som, chairman of NMDC, termed the memorandum of understanding signed today with Tata Steel managing director Hemant Nerurkar in Calcutta as historic. NMDC is the eighth largest iron ore producer in the world as is Tata Steel in its line of business.         
	Never before has a miner and a steel company come forward to work together on all fronts  mining, steelmaking, beneficiation and infrastructure sharing.        
	Only earlier this week, ArcelorMittal and BHP Biliton  the largest steel producer and the biggest miner in the world  began discussions to integrate their iron ore interests in Liberia and Guinea in Africa, but the talks were limited to mining only.        
	Som and Nerurkar indicated that their strategic alliance would be more inclusive.         
	To begin with, both companies will stand to gain in Karnataka, where all steel giants are keen to set up plants.        
	Apart from Posco and ArcelorMittal, NMDC and Tata Steel have separately been pursuing plans to build plants in the southern state, and there is now a distinct possibility that the duo can do it jointly.        
	We are setting up working groups to explore possibilities where two companies can work. They will identify the areas in the next two months, Nerurkar said.        
	Eventually, it could lead to specific joint venture companies for different projects.        
	Likely gains        
	The Tatas and NMDC can gain in many ways from the alliance.        
	Tata Steel will help NMDC realise its dream to become an integrated player by offering insights in steel making.        
	NMDC, on the other hand , will share knowledge on beneficiation  a process by which low grade iron ore is used in steelmaking  with the Tatas.         
	NMDC is setting up a 3 million tonne beneficiation plant in Chhattisgarh, where it has rich deposits of ore, using a technology developed by its own research team.        
	More importantly, NMDC brings the PSU tag to the collaboration, signifying government ownership of projects.        
	Corporate India is today finding it difficult to acquire land. Tata Steels projects in Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh are facing troubles over acquisition. Similar is the case with Posco and ArcelorMittal.         
	Government participation evokes trust, which is lacking in several land acquisition process in the country today, Som said.         
	NMDC being a PSU is able to operate in Maoist strongholds in Chhattisgarh. It has also acquired land for greenfield projects in the state.        
	Specific opportunities         
	If the Tatas and NMDC plan to work together in Karnataka, they may be able to get land and surface rights for mining easily.        
	Among other areas of collaboration are joint exploration of mines in Jharkhand.         
	NMDC may also set up beneficiation plants at the iron ore mines of the Tatas.        
	The two may also jointly develop a deep water port in Karnataka.         
	The Vijaynagar Area Development Authority has invited NMDC to set up a deepwater port at Tadri, which is located between Goa and Mangalore.

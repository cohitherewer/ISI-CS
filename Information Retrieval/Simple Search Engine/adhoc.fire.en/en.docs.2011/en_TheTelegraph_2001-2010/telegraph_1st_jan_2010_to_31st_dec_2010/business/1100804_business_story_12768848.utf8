          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions today reported a 22 per cent rise in net profit at $172.2 million for the second quarter ended June 30 against $141.3 million during the same period last year.        
	Revenues increased 42 per cent to $1.105 billion from $776.6 million a year ago.        
	Cognizant has, however, revised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2010, and expects its earnings to rise 36 per cent to $4.46 billion. At the end of the first quarter, it had projected a 25 per cent growth at $4.1 billion. The company expects its third quarter revenue to be at least $1.175 billion.         
	During the quarter, spending levels were very strong across clients in all our business segments and geographies. Our clients are investing again in discretionary programmes to foster growth and innovation. We saw particular strength in the financial services segment, which had been hit hard by the global credit crisis, CEO Francisco DSouza said.        
	Cognizant, which has most of its software-development centres in India, has been performing well in the past several years.         
	We benefited from a surge in the initiation of discretionary projects over the past several months  in part because of the pent-up demand created by the deferment of discretionary spending last year, chief financial and operating officer Gordon Coburn said.         
	We remain focused to ensure that we have the infrastructure, people and processes necessary to support strong growth, while maintaining industry-leading quality and client satisfaction. We believe we are succeeding in this goal.

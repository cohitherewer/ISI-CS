The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax trouble
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Tax trouble
                                Even after submitting Form 15G in time indicating my PAN for non-deduction of tax at source, the SBI has deducted tax from my interest on fixed deposits. Since my annual income is much lower than the taxable income, I am not submitting income tax return. The bank authorities are apparently expressing difficulties to refund the deducted amount. What shall I do?          Sooma Mukherjee, Calcutta
                    We get such instances pertaining to the State Bank of India quite often. Now, when the tax has been deducted and submitted to the income tax authority bank officials cannot give you the refund. You shall have to claim the refund through filing income tax return. In that case, make sure that the bank gives you the TDS certificate. Along with this, you write a complaint letter (with duplicate copies) citing what has happened with you and how you have been subjected to harassment and monetary losses. Give the bank one copy of it and get the acknowledgement receipt by the bank on the other copy. After waiting for a month, approach the banking ombudsman at the Reserve Bank office on N.S. Road, Dalhousie if the bank doesnt take any corrective action to your satisfaction within this period.                                  For sons future      I retired from WBSEDCL on March 31 last year and now I am a pensioner. My only son, who is now 28-years-old, has been suffering from schizophrenia since 1997. After my death, he will not be able to earn a living for himself. Reading the article on immediate annuity plans in the Personal Finance page of The Telegraph, I want to buy such a plan so that my son may get some monthly income after my death. Is it possible to buy such a joint life annuity plan jointly with him?        Nemai Banerjee, Patuli
                    Life Insurance Corporations Jeevan Akshay plan doesnt provide for joint life annuity with son. However, the insurer has a plan called Jeevan Aadhar for dependants who are handicapped. Other life insurers, such as HDFC Standard Life, have immediate annuity plans where you can include your son as the recipient of the annuity after your death. But the annuity rates in the case of other insurers are lower than that of LIC.

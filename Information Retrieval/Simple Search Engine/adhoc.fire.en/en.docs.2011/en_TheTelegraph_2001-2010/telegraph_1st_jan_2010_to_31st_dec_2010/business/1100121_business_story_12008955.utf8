	Calcutta, Jan. 20: Bengal IT minister Debesh Das today said the state lacked branding and perception.         
	He was speaking on the sidelines of Infocom 2009-10, the IT conference and exhibition organised by Businessworld, an ABP Group publication. The event was kicked off by the minister today.        
	Its not too late to initiate a change. Lets spread the information, which is true about Bengal. Truth will bring in more business opportunities and will enable us to have a better place in the global ICT (information and communication technology) arena, Das said.        
	He said there was a need for entrepreneurs. The state is ready to provide plug-and-play infrastructure for entrepreneurs to start business till the time they find it feasible to initiate the next step.        
	D.D. Purkayastha, managing director and CEO of ABP Group, said Infocoms mission was to develop a platform for IT firms, for better networking, better opportunities and to explore the future course of action.         
	The events aim, he said, was to pave the way for more firms to come to Bengal.         
	Das said the state IT and ITeS industry would employ over 1 lakh this year from 90,000 at present.        
	SBI facility        
	The State Bank of India (SBI) is working on a technology to enable customers to get mobile banking facilities even from low-end handsets, deputy managing director (IT) A. Krishna Kumar said.        
	The SBI launched its mobile banking service in 2008. We are now working on how to extend the service to low-end handsets, Kumar said.         
	Earlier, the SBI customers could access this service only from some specific high-end handsets.

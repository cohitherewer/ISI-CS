	Calcutta, April 12: Tata Steel today said it was ready to face a social audit by an independent agency for the next five years to assess the impact of its proposed plant at Kalinganagar on the project-affected people.        
	The company plans to build a 6-million-tonne plant in two phases, according to a memorandum of understanding signed with the Orissa government on November 17, 2004. However, the steel major has not been able to relocate all the villagers.        
	The audit will establish through facts and figures how our project will impact those who will move out from the site. Let it be transparent, Tata Steel managing director Hemant Nerurkar said in Calcutta today.        
	So far, around 800 families have shifted from the project site. Four years back, 12 villagers protesting the project died in police firing.        
	There are still about 300 families occupying the plot. The company has been negotiating with them for years. It has set up three resettlement colonies under the Tata Steel Parivar scheme, offered medical help through the Tata Steel Rural Development Society and provided training programmes. These initiatives are in addition to the cash compensation.         
	If there is any problem, I am ready to correct. But one cannot agitate and block the project only with a perception that an industrial project will make peoples life worse, Nerurkar said.        
	He said that all companies could consider social audits while acquiring land and displacing people for new projects.        
	Tata Steel conducts social audits once in a decade wherever it has its operations. The next one is due in 2011.         
	The company wants the audits every year to convince the local people and social organisations opposing the project. It may also carry out similar audits at other greenfield project sites in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.        
	The social audit will assess the social and environment impact of the project.        
	The announcement of the audit comes at a time Tata Steel is struggling to retain its top slot among private steel players. It is expanding capacity to 10 million tonnes in Jamshedpur where no more units can be put up. However, its nearest competitor  Sajjan Jindals JSW will ramp up its Bellary plant to 16 million tonnes, making it Indias largest single site steel factory.        
	The Tatas need to begin work in Kalinganagar to expand in India. The project at Chhattisgarh in the Bastar region is facing resistance from the locals and Maoists. The new project at Saraikela in Jharkhand has not made much progress either.        
	Price pinch        
	Nerurkar said the production costs at its European operations could go up by $120-140 a tonne on the back of higher coal and iron ore prices.        
	Iron ore prices could go up 70-80 per cent in the current quarter from $65 a tonne to $110 a tonne. Similarly, coking coal prices are expected to touch $220 a tonne from $125 a tonne, he said.        
	However, the cost impact is expected to be much lower for Tata Steels Indian operations.

	Calcutta, March 1: Around 2,000 employees of two sick public sector outfits  Burn Standard and Braithwaite  have reason to cheer.         
	The department of heavy industry (DHI) is ready to approach the cabinet to seek the transfer of the two companies to the Indian Railways.         
	We want to transfer them on a clean slate basis to the railways, Satyanarayana Dash, secretary of the DHI, said here today.        
	The railways have done a due diligence exercise on Burn Standard and Braithwaite. They are expected to send their response in a week. The DHI will incorporate the railways views in its note to be sent to the cabinet for approval.        
	In her budget speech last year, railway minister Mamata Banerjee had announced plans to take over the two companies that primarily make railway wagons.         
	Both companies, with headquarters in Calcutta, have a significant presence in Bengal.         
	The revival of the two sick units has been hanging fire for years. The railways move not only ends the uncertainty but also helps Banerjee score politically in her home state.        
	Dash said the two companies had liabilities worth around Rs 1,400 crore, including accumulated losses and interest on loan among others.

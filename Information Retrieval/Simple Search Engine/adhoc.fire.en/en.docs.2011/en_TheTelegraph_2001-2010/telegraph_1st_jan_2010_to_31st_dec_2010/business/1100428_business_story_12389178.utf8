          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Return route                                  
	Calcutta, April 27: Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) today entered into three separate agreements with Australias Rocklands Richfield after the latter spurned the Indian companys takeover bid earlier this year.        
	Jindal Steel will also get a board berth in the company in lieu of the existing 14 per cent stake and the commitment of an additional seat if its holding crosses 19 per cent.        
	The agreements span across three countries  India, Australia and China.        
	In India, Rocklands and JSPL will build a facility at Raigarh to produce house bricks from coal waste.        
	In Australia, Jindal and Rocklands will jointly develop two coking coal blocks at Queenslands Bowen Basin.        
	Moreover, Jindal will help Rocklands to expand the latters metallurgical coke plant in China.        
	Todays surprise announcement is seen as the culmination of over eight months of hectic negotiations by Jindal Steel to seize control of the Australian company.        
	JSPL wanted to buy Rocklands and made an initial offer in September last year. It then sweetened the bid a number of times to match a competing offer from a Chinese company.         
	The Australian company eventually rejected JSPLs offer in January and terminated the sale talk.        
	Jindal Steel, which is in search of imported coking coal to expand its steel business in India, did not give up.         
	Rocklands chairman Benny Wu came to Delhi earlier this month and held a series of discussions with JSPL executives, which resulted in the agreements announced today.        
	The Naveen Jindal-owned company is keen on the joint development of two mines in Australia.        
	Rocklands owns 60 per cent in one of the mines and 100 per cent in the other. JSPL will make a draft development plan for the mines and submit it to the Australian company.        
	It is not yet clear how much stake Jindal Steel will pick up in either mine. The Australian company has three mines  all in Queensland.        
	The Jindals were unsure of the actual reserves in the three mines even as Rocklands had estimated it to be 900 million tonnes. As a result, JSPL could not arrive at a fair price during the bidding process.        
	Indian venture        
	JSPLs project in India with Rocklands may cost Rs 40 crore. Jindal will provide 50 acres for the plant that will make bricks from coal waste.         
	The plant will have an initial capacity of 150,000 tonnes of brick, which can go up to 600,000 tonnes based on demand. Rocklands will provide Chinese technology to make brick from coal waste.

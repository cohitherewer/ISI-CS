	Calcutta, Dec. 17: Toyota Motor is pinning high hopes on its latest offering  the Etios  to double sales in 2011.

	We are closing 2010 with sales of 74,000 units and planning to hit the 1,50,000-mark in 2011, of which 70,000 will be of the Etios sedan and the Liva hatchback, said Koji Nagata, executive managing coordinator and director, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM), during the launch of the sedan here.        
	The increase in sales will raise Toyotas share in the passenger car segment to 37 per cent from 11 per cent now. Having sold 54,000 vehicles in 2009, Toyota has witnessed a 40 per cent growth in sales this year. Both the Etios sedan and the hatchback will be produced at TKMs new plant in Bidadi near Bangalore, which has an annual production capacity of 70,000 units.         
	The plant, set up at an investment of Rs 3,200 crore, will produce only the Etios vehicles. It is currently on a single shift production and will start double shift next year, said Nagata.         
	The companys first plant, which was set up in 1997 at an investment of Rs 1,700 crore, has a capacity of 80,000 vehicles. It manufactures the Innova, the Altis and the Fortuner. The company also sells the Land Cruiser 2000, the LC Prado, the hybrid Prius and the sedan Camry.        
	The Etios Liva hatchback, which was showcased here along with the sedan, is due for launch in April next year. While the sedan has received a nationwide booking of 13,000 units, of which 300 units are from Bengal, the hatchback bookings will open next year.

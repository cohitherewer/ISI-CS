The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Surrender value
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Surrender value
                                My daughter-in-law bought a unit-linked policy from Aviva Life Insurance India (policy number NLG 123735) on July 5, 2006 for a monthly premium of Rs 1,000. On September 7, 2009 the policy was surrendered. During this period a total premium of Rs 38,000 was paid. Aviva has given a cheque of Rs 17,995 as the surrender value of the policy. The remaining amount was deducted as charges for surrendering the policy. According to the statement of accounts as on April 15, 2009, the fund value was Rs 25,218. After that another four monthly premium installments were paid. Was Aviva right in calculating the surrender value?            S.K. Chakraborty, Salt Lake
                Yours, like many other Ulip buyers, is a classic example of what can happen when you buy a financial product without clearly understanding how it works. Ulip is a complex product and till September 2010 insurers selling Ulips imposed hefty charges on early surrenders while their agents mis-sold the product. However, from September this year the insurance regulator has put a cap on surrender charges. For your case, you once again go through the terms and conditions of the policy pertaining to surrender. If you find any anomaly in the charges actually deducted from what was mentioned in the policy document, you can approach the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority or the insurance ombudsman to settle the dispute.                                  Home loan      I had purchased a residential flat in April 2010 for Rs 45 lakh. I took a bank loan of Rs 30 lakh for this. I sold my existing residential flat where I have been residing since last four years in August 2010 for Rs 30 lakh. The indexed cost for this flat is Rs 20 lakh. If I repay Rs 30 lakh to my lender bank from the above sale price will it amount to utilisation of my sale proceeds for the purchase of the new flat and can I get capital gains tax exemption?         Sweta Lakra, Lake Town
                    Yes, you can claim exemption on capital gains tax from sale of your current residential property since you have purchased the new property in the same year. However, if you repay the bank loan within five years, you cannot claim any tax deduction on the interest and principal repayment of the housing loan.

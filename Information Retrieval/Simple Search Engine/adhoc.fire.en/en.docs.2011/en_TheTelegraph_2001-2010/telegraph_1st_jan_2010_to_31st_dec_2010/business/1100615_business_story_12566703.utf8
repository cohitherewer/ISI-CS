	Calcutta, June 14: Tata Tea, the worlds second largest packaged tea company, is stepping up its presence in Pakistan and Bangladesh to capture at least 10 per cent share of the packaged tea markets in both the countries over the next two years.        
	We are in the process of enhancing our distribution networks for tea business in Pakistan and Bangladesh and will increase point of sales, Sangeeta Talwar, executive director of Tata Tea, said here today.        
	Tata Tea has a 7 per cent market share in Pakistan and 5 per cent in Bangladesh. The company plans to grow in the geographies it is already present, she said. We dont see good prospects in other south Asian markets where we are not present now, Talwar added.        
	India contributes the most to Tata Teas global business, while Sri Lanka comes second in south Asia.         
	South Asia accounts for about a third of Tata Teas global revenue.         
	Tata Tea, which has recently formed a 50:50 joint venture with PepsiCo for non-carbonated ready-to-drink beverages in the health and wellness category, expects to launch its first product by the end of this year.

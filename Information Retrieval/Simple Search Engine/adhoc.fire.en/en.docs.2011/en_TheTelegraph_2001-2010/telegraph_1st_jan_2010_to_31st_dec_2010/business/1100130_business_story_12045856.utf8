          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 29: The Reserve Bank of India today took its first step towards monetary tightening by ordering banks to set aside more cash as reserves after raising its forecasts for economic growth this year to 7.5 per cent and warning that inflation could rise as well to 8.5 per cent.        
	The central bank raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR)  a monetary device that it uses to soak up excess cash from the financial system  by 75 basis points to 5.75 per cent, which was more than what bankers and economists were expecting.         
	It, however, kept short-term interest rates unchanged but the speculation lurked that it could tweak these when it reviewed the monetary policy next in April.         
	The CRR is that portion of bank deposits that must be maintained with the RBI. Its increase, which signals the end of the central banks expansionary monetary policy, will suck Rs 36,000 crore out of the banking system.        
	The first 50-basis-point hike will be effective from February 13 while the next 25-basis-point hike will take place on February 27. Bankers had expected the RBI to raise the CRR by up to 50 basis points.         
	The sensex swooned below 16000 for the first time this year soon after the monetary policy was announced as the market was surprised by the central banks hawkish tone. After hitting a low of 15982.08, the market rebounded to close at 16357.96, notching up a gain of 51 points.        
	Rate status quo seen        
	Excess liquidity in the banking system is now put at Rs 70,000 crore. The CRR increase will thus drain nearly half of this liquidity.         
	However, bankers feel that interest rates are unlikely to head north at least immediately as there is ample money in the system, non-food credit is growing at a tardy pace and 98 per cent of the projected government borrowing was over.        
	Although the central bank left both the repo rate and the reverse repo rates  the two key short-term policy rates  unchanged at 4.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent, respectively, the tone was hawkish in its third-quarter review of the monetary policy.        
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides funds to banks against government securities and reverse repo is that at which it absorbs liquidity.         
	The hawkishness was clearly evident when the central bank drastically increased its inflation projection for the year to 8.5 per cent from 6.5 per cent with an upside bias as estimated earlier.        
	RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao told reporters that the upside risk in terms of higher food prices reflecting the poor south-west monsoon has already materialised. Some additional factors such as higher global crude prices and less-than- expected seasonal moderation in food prices have also exerted upward pressure on inflation.         
	Subbarao, however, added that on the assumption of a normal monsoon and global oil prices remaining around the current levels, inflation could moderate from July.        
	A candid RBI governor admitted that framing the policy decision this time was more complex and challenging than it had been in the past 18 months. Getting out of an expansionary policy is more complex than getting into it.         
	Subbarao said the RBI did consider raising the reverse repo rate while framing the monetary policy, but chose to hike the CRR as its main objective was to control liquidity and not signal a rate hike.         
	An advantage of raising the CRR is that the central bank will know the quantity of liquidity coming out of the banking system.         
	An increase in the reverse repo will not have the same effect as the banks can then exercise their discretion in parking excess funds with the RBI.        
	The RBI was, however, gung-ho in its outlook for the economy when it upped the GDP growth estimate to 7.5 per cent from 6 per cent with an upward bias estimated last October.                                                                           
	It noted that the recent movements in the indicators of real sector activity suggested that the upside bias, it projected last year had materialised.        
	Assuming a near zero growth in agricultural production and continued recovery in industrial production and services sector activity, the baseline projection for GDP growth for 2009-10 is now raised to 7.5 per cent. Looking ahead to 2010-11, our preliminary assessment of the baseline scenario is that the current growth will be sustained, it added.        
	However, it did outline some risk factors that could endanger this growth. These include uncertainty about the pace and shape of the global recovery, surge in oil prices, uncertainty about the performance of the south-west monsoon in 2010, sharp increase in capital flows which may complicate exchange rate and monetary management and accentuation of inflation expectations, if excess liquidity is allowed to persist.        
	In addition, a bigger risk to both short-term economic management and to medium-term economic prospects emanates from the large fiscal deficit. As the recovery gains momentum, it is important that there is co-ordination in the fiscal and monetary exits, RBI added.        
	It urged the government to return to a path of fiscal consolidation that could begin with a phased roll back of the transitory components. It also urged that the government to indicate a road map for fiscal consolidation and also spell out the broad contours of tax policies and expenditure compression that will define this road map.        
	While the central lowered its estimate for non-food credit growth to 16per cent for this year as it felt that the earlier projection of a 18 per cent growth would not be realised.

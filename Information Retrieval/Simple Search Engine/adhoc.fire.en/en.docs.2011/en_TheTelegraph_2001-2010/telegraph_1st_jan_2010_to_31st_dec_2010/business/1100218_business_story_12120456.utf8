          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          New message                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: The government today offered to help Bharti in securing the African assets of Kuwaits Zen.        
	The Bharti management has not approached us yet. If they do, I will be very happy to help them because when they go out, its not the company alone but they are our flag-bearers. We will do the utmost of what we can, said corporate affairs minister Salman Khurshid.        
	Indias No. 1 mobile operator Bharti had entered into exclusive talks with Zain till March 25 for buying its African operations based on an enterprise value of $10.7 billion (Rs 50,000 crore).        
	We will be happy to pitch in to help Bharti to compete with the best in the world, said Khurshid.        
	Bharti has been trying to enter Africa, one of the worlds fastest-growing markets, as competition hots up in India. Last year, the company failed to buy South Africas MTN Group for about $23 billion.         
	We have matured enough to see multinational companies emerge out of India. We are very happy to see an Indian company expand its footprint overseas, said Khurshid.        
	Asked about the regulatory roadblocks that the company may face, Khurshid said, Nothing has been brought to our notice yet. In the past (referring to Bhartis failed bid for MTN), there were obviously policy issues.        
	As far as the present information (regarding Zain) is concerned, nothing has come to us. But if anything comes to us, as I said, we will do whatever, we can, he said.        
	Last month, Bharti bought a 70 per cent stake in Warid Telecom of Bangladesh. The African venture could become the years largest telecom deal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New SAIL chief hunt
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      New SAIL chief hunt
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Roongta: Retirement time                                  
	New Delhi, May 2: The government is unhappy with the selection exercise for the next chairman of Steel Authority of India Ltd. The steel ministry would like to give temporary charge of the company to one of its top directors after existing chairman S.K. Roongta retires at the end of this month.         
	The Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) had shortlisted two names  Bhels director (finance) C.S. Verma, who topped the list, and Arup Roy Chowdhury of National Buildings Construction Corporation Ltd (NBCC).         
	However, the ministry feels the steel PSU needs someone with greater experience in the business.        
	C. S. Verma has been the finance director at Bhel for the last five years. He is believed to be a financial ace and has the support of the Prime Ministers Office. But he is not seen to have sufficient knowledge of the industry to enable him to lead SAIL against domestic and global leaders such as Tata Steel, ArcelorMittal and Posco.        
	No. 2 candidate Arup Roy Chowdhury, a civil engineer heading NBCC, is considered too junior to take on the SAIL chiefs mantle.        
	The chairman of SAIL is one of the few top PSU jobs equivalent to the rank of a secretary in the government. Sources said Chowdhury had the backing of a former industry minister from the Northeast.         
	There has been speculation that the government may give Roongta an extension, but that is unlikely as there are no precedents, sources said.        
	One of SAILs senior directors may head the company for a few months  this could be either V.K. Srivastava, who heads Bokaro Steel, or S. Bhattacharya, the director (finance).         
	Bhattacharya has more months to go before he retires and is better suited for the temporary charge, in case the government decides to start a fresh hunt for a permanent chairman.         
	The chairmans post is crucial as SAIL is undertaking a Rs 70,000-crore expansion programme to ramp up its production to about 23 million tonnes from around 14 million tonnes by 2012 in the face of increased competition from global players. The incumbent has to be a deft manager with vast experience in the steel business.         
	It will not be an easy task for the new chief who is being brought in when most of the managing directors of SAILs major plants are due to retire and will be replaced by new men.         
	A separate selection list has been prepared for the post of managing directors of Bhilai, Bokaro and IISCO Steel Plant. Among the names doing the rounds are S.C. Verma, executive director (project) at Rourkela, R. Kulshreshtha, executive director at the Delhi head office of SAIL, S. Mohanty, executive director (projects) at Bhilai, A.K. Saxena from ArcelorMittal and T. Suresh, executive director (projects), at Bokaro.         
	The list finalised by the PESB is now with the steel ministry which will send it to the appointment committee of the cabinet soon.         
	Saxena is a surprise candidate as he is the only one outside the PSU fraternity though he has earlier worked with SAIL. Sources said most of the names were project heads as SAIL was undertaking a modernisation programme and they were being highlighted.         
	However, old-timers within the steel firm said people should also be brought in from marketing, finance and steel making, besides the increasingly important raw material department.

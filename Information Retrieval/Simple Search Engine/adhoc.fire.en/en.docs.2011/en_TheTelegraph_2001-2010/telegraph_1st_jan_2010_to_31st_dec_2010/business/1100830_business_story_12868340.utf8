        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay finds out the best possible combination for your familys health insurance plan                                            
	Good health comes at a cost  regular exercises, annual medical check-ups, wellness spas and so on. If you are ready to take so much effort to be in good shape, dont forget to get a good health insurance cover for yourself and your family to take care of your medical expenses.         
	The insurance regulator will soon come out with new norms in health cover to standardise, among other things, pre-authorisation and claim procedures, hospitalisation costs and the list of excluded expenses.        
	The regulator also wants that five years from now insurers settle all claims related to health insurance on a cashless basis.         
	Key features        
	At present, health insurance is sold by general and life insurance firms and some specialised companies.        
	There are fixed benefit plans, primarily sold by life insurance companies, as well as indemnity plans. In the fixed plan, the benefits available for different purposes such as hiring an ambulance, daily cash allowance in the case of hospitalisation, surgical treatment, domiciliary medical expense are pre-determined and the policyholder gets a fixed amount, irrespective of the actual expenses.        
	These products are in the nature of reimbursements. Insurers dont ask for the original bills; photocopies of the bills are sufficient to claim the benefits.        
	So, one can buy such a policy from a life insurer along with an indemnity health insurance plan from a non-life insurer and can claim benefits under both the policies.        
	Another benefit of health plans sold by life insurers is that premium is renewed once in every three years. So, if you buy such a policy and make a claim in the first year, your premium will not change in the second or the third year. It will be revised only in the fourth year.        
	For indemnity plans, which are sold by general and specialised health insurance companies, benefits are paid on the basis of the actual expenses, subject to the sum insured. In these policies, the premium is renewed every year. If in a year you claim more than 10 per cent of the sum assured, the next year your premium will go up. If the claim is 25 per cent, the premium will increase 25 per cent. If the claim is between 50 per cent and 75 per cent, the renewal premium will go up by 100 per cent.        
	However, some insurers such as ICICI Prudential and HDFC Ergo offer health insurance policies where the premium is fixed for two years.         
	Claim clamour        
	When it comes to health insurance, no one likes to pay the expenses from his own pocket and claim the money later.        
	Health insurance loses significance if policyholders are asked to pay for the treatment and then get the expenses reimbursed from the insurer. This is why the sector didnt grow at a fast pace till 2003 when third-party administrators and cashless benefit was introduced. Health insurance premium that stood at Rs 531 crore in 2000-01 shot up to Rs 7,802 crore in 2009-10.         
	For various reasons, health insurance (indemnity) provided by non-life insurance companies was a loss-making business  claim payouts were higher than the premium received. It was only in 2009-10 when insurers paid claims worth Rs 7,426 crore against a premium income of Rs 7,802 crore. This was because the cashless benefit has been misused at various levels. The recent dispute between the four public sector non-life insurers and high-end hospitals is a case in point.        
	Life insurance companies such as Aegon Religare and ICICI Prudential have started offering cashless facility. But since they sell fixed benefit plans, there is a limited scope for misusing the benefits and causing loss to the insurers, either by policyholders or hospitals.        
	Taking a cue from this, non-life insurance companies have also introduced co-payment clauses, sub-limits on benefits under different expense categories and ailment-based limits in their plans.         
	Like life insurance companies, non-life insurers will also introduce silver, gold and platinum plans once the gradation of hospitals is done. For example, you shall have to buy a platinum plan for a higher premium if you want the services of a high-end super-speciality hospital. You can buy a silver plan for a lower premium and co-pay part of the hospital bills.        
	The family way        
	When it comes to buying a health insurance plan, it is always advisable to buy a family floater so that all members are covered.         
	The next step will be to shop for the plan with the lowest premium given a sum assured. The charts give indicative premium rates for a family floater (two adults and two children) plan of Rs 5 lakh, with the eldest member being 45-years-old.        
	It can be seen that Star Health amp; Allied Insurance Company, a specialised health insurance firm has the cheapest plan, while the premium rates for life insurance companies are the highest.         
	Public sector general insurers also offer family packs where the premium is calculated for individual members according to their age and then a 10 per cent discount is given on the total premium.        
	The most important thing while buying a health insurance plan is to find out what expenses, ailments and medical treatments are covered under the plan.         
	For example, in most plans there is a cooling period of one to three months during which no claim can be made unless it is an accident. Ailments such as gall bladder stone are not covered for the first two years of the commencement of the policy. If you have a clear idea of what all is excluded in the plan that you have bought, there will be little room for any claim-related dispute with the TPA or the insurer.        
	After the regulator introduces new norms for health insurance, the terms and conditions will hopefully become easier to understand.

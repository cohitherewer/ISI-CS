	Calcutta, July 23: Two city-based public sector banks  Allahabad Bank and Uco Bank  will focus more on retail lending. After the base rate system comes into force, the banks will concentrate on collecting low-cost deposits and increasing retail loans as a percentage of total advances, their top brass said today.        
	Allahabad Bank, which posted a 35.18 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit at Rs 347.14 crore, plans to disburse Rs 5,000 crore in housing, education and car loans in the current financial year.         
	By the end of June this year, our retail loan outstanding stood at Rs 10,517.77 crore, up 25.98 per cent from Rs 8,348.96 crore at the end of June 2009. We aim to take it to Rs 14,000 crore by March 2011, an increase of 39 per cent, said J.P. Dua, chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank.        
	In the April-June quarter, the bank disbursed Rs 671.83 crore under retail credit, an increase of 42.69 per cent from the Rs 470.35 crore disbursed in the same period last year. Total business increased 22.36 per cent to Rs 1,84,039 crore, with advances growing 24.12 per cent to Rs 75,718 crore.        
	Uco Bank, a bigger bank in terms of total business, has a smaller retail loan book at Rs 9,273 crore. Currently, retail lending is only 13 per cent of our total advances and we are aiming to increase its share to at least 20 per cent by the end of the current financial year, said Ajai Kumar, executive director of Uco Bank.         
	Kumar said the bank was targeting a 22 per cent growth in total business to Rs 2,45,000 crore in 2010-11. We expect the advances to grow by 25 per cent, he said. The bank recorded a 19.55 per cent growth in advances in the first quarter. Uco has posted a 45.49 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 260 crore for the April-June quarter over the same period last year.        
	Allahabad Bank managed bad loans better than Uco. While Allahabad Banks gross non-performing assets (NPA) declined to 1.5 per cent at the end of June from 1.69 per cent at the end of March 2010, Uco Banks gross NPA increased to 2.36 per cent from 2.27 per cent during the same period.        
	This was because of a slippage of Rs 416 crore on account of restructuring loans, Kumar said.         
	However, Uco Bank made a hefty provisioning of Rs 383 crore (an increase of 190.15 per cent over the previous corresponding period) from profits that brought down the net NPA level to 1.14 per cent from 1.15 per cent at the end of March 2010.                                      
	However, well be able to bring down the net NPA ratio below one per cent by the end of this financial year by plugging slippage, Kumar added.        
	Uco Bank will need to make provisioning for another Rs 400 crore to achieve the 70 per cent coverage ratio banks are mandated to achieve by September end.

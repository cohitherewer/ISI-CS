                              Mukherjee: Reassuring                             
	Thrissur (Kerala), Nov. 27 (PTI): Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today assured investors of the Life Insurance Corporation of India that they would not lose any money because of the housing finance racket involving the CEO of the state-run insurers subsidiary  LIC Housing Finance Ltd  and some top bank officials.        
	There is no cause for any anxiety for investors as not even a single paise would be lost by them because of an aberration of one or two officers in the organisation, Mukherjee said.         
	LIC is very strong and stable. It is too big an institution and its smooth functioning will not be affected by aberrations of one or two officers of the organisation, he said.        
	The minister said no guilty person would be allowed to escape from the process of law and stern action would be taken against them.        
	Earlier this week, the CBI had arrested top officials of the LIC and its affiliates and other banks and financial institutions for granting corporate loans against grafts.        
	The finance minister had asked lenders, who had an exposure to the dubious deals unearthed by the CBI, to ensure that their money was safe, while state-run insurer LIC termed it as a case of bribe and not a scam.        
	Mukherjee said there were several doubting Thomases over bringing the private sector to the insurance business on the assumption that the LIC would not be able to compete with the private sector.        
	Their predictions had been proved wrong, considering LICs growth. While, the LIC grew 20 per cent during the decade before liberalisation, it had grown 27 per cent in the post liberalisation period, he said.        
	Mukherjee said many banks had collapsed in the US and the EU following the global economic meltdown two years ago and millions of dollars of investors had been lost in those countries. India, however, withstood the meltdown without burdening taxpayers as banks and other financial institutions are very strong and stable, he said.

          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, April 11: NRI entrepreneur Purnendu Chatterjee is open to an amicable settlement with the Bengal government to end the ownership dispute over the states showcase industrial project, Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL).        
	The eagerness for an out-of-court deal comes at a time when the two principal promoters of HPL are locked in a high stake legal battle in the Supreme Court to determine who will eventually own and manage the Rs 10,000-crore company. I am open to an amicable settlement, the head of The Chatterjee Group (TCG) told The Telegraph.        
	TCG, which has a 36.45 per cent stake in HPL, has so far invested Rs 822 crore in eastern Indias first petrochemical plant. But TCG has not got any return since the unit is yet to pay any dividend.         
	Besides, TCG has a limited say in the management and operation of the company, which is effectively under the control of the state government. There have been efforts in the decade-long chequered history of HPL to ram a solution on the ownership issue but none have succeeded.         
	Two of the most important milestones have been in 2002 and 2005 when the state agreed to hand over the control to Purnendu. But the deals never took place.        
	Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen said he was always open to settling the dispute. My only intention is to protect the interest of the state government. We have invested a lot of money in HPL, Sen said when told about Purnendus offer. The minister said that the government had in the past offered management control to TCG.        
	It is evident that Chatterjee will not let go either the company or the management. In such a situation, an amicable or out-of-court settlement would mean TCG becoming the largest shareholder and getting management control.        
	This is possible in two ways: the government registers Rs 155 crore worth of preference shares with TCG, taking TCGs holding to 51 per cent, and/or the state sells its holding partially or fully to Purnendu.        
	TCG has informally approached the government a few times in the last 2-3 years for rapprochement. But it gets stuck on valuation. Its not that TCG does not agree to HPLs valuation; the exercise to determine the value never started.        
	There is also the thorny issue of Indian Oil Corporation holding 8.19 per cent. While the PSU major had initially said it wanted a strategic stake, its submission to the apex court says it does not want any more shares. Purnendu is likely to agree to IOC retaining a minority stake.        
	Asked if he rues the fact that he invested in HPL, Chatterjee said: I have demonstrated that it was possible to build a world class petrochemical complex at Haldia those days. So its a right decision. But on a purely financial terms, I might have got far better returns had I invested the money in other ventures.        
	Its his late mothers wish that swayed Chatterjee to invest in HPL when the then Jyoti Basu government was keen to set up the project. HPL swung to profit after two years of heavy losses since production started in 2001. However, it reported loss again in 2008-09. It is likely to witness losses in the last fiscal, too, owing to a five-month shutdown to expand capacity by 30 per cent. While the project was completed in February, production had tripped for days because of technical glitches.        
	A veteran corporate figure, who chairs many prestigious boards, said TCG and the Bengal government should settle among themselves without the interference of any third party.         
	First, a valuation should be done by reputed consultants. Such an exercise is not a rocket science. It will take into account the present performance and future potential, he said.        
	For Purnendu, the future could be unknown as he says that an entrepreneur thinks in a non-linear fashion. Who would have thought HPL could toy with the possibility of buying Basel in 2005?        
	Valuation issues        
	One of the options for valuation could be to sell HPLs shares in the stock market. This will enable the Bengal government to exit at a price which is understood to be fair by domestic and international investors. HPL, too, had toyed with this idea to raise resources and retire debt. But like many of Haldias lofty ambition, this, too, remained unrealised.        
	Political observers, however, believe the present Left Front government, torn within itself among different constituents and faced with a daunting challenge from the Trinamul Congress, wont dare a settlement with Purnendu. Any decision that they take would draw criticism. The Left Front will leave the onus to the court instead, observers said.

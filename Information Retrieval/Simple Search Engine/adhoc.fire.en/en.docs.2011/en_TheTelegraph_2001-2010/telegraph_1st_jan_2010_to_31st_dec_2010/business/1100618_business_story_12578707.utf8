	Calcutta, June 17: April is the cruellest month, wrote T.S. Eliot at the start of his celebrated poem The Waste Land.        
	If the government has its way, Eliots assertion could prove to be true for all investors in stock markets and mutual funds starting April 2011 when the direct tax code kicks in.        
	The government proposes to redefine long-term capital gains and stretch the holding period from 12 months to as much as 23 months to qualify for a lower rate of tax.        
	At present, sale of securities held for more than 12 months is treated as a long-term capital gain (if the investor makes money on his investment) and is tax exempt. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the rate of 15 per cent.        
	Last year, when the first draft of the direct tax code was floated, the government had said it would eliminate the distinction between short-term and long-term capital gains tax on the basis of the length of holding the asset.        
	The good news is that the second discussion paper, released on Tuesday, says the distinction between the two will remain.        
	The bad news is that long-term capital gains on stocks and mutual fund units will be taxed unlike at present though the government hasnt yet fixed what that rate will be.        
	The long and short of the story is that no investor will henceforth be able to avoid paying some form of capital gains on their investment bets that pay off.        
	But it is the plan to stretch the holding period for eligibility for treatment as long-term capital gains that will draw the loudest groans from investors in stocks and mutual funds.        
	April woes        
	Long-term capital gains have been re-defined in the revised draft as gains arising from an investment in an asset held for more than one year from the end of the financial year in which the asset was acquired.        
	Essentially, this means that investors will be better off buying stocks and mutual funds in March (the last month of the fiscal) rather than April (which is the first month of a new fiscal).        
	Heres why. Take the case of an investor who bought shares in April 2010. Under the revised proposal, the 12-month holding period will start only after March 31, 2011. This means that the sale of the stock before end March 2012 will not qualify as a long-term capital gain. An investor in April will, therefore, need to hold the shares for 23 months to become eligible for the lower rate of tax on long-term capital gains.        
	This is completely different from the situation today wherein long-term capital gains is calculated from the date of the acquisition of the asset  so investors only had to worry about timing the market and not timing their purchases for tax purposes.        
	Theres more. The revised draft has also done away with the benefit of cost inflation indexation on investments in stocks and equity mutual funds that the first draft had promised. Instead, it has proposed to allow a deduction at a specified percentage of the long-term capital gains.        
	This adjusted capital gain (after the deduction) will be included in the total income of the taxpayer and taxed at the applicable income tax rate, the second draft says.         
	This draft, however, did not mention the specified percentage that would be allowed for deduction from the long-term capital gains on investment in equity and equity MFs.        
	The draft says that no such deduction will be available in the case of short-term capital gains from equity investments and the applicable capital gains tax will correspond to the income tax rate payable by the assessee. The capital gains tax proposal in the revised DTC discussion paper will act as a drag on equity investments and stock markets in general, said a senior official with Enam Securities.        
	The first draft had proposed to impose a 30 per cent capital gains tax on foreign institutional investors  one of the main props of the stock markets. The second draft hasnt changed the rate even though the finance ministry had received several representations to create a special tax regime to attract investments from them as other countries have done.        
	FIIs will consider the 30 per cent capital gains tax proposal an additional tax burden for them, the Enam Securities official added.         
	Other capital assets        
	House owners and people who dabble in other capital assets such as art works and antiques will stand to benefit from the move to reduce the holding period for treatment as a long-term capital gain.         
	At present, the holding period for these capital assets is at least 36 months for treatment as a long-term capital gain. The government proposes to have the same holding period as in the case of stocks and mutual funds for treatment as a long-term capital gain  12 months from the end of the financial year in which the asset was acquired.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          ROUGH RIDE                                  
	New Delhi, July 24: Maruti Suzuki India today reported an unexpected 20 per cent fall in first-quarter net profit as higher raw material costs outweighed a robust gain in sales.         
	Net profit for the quarter ended June 30 fell to Rs 465 crore from Rs 584 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Net sales rose 27 per cent to Rs 8,051 crore from Rs 6,340 crore in the year-ago period.         
	The economic recovery jacked up car sales, but has also driven up prices of key raw materials  metals and rubber. Most car makers have raised prices to pass on the higher input cost to customers. Some, including Maruti, have not hiked prices because of stiff competition.        
	The profit decline during the quarter was the steepest since the January-March period of 2009 when net profit skid 18 per cent. The company spent Rs 6,080 crore to buy steel, aluminum and other raw materials in the quarter, up 26 per cent from the year-ago period.        
	The company aims to spend Rs 1,700 crore to expand capacity at its Manesar plant to 550,000 vehicles over the next two years.        
	IOC loss        
	State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) today reported a net loss of Rs 3,388.39 crore in the first quarter ended June 30 for selling fuel below cost. Net profit stood at Rs 3,682.83 crore in the April-June quarter of the last fiscal.        
	Analysts expect the refiner to trim its losses after the deregulation in petrol prices.        
	IOC lost Rs 11,013.85 crore in revenues during the quarter. Of this, it got Rs 3,671.26 crore from upstream firms.        
	Consequent to the non-revision of retail selling price in line with international rates, the company suffered a net under-realisation of Rs 7,342.59 crore, IOC said.

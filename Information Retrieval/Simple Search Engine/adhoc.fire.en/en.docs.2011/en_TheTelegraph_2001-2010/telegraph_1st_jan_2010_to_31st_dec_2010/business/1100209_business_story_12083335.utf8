The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fall in farm output to be less severe
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fall in farm output to be less severe
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: The forecast for farm output decline is less than previous estimates, which augurs well for the governments efforts to tame food inflation.         
	The contraction is seen at 0.2 per cent against earlier estimates of a 2 per cent decline.        
	In September, we had estimated agriculture growth at (-) 2 per cent. But despite a severe drought, the Central Statistical Organisation is projecting (-) 0.2 per cent farm growth this fiscal. I think this is good, Montek Singh Ahluwalia said. The RBI in its January monetary policy had said agricultural growth in 2009-10 was expected to be near zero.        
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla said agriculture could revive because of good winter harvests. We are expecting the fourth quarter to be much better, so overall agriculture is not going to see the kind of dip which was initially out (forecast), he said. A late monsoon is expected to raise the winter crop (rabi); an increase in allied activities should also contribute to an improved performance.        
	Driven by sugar, pulses and vegetables prices, food inflation soared to a decades high of nearly 20 per cent in December before moderating a bit in January.         
	General inflation fed on the food price hike to cross 7 per cent in December and is estimated to rise to 8.5 per cent by March.         
	The government has announced an additional allocation of wheat and rice under the public distribution scheme (PDS) and duty-free imports of raw sugar.         
	Ahluwalia, who is a member of the high-level group comprising chief ministers and union ministers to deal with price rise, said, We do not have any problem of food stocks.

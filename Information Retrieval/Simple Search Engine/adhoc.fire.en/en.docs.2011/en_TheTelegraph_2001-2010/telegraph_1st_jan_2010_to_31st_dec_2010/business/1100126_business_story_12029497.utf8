          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Uday Phadke (left), president (finance, legal and financial service sector) of M amp;M, with group CFO Bharat Doshi in Mumbai on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 25: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) today announced a stock split after it uncorked an 849 per cent growth in net profit of Rs 413.7 crore in the third quarter ended December 31.        
	In the same quarter a year ago, the company had notched up a net profit of Rs 43.6 crore.        
	The M amp;M stock  which has surged this year on the back of strong sales in the automobile segment  plunged 5.24 per cent to Rs 1,072.35 on the Bombay Stock Exchange as the results were short of market expectations. Analysts were expecting M amp;M to post a net profit in the region of Rs 480-500 crore.        
	The stock split could, however, ignite investor interest in the counter. The face value of the scrip has been slashed to Rs 5 per share from Rs 10 per share.        
	The M amp;M board cleared the 2:1 stock split today and the shareholders will get to vote on the proposal through a postal ballot. The cut-off date for ascertaining the shareholders of M amp;M will be February 25.        
	A number of companies have already split the face value of the stock as the markets start to rally. Several companies, including Atco Corporation, Bajaj Electricals and Sterlite Technologies have either already announced a split or are mulling such a proposal.        
	M amp;M said both the automotive and the farm equipment sectors had shown strong growth in the quarter.        
	According to the company, the governments stimulus package and easy availability of retail consumer finance continued to be conducive for good sales. Moreover, commodity prices were much lower than the peak levels reached last year.

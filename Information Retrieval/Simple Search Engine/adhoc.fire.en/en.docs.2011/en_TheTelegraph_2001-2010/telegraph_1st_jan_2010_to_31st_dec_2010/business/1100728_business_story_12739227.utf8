The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Short-term spread shrinks

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 27: The short-term rate spread  the difference between the repo and the reverse repo  has shrunk to 125 basis points as the RBI tries to quell volatility in short-term rates, especially the call rates.        
	Two years ago, the spread was at 300 basis points when the repo was at 9 per cent and the reverse repo at 6 per cent. The repo was cut to 8 per cent on October 20, 2008 and the spread was brought down to 200 basis points.        
	It shrank further to 150 points in November 3 that year when the repo was cut to 7.5 per cent. The 150-basis-point spread has been in operation for 20 months since till the rates were tweaked again today.        
	The central bank also announced that it was setting up a working group to review the operating procedure of the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF).        
	LAF was introduced by the central bank in 2000. It is the facility through which the RBI injects or sucks out liquidity from the system. This is done via the reverse repo and repo auctions.        
	The short-term rate spread  or the LAF corridor in bankers parlance  has been trimmed further to ensure that at a time the liquidity within the system alternates from surplus to deficit (as it is now), the overnight call money rates alternate between the reverse repo rate and the repo.        
	With little surplus cash in the system, banks have been borrowing overnight funds from the RBI at the repo rate. As a result, the call money rate has been hovering around 5.6 per cent or at the top of the short-term rate band. Inter-bank call rates govern bank borrowings among themselves.         
	The central bank said though there was no unique way to determine the appropriate width of the policy interest rate corridor, the working group to be appointed would focus on all these issues.

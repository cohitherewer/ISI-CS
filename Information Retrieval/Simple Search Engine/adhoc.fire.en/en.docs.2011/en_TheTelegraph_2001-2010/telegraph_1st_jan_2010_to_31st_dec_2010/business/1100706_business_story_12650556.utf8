The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nath takes a dig at planners
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Nath takes a dig at planners
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                
	New Delhi, July 5: Upset with the tardy progress of national highway projects, road transport and highways minister Kamal Nath today said the plan panel was an armchair adviser oblivious to ground realities.        
	Nath seems to be peeved with the Planning Commission for placing checks and audits on some projects he has been trying to rush through.        
	We must get out of the armchair theoretical approach. It is easy to prepare nice documents but one must take into account ground realities while clearing projects, Nath said.         
	Today in the presence of Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Nath said Delhis swanky new international airport had been completed mainly because the plan panel did not interfere.         
	However, the adviser to Ahluwalia, Gajendra Haldea, interjected saying the commission had been involved in the Rs 9,000-crore project completed in a record 37 months.        
	We were involved in the airport project, Haldea said. You were involved in the beginning, Nath retorted. Haldea replied, So OK, Mr Nath ... you mean to say the Planning Commission should be there at the start of the project and should leave after that.        
	Later, talking to reporters, Ahluwalia termed Naths broadside as constructive criticism. He agreed there were problems within the commission. We are sorting them out.         
	Earlier this year, the Planning Commission had said Naths highways ministry was being over-ambitious in its target of building 20km of roads every day and advised it to be realistic.

	Nath does not agree with the lower target.         
	He is also agitated with the model road building agreement, which the plan panel wants all road-ways projects to adopt.        
	Plan panel members said Nath was upset because the commission insisted on norms being met and on price controls.         
	Being ambitious is not bad, but the target has to be reasonable and achievable  while following the norms and procedures, they said.        
	Referring to the public-private-partnership model, Nath said it cannot be one-size fits all. Building a road in Kerala is different from building a road in Assam or Madhya Pradesh. We have to have a concept that has flexibility. PPP for Kerala has to be different from Madhya Pradesh.        
	The ministry, officials said, could not meet the road building target because of problems of land acquisition, environmental clearance and changes in the model concession agreement.        
	The ministry could utilise just about 40 per cent of the Rs 30,000 crore allocated for 2009-10.         
	Despite the inability to meet the target, it plans an annual borrowing of Rs 20,000 crore over the next 15 years.        
	According to the Planning Commissions report on highways development for 2009-10, the ministry spent only Rs 11,608 crore in 2009-10 against a target of about Rs 30,000 crore under various phases of the National Highways Development Project.        
	On being asked why the Planning Commission has placed a lower target for awarding and constructing roads in 2010-11, Nath said, I have set the target. We build roads. Planning Commission can plan. There is a difference between doers and planners. Planning Commissions job is just to plan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Power plugs into bid policy switch
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Power plugs into bid policy switch
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          New game plan                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 11: Starting next year, the central government will award power projects on the basis of tariff-based competitive bidding, which should bring down electricity prices and promote greater efficiency in plant construction leading to faster addition to capacity.        
	The power ministry, in consultation with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and the Central Electricity Authority, has decided to mandate competitive bidding for thermal plants and transmission systems from January 5, sources said. The ministry is yet to decide on hydel projects.        
	State-owned firms, therefore, will now have to compete with private producers to secure contracts.        
	The Planning Commission has said the country will not be able to cross double-digit growth if it does not rapidly add to power capacity.        
	The government has already scaled down its generation target for the 11th Five Year Plan (2007-12) to 62,000 mega watt (MW) from an initial estimate of 78,700MW. The country has a generation capacity of about 164,508MW.         
	A senior power ministry official said, The competitive scenario will be there for all players and everybody will have to compete on a level-playing field.        
	Until now, government projects went to PSUs through a cost-plus system. State-owned firms charged a price that factored in the project cost and included a reasonable rate of return.        
	Tariff-based bidding is likely to impact state-run firms such as NTPC Ltd, the Damodar Valley Corporation and the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation. They will be pitted against private firms such as Anil Ambanis Reliance Power, Tata Power, Essar Power and Lanco Infratech.        
	The response from private players to tariff-based bidding has been very encouraging. The competitive bidding for four mega projects witnessed aggressive offers from private players, which helped to keep project costs low.         
	All the four big projects went to private firms  three to Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and one to Tata Power. NTPC could not bag even one.        
	Industry sources said, State-owned firms have the capability to compete with the private firms but do not have the same level of operational freedom, which acts as a hurdle.         
	On the basis of preliminary findings of a study to assess the comparative benefits of tariff-based bidding vis-a-vis cost-plus system, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has found that tariffs being obtained through competitive bidding were lower than those under the cost-plus structure.        
	The government has extended the original deadline to implement the new structure from January 2006 to January 2011 to give more time to the PSU developers to prepare themselves for competition.

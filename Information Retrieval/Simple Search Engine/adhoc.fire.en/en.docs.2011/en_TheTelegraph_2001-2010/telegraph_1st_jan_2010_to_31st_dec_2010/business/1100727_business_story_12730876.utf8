          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, July 26: Malaysias sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad has beaten Indias Fortis Healthcare in the race for hospital chain Parkway.        
	Khazanahs improved bid for Singapore-based Parkway today was much higher than Fortiss offer  at S$3.95 per share for an 100 per cent stake compared with its earlier bid of S$3.78 per share for a 51.5 per cent stake and the Indian companys S$3.80 per share for full control.        
	Following the Khazanah offer, Fortis has agreed to sell its entire stake for Rs 3,800 crore. It had picked up about 25 per cent stake in Parkway from March for Rs 3,450 crore and stands to gain Rs 350 crore from the sale. Khazanah has a 23.3 per cent stake.         
	At the end of the day, you have to take an economic call. You cant take an emotional call on the assets you want to own, said Fortis managing director Shivinder Singh, who along with brother Malvinder runs the company.         
	Fortis said it would use the profit on its Parkway stake to look for other opportunities in the region.        
	Shares of the Indian firm rose nearly 3 per cent following the developments. It settled at Rs 156.30, up 2.93 per cent, on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Khazanahs takeover will cost the fund S$3.5 billion. The full offer follows a partial one in May in which it planned to increase its stake to 51 per cent at S$3.78 per share.         
	Parkway Holdings is a premium healthcare provider with a network of 16 hospitals and 3,400 beds in six Asian countries, including India.        
	Singapore will continue to be our hub for Asian operations and it will be our regional headquarters. We are evaluating the listing of Fortis in Singapore, Shivinder said.         
	He said he was open to listing through a real estate investment trust.         
	A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a fund that invests in mainly commercial property and pays most of its rent earnings to shareholders as dividends, which are usually higher than yields of government bonds and offer capital gains if property prices rise. In Fortis case, such a trust should invest primarily in healthcare facilities and medical buildings.        
	The company will become cash surplus. We will now have a surplus of about Rs 900 crore, Fortis Healthcare chief financial officer Yogesh Sareen said.        
	When asked if the company would continue to look for acquisitions, chairman Malvinder Mohan Singh said, We will identify other exciting opportunities. We will focus on West Asia, Asia and Indian markets, where we will look for greenfield projects, management control and acquisitions.        
	He said during the Parkway transactions, the company came across many opportunities and would evaluate those in due course of time.        
	We are passionate, but not obsessed (with acquisitions). For our shareholders, we wont hesitate to do ... whether it is acquisition, divestment or expansion, he said.        
	According to Rashesh Shah, an analyst at ICICIdirect.com, Its a good opportunity for Fortis to exit Parkway. Fortis can either try to increase its investments at home or look for other targets similar to the Parkway chain. Fortis will most likely scout for another company overseas but contenders like Parkway are not there. Other international healthcare players dont have the kind of presence that Parkway has.         
	Khazanah and Fortis, which own around 25 per cent stake of Parkway each, had wrangled for more than two months over the Singapore firm. The Singh family-owned Fortis had picked up a 23.9 per cent stake in Parkway for nearly Rs 3,100 crore when it bought TPG Capitals shares in March this year.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 2: Sun Pharmaceuticals has rejected an overture to buy out its stake in Israeli drug maker Taro Pharmaceuticals for $215 million.        
	The overture came from Guggenheim Partners  a global, privately-held diversified financial services firm with assets of over $100 billion. Guggenheim said it was confident of arranging the purchase of Suns entire equity interest in Taro by a group of institutional investors at a price of $15 per share.         
	Sun holds a 36 per cent stake  a little over 14 million shares  in Taro Pharmaceuticals. The two sides have been locked in a bitter battle since 2007 after a merger deal between them went sour.         
	In his letter dated May 27 to Sun Pharma chairman Dilip Shanghvi, Guggenheim chairman Alan Schwartz said, We believe this transaction would be viewed positively by Suns shareholders as it will allow Sun to monetise an illiquid, minority position, while realising a profit of over $140 million  more than double the size of its initial investment.        
	Guggenheim has been advising Taro on a range of alternatives to resolve the situation arising from a spate of litigation between the two drugmakers.        
	Schwartz said in his letter a prompt resolution of this matter is in the best interests of both Sun and Taro. He gave Sun time till June 7 to respond to the offer.        
	Suns response came two days later through its whole-time director, Sailesh Desai, who said, Our goal is to acquire control of Taro, as we are entitled to under the agreements we signed. Therefore, we have to reject your offer. Desai added he was responding to the Guggenheim approach as Shanghvi was on vacation.        
	Under an agreement that the two companies had reached in 2007, Sun Pharma had agreed to acquire Taro Pharma, a generic drug manufacturer, in an all-cash deal worth $455 million. The deal provided for the acquisition of Taro by Sun for $7.75 per share and allowed either party to terminate the agreement after December 31, 2007.        
	In May 2008, Taro formally scrapped the merger agreement with Sun Pharma, prompting the Indian company to go to the courts in that country.        
	At one stage, Sun Pharma had offered to pay $10.25 per Taro share but predicated this offer on the elimination of a voting threshold required by Israeli law to implement the merger. But the Israeli drug firm held out for a higher price. When this wasnt forthcoming, it scrapped the deal.        
	The battle between the two drug firms came to a head last December when Sun asked the shareholders of the Israeli pharmaceutical company to reject a slate of 11 directors that included Taros chairman and managing director Barrie Levitt and Daniel Moros. The Levitt/Moros family controls Taro with a combined holding of just 11 per cent.        
	Levitt in turn urged Taro shareholders to reject a takeover bid by Sun Pharma.         
	Shanghvi also slammed Taros management for failing to come out with audited financial results for seven years since 2003 and accused the Taro directors of seeking to indemnify themselves against litigation. At the annual general meeting on December 31 last year, the minority shareholders rejected a Taro management-sponsored proposal to elect external director nominees. However, the Levitts still managed to stay in control as they hold a little over 33 per cent of the voting power through a special class of non-equity shares.        
	In April this year, Taro came out with an accounting restatement for three years ended December 31, 2006  fulfilling a key requirement to re-list the shares of the company on a national stock exchange.         
	But soon after the restatement, it terminated the appointment of its auditors  Kost Forer Gabbay and Kasierer, a member of Ernst and Young Global. It appointed a new auditor  Ziv Haft  to deal with the audits for the years 2007 to 2009.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naik: Growth plans                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 26: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) plans to unlock value in its financial services business through some form of share sale and provide a greater thrust to infrastructure, construction, nuclear power and defence.         
	L amp;T is present in financial services through three subsidiaries  L amp;T Finance Ltd, L amp;T Infrastructure Finance Ltd, and L amp;T Investment Management Ltd (L amp;T Mutual Fund). Initially, L amp;T plans to unlock the value in L amp;T Finance and follow it up with the other two.         
	L amp;T Finance has a presence in corporate, rural and retail space.         
	The companys decision may be linked to its intention to convert L amp;T Finance  a non-banking finance company (NBFC)  into a bank once the Reserve Bank of India finalises the guidelines. In a recent discussion paper, the central bank had sought views on the conversion of NBFCs into banks.         
	Addressing the shareholders during the 65th annual general meeting of the company, chairman A.M. Naik said the financial services business had grown during 2009-10 and held assets worth over Rs 10,000 crore.         
	We believe that in a growing economy, financial services will continue to grow, and it is, therefore, necessary to ensure suitable structuring of the business to exploit its full potential. The company is exploring various options of unlocking value at an appropriate time in the near future, he said.         
	Though the L amp;T chief did not disclose the options, sources said it could include a possible listing or bringing in a private equity investor.         
	Naik expects a healthy growth in orders this fiscal, particularly from roads and railways, water, urban infrastructure and nuclear power.        
	L amp;T also sees a good demand from overseas in power, hydrocarbon and urban infrastructure.

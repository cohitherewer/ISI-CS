          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 10: Tea exports have increased nearly 24 per cent in November as production rose on the back of good weather.         
	According to the latest statistics of the Tea Board of India and the Indian Tea Association, exports in November stood at 19.3 million kg against 15.6 million kg a year ago.        
	In value terms, exports increased to Rs 271 crore from Rs 226 crore, though the price was down about Rs 4 per kg.         
	Production during the month rose slightly to 90.53 million kg from 89.65 million kg in the same month of the previous year.        
	Overall output during the first 11 months (January-November) dropped to 920.9 million kg from 922.2 million kg a year ago.        
	While south Indias output increased to 26.37 million kg in November from 23.04 million kg in the corresponding month a year ago, north Indias fell to 64.15 million kg from 66.61 million kg.        
	Production in Assam was almost flat at 38.4 million kg compared with 38.6 million kg in the year-ago period.         
	In Bengal, output fell 2.2 million kg to 22.8 million kg from 25 million kg in November 2008.        
	Among the south Indian states, Tamil Nadu produced 19.1 million kg in November against 17 million kg a year ago. Kerala produced 6.5 million kg, up 1.2 million kg from November 2008.         
	During January-November, exports slipped nearly 9.4 per cent to 169.25 million kg from 186.85 million kg in the year-ago period because of a lower shipment from north India.        
	North India docked 85.9 million kg, down from 107.23 million kg in January-November, Tea Board data revealed.        
	South India, improved its contribution to the export kitty by 4.6 per cent to 83.35 million kg from 79.62 million kg.        
	E-auction        
	Meanwhile, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee on Friday said the tea traders in Calcutta had promised him to take the e-auction route fully by April 30.         
	Guwahati has already fully implemented the e-auction model, and Calcutta will be under this by April 30, Banerjee said on the sidelines of a business summit on the Northeast organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.        
	The Tea Board of India has also asked the Northeastern states, other than Assam, to focus more on orthodox specialty varieties aimed solely for the international markets instead of CTCs.

	New Delhi, Jan. 29: National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (NTPC) today reported a marginal growth of 5 per cent in net profit at Rs 2,364.9 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 over the same period last year.        
	However, total income declined to Rs 11,962.8 crore for the quarter under review from Rs 12,128 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal, the state-owned power generator said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	The company said one of its coal-based unit in Uttar Pradesh, which would supply power to the Commonwealth Games, had reached its full load of 490mw. With the commissioning of this unit, the installed capacity of the company has crossed 31,000mw.        
	NTPC has undertaken 17 projects for capacity addition of 17,930mw.         
	The target is to achieve 75,000mw capacity by 2017.        
	We have 17 projects under construction for generating 17,930mw power, of which 14 projects are of NTPC and four are joint ventures, Sulochana Muralidharan, DGM (finance), said in Ahmedabad yesterday.        
	Land, water, fuel supply and power purchase agreements all are in place for these projects, which are expected to come up in the next 2-3 years, say under the Eleventh or early Twelfth Five Year Plan, she said.        
	At present, NTPC generates 30,644mw power.

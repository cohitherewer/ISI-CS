                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Fault finding
                                I have fixed deposit accounts with the State Bank of India. The bank refused to accept my Form 15H on the ground that I didnt have a PAN card. I am 75-years-old. Is it mandatory to have a PAN card to submit Form 15H?.          N.P. Chowdhuri, Andul
                    A person submitting Form 15H is expected to have no taxable income. However, a bank is bound to quote the PAN of the depositor if it has to deduct tax at source on interest income. A bank will also have to deduct tax at source if a depositor doesnt submit Form 15H before the interest is credited to the account. This date is generally April 10. If you were late in submitting Form 15H, the bank was not at fault.                                  Bank on the house      I am 70-years-old. I inherited an old house built in the 1930s as a gift from my uncle through registered deed. The deed, however, doesnt mention the valuation of the house. If I sell the property now for Rs 20 lakh, what will be my capital gains tax liability? I dont want to buy a residential house at this age. I dont have any other source of income. Tax saving bonds give much lower rate of interest. Can you suggest any investment alternative?        Smita Dey, Calcutta
                    You may have to consider the cost as on April 1, 1981, of a similar property to arrive at the cost of acquisition, according to Section 48 of the Income Tax Act. You can contact a certified valuer to get this valuation done. Once the acquisition cost is determined, you can calculate the capital gains as the difference between the sale price and the acquisition cost. You can check out with your bank for reverse mortgage. This will not only give you tax benefit, but also ensure a steady stream of pension-like income.                                  Date of birth      My date of birth is April 1, 1945. Shall I get tax benefit for senior citizens in assessment year 2010-11?        Swadesh Paul, Kanchrapara
                    You will be 65 on April 1, 2010, that is, in financial year 2010-11. You can claim tax benefits for senior citizens for that fiscal corresponding to assessment year 2011-12.

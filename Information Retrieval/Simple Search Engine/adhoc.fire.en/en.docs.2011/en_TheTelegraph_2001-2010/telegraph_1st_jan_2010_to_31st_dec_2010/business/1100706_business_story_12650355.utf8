                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      No takers for Satyam land in Bengal
          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, July 5: Bengal has failed to find a developer for the 2.77 acre plot, which was allocated to Satyam Computers in 2004 at Salt Lakes Sector V.        
	West Bengal Electronics Industry Development Corporation Ltd (Webel) has floated the tender three times, inviting expression of interests from IT infrastructure developers for the plot after the new owners of Satyam (now known as Mahindra Satyam) returned the land to the state authorities last November.         
	Webel is the nodal agency of the Bengal government for developing information technology and ITeS industries.         
	Webel floated the first tender on December 24, followed by the second on May 13 and the third one on June 15.         
	The authority is yet to get any suitable IT infrastructure developer for the 2.77 acre plot, said a government source who did not wish to be identified.         
	State IT minister Debesh Das and Webel managing director Tamal Dasgupta could not be contacted as they did not take calls from The Telegraph.         
	According to the tender document, Webel invited bids for subleasing a plot of approximately 2.77 acres of land at Plot no. G2, Block GP, Sector V, Bidhannagar, Calcutta for the purpose of establishing Electronics, IT and ITeS industries.         
	The land was handed over when Satyam was still under Ramalinga Raju. An MoU was signed in the presence of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Raju in Hyderabad on January 30, 2004. The foundation stone was laid on February 24, 2006.         
	After remaining unused for almost four years, the new owners of the company  the Mahindras  had expressed their unwillingness to go ahead with the proposed development centre.         
	According to the tender document, the total buildable area on the subject site would be, approximately, 712,000 sq. ft.         
	At the time of returning the land, a Mahindra Satyam spokesperson said, The Calcutta pullout was inevitable as the company is going through a phase of consolidating infrastructure. Rather than hold on to something it knows it cant find a use for, it did the best thing by returning it to the Bengal government so that it can be given to someone who needs it.

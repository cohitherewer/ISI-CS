	New York, Nov. 28 (PTI): Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia is among the probables to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn as the next chief of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to the New York Times.        
	Noting that the clout and role of the international lender has increased substantially in the emerging markets, the US daily reported that someone from the developing world was likely to succeed IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn.        
	The report named Ahluwalia among the probable successors to Kahn, adding that the incumbent chief might run for the French presidency in 2012.        
	Whatever he (Kahn) decides, his successor is likely to be someone from the developing world.        
	Frequently mentioned names include Mohamed A. El-Erian, the American-born son of an Egyptian diplomat and an economist who leads the giant bond investor Pimco; Montek Singh Ahluwalia, a senior Indian planning official; and Arminio Fraga and Guillermo Ortiz, former heads of the central banks of Brazil and Mexico, respectively, the daily said.        
	Ahluwalia has served at the IMF and its sister institution the World Bank. He has also worked as Indias finance secretary and commerce secretary.        
	Before taking over as the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission in July 2004, he was a director (independent evaluation office) at the IMF in Washington for three years.         
	He had also worked as an economist at the World Bank from 1968 to 1971.        
	French economist Kahn has been at the helm of the 187-nation IMF since 2007.

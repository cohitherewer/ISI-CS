	Beijing, April 15 (Reuters): China chalked up an unexpected strong growth of 11.9 per cent in the first quarter, prompting renewed calls for tighter policies to prevent the economy from overheating and stoking speculation of when Beijing will loosen its grip on the yuan.        
	The rate of expansion, the fastest since 2007 and above the median forecast of 11.5 per cent, was flattered by a low base of comparison a year earlier. But economists said the figures were unquestionably sturdy and would justify a firmer policy stance.         
	Some economists advocated a pre-emptive rise in interest rates to curb inflationary pressures, while Glenn Maguire with Societe Generale in Hong Kong said he favoured a prompt revaluation of Chinas currency.        
	Yuan stability and Chinas stimulus package made an enormous contribution to global stability in the aftermath of the crisis, but now that Chinas economy is growing by 12 per cent, its time for the country to share some of that growth with the rest of the world via appreciating its exchange rate, he said.        
	The commerce ministry promptly reaffirmed its opposition to a stronger yuan. A spokesman said Washington was wrong to argue that, by holding down the currency, Beijing was giving Chinese exporters an unfair competitive edge and thereby contributing to near double-digit US unemployment.        
	The yuan rose modestly in the offshore forwards market, which was pricing in a 3.3 per cent rise against the dollar over the next year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Input costs make steel dearer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Input costs make steel dearer
                              On the rise                            
	New Delhi, April 2 (PTI): Steel producers SAIL, JSW and Essar today increased the prices of their products by up to Rs 2,500 a tonne. The hike could make automobiles and consumer durables costlier.        
	We have increased steel prices in the range of Rs 2,000-2,500 a tonne mainly because of the rise in raw material prices, Steel Authority of India chairman S.K. Roongta said.         
	Private steel makers JSW Steel and Essar Steel, too, confirmed hiking their prices.        
	Worlds sixth largest steel producer Tata Steel, however, said it had not yet taken a decision.        
	Jayant Acharya, director of JSW Steel sales and marketing, said the company had increased the prices of its products by 5-7 per cent and would review the rates again in mid-April.        
	It is a preliminary review. We are partly offsetting the rise in raw material cost pressure, he said.        
	An Essar Steel spokesperson said, The price increase is in the same range as of other steel producers. The price hike is effective from April 1.        
	On the rising steel prices in the domestic market, Roongta said India would follow the global trend where the rates had gone up because of the increase in prices of iron ore and coking coal  the two key raw materials.        
	Global mining firms such as Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Vale are in the process of entering into new iron ore and coking coal supply contracts with global steel makers.         
	According to industry experts, mining firms are entering into iron ore supply contracts for the April-June quarter at about $110-120 a tonne, which are 80-100 per cent more than the levels in 2009-10.        
	Steel minister Virbhadra Singh today termed the steel price hike as a temporary phenomena.         
	There has been a spurt in steel prices recently, but it is a temporary phenomenon and at present there is no inflationary concern because of that, the minister said.         
	He, however, cautioned that measures would be taken to control prices if they rose abnormally.

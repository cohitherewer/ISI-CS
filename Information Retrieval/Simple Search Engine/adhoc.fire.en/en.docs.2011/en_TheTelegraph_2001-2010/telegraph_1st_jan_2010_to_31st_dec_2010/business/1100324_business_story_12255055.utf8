The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hyundai revs up for Rs 2-lakh car 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Hyundai revs up for Rs 2-lakh car 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Shifting gear                                  
	Calcutta, March 23: Hyundai Motor plans to launch an 800cc small car for Rs 2 lakh in India during the second half of 2011.        
	The company is doing the research and development in Korea. We are primarily looking at a petrol variant with an 800cc engine at a price tag of Rs 2 lakh, a company official said here today.         
	The company plans to cater to the mass market in India where the demand is slated to grow at a faster pace in the coming years.         
	Meanwhile, the Hyundai i10 has already taken over from the Santro the mantle of the companys highest selling vehicle. The Santro is Hyundais cheapest offering at Rs 2,71,331 (ex-showroom, Calcutta).        
	The company has decided to produce less i20s that are meant for exports to Europe at its Chennai facility. Hyundais Turkey plant will now produce more i20s for the European markets.        
	The move, while reducing the three to four weeks waiting period for the car in Europe, would lead to the Indian plant producing more for the domestic market.        
	Moreover, Hyundai would also get to shift its export focus from Europe to other markets such as Australia and New Zealand.        
	The Korean auto makers plans are especially relevant, given its domestic sales growth projection of 9-11 per cent in 2010. With sales of 5.6 lakh units in 2009, it is already close to exhausting its installed capacity of 6 lakh across the two Chennai plants.        
	The current plan would boost domestic sales and help the company maintain its growth target.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PSU trio on selloff radar
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      PSU trio on selloff radar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cash route                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: The government is considering selling stakes in a number of PSUs, including MMTC, Shipping Corporation of India and Manganese Ore India, this fiscal to meet the Rs 40,000-crore divestment target.        
	The government is planning a stake sale through public offerings in MMTC, Coal India, Steel Authority of India Ltd, Shipping Corporation of India, Power Grid Corporation, Manganese Ore India and Hindustan Copper India, minister of state for finance Namo Narain Meena said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.        
	The cabinet has already given its approval for sales in Coal India, SAIL, Power Grid Corporation and Hindustan Copper, while the government has shortlisted merchant bankers for the Manganese Ore float.         
	Broker fee        
	The finance ministry said the department of disinvestment would bear the expenses for hiring brokers and sub-brokers to promote the issue to retail investors.        
	It has directed the lead managers to pay the commission within 30 days for issues up to Rs 1,000 crore and within 45 days for issues of a greater size. The directive is effective from April.        
	Employee quota        
	Divestment secretary Sumit Bose said selloffs in identified companies were likely this fiscal. He said none of the PSUs since the past year were able to sell the entire quota reserved for their workforce.        
	What we have found in the seven, eight instances is that whatever was reserved for employees has not been fully subscribed. The best subscription we had was of Rural Electrification Corporation, which went up to 75 per cent. In some companies it has been as low as 20-25 per cent, Bose said at a seminar here today.        
	In the recent follow-on public offer of Engineers India, only around 60 per cent of the employee quota got subscribed.

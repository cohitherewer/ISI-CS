          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 19: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today announced a reduction in the ceiling rate on export credit in foreign currency given by Indian banks to Libor plus 200 basis points from Libor plus 350 basis points with immediate effect.        
	Exporters will benefit as they can now get cheaper dollar loans.         
	The commerce ministry has been pushing for such a relaxation to sustain the recovery in exports.        
	In a notification issued today, the RBI said that the new norm was subject to the banks not levying any other charges, including service and management charges.         
	The RBI said that the new norms would apply to loans using the Euro libor or the Euribor as the benchmark.        
	The revision in the rates of interest would be applicable only to fresh advances.         
	The Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, is a benchmark rate for the global financial markets         
	Following the changes, in the case of pre-shipment export credit, the interest rates for loans up to 180 days will not exceed 200 basis points over Libor.

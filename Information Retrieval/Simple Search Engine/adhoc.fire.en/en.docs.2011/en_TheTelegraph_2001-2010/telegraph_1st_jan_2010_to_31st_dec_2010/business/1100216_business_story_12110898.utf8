The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stimulus key to auto growth
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stimulus key to auto growth
          ABDUL MAJEED                            
	The Indian auto industry, which had faced rough weather in the aftermath of the global financial crisis especially in the second half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, has recovered well in the second half of 2009 thanks to some of the measures taken by the government, which include the introduction of the stimulus package by way of a cut in excise duty.         
	The expectation from the forthcoming budget is that these incentives will continue.                  
	However, the vital question that will be on everyones mind is whether the budget will have an impact on the price of automobiles.         
	Here is the look at the key concerns and their impact on the auto industry and prices:              
	Increase in input/raw material cost: Sales in 2010 are likely to be affected by the price increase because of the rise in input cost. With the recent 5-7 per cent increase in the prices of steel, aluminium and rubber, vehicle manufacturers are experiencing cost pressures.         
	Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have already started passing on the increased cost to customers by hiking sticker prices in January and this trend is expected to continue. We expect customs duty to remain unchanged.              
	Rollback of excise duty: In the previous budget, specific components of excise duty applicable to large cars or utility vehicles of engine capacity of 2000cc and above were reduced from Rs 20,000 per vehicle to Rs 15,000 per vehicle. Excise duty was reduced by 4 per cent and service tax by 2 per cent. Any rollback in these stimulus incentives will impact prices and, consequently, have a direct impact on sales volumes in 2010. The incentives post-stimulus are summarised in the table.              
	Availability of finance and interest rates: In India, more than 75 per cent of the vehicles are financed through banks and non-banking financial companies. Auto sales largely depend on easy availability of finance at affordable interest rates. If the Reserve Bank of India increases the rate of interest, then it will impact cash outflow as banks and lending institutions will automatically increase their interest rates. Thus, any increase in interest rates would impact auto sales in 2010.               
	Impact of stricter emission standards: From April, the emission norms are going to be tightened in select cities. As a result, OEMs will have to spend more on components in the manufacturing process. Consequently, consumers are likely to experience a further increase in sticker prices in April when vehicle manufacturers are expected to revise prices upwards to address the increased costs relating to the upcoming stricter emission standards.              
	A competitive sub-compact sector: During fiscal 2010, multiple auto makers such as Toyota, Ford, Volkswagen, and Nissan are expected to launch models in the sub-compact sector. New product introduction from these brands will challenge manufacturers such as Maruti and Hyundai, which have traditionally dominated the sub-compact segment. With the start of production at the Nanos main plant in Sanand (Gujarat), the Tatas are also expected to gain market share in this segment. Given these developments, a reshuffle in the market shares of Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai is very likely in the forthcoming fiscal.               
	Budget expectations        
	The auto industry is likely to see a price hike on account of the above mentioned factors and trends. In order to maintain the momentum of growth for the industry, we hope that the government will continue with the existing stimulus packages to the auto industry. Moreover, there should not be any increase in customs duty.

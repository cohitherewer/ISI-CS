        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay helps you to take a closer look at Union Budget 2010-11                                            
	Now that the cat is out of the bag, its time to count the hits and the misses. The Union Budget 2010-11 has come out with a number of proposals that will affect your savings and investments. Lets see how and who will gain from the budget.        
	Proposals on personal income tax and the cabinet decision on gratuity payment will benefit individuals earning above Rs 50,000 a month more than people below this income level.         
	Income tax tally        
	At present, an individual having an annual income of Rs 6,00,000 can claim deduction up to Rs 1 lakh on specified investments under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. A further deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh is also available under Section 24 on interest payment for a home loan.         
	Under Section 80D, one can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 35,000 on medical insurance premium  up to Rs 15,000 for self or spouse or children and an additional Rs 20,000 for senior citizen parents.        
	If we take into account all these deductions (Rs 2,85,000), an individual taxpayers income comes down to Rs 3,15,000 lakh (=Rs 6,00,000- Rs 2,85,000). One has to pay tax at the rate of 10.3 per cent (including education cess) on the taxable income in excess of the basic exemption limit of Rs 1,60,000, that is, Rs 1,55,000 (= Rs 3,15,000 - Rs 1,60,000).        
	Assuming that the taxpayers annual income remains the same in 2010-11, his taxable income will be Rs 2,95,000 because he can claim deduction up to Rs 1,20,000 under Section 80C (deduction of Rs 20,000 is allowed for investment in infrastructure bonds). He will have to pay tax at the rate of 10.3 per cent on Rs 1,35,000 (= Rs 2,95,000-Rs 1,60,000).         
	The savings in tax outgo, thus, works out to be Rs 2,060.        
	A taxpayer earning Rs 12 lakh per annum now will be able to save Rs 57,680 (= Rs 1,83,855-Rs 1,26,175) in tax outgo. Higher income people will also benefit from higher tax-free gratuity payment.         
	Now, a tax-free gratuity payment of Rs 3.5 lakh corresponds to a basic salary of Rs 20,000, which translates into a total monthly salary income of about Rs 50,000, including other allowances. When the gratuity limit is raised to Rs 10 lakh, it will correspond to a basic salary of Rs 57,000, or a total monthly salary of around Rs 1 lakh, including other perks and allowances.        
	The budget should be looked as a precursor to the implementation of the direct taxes code (DTC) that is expected to be implemented in 2011. The DTC has proposed to do away with various tax exemptions available now and instead provide for a consolidated deduction of up to Rs 3 lakh. After the inclusion of infrastructure bonds under Section 80C, the total deduction available for individual taxpayers is Rs 3,05,000.        
	The new code has proposed a tax rate of 10 per cent up to an annual income of Rs 10 lakh, In this budget, the income slab for the 10 per cent tax bracket has been increased to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 3 lakh. Though the finance minister has not increased the basic exemption limit of annual income, he will do it next year.        
	Insurance status        
	Some of the proposals may affect your purchase of or investment in insurance.         
	In medical insurance, the budget has proposed cashless facilities. Now, the insurance company will have to pay service tax on payments made directly to hospitals/health service providers for the treatment of the policyholder. So far, third-party administrators were paying the service tax.         
	The onus of paying the service tax is now on insurers. Being an indirect tax, insurers are likely to pass on the tax burden to policyholders. In that case, the premium for cashless mediclaim service may rise. However, if one opts for reimbursement, where the policyholder first pays the bill and later on gets it reimbursed from the insurer, no service tax will have to be paid.        
	The cost of unit-linked life insurance policies (Ulip) may come down. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has proposed to levy service tax only on fund management and mortality charges. The fund management charge for the levy of service tax will either be fixed by the insurance regulator or the actual amount charged by the insurer, whichever is higher.        
	In 2008-09, all fees and charges, including the premium allocation and policy administration charges, in Ulips were brought under the service tax net. If you had paid an annual premium of Rs 100, of which Rs 5 was deducted towards mortality charge and Rs 85 was allocated to investment, the service tax levied was Rs 10 (= Rs 100-Rs 5-Rs 85).         
	In the budget, the service tax liability has been restricted to mortality and fund management charges. The insurance regulator had last year capped the fund management charge at 1.50 per cent for Ulips of up to 10 years and at 1.25 per cent for policies beyond 10 years. The budget will, thus, reduce the cost of Ulips as policyholders will pay less service tax.        
	The budget has also increased the exemption limit for TDS on insurance commission to Rs 20,000 from Rs 5,000. This means that insurance agents will now get more cash as commission (from insurers) for acquiring new businesses as well as from renewal of premium.         
	Happy housing         
	Buying a ready-to-move-in flat will now be cheaper than an under-construction flat. The budget has proposed to levy service tax on almost all payments made for homes that are under construction. The levy is not applicable when completed homes are sold. However, only 33 per cent of the base price of the flat/home will be chargeable. So, from July 2010, the price of an under-construction flat will go up by 3.39 per cent.         
	Mutual anguish        
	The double levy of Security Transaction Tax (STT) for equity mutual funds, however, stays.        
	In equity mutual funds, unit holders are required to pay STT at the rate of 0.25 per cent, while redeeming their units. This is in addition to the STT paid by fund houses at the rate of 0.125 per cent while buying or selling equity shares on stock exchanges.         
	The D-day came and went. Its now your turn to do the checks and balances.

	Calcutta, July 9: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) today announced a new shared service centre in Calcutta, which will employ 2,000 people over the next three years.        
	The venture is the biggest by the firm after the Satyam scandal broke out in 2009. PwC provides tax consultancy, audit and advisory services.        
	Ambarish Dasgupta, executive director of PwC India, said 600 people were already on board to kick off operations. The headcount will be raised to 2,000 by the end of 2012, he said.        
	The service centre, to cater to all PwC outfits globally across sectors, will have a new corporate entity  PwC Service Delivery Centre.        
	The company is a joint venture among five PwC operations in India, Australia, Canada, the US and the United Kingdom. Dasgupta is the India representative on the board. The centre will provide back-end financial analysis of every job that various PwC outfits will perform globally.        
	The venture is a confidence booster for the embattled firm, which suffered badly after the Satyam fiasco. PwC was the auditor of the firm, whose promoter Ramalinga Raju allegedly orchestrated the biggest fraud of corporate India.        
	PwC and its partners have faced several investigations since then. Chairman Gautam Banerjee in an exclusive interaction with The Telegraph in March this year had said: We want some good sense from the government that they are happy with PwC making some of these investments.         
	Insiders in the firm said the crisis had certainly not blown over yet but it had subsided to a great extent. An email sent to Banerjee went unanswered.        
	The service centre will create new opportunities for finance sector professionals in Calcutta. Apart from chartered accountants, it will also employ B Com and M Com students.                    
	The new firm will also take up space in Salt Lake Sector V IT park South City Pinnacle. Sumanth Prakash, partner at PwC the new venture would eventually take up 200,000 square feet space.        
	In future, there is also possibility that PwC may set up its own building here.

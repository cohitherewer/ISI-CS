          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 3: Jetking, a leading hardware and networking training institute in India, plans to open centres in China and Nigeria during 2010-11.        
	We are undertaking a feasibility research about entering China and African countries such as Nigeria. Once the study is complete, we will finalise the details of our overseas venture, Urvashi Bharwani, vice-president (sales amp; marketing), Jetking Infotrain, told The Telegraph.        
	The BSE-listed company, which operates under a franchise model in India, is likely to retain the business model for its overseas business, Bharwani said. However, the company may change the business pattern, if needed, to escape regulatory hurdles.        
	Jetking, which has 135 centres across India, plans to open another 20 training centres in the country this year.        
	We would like to stick to our core strengths but also introduce newer courses, Bharwani said, adding that a course on infrastructure management was being prepared. We hope to start the new course this year, she said.        
	Jetking has seven centres in the eastern region and the number will go up by another four to five this year. We are focussing on the tier-I and tier-II towns to expand our network, she said. In the east, the company plans to open training centres in Siliguri, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Durgapur and a few north-eastern towns.         
	Jetking reported a gross revenue of Rs 186 crore in 2008-09.        
	Meanwhile, the company earlier said it had plans to set up its own university and had explored options to purchase a private university.

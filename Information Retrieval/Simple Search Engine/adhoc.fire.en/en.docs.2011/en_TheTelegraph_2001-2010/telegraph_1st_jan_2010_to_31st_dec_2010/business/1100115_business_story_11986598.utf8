The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Inflation puts all on rate alert
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Inflation puts all on rate alert
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: Inflation jumped to 7.31 per cent in December from just 4.78 per cent a month ago on higher food prices, raising the possibility of an RBI clampdown on an easy credit regime.        
	Already, inflation has crossed the RBIs forecast of 6.5 per cent by the end of this fiscal, and the government is being attacked from all quarters for its inability to tackle the situation.         
	The current inflation trajectory suggests it is likely to rise above 8 per cent in January and inch closer to double-digits by March. We expect liquidity withdrawal measures and policy rate hikes to start this month, Sonal Varma, economist with Nomura, said.        
	Trade union leaders in their pre-budget meeting with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told the government to control the price rise.         
	Union leaders said they had planned nationwide protests on March 5 against the price rise.         
	Given the risk of excess liquidity feeding through to asset and general prices, we expect the Reserve Bank to begin withdrawing liquidity through the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and to hike interest rates gradually, Tushar Poddar of Goldman Sachs said.        
	Sugar prices rose 54 per cent in December from a year ago. The sweetener is selling at nearly Rs 50 a kg in the retail market. Potato prices, too, have more than doubled, while pulses were costlier by over 40 per cent.         
	Overall, vegetables and cereal prices were up nearly 40 and 13 per cent, respectively.        
	There is a concern that with food price rising, it will push up overall inflation. Moreover, there is a liquidity overhang in the system and dollar flow from foreign institutional investors have picked up. So the RBI may hike the CRR, Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at the Bank of Baroda, said.         
	The RBI, as part of its response to the global financial crisis, had reduced the CRR five times between October 2008 and January last year to 5 per cent from 9 per cent.        
	Two days back, China had increased its reserve requirements to put the lid on an economy that is on the verge of overheating.         
	Kaushal Sampat, chief operating officer of Dun amp; Bradstreet, said global fuel prices would put considerable upward pressure on prices. Monetary action might be warranted to restrain any demand side pressures in the wake of excess liquidity in the system.

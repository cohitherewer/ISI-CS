	New Delhi/Mumbai, April 6: Brothers Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh today stepped down from the board of Religare Enterprises to concentrate on their healthcare project.         
	Sunil Godhwani has been appointed the chairman and managing director of Religare.        
	Announcing the decision, Malvinder said the step was taken to segregate the management from ownership and, thereby, create value for shareholders. Shivinder and I will continue to focus on building a global healthcare delivery business, he said.        
	Asked if their quitting the REL board was a precursor to their exit from the financial services firm, Malvinder said, nothing like that ... In fact, we are willing to increase our stake in Religare.        
	Apart from Godhwani, who was elevated from managing director and CEO to chairman and managing director of REL, Shachindra Nath, who was the group chief operating officer, had been designated as chief executive officer. He along with Anil Saxena, chief financial officer, will oversee the groups businesses globally.        
	The Religare board also decided to induct three non-executive members in the areas of asset management, investment banking and commercial banking to support its ongoing expansion.        
	Religares businesses range from investment banking to asset management and retail broking.        
	Malvinder who sold his stake in Ranbaxy Laboratories in 2008, has been quite upbeat about healthcare. In March, Fortis Healthcare acquired a 23.9 per cent stake in the Singapore-based healthcare firm Parkway Holdings for about $685 million.

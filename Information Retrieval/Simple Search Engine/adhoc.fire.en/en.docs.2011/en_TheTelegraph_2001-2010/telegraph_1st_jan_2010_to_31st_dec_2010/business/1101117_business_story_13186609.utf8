          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: Some newly created companies suppressed facts, gave incomplete information, submitted fictitious documents and used fraudulent means to get telecom licences and spectrum, according to a CAG report.        
	The department of telecom did not do the requisite due diligence of applications, leading to the grant of 85 of 122 licences to ineligible applicants, the report said.        
	The memoranda of association of many of these firms did not allow them to get into telecom, and many more did not have the requisite net worth stipulated by the DoT at the time of application.        
	Some of these alleged ineligible applicants have since formed joint ventures with foreign telecom operators and started full-fledged services.         
	Eight newly incorporated applicant companies  Unitech Infrastructure, Unitech Builders, Azare Properties, Hudson Properties, Nahan Properties, Adonis Projects, Aska Projects and Volga Projects  which were formed in August 2007 and applied for licence in September 2007 (now operating as Uninor), were not eligible as the business activity in the main object clause of their memorandum of association was real estate instead of telecom.        
	Their authorised share capital was Rs 5 lakh against the required Rs 10 crore, and they submitted false certificates from their company secretary on paid-up capital. Another firm, Shipping Stop Dot Com (now Loop Telecom) had stated its business activity in the main object clause of its MoA as design, develop, sell, maintain computer software as the resolution effecting the alteration to telecom was not registered on the date of application. Moreover, its authorised share capital was only Rs 5.2 crore against the requirement of Rs 128 crore.        
	Allianz Infratech, which got merged with Etisalat DB, had a low authorised share capital of Rs 5 lakh against the requirement of Rs 8 crore. It also submitted a false certificate from the company secretary. Datacom Solutions (now Videocon Tele), STel and Swan Telecom (now Etisalat DB) had also failed to meet eligibility criteria for obtaining a second generation mobile permit.        
	Datacom had a share capital of Rs 1 lakh against the required Rs 138 crore; STel had a capital of Rs 10 lakh against a requirement of Rs 18 crore and Swan had a share capital of Rs 4 crore, which was lower than the required Rs 10 crore.

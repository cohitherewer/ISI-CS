	New Delhi, March 2: Rajan Bharti Mittal, the newly elected president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), wants India to become a global investment destination and has targeted foreign direct investment (FDI) of $75 billion by 2015.         
	We will focus on making India the global investment destination with a target of $75 billion FDI by 2015 from the current level of $33 billion, making the country a leading manufacturing hub, Mittal said after taking charge as the president of the industry body.        
	While India is the first or the second country on everyones mind as a possible investment destination, its so unfortunate that we are ranked 133 in terms of ease of doing business, said Mittal, who hopes to clinch the $10.7-billion deal with Kuwaiti telecom firm Zain for its African assets.        
	He said the industry was more or less prepared for a partial rollback of the fiscal stimulus given by the government but said it should be withdrawn in a calibrated manner.        
	We all know stimulus incentives cant stay on perpetually but the government needs to take a look at each sector and then assess. There should not be a complete withdrawal at one go, he said.

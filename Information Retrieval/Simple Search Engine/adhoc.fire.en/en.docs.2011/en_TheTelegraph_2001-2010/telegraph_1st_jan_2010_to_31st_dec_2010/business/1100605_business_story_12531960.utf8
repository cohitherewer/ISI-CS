The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Europe crisis spooks G20, India calm
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Europe crisis spooks G20, India calm

	Busan, South Korea, June 4 (Agencies): Leading policymakers were unusually candid on Friday in voicing fears that the euro zones financial and banking woes could derail the global economic recovery.        
	The troubles of Greece and other heavily indebted European governments dominated conversations ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of 20 of the worlds top developed and emerging economies, Canadian finance minister Jim Flaherty said.        
	It is essential to ensure continued recovery that Europe fix its banks. It is essential that certain vulnerable European nations follow through with major fiscal consolidation, and get the job done, Flaherty told reporters in Busan, South Korea.        
	However, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told a news channel that the festering European debt crisis, if confined to Greece and a couple of other countries, would not impact India.        
	Up to now I must say we could not have that much adverse effect because the countries which are in the vortex of this great crisis, our exposure to them is limited. So also our exports to Greece, he said.        
	Mukherjee, however, added that if the recovery process in Europe as a whole and the euro zone in particular, is retarded, then it may have an adverse impact on our economy.        
	There will be an impact on our recovery because Europe still continues to be an important export destination for us, the minister said. But he quickly added that he was hopeful that the crisis would be tackled by world leaders and would be confined to one or two countries only.        
	Therefore, when it is confined to the current level and thereafter responding to the package of stimulus measures which have been worked out by the leaders of Europe, if this crisis is resolved, I dont think there is anything to be worried about, he said.        
	However, not all finance ministers were as confident.         
	We cant afford to be complacent, South Korean finance minister Yoon Jeung-hyun said at the meet. Without further and ongoing action from us, the recovery may not remain on track and we may not be able to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth, he said.        
	South African planning minister Trevor Manuel said he could not think of a more challenging time than the present for the Group of 20. Decisions needed taking, he said, to banish the spectre of a double-dip recession. Its important that we all understand just how fragile the recovery is, Manuel, himself a former finance minister, said.        
	Hungary trouble        
	Hungarys markets fell sharply on Friday after its Prime Ministers spokesman supported the view that the country had only a slim chance of avoiding a Greek-style debt crisis, although he said it would do so.        
	The new government, which was sworn in less than a week ago, said it would soon announce an action plan to tackle the economys problems, after it publishes the figures about the true state of the 2010 budget this coming weekend or early next week.        
	But nervous markets and investors were spooked by the governments comments and urged clarity on its plans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tragedy sparks aviation cop debate

	New Delhi, May 30: The Mangalore air tragedy just eight days ago has renewed a debate on the need for an aviation regulator with sufficient independence.        
	At present, the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) undertakes regulatory functions on all aspects of civil aviation. It is headed by a bureaucrat who works in close proximity with the government.         
	There have been demands from within the government that the office of the DGCA be brought under a larger quasi-judicial regulatory body such as the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) in the US.        
	The International Civil Aviation Organisation, a United Nations agency that outlines the principles and techniques of navigation, had also called upon its member nations to set up an autonomous body soon.        
	A senior plan panel adviser said, We have always supported an independent regulator for the aviation sector.         
	However, the civil aviation ministry prefers just an airport regulator and not an entity on all aspects of aviation.        
	Several ministries as well as the Planning Commission are keen on a regulator with more powers covering the whole sector.        
	The DGCA head works under the aegis of the civil aviation ministry and has limited independence. Besides, the directorate often lacks sufficient number of experts in various aviation fields.        
	The DGCAs dismal performance has drawn flak from the US regulator, which last year threatened to downgrade India from Category 1 to Category 2 state. This means India will be positioned with countries such as Guyana, Serbia and Ukraine in aviation safety measures, below the standards for Pakistan and China.        
	The FAAs move comes after repeated flawed landings and other errors. Operational audits also pointed towards loopholes.         
	Most Indian airports function without a sufficient number of air traffic controllers, who are consequently overstretched. Surface radars that help the controllers to guide planes on the runway and spot any problem while landing or takeoff are absent in all airports, except Delhi.         
	Sources say in most airports the instrument landing system does not function properly.         
	There have been complaints in the past about fatigued pilots as well as fatigued air traffic controllers, said U. K. Bose, former CEO of Sahara Airlines. Though I do not think that contributed to any recent accident.        
	Last week, the civil aviation ministry has set up a panel to recommend safety rules for airports and airlines. However, the council, comprising 28 experts brought in from airlines, aircraft makers, airport companies and international aviation bodies, can only give suggestions to the DGCA but will not have the right to take decisions or implement changes.         
	The initiative on the council was underway even before the tragedy at Mangalore. However, many within the government contend that it is too little, too late.         
	Pilot associations have been raising concerns over inadequate landing strips, unsafe airports during monsoons and lack of sufficient rest between flights.         
	In the last few weeks, several planes came down using emergency procedures because of some problem or the other. This could be because of improper maintenance, bad piloting or even ageing planes. This has to be investigated, said Robin Pathak, former director of Indian Airlines.

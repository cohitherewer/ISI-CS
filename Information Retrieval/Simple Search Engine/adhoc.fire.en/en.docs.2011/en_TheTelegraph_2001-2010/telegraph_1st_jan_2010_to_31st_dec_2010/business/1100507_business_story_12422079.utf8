          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          REDUCING DEFICIT                                   
	New Delhi, May 6: The government may be able to lower its fiscal deficit by up to half a percentage point by the end of the fiscal because of unprecedented responses to the PSU share sale and the 3G auction coupled with savings by government departments.         
	The government had estimated it would earn Rs 40,000 crore from divestment and Rs 36,000 crore from the auction of 3G spectrum.         
	However, officials say the government is likely to earn Rs 35,000 crore from the sale of PSU shares by the middle of this fiscal and can end the year with an earning of Rs 50,000 crore. However, officially the government is maintaining it will meet the target of Rs 40,000 crore.        
	Similarly, the government looks likely to earn about Rs 10,000-15,000 crore extra from the auction of 3G spectrum, besides the auction of broadband rights.         
	Traditionally government departments end up saving some of the money allotted to them despite our exhortation that they spend on time and on the schemes we have sanctioned ... some of this is balanced out by extra spending on other heads, but still there is a balance, said officials.        
	Officials say current estimates place this saving at another Rs 15,000-20,000 crore.         
	Together with the additional capital receipts over and above what we had forecast in the budget from telecom auction and divestment, we expect the fiscal deficit could be reduced by Rs 40,000 crore or more, they said.         
	Besides Engineers India, Coal India, SAIL and Hindustan Copper which will see share sale by the middle of this fiscal, the government is considering selling stakes in PowerGrid, Indian Oil Company, Manganese Ore India Ltd, RINL, MMTC and Shipping Corporation of India during this fiscal.         
	The government also wishes to go ahead with its selloff plan for Bharat Sanchar Nigam but will try and do so after taking the telecom majors workers on board.         
	Global rating agencies as well as the World Bank have long flagged rising fiscal deficit as an area of concern. Standard amp; Poors lifted its outlook on India to stable from negative in mid-March, citing an improving fiscal position and strong growth.

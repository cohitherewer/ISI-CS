	Hyderabad, Sept. 21: Scam-tainted Satyam Computer Services will announce its financials for fiscal 2008-09 and 2009-10 on September 29.        
	The board of Satyam, now acquired by the Mahindra group and since renamed Mahindra Satyam, will review the audited accounts of the company and the same would be submitted to the Company Law Board, a senior company official said.        
	Satyams founder B. Ramalinga Raju had in January 2009 admitted to a massive Rs 7,100-crore fraud by fudging the companys accounts for years.         
	Following the revelation, the companys administration was taken over by a government-nominated board, which subsequently cleared the sale of the company to the Mahindras.        
	All the nine accused in the Satyam scam, including Raju, have been let out on bail, in the face of opposition by the CBI which filed three chargesheets against him and others. The CBI has sought the law ministrys approval to file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against Rajus bail.         
	Sources said there had been divergences in the numbers estimated by the CBI and KPMG, which along with Deloitte is restating the results, of as much as Rs 1,000 crore.        
	The confusion over the numbers could hold up Mahindra Satyams merger with Tech Mahindra, which needs the go-ahead from market regulators in India and the US.

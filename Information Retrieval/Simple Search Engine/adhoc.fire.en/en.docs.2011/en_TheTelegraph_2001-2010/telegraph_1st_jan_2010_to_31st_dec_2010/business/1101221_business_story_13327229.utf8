          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: The empowered group of ministers (eGoM), headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, is likely to propose a marginal hike in diesel prices later this week as transferring the entire burden of the revenue loss of oil firms can trigger inflationary pressure and result in political backlash.        
	State-owned oil firms are suffering a revenue loss of over Rs 6 per litre in the wake of a sharp rise in crude prices.        
	We have asked the eGoM for a hike in the prices of diesel similar to that of petrol to help oil marketing firms cut their under-recoveries, a senior oil ministry official said.        
	A hike of Rs 2 per litre in diesel rates is on the agenda of the eGoM meet with the objective of narrowing the difference between the domestic retail price and the imported cost.

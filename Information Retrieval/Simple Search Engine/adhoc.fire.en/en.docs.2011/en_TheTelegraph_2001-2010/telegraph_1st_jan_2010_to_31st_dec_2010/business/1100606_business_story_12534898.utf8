The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | G20 scraps bank tax plan
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      G20 scraps bank tax plan

	Busan, South Korea, June 5 (Reuters): The worlds top economies scrapped plans for a universal global bank tax on Saturday, giving countries plenty of wiggle room over how to make banks pay for their bailouts in future.        
	Finance ministers from the Group of 20 countries ended a two-day meeting to review progress on a string of initiatives agreed last year to make the financial system safer and protect taxpayers from having to pay for bank rescues again.        
	Attempts to introduce a global bank levy were finally ditched in the face of opposition from Japan, Canada and Brazil whose banks needed no public aid during the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.        
	There is no agreement to proceed with an ex ante bank tax, said Canadian finance minister Jim Flaherty.        
	The Group also reached an uneasy compromise on Saturday over the speed of budget cuts needed to calm global financial markets rattled by a spreading debt crisis in Europe.        
	G20 finance ministers sought to bolster market confidence by declaring themselves ready to safeguard recovery and stressing the importance of putting their public finances in order.        
	Without referring specifically to the euro zones debt troubles, the G20 said recent volatility in financial markets served as a reminder that significant challenges remained despite a faster-than-expected, though uneven, global economic recovery.        
	Those countries with serious fiscal challenges need to accelerate the pace of consolidation. We welcome the recent announcements by some countries to reduce their deficits in 2010 and strengthen their fiscal frameworks and institutions, the G20 said in a communique issued after two days of talks.         
	Note of caution        
	However, India today cautioned G20 nations against rushing to withdraw stimulus measures, although many countries were seeing the worrying trend of expenditure far outstripping income.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who initiated a gradual roll back of stimulus measures back home in the Budget for 2010-11, said withdrawal of fiscal and monetary props, all at the same time, could derail the fragile economic recovery.        
	The market is sending strong signals that the fiscal situation is a matter of concern ... we should all not rush to fiscal (stimuli) exit at the same time so as not to undermine the recovery, he said at the G20 finance ministers meet here.        
	India had unveiled a number of fiscal and monetary sops to insulate the domestic industry in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, but rolled back some of them such as excise duty cuts after the economy posted healthy growth.        
	Those countries that have market compulsions may need to start the consolidation now. Others can stagger in fiscal consolidation. It is critical, however, to clearly lay down credible and transparent fiscal consolidation paths, Mukherjee said.        
	Mukherjee also warned the countries that they should exit from stimulus before the markets started forcing them on account of deterioration in fiscal conditions.

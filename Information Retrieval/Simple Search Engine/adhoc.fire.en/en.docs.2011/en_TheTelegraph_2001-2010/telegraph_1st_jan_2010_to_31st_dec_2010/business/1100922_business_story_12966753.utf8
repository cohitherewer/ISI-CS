	Calcutta, Sept. 21: Bank deposit and lending rates are likely to inch up next month, M.V. Nair, chairman and managing director of the Union Bank of India, said.         
	Nair, the former president of Indian Banks Association, said, Deposit rates may go up first and lending rates will rise after a lag.         
	He was speaking on the sidelines of a Ficci seminar here today.         
	Credit growth in the current fiscal stood at 19.5 per cent, while deposits grew 14.5 per cent against the Reserve Bank of Indias target of 20 per cent and 18 per cent growth rates, respectively.         
	This shows that while credit growth has been in line with the RBI projection, deposit growth fell short of target.         
	He said the recent deposit rate hikes by as many as 40 banks were not enough to bridge the liquidity shortfall of Rs 40,000-45,000 crore in the system because of advance tax payments.

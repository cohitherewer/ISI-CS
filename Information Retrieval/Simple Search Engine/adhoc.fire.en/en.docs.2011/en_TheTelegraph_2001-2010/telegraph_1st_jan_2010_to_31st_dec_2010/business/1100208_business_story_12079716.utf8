	New Delhi, Feb. 7: The government may auction wireless spectrum for broadband by next month, which is expected to fetch over Rs 5,000 crore.        
	In its budget estimates for 2009-10, the finance ministry had expected a revenue of Rs 48,335.33 crore from telecom, with 3G and broadband spectrum sales contributing over Rs 35,000 crore.        
	The department of telecom (DoT) had earlier announced simultaneous auctions of 3G and broadband spectrum in January.         
	However, with the 3G auction getting postponed, the government is exploring the possibility of delinking the broadband auction from 3G and proceed with the former.        
	The government had planned to plug part of its fiscal deficit  estimated at a 16-year high of 6.8 per cent of the gross domestic product, or Rs 400,000 crore  through proceeds from the spectrum sale.         
	The empowered group of ministers on 3G, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, is set to take a call on the issue.        
	Officials said the DoT had access to the broadband spectrum to be put up for auction, which is in the 2.3-gigahertz (GHz) frequency. The government will auction two slots of spectrum to private operators at an all-India base price of Rs 1,750 crore.         
	One slot will be reserved for state-owned BSNL and MTNL.        
	Analysts said the delay in the auction would cost the country around Rs 10,500 crore in revenues from value-added services in broadband, excluding the estimated Rs 5,000 crore spectrum fee.        
	Below target        
	As on January 31, the country had a total of 8 million broadband connections, way below the 9-million subscriber target set by the DoT for 2007. The meagre growth  India is adding around 1 million subscribers per annum  will make it difficult to meet the target of 250 million users by 2012. The number of mobile users at the end of December is 525 million, with the additions in December being 19.10 million.        
	Broadband spectrum has the potential to bring high-speed data connectivity resulting in improved access to education, enabling people in remote areas to take classes at faraway universities besides improved access to medical services, through telemedicine applications, said Naresh Ajwani, secretary, the Internet Service Providers Association of India.        
	Industry experts said the lower cost and faster rollout of wireless network would help in quicker proliferation of broadband services, which in turn would help to develop more Internet and e-commerce applications.        
	According to research firm Gartner, the number of broadband users are expected to reach 7 million by 2011-end.        
	Legal complications, meanwhile, have delayed the 3G auction.         
	The issues related to the payment of the bid sum upfront with the promise of spectrum at a later date. The law ministry has told the DoT that the auction should be held when spectrum is available.

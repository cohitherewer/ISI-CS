          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: The economy should again clock a growth rate of 9 per cent in 2011-12, achieved prior to the financial crisis, but the government needs to urgently put its books in order that necessitates starting the process of stimulus withdrawal, the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister said today.        
	The panel forecast growth of 7.2 per cent in this fiscal and 8.2 per cent in next year, while growth should be at least 9 per cent the year after.         
	However, the huge fiscal deficit of Rs 4 lakh crore for this fiscal is a cause for concern, and the government should raise indirect taxes and prune expenditure.        
	Adjustments are possible both on the revenue side and the expenditure side in order to bring down fiscal deficit. Exit measures should be calibrated in a manner that the stimulus in the economy should continue, the chairman of the economic advisory panel, C. Rangarajan, said after releasing its review of the economy for 2009-10.        
	By keeping expenditure and subsidies at current levels, it is possible to cut the fiscal deficit by 1 to 1.5 per cent during the next fiscal without hurting growth.

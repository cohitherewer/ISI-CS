The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance to invest $5bn in telecom
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Reliance to invest $5bn in telecom
                                          
	New Delhi, June 13 (PTI): Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limiteds (RIL) foray into telecom will involve an investment of about $5 billion, for which it is open to accessing the infrastructure of younger brother Anils group firm Reliance Communications, company officials said.        
	The flagship firm of Ambani will invest about $1 billion to roll out broadband services to attain a target of 100 million subscribers through the just acquired Infotel in five years, RIL top officials said.        
	Besides, the acquisition cost of Infotel and payment of Infotels broadband fee amount to an expenditure of about $4 billion.         
	RIL acquired Infotel for Rs 4,800 crore (about $1 billion) on the day the Nahata group firm emerged as the sole player to bid successfully for all-India broadband spectrum auction conducted by the government.        
	RIL will also have to pay Rs 12,872 crore (about $2.8 billion) to the government as a licence fee for spectrum bagged by Infotel, which will become the subsidiary of the Mukesh Ambani groups flagship firm.        
	On whether it could tie up with Anil Ambanis R-Com for infrastructure, including optic fibre and towers, RIL top executive Manoj Modi and chief financial officer Alok Agarwal said broadband infrastructure could be shared with any of the existing players.        
	Asked if RIL also intends to acquire any 2G telecom player for voice telephony, Modi said, RIL will not acquire any 2G player, thus ending speculation about the companys interest in Videocon Mobile, a Venugopal Dhoot group firm that acquired licences for 22 circles in 2008.        
	Meanwhile, R-Com, the second largest telecom player in the country, bagged the highest number of circles along with Bharti Airtel in the 3G licence auction, which concluded recently.        
	Mukesh, along with Manoj Modi, had created R-Com, but the company had gone to Anil Ambani as part of the family settlement to divide the Reliance empire.        
	The officials said even for devices such as notepads and laptops, arrangements would be made with existing players to ensure that customers get full services.

	Trents consolidated turnover increased from a mere Rs 8 crore in 1998-99 to Rs 1,137 crore in 2009-10.        
	Tata is considered one of the key contenders to take over the leadership of the group, which had posted a revenue of $70.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2009. Ratan Tata, the current head, will stay on till 2012.

It will further consolidate and grow its position in Africa and enter new geographies.

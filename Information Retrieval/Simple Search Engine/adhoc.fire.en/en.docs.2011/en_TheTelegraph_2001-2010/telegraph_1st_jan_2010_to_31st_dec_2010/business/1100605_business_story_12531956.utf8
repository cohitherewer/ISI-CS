          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 4: The government today notified that all listed companies, including public sector units, must have a minimum 25 per cent public holding, meaning the markets may be awash with share issues of firms where promoters hold more than 75 per cent stakes.         
	According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, there are 278 listed entities having promoter holdings of more than 75 per cent.        
	However, these firms need not bring promoter holdings down to 75 per cent at one go: the new rules say existing companies with less than 25 per cent public holding will have to issue fresh capital, or otherwise increase public holding, by not less than 5 per cent annually. If the public shareholding is not very much below the stipulated level  anything more than 20 per cent, for instance  they can issue less than 5 per cent capital.        
	The government said it was seeking to broadbase shareholding to ensure greater transparency in capital markets and fairness in the trading of equities.         
	A dispersed shareholding structure is essential for the sustenance of a continuous market for listed securities to provide liquidity to investors and to discover fair prices. Further, the larger the number of shareholders, the less is the scope for price manipulation.         
	The proposal was mooted by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in his budget for 2009-2010.         
	The finance ministry has since held several rounds of consultations with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.         
	The companies can meet the new public holding requirements by using either or a combination of two options  the first being to sell promoter stake and the second to issue fresh capital.        
	Well-known firms having public holdings of less than 25 per cent include Reliance Power, Essar Oil, DLF, Jet Airways and JSW Energy. PSUs include Steel Authority of India Limited, NTPC, Power Finance Corporation and NMDC.        
	Rating agency Crisil in a recent analysis said the proposal could result in capital raising of over Rs 1.6 lakh crore. A bulk of the funds will be raised by the 45 public sector units and state-owned banks.        
	Since the sum needed to be raised is at least 3-4 times what is normally raised through public offerings in a year, officials said we cannot force immediate compliance.        
	Vikram Sawhney, independent merchant banker and securities analyst said, Its a good move. It will bring in more money into bourses, much of it from retail investors which should broadbase the markets and make it more immune to external shocks of the kind we have been witnessing where FIIs pull out funds at their whims and fancies.         
	A company which has or is coming up with a draft offer document before Sebi on or before these amendments are notified will be required to comply with 25 per cent public shareholding requirement by increasing its public shareholding by at least 5 per cent per annum, irrespective of the amount of post issue capital of the company calculated at offer price.        
	For any new listing, if the public offer is over Rs 4,000 crore, the company can list with just 10 per cent public holding to start with and reach the 25 per cent requirement with an annual increase of 5 per cent over the next three years.         
	The new rules also state that in case a listed company whose public holding of 25 per cent falls at any given time because of sales or purchases or inheritance reasons, such a company shall bring the public shareholding to 25 per cent within a maximum period of 12 months from the date of such fall.        
	Industry associations today welcomed the governments move but warned that implementation should be gradual to avoid hiccups.        
	In general, this is a good development, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said.

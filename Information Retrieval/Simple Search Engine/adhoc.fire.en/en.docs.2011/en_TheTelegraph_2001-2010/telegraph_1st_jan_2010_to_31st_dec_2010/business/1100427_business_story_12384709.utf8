                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Two-fold rise in Maruti profit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 26: Maruti Suzuki Indias net profit jumped two fold in 2009-10 to Rs 2,624.64 crore with sales crossing a million units.         
	The companys board has recommended a dividend of 120 per cent per share having a face value of Rs 5 each, resulting in a total outgo of Rs 173.35 crore.        
	Consolidated income from operations last fiscal soared 42.27 per cent to Rs 30,122.51 crore from Rs 21,172.20 crore in the previous year. The company earned a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,227.45 crore in the previous financial year.        
	Car sales had been robust in 2009-10 with a revival in the economy pushing up demand, and the availability of credit boosting customer confidence. But higher raw material prices, a rise in interest rates and a hike in fuel prices are threatening to spoil the party, analysts said.        
	Maruti is the first Indian car maker to sell over a million units in a single financial year. It sold 1,01,83,65 units in 2009-10, 28.55 per cent higher than 792,167 units in the previous fiscal.        
	For the quarter ended March 31, 2010, net profit shot up nearly three fold to Rs 656.55 crore from Rs 243.13 crore in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.        
	Though profit in the quarter increased on the low base of last year, it was impacted to some extent by the cost of upgradation of the companys full range of cars to Bharat Stage-IV emission norms, cost of new models, higher raw material prices and adverse foreign exchange movement, Maruti said.        
	Total income from operations during the fourth quarter of the last fiscal increased 30.96 per cent to Rs 8,424.55 crore from Rs 6,432.90 crore in the same period previous fiscal. During the quarter, Maruti sold 287,422 units against 236,638 units in the year-ago period. Domestic sales in 2009-10 stood at 870,790 units, while exports contributed 147,575 units.         
	The Maruti scrip opened firm on the BSE but later came under selling pressure on concerns over lower profit margin. The stock dropped nearly 2 per cent to Rs 1,335 on the BSE.                          
	Marutis major markets include the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Netherlands in Europe and Algeria, Chile, Indonesia and Australia in non Europe, the company said.        
	Maruti, which more than doubled its exports in the last fiscal from about 70,000 units in last fiscal 2008-09, said it had added some new export markets such as South Africa, Hong Kong and Norway during 2009-10.

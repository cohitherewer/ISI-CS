The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Excess spectrum for oldies
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Excess spectrum for oldies
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 16: The spectrum scam wasnt about the newbies alone.        
	In its report, the CAG said nine existing operators were allotted spectrum beyond the upper limit as specified in the Unified Access Servicing Licence.        
	The value of the excess spectrum held by these operators worked out to Rs 2,561 crore, though its market value today would be higher.        
	These operators are Aircel, Bharti Airtel, BPL (Mumbai), Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), Idea Cellular, MTNL (Delhi amp; Mumbai), Reliance Communications, Spice and Vodafone.        
	At a time the department of telecommunications was not processing pending applications for licence as adequate spectrum wasnt available, the report said, it had no qualms about doling out spectrum to the existing players beyond the contracted limit without any upfront charges being imposed or without determination of market price of spectrum.        
	The CAG felt that the additional spectrum should attract an upfront charge equivalent to the 3G auction price from the date of assignment.        
	In May, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India also recommended the need to charge for the additional spectrum held by the operators beyond the licensed quantity. The suggestion is under the consideration of the government. In the event of these recommendations being accepted, the additional flow of revenue to the government would come to Rs 36,993 crore, it observed.

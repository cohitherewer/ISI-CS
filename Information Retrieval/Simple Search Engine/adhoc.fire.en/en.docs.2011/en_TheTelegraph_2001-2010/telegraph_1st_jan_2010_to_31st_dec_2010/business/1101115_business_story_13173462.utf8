        Fix a date with dividend yield mutual funds that can beat market volatility to give high returns, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Last week, we analysed why gold is not a good investment option for retail investors. Not only in terms of returns, gold is also not preferred to equity investments because of capital gains tax implications.         
	Gold investment, through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), is subject to long-term capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent. If gold is held in physical form, you shall have to hold it for three years to get the benefit of long-term capital gains tax. If gold ornaments, bars or coins are sold before three years of purchase, the gain will be treated as short term and the capital gains tax will be equal to the income tax rate. So, after tax, return from gold investment will be less by 10-30 per cent, depending on whether you have invested in a gold ETF or physical gold and the period of holding the investment.         
	Profit pays        
	The question that naturally follows is then how can one reduce the volatility risk in equity investment? You may think that one really needs to be brave to consider equities after the kind of bloodbath we witnessed in the stock markets in 2008.        
	Not really. The answer to your apprehensions lies in high dividend yield stocks that provide a hedge against volatility. Dividend payment to shareholders by a company is not linked to its share price movements, but to its business profitability. So, irrespective of share prices going up or down, a high dividend paying company always rewards its shareholders. Share prices of such companies fall less compared with other companies when the markets tumble.        
	The chart shows how dividend yield mutual funds that invest in shares of high dividend paying companies have given a much superior return compared with frontline share price indices both in the short and in the long run.        
	Where to gain        
	For the 12-month period through November 9, gold ETFs generated a return of 22 per cent. In comparison, dividend yield funds gave more than 40 per cent.        
	Gold ETFs came into existence in February 2007 when Benchmark Mutual Fund launched its gold ETF. Till now, it is the best performing gold ETF. Since launch, the fund has given an annual compounded return of 22.31 per cent. In comparison, Birla SunLife Dividend Yield Plus fund, which was launched in February 2003 (four years before Benchmark Gold ETF) gave an annual compounded return of 27.13 per cent over these seven years.        
	In the last three years, gold ETFs gave a return of 23.45 per cent, which means Rs 1,000 invested in a gold ETF three years ago would have now amounted to Rs 1,881.37. However, you shall have to pay a 10 per cent capital gains tax on the gain amount. Post tax, your gain reduces to Rs 793.233. The post-tax compounded annual return from the gold ETF investment, thus, declines to 21.49 per cent from 23.45 per cent.        
	During the same period, Birla SunLife Dividend Yield Plus fund has given a return of 22.54 per cent and there is no capital gains tax liability on this gain  equity investments are exempted from long-term capital gains tax.         
	In other words, you would have gained Rs 793.23 on an investment of Rs 1,000 three years ago in a gold ETF, while the same investment in the Birla SunLife Dividend Yield Plus fund would have generated a profit of Rs 840.07.        
	This shows that despite the stock market debacle in 2008, your core equity investment would have been better hedged with high dividend yield stocks than gold.         
	Go the SIP way        
	Let us see how systematic investment of Rs 1,000 each in Benchmark Gold ETF and Birla SunLife Dividend Yield Plus fund since November 8, 2007 compare now. The SIP in Benchmark Gold ETF for 36 months ending October 2010 will amount to Rs 50,438.43 as on November 12, 2010.        
	An SIP of Rs 1,000 since November 8, 2007, for 36 months in a Birla Sunlife Dividend Yield Plus fund will be Rs 65,352.31 as on November 12, 2010. So, you can see a systematic investment in equities yield even better pre-tax return than gold.        
	The point I want to drive home is that no other asset class can give as high a return as equities over a long period of time. This is so because in a developing economy like ours the GDP (gross domestic product) growth is high. If we assume an 8 per cent GDP growth and an annual inflation rate of 5 per cent, the nominal GDP growth works out to 13 per cent. A 13 per cent nominal GDP growth means at least 15 per cent profit growth for companies. In other words, one can safely expect a 15 per cent annual return on equity investment.         
	Long view        
	Sure, equity investments are fraught with risks. But these risks get evened out over a long period of time, say seven or 10 years.         
	After all, equities are not the place you should be in if you want to become rich overnight. Wealth creation is a long-term process and nothing can create wealth faster than equities. You just need to be patient and disciplined.         
	Every income earner is a potential saver and every saver is a potential investor. But when you consider investing in equities, invest regularly and invest only that much amount that you may not need for at least 10-12 years.        
	Portfolio plan        
	The next question then is how to create an investment portfolio. Your equity investments should consist of a core portfolio consisting of a large-cap diversified equity mutual fund that has a good, consistent track record over a sufficiently long period of time, say 10 years. This core portfolio is then topped with a dividend yield fund and a small and mid-cap equity fund. A small and mid-cap fund ensures faster growth of your investment. Once you have this fund mix in your kitty, you can rest assured that equities wont disappoint you.

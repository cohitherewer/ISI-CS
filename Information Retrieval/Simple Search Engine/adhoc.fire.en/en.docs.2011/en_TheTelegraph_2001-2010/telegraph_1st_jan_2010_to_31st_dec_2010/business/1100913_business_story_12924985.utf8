                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Go to the bank
                                My wife, who had died recently, held a bank fixed deposit of Rs 5 lakh jointly name with me. She had got the money as gift from her mother. I want to continue with the fixed deposit till maturity. But I, as a second holder of the account, cannot submit Form 15G for non-deduction of tax at source. What should I do so that the bank doesnt deduct the tax at source?          Dinesh Ganguly, Salt Lake
                      Inform the bank about the death of your wife. If the account was operated as either or survivor, the FD will be transferred to your name and then you can continue and submit Form 15G, if eligible. The interest income will be taxed in your hand. If you have other taxable income, the interest income will be added to that. If you do not have any other taxable income, you can submit Form 15G.                                      Account transfer      Nationalised banks dont allow transfer of FD accounts from one branch to another. I want to know whether the SBI follows the same principle ? I am an 82-year-old and alone. Soon, Ill be moving to Karnataka permanently.        R. Dey, Calcutta
                    Uco Bank has an FD scheme, called Wealth Maximiser, under which an account opened in one branch can be transferred to any other branch of the bank without any charge. Other banks, such as Axis Bank, offers online opening of FD accounts that you can operate from anywhere in the country. You can open an FD account here and when it matures, transfer the fund to your savings account opened in any bank in Karnataka through Internet.                                  Interest count      To calculate income tax on bank interest which date is to be taken into account  when the interest is actually credited to the account or when the interest becomes due ? If the interest due date is March 31, 2010 and the interest is actually credited on April 1, 2010, which financial year should I consider for the payment of income tax on the interest?        S. Basu, Jamshedpur
                    The question of tax liability will arise when the interest is actually credited to your account. You should calculate the interest as income for financial year 2010-11.

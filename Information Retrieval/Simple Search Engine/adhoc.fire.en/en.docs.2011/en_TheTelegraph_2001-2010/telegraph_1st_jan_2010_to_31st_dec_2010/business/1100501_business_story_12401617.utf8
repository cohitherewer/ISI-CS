The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bar on Chinese phone parts

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Connection error				                                 
	New Delhi, April 30: Import of Chinese telecom equipment by leading mobile operators, including Vodafone and Bharti, has been stalled by the home ministry on security concerns.        
	Sources told The Telegraph that Vodafone Essar, Bharti Airtel, Aircel and Reliance had received letters from the department of telecom (DoT) stating that security clearances had not been granted for equipment from Huawei, ZTE, Acelink and UT Starcom.         
	All telecom service providers need to get security clearance from the home ministry before importing foreign equipment.        
	The DoT said a blanket ban was not placed on equipment from the Chinese vendors. However, each equipment contract is studied separately and a security clearance is given on a case by case basis. Some companies may not have got clearance for specific equipment orders, said DoT officials.        
	The DoT had recently issued a directive asking all the service providers to get the clearances before placing any order for equipment and software from foreign companies. The rule applies to all equipment vendors and is not specific to Chinese companies, said officials.        
	Huawei India is evaluating and understanding the latest development and seeking clarifications from the authorities concerned, said Huaweis spokesperson.        
	He added that Huawei was willing to co-operate with all Indian government agencies to remove their concerns.        
	The spokesperson for ZTE said the company had not received any formal notification from the DoT.        
	The ministry had issued its directive after security agencies expressed their concern that foreign vendors could embed spyware into telecom networks, which could then be used by unfriendly countries to snoop into Indias communication set-up.        
	Officials said most countries had similar rules in place that made it mandatory for companies to reveal their service providers.        
	The DoT has also asked service providers to ensure that their networks are entirely operated and maintained by Indian engineers, with a minimal dependence on foreign engineers.        
	The DoT had last year also proposed to impose a ban on Chinese vendors which was later removed following protests from industry.        
	Most new operators source equipment from the Chinese vendors as it is cost effective and matches the western vendors in quality. Low equipment cost was one of the reasons behind the operators offering call tariffs at 1 paise per second.

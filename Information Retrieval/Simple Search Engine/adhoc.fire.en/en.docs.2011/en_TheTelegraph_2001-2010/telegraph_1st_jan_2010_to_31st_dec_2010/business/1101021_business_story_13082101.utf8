The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SBI loans to turn dearer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SBI loans to turn dearer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RATE REJIG                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 20: Borrowers of State Bank of India (SBI) will now have to pay higher EMIs on their home and car loans.        
	The countrys largest bank today raised its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 25 basis points to 12.50 per cent and its base rate by 10 basis points to 7.60 per cent.        
	The two rate revisions will come into effect from October 21, the SBI announced today.         
	This is the second time in two months that the SBI is raising its BPLR. In August, the bank had raised this rate by half a percentage point. The domestic banking system moved over to a base rate regime from July 1. This is the minimum lending rate that banks can charge their customers. Loans disbursed after July 1 will be benchmarked to this rate. The SBI had then fixed its base rate at 7.50 per cent.         
	This is the first revision of SBIs base rate since July.        
	Banking circles say that despite the introduction of the base rate, many existing customers (loans disbursed before July 1) have not yet switched over from the BPLR system.         
	An analyst, who did not wish to be identified, said the SBI move to go in for a sharper hike in its BPLR vis-a-vis the base rate was perhaps designed to encourage existing customers to shift to the new base rate regime. The analyst, however, added that the key factor behind this hike in lending rates would be to protect its margins.         
	It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given customers the freedom to move over to the base rate regime. It has, however, told the banks that they should not levy any additional charges should a customer express his desire to do so.        
	The SBIs rate hike comes more than a fortnight before the central bank is set to announce its monetary policy. With inflation beyond the comfortable zone of the RBI, it is felt that it may raise key short-term rates by 25 basis points.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had given an indication of this rate hike when he recently said lending rates might have to be hiked as the cost of funds for the bank had been going up even as liquidity remained tight.        
	Last week, when he launched the banks Rs 1,000-crore bond issue, Bhatt told reporters that the cost of deposits had been rising since the middle of the last quarter.        
	In calculating its base rate, the SBI has been using its cost of deposits as a major component. The bank had recently increased deposit rates across various maturities by 25 to 75 basis points.

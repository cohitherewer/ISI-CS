The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Swamy wants to file FIR
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Swamy wants to file FIR
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 15: The Supreme Court will tomorrow hear a plea by Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy to allow the filing of an FIR against former telecom minister A. Raja in connection with the 2G spectrum scam.         
	Since Raja is no longer a minister now, no sanction is required from the Prime Minister for his prosecution, Swamy told a two-judge bench today.         
	Swamy had earlier filed a petition seeking the Prime Ministers sanction for Rajas prosecution.         
	He had alleged that though the CBI had filed a case against unknown persons many months ago, no progress had been made.         
	With Raja resigning, Swamy now sought his prosecution.         
	Swamy also invoked a Supreme Court judgment, which had said that no sanction was required to prosecute those against whom there were corruption charges.         
	The sanction clause could be invoked only to protect people who exercise bona fide powers and not those who indulge in corruption, which doesnt fall under official duty, the court had said in an earlier judgment.         
	The top court said it would hear Swamys plea tomorrow when it resumes hearing.        
	It was a low-key hearing today compared with the previous hearing when the court had pulled up the government for making slow progress in the probe and continuing with Raja despite the allegations against him.

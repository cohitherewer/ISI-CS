        Fund houses are launching multi-asset schemes. But how good are these? Srikumar Bondyopadhyay finds out                                            
	No matter how much you invest, theres never really any guarantee that you will make enough money, given the ways of the world.        
	Different asset classes give varied returns, depending on the market conditions and the state of the economy.        
	Last year belonged to equities  broad-based indices, sensex and Nifty were up more than 75 per cent each. Those who had invested at the rock bottom levels of March 2009, were rewarded with excellent returns. But if you had invested when the stock markets were at their peak in January 2008, then you are yet to recover the losses. During this period, returns from fixed income assets were also volatile.         
	Returns from debt instruments were subdued last year. But in 2008, when equity prices plunged, bond funds gave double-digit returns, mainly because of a sharp fall in interest rates triggered by the RBIs easy money policy in the aftermath of the global slowdown.         
	In the current calendar year, gold prices touched its historical high as investors, particularly in the developed markets, rushed for the yellow metal for a safe haven. Thus,we see that each asset class has given volatile returns within a short span of three years.         
	Find the balance        
	The question is how do you make money, irrespective of what happens to the economy?        
	Your chances of earning a good return depend on how you allocate your capital in a balanced portfolio, comprising various asset classes rather than spreading your investment within one asset. This is because different asset classes are differently correlated with each other.         
	Till a few years ago, creating a balanced portfolio was limited to two asset classes  equities and fixed-income investments. If someone wanted to get a better return than a plain vanilla debt fund but at a lower risk than in a diversified equity fund, balanced mutual fund was the only option.        
	Now, with the availability of index funds and exchange traded commodity funds (gold ETFs), mutual funds are offering multi-asset plans that invest in equities, fixed income securities, gold ETFs and ETFs based on foreign equity indices. By investing in a wider range of assets, mutual funds hope to ensure greater stability for investors.        
	The new breed of multi-asset funds is an extension of the traditional balanced funds, which largely invest in two assets  equities and bonds.         
	Packaged solutions        
	Balanced funds became popular after the stock market slumped following the burst of the dotcom bubble in 1999-2000. Small investors were increasingly attracted to funds that can effectively provide a one-stop solution to all their investment needs.         
	However, the launch of multi-asset plans by fund houses now has another story behind it. After the regulatory changes in the past 12 months, it will not be profitable for fund houses to launch plain equity funds that involve high risks. Fund houses are moving towards launching low-risk hybrid funds, including multi-asset funds, that involves passive management of underlying investments, said Akshay Gupta, chief executive officer of Peerless Fund Management Company Ltd.        
	According to Gupta, fund houses will be increasingly looking at packaged solutions to attract retail investors. Having a multi-asset fund as part of the core investment makes sense for small investors who have a long-term strategy.        
	Early to take a call        
	Theoretically, a multi-asset fund should be suitable for small investors who do not want to take much risk but want good return on their investments. But the actual performances of such funds are not yet established as they are new in the business.         
	Most of these funds function as an income/debt fund with a marginal exposure to equity, equity derivatives or gold. As a result, there is a drawback in terms of tax. At present, balanced and equity funds attract 15 per cent short-term capital gains tax and no long-term capital gains tax. Debt funds, however, are taxed according to personal income slabs in the short term and at 10 per cent in the long term (20 per cent with indexation).        
	In a multi-asset fund, there are multiple fund managers looking after each of the asset class. This may limit their freedom to take cash or investment positions. Earlier, several dynamic funds were launched with varying levels of exposure to equity, equity arbitrage and debt. But except for Franklin Templeton Indias Dynamic PE Ratio Fund of Fund, others failed to yield a good return.        
	Alternative plan        
	Instead of choosing a multi-asset fund, one can invest in diversified equity funds, debt funds and non-equity ETFs, such as gold ETFs, separately. You yourself can monitor the performance of each of the asset and rebalance your investments when required.         
	An investment portfolio should have diversification at two levels. First, you should allocate your capital among different assets that have little or low correlation. Second, spread your investment over different instruments within each asset class.         
	Diversification is different from asset allocation. Asset allocation refers to investment in more than one asset class. For example, an investor may choose to allocate 40 per cent of the money in stocks, 40 per cent in bonds and 20 per cent in other assets such as gold and commodities. Diversification is buying different assets within a single class. An investor deciding to allocate 40 per cent in stocks may choose to buy four different equity funds, or 15 different stocks.        
	A simply way can be to invest in a core portfolio, consisting of a low-cost equity sensex or Nifty index fund and fixed-income instruments such as PPF. The portfolio then can be topped with commodity ETFs, such as gold ETF and foreign equity index fund. It might be a bit premature now to bet big on multi-asset funds. Create a portfolio on your own  that way youre sure to make less mistakes.

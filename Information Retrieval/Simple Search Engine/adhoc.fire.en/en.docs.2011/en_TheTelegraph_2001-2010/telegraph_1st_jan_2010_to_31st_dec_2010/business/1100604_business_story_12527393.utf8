                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Worst over for Hind Steelworks
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 3: Hindustan Steelworks Construction Ltd (HSCL), which almost went out of business, is set to bounce back by diversifying into infrastructure and realty.        
	After two rounds of restructuring involving over Rs 1,700 crore, HSCL is now eyeing the land bank of PSUs for developing housing and commercial projects.        
	HSCL, an undertaking of the Union steel ministry, was set up in the 1960s to cater to emerging public sector steel plants at Bokaro, Rourkela and Durgapur.         
	Over the years, its manpower grew to 26,000, but orders started drying. The Centre spent Rs 350 crore on a voluntary retirement scheme and brought down the headcount to around 900.        
	According to a revival plan charted by A. Ferguson, HSCL has diversified into dams, port- and harbour-related constructions and housing, which have helped its order book to soar to over Rs 1,000 crore last fiscal.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, April 29: Andhra Bank has received a licence to set up banking operations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in collaboration with the Bank of Baroda and Indian Overseas Bank.         
	R.S. Reddy, the chairman and managing director of Andhra Bank, said the joint venture with a corpus of Rs 400 crore would commence operations in the next three to six months.         
	Andhra Bank, which has a 25 per cent stake in the venture, will invest Rs 100 crore. Indian Overseas Bank holds 35 per cent, and BoB has picked up a 45 per cent stake in the venture.         
	Reddy said the bank had made ample provisions for covering non-performing assets this year. We have taken this precaution as the economy is still not fully out of the woods and there is likely to be more pressure on the margins of yield and interest, he said.         
	Andhra Bank has posted a 60.15 per cent rise in profit at Rs 1,046 crore during the year ended March 2010 against Rs 653 crore a year ago. It has recorded a 29.26 per cent growth in business at Rs 134,194 crore against Rs 103,818 crore in the previous fiscal.         
	Operating profit has grown 40.51 per cent to Rs 1,810 crore from Rs 1,288 crore a year ago. Non-interest income has risen 34.90 per cent to Rs 2,195 crore from Rs 1,627 crore a year ago.        
	For the fourth quarter ended March 31, net profit rose 19.40 per cent to Rs 240.26 crore from Rs 201.21 crore in the year-ago period.

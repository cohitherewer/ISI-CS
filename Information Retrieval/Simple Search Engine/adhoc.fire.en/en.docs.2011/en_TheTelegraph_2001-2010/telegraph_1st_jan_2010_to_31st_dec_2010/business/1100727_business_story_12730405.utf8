The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | UK team to push for easy FDI

	New Delhi, July 26: British Prime Minister David Cameron and his team will try to gently prod India into easing foreign direct investment norms in areas such as insurance, banking and defence.        
	A key proposal will be to allow Lloyds to set up shop here. Top finance ministry officials said Britain had been asking India to allow Lloyds to sell re-insurance in India.         
	The government will have to rework the insurance laws to allow Llyods to operate in the country as it is not an insurance company but an exchange where different insurers do business under one roof.         
	At present, local firms are allowed to do re-insurance with Lloyds syndicates. But Lloyds is keen to open a trading floor here to get direct business.         
	Britain, along with the US and other European countries, has also been seeking an increase in FDI in insurance to 49 per cent. However, the government will move cautiously because of political resistance. Gerry Grimstone of Standard Life will be part of Camerons team.        
	Half a dozen of UKs leading insurers, including Prudential, are involved in joint ventures in India and this means the Cameron team will always be interested in what we do about FDI in that sector, officials said.        
	Banking will be another focus area. There is discontent over the hurdles insetting up shop. Around 20 licences are required for each bank branch. John Varley of Barclays Bank and Peter Sands of Standard Chartered are among the British bankers in the team.        
	The government is unwilling to open up the banking sector further at this point. However, it may allow foreign banks to set up more branches as well as provide concessions in retail banking.        
	The UK is also keen on a higher FDI limit in defence.         
	Sources said top ministers were looking to relax the foreign investment cap from 26 per cent to up to 49 per cent, but the government may try to link this with the West lifting restrictions on agencies such as Isro and the DRDO.        
	Dick Olver, the chairman of BAE Systems, is in Camerons team.

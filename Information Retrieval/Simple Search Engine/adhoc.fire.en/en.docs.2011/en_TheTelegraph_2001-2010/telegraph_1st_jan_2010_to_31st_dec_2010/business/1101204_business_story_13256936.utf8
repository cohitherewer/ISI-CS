The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wake-up call on loan clearance
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Wake-up call on loan clearance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 3: The finance ministry today asked banks to be watchful about any subversion of lending processes by some undesirable parties, referring to the recent bribes-for-loans scam that led to the arrest of top officials at banks and financial institutions.        
	Addressing banks at Bancon here today via a video link from the capital, R. Gopalan, secretary of financial services, said banks should be on guard against the processes being subverted by undesirable business parties as has come to the light recently in some places.        
	Gopalan said the banks had not exercised enough care while selecting the beneficiary borrowers and had slipped on their evaluation of the business proposals without insisting on immaculate documentation followed by periodic inspections and reviews.         
	It seems that in the recent past, we have not been careful enough on this count which has led to stray incidences of burgeoning non-performing asset (NPA) portfolios of the banks, he added.        
	Last month, the Central Bureau of Investigation unearthed a racket in which the top management of public sector lenders allegedly accepted bribes from middlemen to clear the loan proposals of some realty companies. Eight people, including former LIC Housing Finance CEO Ramachandran Nair and senior officials from Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Central Bank of India, were arrested in connection with the scam.        
	You should ensure that all procedures and due diligences consistent with board-approved guidelines are adhered to while approving loans, Gopalan said while urging them to strengthen their NPA monitoring system to ensure that appropriate action was taken in the case of payment defaults by borrowers.        
	He stressed that bankers should espouse the principles of basic banking by extending their reach to the unbanked sections of the country in line with the goal of financial inclusion.        
	Microfinance future        
	Microfinance lending across the country will be dead, absolutely by January 1 unless banks release fresh credit to the cash-strapped sector, an umbrella body representing MFIs said today.        
	If the current severe credit crunch continues till December, there will be no microfinance in 2011. Come first January, we are dead, absolutely... it will be finished, Vijay Mahajan, president of the Microfinance Institutions Network, told reporters on the sidelines of Bancon 2010.

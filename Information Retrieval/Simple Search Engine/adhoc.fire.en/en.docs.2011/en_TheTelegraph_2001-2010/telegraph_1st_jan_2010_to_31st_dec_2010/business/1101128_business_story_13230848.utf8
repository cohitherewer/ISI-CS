          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          ON FAST TRACK                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 27: The premium car market in India is growing at 60 per cent and German auto firms are gearing up to cash in on the trend.        
	BMW is planning to sell 5,000 units this year, while the Volkswagen Group, which includes the Audi, Skoda and Volkswagen brands, will double its sales figure from 1,800 last year to 3,600 this year.         
	Mercedes-Benz, the oldest entrant in the Indian market, is giving BMW close competition with a sale of nearly 5000 units. Both BMW and Mercedes have an equal 39 per cent share of the premium car market with the remaining 20 per cent shared by Audi, Jaguar, Land Rover, Porsche and other high end automobiles available in the Indian market.        
	At the annual meeting of the members of the eastern region of Indo-German Chamber of Commerce here today, BMW president Andreas Schaff and Volkswagen India managing director Maik Stephan shared their vision of the Indian premium vehicle market.         
	In the last three years, BMW India has achieved the number one position, said Schaff in his address.         
	The company now plans to expand its CKD production base with the X1 being assembled at the BMW Chennai facility.         
	We have witnessed unexpected growth, said Stephan on the Volkswagen groups performance in India. The group sold 1,800 units in 2009, and is poised to double its volume in 2010.

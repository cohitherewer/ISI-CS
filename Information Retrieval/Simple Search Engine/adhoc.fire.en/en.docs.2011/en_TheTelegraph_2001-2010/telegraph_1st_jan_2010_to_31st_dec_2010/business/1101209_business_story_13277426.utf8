The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | November exports up 27%
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      November exports up 27%
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Khullar: Growth gain                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Exports rose 26.8 per cent in November to $18.9 billion, bolstering the governments expectation that it might top the $200-billion target to touch $215 billion this fiscal.        
	Exports are doing pretty well. At this rate, four months from now, we are looking at anywhere between $210 billion and $215 billion, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said. At one point of time, even the target of $200 billion had looked difficult as a surge in foreign capital inflows jacked up the rupee.         
	A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisation, said the export basket was undergoing a big change, with emerging sectors such as engineering, petroleum, pharmaceuticals and chemicals were gaining prominence.        
	The big positive on exports came from engineering, which increased 50 per cent during April-November to $31.6 billion followed by gems and jewellery at 16 per cent. The export of petroleum refinery products grew 41 per cent because of a spike in global crude prices, while cotton yarn increased 46.5 per cent.         
	Imports during November grew at a slower pace of 11.2 per cent to $27.8 billion.         
	In October, exports were up 21.3 per cent at $18 billion. During April-November, exports increased 26.7 per cent to $140.3 billion.        
	Khullar said events in Ireland, Spain and Portugal could impact exports, and the government was keeping a watch.        
	These are big economies and a slowdown in them will affect the global economy. Though demand from the European Union is showing signs of cooling, Indias exports are mostly insulated as the country caters to a diverse market, he said.        
	For April-November, imports expanded 24 per cent to $222 billion. The trade deficit for the first eight months of 2010-11 stands at $81.7 billion.        
	If the current trend continues, the country could end up with a deficit of $120 billion. I am not sanguine. One blip on crude prices and the import bill suddenly zooms. On pro rata basis, we are looking at $120 billion with a caveat that if oil prices go up, it can be $130-135 billion, Khullar said. At present, crude prices are ruling at $88-89 per barrel.

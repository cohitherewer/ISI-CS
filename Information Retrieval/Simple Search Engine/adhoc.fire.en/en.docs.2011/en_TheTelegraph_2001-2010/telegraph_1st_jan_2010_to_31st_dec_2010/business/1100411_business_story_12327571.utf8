The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Insurance cop defies Sebi stricture
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Insurance cop defies Sebi stricture
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      J. Hari Narayan, IRDA Chairman                          
	Calcutta, April 10: A day after Sebi banned the sale of unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips), the insurance regulator today asked the affected life insurers to do business as usual, including offering, marketing and servicing these schemes.        
	In a late evening release, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) said the Sebi order would jeopardise and adversely impact the interests of policyholders and insurers.         
	The order would stop renewals of insurance policies already invested by the public, may result in the forced premature surrender of insurance policies, causing substantial loss to policyholders and insurers, IRDA chairman J. Hari Narayan said in the signed release.         
	Moreover, the ban would dry up revenue flow for the insurers, which could disrupt the payment of benefits on maturity, on death and on other admissible claims, putting policyholders and the general public to irreparable financial loss, the IRDA said.        
	The IRDA issued the directive in exercise of the powers vested with it under Section 34 (1) (a) and (b) of the Insurance Act 1938.        
	In 2008-09, there were 7.03 crore unit-linked insurance plans in force, involving a premium of Rs 90,645 crore. In 2009-10 till February, 16.7 lakh Ulips were sold, entailing a premium of Rs 44,611 crore. The 14 insurance companies indicted in the Sebi order had an equity capital worth Rs 16,281 crore as on March 31, 2009.        
	The finance ministry, meanwhile, decided to keep a safe distance from the ongoing row, saying the two regulators had to resolve the issue.         
	Its a matter between regulators; so they have to decide, said finance secretary Ashok Chawla.         
	Earlier in the day, the IRDA chief had said, Sebis position is not well founded and matters arising out of its order will be addressed expeditiously in the appropriate forum in accordance with law.        
	He, however, said individual insurers would have to challenge the Sebi order in the court of law because the order was issued against individual companies and the IRDA had not been made a party to it.        
	Though insurers named in the Sebi order, such as Max New York Life and Birla Sun Life Insurance, did not want to officially disclose their plans of action today, their legal officials were summoned to work on a weekly holiday.        
	We have not received any communication from Sebi and would not want to comment, said an official of Max New York Life Insurance Company.         
	While the insurance regulator has decided to meet the affected insurance companies, including SBI Life, ICICI Prudential and Tata AIG, the date for the meeting has not been finalised.        
	A Birla Sun Life Insurance official said the Life Insurance Council, an apex association of all life insurers, might decide on the next course of action on the Sebi order.        
	The Sebi order indicted only 14 out of 23 life insurance companies operating at present. The ban does not apply to all life insurers. We are sending a communique to chief operating officers of insurers indicted in the ban for their opinion on what they would like to do next. This will be done by tomorrow. We shall explore all options, including the legal course, said S.B. Mathur, the secretary-general of the Life Insurance Council.         
	Interestingly, the nine life insurance companies left out in the order include the LIC.         
	When Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave was asked why the LIC was not banned from raising public money from Ulips, he replied, I dont want to comment on this.

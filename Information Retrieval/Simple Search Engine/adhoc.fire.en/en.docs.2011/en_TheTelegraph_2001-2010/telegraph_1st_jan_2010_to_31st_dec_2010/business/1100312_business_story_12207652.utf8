	Mumbai, March 11: AstraZeneca has signed a deal with Torrent Pharmaceuticals for a steady supply of a range of cheap generic drugs that it intends to hawk in emerging markets.         
	The Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company said in London that the deal would initially cover 18 products in nine countries and would be expanded over time.         
	No financial terms were disclosed. Torrent did not immediately come out with a statement, but its stock leapt over 3 per cent to close at Rs 490.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	The deal mirrors similar arrangements that the big pharma players have signed with several Indian firms over the past few years, signalling that theres money to be made by targeting emerging markets with a product pipeline of cheap generics.        
	AstraZeneca will host an investor day on March 16 to highlight its plans for emerging markets. It intends to use its own brand to sell these products in developing markets where it already has a strong commercial footprint.         
	Torrent will manufacture the medicines working to AstraZenecas quality and processing standards. Major drug makers are focusing on emerging markets as growth slows in the West and many blockbuster medicines lose patent protection.         
	Emerging markets are forecast to contribute around 70 per cent to pharmaceutical growth in the next five years and branded generics represent approximately 50 per cent by value in these markets, AstraZeneca said. Last December, Torrent Pharma had denied media reports that it was planning to sell some stake to Takeda Pharmaceuticals of Japan. There is no move on the part of the company or its promoters to sell stake, in part or in whole, to any player, national or global, it had said.         
	The buzz around generics began a couple of years ago when multinational giants such as Pfizer and GSK signed a flurry of deals with Indian firms to source generics products.

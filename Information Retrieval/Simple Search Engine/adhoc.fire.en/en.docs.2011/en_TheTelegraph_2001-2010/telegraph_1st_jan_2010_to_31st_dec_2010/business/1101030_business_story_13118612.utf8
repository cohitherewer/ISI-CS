The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI bid to ease liquidity crunch
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RBI bid to ease liquidity crunch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 29: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today decided to open the cash taps for banks which have been desperately scouring for funds to meet the growing borrowing requirements of their customers.        
	To help the banks tide themselves over a liquidity crunch, the RBI permitted banks to draw down more funds from the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) window up to 1 per cent more on their deposits.         
	LAF is the mechanism through which the central bank injects or sucks out liquidity from the system.         
	Under this system, banks can borrow from the RBI from its repo window at 6 per cent to take care of their temporary liquidity mismatches. On the other hand, if banks have surplus funds, they can park it with the RBI.        
	The banking system has been witnessing an extremely tight liquidity situation in the past fortnight, prompting them to borrow heavily from the LAF window. Over the past few days, they have consistently borrowed over Rs 80,000 crore from the RBIs one-day repo window.        
	Banking circles attribute various reasons for this crunch. Last month, the cash crunch arose because of the advance tax payments by companies. This has been exacerbated by the Rs 15,000-crore IPO of state-owned Coal India Ltd and a spurt in festival season demand. The offering from Coal India saw investors borrowing heavily from banks to subscribe to the issue. Deposits with banks have failed to keep pace, leading to the liquidity mismatch.        
	The RBI today said the LAF window had been in the deficit mode (as reflected by banks drawing funds) in the recent period and in order to provide liquidity comfort arising out of frictional liquidity pressure, it was resorting to certain temporary measures. It will now start conducting a special second LAF on two days  October 29 and November 1.        
	Further, a special two-day repo auction under LAF will be conducted on October 30.         
	Scheduled commercial banks may get additional liquidity support under the LAF to the extent of up to 1 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as on October 8, it observed.        
	The RBI has been undertaking calibrated actions to absorb surplus liquidity since October last year. However, liquidity became tight in June 2010 because of the 3G/BWA auctions. While this has persisted till now, it brought about a shift in LAF as the repo rate under LAF has now become the operating policy rate from the reverse repo rate earlier.        
	Bankers say the RBI has also deliberately kept the system in a deficit mode, or liquidity tight, to make the repo rate more effective as it has been taking policy measures to control inflation. Keeping the liquidity tight also helps the RBI in the transmission of policy rates to deposit or lending rates.         
	In fact, the liquidity support measures today announced by the central bank come just days before it is set to review the monetary policy. In its monetary policy on November 2, the central bank is expected to raise key rates by 25 basis points.        
	MFI panel        
	An RBI appointed sub-committee will examine the recovery mechanism of microfinance institutions (MFIs) and their interest rate practices, amid criticism of these lenders charging exorbitant loan rates and using strong-arm tactics for recovery.        
	To examine the prevalent practices of MFIs regarding interest rates, lending and recovery practices, to identify trends that impinge on borrowers interest, the RBI said in a notification.        
	Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank had appointed the sub-panel to look into the functioning of MFIs. The committee will submit its report in three months. The RBI will examine the conditions under which loans to MFIs can be classified as priority sector lending and give appropriate recommendations.        
	Currently, MFIs charge up to 34 per cent interest rate per year on loans.        
	At present, the RBI regulates only those MFIs which are registered with it as non-banking finance companies.         
	The finance ministry is preparing a bill on regulating MFIs and has finished consultations with stakeholders to table the bill in the winter session.        
	But this has been delayed now, since the whole issue came under a lot of controversy after a number of suicide cases were reported in Andhra Pradesh, allegedly due to coercive methods adopted by these lenders to recover their money from poor borrowers.        
	This prompted the state to promulgate an ordinance to rein in MFIs and the RBI to constitute a sub-committee to look into the functioning of these lenders.

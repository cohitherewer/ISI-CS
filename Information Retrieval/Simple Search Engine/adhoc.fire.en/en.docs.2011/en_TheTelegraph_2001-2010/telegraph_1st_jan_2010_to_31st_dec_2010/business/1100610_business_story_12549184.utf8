          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 9: Is the Oracle of Omaha investing in Bajaj Finserv Ltd?         
	The stock soared on the bourses today amid talk that Warren Buffett, the worlds legendary value investor, was planning to pick up a stake in the Bajaj group company through Berkshire Hathaway.        
	The Bajaj groups financial services company denied the news in a communication to the National Stock Exchange.         
	We would like to state that we are neither in touch with Berkshire Hathaway nor are we aware of any plans of theirs to invest in our company, Bajaj Finserv said. However, it is learnt that certain private equity players have evinced interest in picking up a stake in the company.        
	The rumour that swirled in the market was that Buffett was looking to invest between 5 and 10 per cent in Bajaj Finserv and discussions between the two were in a preliminary stage. The stock opened higher at Rs 492.70 against its previous close of Rs 447.90. The clarification by the company saw the shares coming off this level and ending at Rs 466.95, a gain of Rs 19.05 or 4.2 per cent.         
	Earlier this month, there was talk that Buffett was planning to visit India sometime in March next year to suss out investment opportunities.        
	If Berkshire Hathaway invests in Bajaj Finserv, it would be Buffetts first investment in India.         
	Although there has been speculation over the past few years that Buffett was eyeing a stake in Indian companies, he has stayed out of the country.         
	The current business lines of Bajaj Finserv includes life and general insurance  Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance  in partnership with Allianz. The company also offers consumer durables and two-wheeler loans through Bajaj Auto Finance.        
	The company has also joined hands with Allianz in the asset management business, which is expected to start operations in April next year.        
	Recently, the company ventured into the wealth management business and construction equipment financing as part of its plans to expand its product suite. Bajaj Finserv has also indicated that it may also look at a banking licence after the Reserve Bank of India comes out with norms for the entry of new players.        
	In construction equipment financing, the company is looking to capture a slice of the Rs 15,000-crore industry where banks along with select non-banking finance companies are key players. It is targeting medium to large customers in the first phase.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Exemptions to facilitate lending
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Exemptions to facilitate lending
										      ROBIN ROY      COUNTEDOWN TO BUDGET 2010                                          
	Come February-end, all eyes and ears look towards Delhi for some directional thrust from the finance minister, which will provide those few extra rupees, to spend, invest or save for a rainy day, all in the continuous strive to beat inflation. A whole set of calculations begin to be made in anticipation of policy triggers on all important segments of the economy.         
	So what could the budget bring for the common man? Lets first take a quick look at a few key scenarios:        
	Payment of arrears by PSUs, by government: This will mean money in the hands of consumers, which, in turn, will lead to more spending on consumer items, margin money for a new house and buying a new insurance policy.        
	CRR hike by RBI: Lesser lendable deposits in the hands of banks, leading to lesser ability to give loans to consumers. Banks seeking to earn adequate profits by higher lending rates.        
	Plenty of deposits (liquidity) with banks: Bringing down cost of deposits, implying reduced lending rates, which will lead to more affordable loans for mortgages, holidays, cars and marriages.         
	Increased tax savings because of home loans, education loans: More cash in hand leading to increased spending on consumer durables. Higher production of such goods and more jobs in such consumer industries.        
	The budget sets expectations in the backdrop of a number of factors:        
	a) Inflation and impact on cost of essential items.        
	b) Impact of interest rates on asset prices: real estate, gold, commodities and their affordability.         
	c) Increase or decrease in savings from salaries for future annuities.        
	d) Increase in cost of services or utilities such as medical, transportation, insurance premium.        
	So, which are the expectations which can have some impact on the above factors?         
	Tax exemption for banks for core projects: To boost infrastructure lending by banks, re-introduction of tax exemptions is needed. It will help banks to lend more freely to such projects which in turn will enhance the market value of housing properties.        
	Increase in exemption of interest under housing loan from Rs 1.5 lakh to 3 lakh or more: This will help the retail mortgage market pick up further and push credit growth from banks and sustain their margins.        
	Reduction in interest rates for small savings and tax-free status for fixed deposits up to three years and more: Currently fixed deposits of five years and more are tax free. This can be reduced to three years, which will boost more deposits to flow into the banking sector, thus helping the banks to manage their asset-liability mismatches better.        
	Increase in interest subvention on short-term farm credit (announced in the last budget): This should be continued and the additional subvention of 1 per cent to be paid from this year will act as incentive to those farmers who repay short-term crop loans on schedule.         
	With this the climate for farm loan, repayment is expected to improve and thereby bank bottom lines are also set to improve.        
	The budget in turn prompts the average citizen to plan their own mini-budgets. So moderate your expectations from the budget even as you bring out your calculators!

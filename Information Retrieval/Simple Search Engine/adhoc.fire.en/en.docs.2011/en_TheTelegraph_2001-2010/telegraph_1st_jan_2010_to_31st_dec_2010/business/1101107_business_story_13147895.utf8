	Mumbai, Nov. 6: Some of the worlds biggest corporate chieftains today called for technology cooperation between the US and India in areas such as energy and education, stressing that firms should not be the sole beneficiaries of such deal-making.        
	Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said Indian companies could gain from technological expertise that the US had in discovering shale gas; PepsiCo chairperson Indra Nooyi made out a strong case for the adoption of the successful online education model in the US here in India.        
	Ambani and Nooyi were speaking at separate sessions at the US-India Business and Entrepreneurship Summit. Participating in a panel discussion on the issue of creation of jobs and opportunities, Ambani who has been in the news for snapping up shale gas assets in the US recently, said the robust economic growth posted by India must result in benefits for millions of ordinary Indians.         
	Jeffrey Immelt, chairman amp; CEO of General Electric, which has a major exposure here in India, said though the giant had created lots of jobs in the country, it was looking forward to a win-win situation when it came to forging a lasting relationship between the two countries.         
	Responding to a query on US President Barack Obamas stress on job creation back home, Anand Mahindra, vice-chairman and managing director of Mahindra amp; Mahindra, saw nothing wrong in it. We can cry that it is unfair. Hes got to talk about jobs, he said, adding that the Mahindra group had created more than 6,000 jobs in the US and that it was keen to start a auto assembly plant there.

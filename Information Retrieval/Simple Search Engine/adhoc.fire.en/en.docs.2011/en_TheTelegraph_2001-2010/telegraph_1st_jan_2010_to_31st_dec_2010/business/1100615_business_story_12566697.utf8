	Mumbai, June 14: Sun TV Network founder Kalanithi Maran will pay Rs 740 crore to buy a 37.73 per cent stake in no-frills carrier SpiceJet and plans to acquire another 20 per cent in the airline through an open offer.        
	The deal to buy the 37.73 per cent stake has been struck with US-based investor Wilbur Ross and the Kansagra family-owned Royal Holdings Services Ltd for Rs 47.25 per share.        
	The mandatory open offer that will follow will be priced at Rs 57.76 a share. The SpiceJet stock closed at Rs 55.15 on the BSE today, 1.61 per cent lower than its previous close.         
	If the open offer is successful, Maran, who owns 20 television channels in south India, will need to cough up another Rs 480 crore. The offer to buy a stake in the budget airline has been made by Maran and Kal Airways, an unlisted company promoted by Maran and his wife Kavery Kalanithi.        
	The transaction will entail Maran and Kal Airways buying a 30.23 per cent stake from Wilbur Ross who has recently converted some foreign currency convertible bonds in the airline to stock and another 7.49 per cent from the Kansagara family.        
	SpiceJet is the only Indian airline to make a profit last year of Rs 61.4 crore. The airline is also raising $75 million of funds through ADRs/GDRs or a qualified institutional placement.         
	An analyst at Angel Broking said the deal would enable the airline to expand with Maran onboard. The carrier, which has a fleet of 20 Boeing 737s at present, has been given permission to fly overseas routes, including Bangladesh, Nepal and the Maldives. It is expected to add five aircraft to its fleet this year.         
	Marans decision to buy a stake in SpiceJet will make him the single largest shareholder in the airline that may further benefit the running of the airline, said a Mumbai-based analyst.        
	Ajay Singh, who holds roughly 12 per cent in the airline along with his associates, has decided not to tender his shares in the open offer.

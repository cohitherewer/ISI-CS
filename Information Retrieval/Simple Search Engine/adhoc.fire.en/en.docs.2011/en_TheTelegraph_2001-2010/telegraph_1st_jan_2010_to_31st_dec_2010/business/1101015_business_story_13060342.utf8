The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mastek slips into the red
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mastek slips into the red
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 14: Mastek  the second rung technology firm  today stunned the markets by reporting a loss of Rs 13.46 crore in the second quarter ended September 30 against a profit of Rs 26.41 crore in the same quarter a year ago.         
	The company blamed the poor show on a string of unexpected reverses and scrambled to put together a six-point plan to pull the firm out of the morass. This has been a disappointing quarter. A set of adverse events came together, unexpectedly, to cause a severe decline in revenues and a negative profit after-tax, said Sudhakar Ram, chairman and Group CEO of Mastek.        
	In the first quarter ended June 30, the company had reported a net profit of Rs 2.51 crore. However, this was on a consolidated basis. On a standalone basis, it had suffered a Rs 1.3-crore loss.        
	Total income in the second quarter ended September 30 declined to Rs 151.35 crore from Rs 191.44 crore in the year-ago period.        
	The Mastek share tumbled on the bourses after it announced the results. It fell 3.34 per cent to close at Rs 235.85 on the BSE. Masteks disappointing numbers come just a day before technology titan Infosys announces its second quarter results.        
	However, most analysts expect the Bangalore-based company and other frontline IT firms to declare excellent numbers. Top IT companies traditionally announce robust results in the second quarter.        
	Mastek said its numbers were botched by a sharp reduction in development revenues from one major client account, some revenue reversals in the India/Asia market, and the implementation of annual wage hikes of both onsite and offshore employees.         
	It said its margins were impacted by higher staff costs resulting from annual wage increases (that came into effect from July 1) and an increase in the headcount.         
	Sources said the wage hike was roughly 20 per cent. It also spent more on research and development with the addition of a client in the insurance vertical in North America. It had to wrestle with the problem of lower utilisation of workforce as newly hired employees tend to become productive only with a lag.        
	A company statement said these setbacks neutralised the benefits of cost efficiencies in other areas and forex gains made during the quarter, resulting in an after-tax loss of Rs 13.5 crore for the quarter.

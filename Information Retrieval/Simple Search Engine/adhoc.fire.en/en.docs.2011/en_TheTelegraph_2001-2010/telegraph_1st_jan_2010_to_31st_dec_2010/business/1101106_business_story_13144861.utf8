The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Toyota profit up four-fold
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Toyota profit up four-fold
                            
	Tokyo, Nov. 5 (AP): Toyotas second-quarter profit more than quadrupled despite lingering worries about the safety of its cars after massive recalls that are still dogging its sales in the US.        
	Toyota reported a profit of 98.7 billion yen ($1.2 billion) for July-September, up from 21.8 billion yen a year ago but lower than analyst estimates. Quarterly sales rose 5.8 per cent to 4.80 trillion yen ($59.5 billion).        
	Toyota Motor Corp is the only major auto maker whose US sales have been sluggish despite a recent onslaught of incentives that have boosted other auto makers results, underlining how its once sterling image continues to be tarnished in that crucial market.        
	Like other Japanese exporters, Toyota is also fighting damage from a strong yen that erodes the value of overseas earnings.        
	The worlds top auto maker by vehicle sales raised its profit forecast for the year through March 2011, albeit modestly, to 350 billion yen ($4.3 billion) from an earlier forecast for 340 billion yen ($4.2 billion).         
	That will mark a 67 per cent rebound from the previous year, when the maker of the Prius hybrid and the Camry sedan was hit hard by the recall woes.         
	Toyota raised its global sales forecast for the full year to 7.41 million vehicles from 7.38 million. That will be a 2.4 per cent gain from 7.24 million vehicles sold the previous year.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Industry opposes ad hoc tea wage hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      ITA chairman Aditya Khaitan in Calcutta on Friday. (PTI)                          
	Calcutta, Sept. 17: The tea industry has opposed a proposal for an ad hoc increase in the wages of workers in Bengal.        
	The Indian Tea Association, the representative body of garden owners, said there was no need to raise wages ahead of a new agreement that would come into force from the next fiscal.        
	The co-ordination committee, a platform of 26 unions in the industry, had asked for a special increase without quantifying any amount.        
	Earlier, the state labour ministry had also fought for the 2.5 lakh workers in the Bengal gardens, asking owners to raise wages to Rs 100 a day. At present, a worker gets Rs 67 in wages per day.        
	ITA chairman Aditya Khaitan said garden owners did much more than just pay wages.         
	The composite wage cost for industry in Bengal is around Rs 140.90 per day and above the NREGA (national rural employment guarantee act) level, he said.        
	Apart from basic wages, a worker is entitled to get foodgrain (wheat and rice), dry tea, fuel (wood), housing, education and maternity benefit among others.        
	The basic wage structure comprising cash as well as fringe benefits, both statutory and those settled through agreements, has been reviewed by several government panels .         
	The wage agreement has withstood the test of time. There is no need to tinker with it now, Khaitan said.        
	However, industry veterans admitted there could be non-compliance in some gardens.         
	But there is a well-oiled state machinery to catch people who are not providing the facilities they should, C.S. Bedi, managing director of Rossell Tea, said.        
	Industry observers said the Left Front was trying to push a hike ahead of the 2011 assembly elections.

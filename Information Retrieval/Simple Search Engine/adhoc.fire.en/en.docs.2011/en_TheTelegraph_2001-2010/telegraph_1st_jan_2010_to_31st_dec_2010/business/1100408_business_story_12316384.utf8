The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex gets a glimpse of 18000
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sensex gets a glimpse of 18000
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, April 7: The sensex surged past 18000 for the first time in two years, but the rally sputtered out quickly in the absence of strong cues that could prop up the market.         
	The bellwether index lost steam as investors scooped up gains, closing at 17970.02 with a tame 29-point gain over Tuesdays close.        
	Analysts reckon that the fourth-quarter earnings season which begins next week with Infosys Technologies due to unveil full-year results on April 13 can provide direction to a market that has run up quickly this year and triggered talk of stretched valuations.         
	The sensex is currently trading at 17 times its estimated earnings, sparking some unease among foreign investors who now find Indian stocks the most expensive in Asia after China. Foreign funds have pumped around $4.9 billion into Indian equities in this calendar year.         
	The markets will continue to remain choppy. We have entered a new territory after a gap of two years. Everybody is waiting for the Infosys results which is a very big event in itself. That will determine whether the markets will go up or down, says Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS.         
	One aspect that is weighing on everyones minds is the sudden hardening of the rupee which scaled a 19-month high on Monday  an aspect that could dent the profitability of the frontline IT companies which depend very heavily on dollar-denominated revenues.         
	Marketmen said Infosys could report profits in excess of Rs 1,600 crore, a 1.6 per cent growth sequentially.         
	A research head from a leading brokerage, who does not wish to be identified, here said concerns of high valuations were one of the major reasons why the market couldnt cling to its gains. Its therefore important that corporate India declares strong results, he said.         
	While the benchmark index opened lower, it went into the green minutes after opening and hit the 18000 mark on positive cues coming from Asia.         
	It was on February 27, 2008, that the sensex was at this level the last time. Though it subsequently slipped on profit booking, it again regained this level on strong buying by foreign institutions and hit the intra-day peak of 18047.86.         
	The re-emergence of profit booking saw the index erasing most of its gains and ending with a gain of only 28.65 points. Although most of the sectoral indices ended in the green, the IT, metal and banking stocks pulled the index down.

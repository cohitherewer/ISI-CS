          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: New York-based CA Technologies, formerly Computer Associates, is focusing on cloud computing to grow in the Indian infotech sector.        
	Cloud computing is a platform where software applications and related resources can be shared online.         
	According to consulting firm Zinnov Management Consulting, Indias cloud computing market will be around $1 billion in the next five years.        
	The tech giant has spent around $1 billion in the last 14 months to acquire a number of global cloud computing firms, including Arcot Systems, 4Base and Nimsoft.         
	The firm has also earmarked $500 million globally in the current fiscal for acquisitions, primarily to bolster its cloud strategy.        
	We are looking at cloud computing as a big opportunity and will continue to acquire companies in that area to emerge as an undisputed leader in end-to-end cloud services, Lionel Lim, head (Asia Pacific) of CA Technologies, told The Telegraph.        
	According to Ernst amp; Young, over 72 per cent of Indian IT infrastructure firms will adopt cloud computing in a big way over the next two to three years.        
	CA Technologies is also keen on doing software work for infrastructure projects in Calcutta, Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Orissa and Bihar.        
	In the east, countries such as Bhutan and Nepal are also virgin markets where we see huge opportunities for growth, said Amit Chatterjee, India managing director for CA Technologies.

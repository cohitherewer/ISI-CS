The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tighter capital rules
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tighter capital rules
                            
	London, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Global regulators meeting today look set to finalise tougher bank capital rules roughly in line with expectations, but the package may take effect sooner than anticipated, raising investor concerns over dividends.        
	Germanys Die Zeit newspaper reported on Monday evening it had obtained a draft of the finalised package showing that banks would have to hold Tier 1 capital of 9 per cent, including a 3 per cent so-called conservation buffer.        
	At least 5 per cent of Tier 1 will have to be in the form of pure equity or retained earnings for maximum market shock absorbency. The current Tier 1 ratio minimum is 4 per cent, with a core pure equity minimum of 2 per cent.        
	The leak sparked some skittishness in Europes stock market as investors refocused on how much capital banks may need to raise and how this might hit dividend payments.        
	The STOXX Europe banks index was down 1.5 per cent at 1232 GMT, while the broader market was off 0.7 per cent.        
	The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision meeting in Switzerland is finalising a package of Basel III reforms aimed at forcing banks to hold enough capital so that state rescues of lenders in the next crisis are less likely.        
	Consensus path        
	The committee of central bankers and supervisory officials from nearly 30 countries aims to agree on new higher levels of capital requirements and how long banks will have to meet them.        
	A spokesperson for the committee said it was unclear whether there would be any announcements today.        
	Germany continued to press for more time for its banks so they dont have to raise huge amounts of capital quickly.        
	We want a tightening of the rules... (but) the financial sector must be in a position to continue to carry out its business, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said.        
	Analysts and regulators have been expecting the new levels under Basel III to come in at around 6 per cent for core Tier 1 with a conservation buffer of at least 2 per cent.        
	Andrew Lim, an analyst at Matrix Group, said the minimum ratios outlined in the newspaper leak were at the more onerous end of what the market had been expecting once the additional buffers were added.        
	This, we believe, is incrementally negative and is one of the reasons why the market is weak today, Lim said.        
	Our analysis shows that BBVA, HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, Unicredit and Barclays would still be at risk of being in the conservation buffer even by 2013-end, Lim said.        
	Any bank that failed to keep above the capital conservation buffer will have to restrict payouts such as bonuses, dividends and share buybacks.        
	Banking and regulatory sources confirmed the Die Zeit figures but said it was unclear if the figures were final and cautioned that the debate over phase-in periods was continuing.        
	If the new core minimum is 5 per cent or 6 per cent then that looks good. A majority of European banks will be definitely above that level, said Antonio Ramirez of Keefe, Bruyette amp; Woods.        
	Obviously there will be a group of banks below that level but for the system overall, that looks like a very affordable level, Ramirez said.

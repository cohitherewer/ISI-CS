          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Hind Copper chairman Shakeen Ahmed in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, May 14: Hindustan Copper hopes to get the cabinets approval within the next fortnight for a follow-on public offer to raise between Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore.        
	Chairman Shakeen Ahmed said the government and the public sector unit would split the proceeds in equal measure.        
	There will be a 10 per cent fresh equity offer to meet our growth plans, while the government will sell 10 per cent of its holding, he said.        
	The company has posted a profit of Rs 154.88 crore in 2009-10 against a loss of Rs 10.21 crore a year ago even after setting aside Rs 72 crore for arrears arising out of a pay revision.        
	After the cabinet approves the float, merchant bankers will be appointed and a draft red herring prospectus placed before Sebi. The offer is likely to hit the market in September.        
	The Centre owns 99.59 per cent of Hindustan Copper, which closed at Rs 467.55, down Rs 10.15 on the BSE today. Following the offer, the governments holding will come down to around 81 per cent.        
	The company will follow the book-building method where retail investors can subscribe at a discount.        
	Growth plan        
	The company board has cleared an underground mining project at the Malankhanj copper belt in Madhya Pradesh at an investment of Rs 2,500 crore.         
	This could be the countrys largest base metal mining project, which will excavate five million tonnes of ore.         
	The company does open cast mining there.         
	Hind Copper plans to invite bids from private firms that will develop the mine. The company has drawn up an intermediate plan to increase mining to 12 million tonnes (mt) from 3.6mt last year.         
	It will expand the Khetri and Aravalli copper belts in Rajasthan and Singhbhum copper belt near Ghatshila in Jharkhand. It is also eyeing assets in Chile.        
	Ahmed said he didnt expect the copper price on the London Metal Exchange  the benchmark for base metals  to fall below $6800-6900 per tonne during this fiscal.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 2: Shares of Suzlon Energy sizzled on the bourses today amid speculation that Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries might pick up a stake in the wind turbine maker.        
	On both the stock exchanges  BSE and NSE  there was a sudden gust of upward movement in Suzlon shares, earlier moving in a narrow range during most part of the day, following reports of a possible deal with RIL.        
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the scrip after opening at Rs 47 surged to an intra-day high of Rs 53.10, a rise of nearly 14 per cent. The share closed at Rs 51.35, a gain of 10.19 per cent.         
	On the National Stock Exchange, the scrip vaulted to an intra-day peak of Rs 53.10, after opening at Rs 46.30, and then closed at Rs 51.30.        
	Shares of Suzlon have taken a beating after the first-quarter results were announced. The company had reported a loss of Rs 912 crore for the quarter ended June 30 on account of lower sales and a notional foreign exchange loss. The stock hit a 52-week low of Rs 43.05 on Wednesday.        
	Total income fell to Rs 2,404 crore in the first quarter from Rs 4,171.55 crore a year ago. Suzlon had orders worth Rs 22,700 crore on hand.        
	However, Reliance sources denied any plans to acquire a stake in Suzlon Energy.         
	Market experts said the Suzlon shares could see some correction when trading resumed tomorrow.        
	RIL, which has been diversifying into non-core areas, had recently picked up a 14.12 per cent stake in EIH Ltd from the Oberois for Rs 1,021 crore.         
	On Wednesday, the company upped its stake in EIH to 14.80 per cent by acquiring around 26.7 lakh shares from the open market. However, there are indications that RIL will not make any open offer to the EIH shareholders.         
	According to current regulations, it is mandatory for a company to make an open offer if its holding in an entity exceeds 15 per cent.        
	The RIL scrip closed marginally higher at Rs 937.15 on the BSE today.        
	Market meter        
	The BSE benchmark sensex closed with a minor gain of over 32 points today as investors refrained from buying riskier assets ahead of the release of key economic data by the US.         
	Gaining strength from an overnight rally on Wall Street and supported by firm Asian bourses, the markets started the day on a strong note but were unable to sustain the gains as investors booked profit after every rise, brokers said.        
	The 30-share barometer of the BSE ended higher by 32.44 points, or 0.18 per cent, at 18238.31. During the session, the index jumped about 150 points to hit a high of 18355.84. The National Stock Exchanges wide-based 50-share Nifty index finished at 5486.15, up 0.26 per cent.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 16: Ford India is on an expansion drive. The company  set to introduce eight new models from 2011  is planning to set up a second plant in Chennai.        
	Ford India president Michael Boneham said, After the success of the Figo, we are optimistic about the Indian market and plan to launch a slew of vehicles, one in every six to eight months, following which we expect a major boost in demand. We will be considering augmenting our facilities in Chennai to meet the demands of the domestic as well as exports market.         
	At present, the company manufactures 200,000 cars and 250,000 engines annually. The company will decide on the new plant in 8-12 months.        
	The eight vehicles, Boneham said, would be spread across different segments.         
	Therell be cars for everyone, ranging from SUVs, crossovers to sedans and hatches. However, unlike the Figo, there will be no India-specificcar. We will be bringing vehicles that are there in our global portfolio, Boneham said.        
	Introducing eight new vehicles by 2015 will have a tremendous impact on our manufacturing operations, supply chain, dealers and employees. We are working to make sure the value chain is ready to meet the demand in the years to come, Boneham said.

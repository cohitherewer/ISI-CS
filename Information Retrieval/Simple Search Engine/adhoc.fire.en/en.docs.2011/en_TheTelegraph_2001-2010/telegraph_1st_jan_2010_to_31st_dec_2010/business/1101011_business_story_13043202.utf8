The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Shift in quota share
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Shift in quota share
                            
	Washington, Oct. 10 (PTI): In a move that will give emerging economies a greater say in the IMF, the multilateral agency has said it is close to increasing the quota share of developing countries by at least five per cent by January.        
	The move will make the IMF more representative and better able to tackle the economic problems facing the global economy.        
	Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said at a news conference that the aim was for a shift in the quota share to dynamic emerging markets and developing countries by at least five per cent from over-represented to under-represented countries by January.        
	At a joint news conference with Youssef Boutros-Ghali, the Egyptian finance minister, who is also the head of the IMFs International Monetary and Financial Committee, Strauss-Kahn said he expected IMF members to agree in either days or weeks on the reforms needed for the institution. We are still not there, but not far off. Still some divergent views, but I am used to this. I think we are on the right track, he said.        
	India has pressed for a revision in the quota formula in the IMF based on purchasing power parity.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 2: Aviation regulator DGCA today said pilots must land at the correct speed at the touchdown zone rather than aim at soft landings. The move comes less than a fortnight after the Mangalore air tragedy.        
	Passengers have been known to applaud soft landings and airlines, including Air India, have insisted on such landings by their pilots. However, todays DGCA circular indicates that this may result in the aircraft running out of room on a short runway.         
	Soon after the May 22 crash of an Air India Express Boeing in Mangalore, a media report said that this might have been on the captains mind while touching down way ahead of the landing zone.         
	The DGCA said, Landings should be judged not by how soft the landing has been, but if it has been made at the correct speed and touchdown zone on the runway. The regulator didnt specifically mention the Air India crash  which it is currently probing  but said the directive was due to recent events in the aviation sector.        
	In a separate official release, the civil aviation ministry indicated that the DGCA was understaffed with over 370 technical yet to be filled up.         
	The government has approved the creation of 427 technical positions and 129 support staff for strengthening and restructuring the DGCA. However, a mere 48 technical positions were filled up in 2009, while recruitment for 178 positions is under way.        
	The reiteration and clarification on landing come a day before a new advisory body  the Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Council  is launched by the civil aviation minister Praful Patel.         
	The Indian Pilots Guild has been saying for some time now that airlines should not insist on soft landings.         
	The airplane manufacturer lays down limits of G (gravity) values for landing, and airlines need to guard against imposing lower values in their flight quality assurance programmes, the regulator said.         
	The guild said airlines were insisting on a lower G, or softer landings, and this was a danger.         
	The DGCA note today clearly asked all airlines to ensure that their pilots aimed at correct landings rather soft landings.        
	In case of an unstabilised approach which is not correctly timed, pilots should make a go-around so as to approach the airport again, this time in a safer way. The crashed AI Boeing had missed the landing zone by a huge 2,000 feet in an airfield which was 8,000 feet long and then dropped down into a deep gorge.        
	However, the regulator did not respond to another pilots complaint that the crew did not get enough rest between flights.         
	The Indian Commercial Pilots Association has been trying to push for longer rests between flights as it prevents a drop in concentration, a vital factor in a crisis, especially in the dawn hours.        
	Possibly in response to another incident in which an Air India Express lost height by several thousand feet while its captain was in the toilet, the DGCA said, In case a pilot has to leave the cockpit during the non critical phases of flight, the cabin crew is required to be inside the cockpit and occupy the observer seat.

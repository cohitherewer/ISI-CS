The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex shine fails to rub off on brokers
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sensex shine fails to rub off on brokers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 9: The sensex is finally perched above the 18000-mark, sparking talk about another bull run.         
	But the bellwether index bounced around a bit in the April-June quarter  and thats taken a lot of shine off the first-quarter numbers that stock brokerages have started to reveal.        
	Brokerages appear to have run into a wall with retail investors choosing to stay clear of uncertain markets even as the strain of competitive pressures from a new crop of entrants and the sharp tilt toward the options segment have started to crimp margins.        
	During the April-June quarter, the sensex was pretty range bound: it began the period at 17692.62 and ended it on June 30 at 17700.90  and thats had a rub-off effect on brokerage operations.         
	Take the example of Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL)  one of the top brokerages in the country. Though MOFSL reported a marginal rise in its topline, broking and related revenues were lower by 4 per cent.         
	Ditto for India Infoline Ltd (IIFL), which despite a strong 29 per cent growth in its revenues saw equities, broking and related income also falling by around 4 per cent. Then there is Geojit BNP Paribas, which saw a drop of 16 per cent in its topline and net profit skidding 53 per cent.        
	Analysts and market experts aver that there are several reasons for the dismal performance.         
	Motilal Oswal, chairman and managing director of MOFSL, says: The Indian indices remained range bound for the better part of the last quarter resulting in lower retail participation in the markets.        
	An analyst, who agreed with this view, went on to add that brokerages faced fierce competition from new entrants that forced them to offer attractive charges. In addition, they had to fork out larger pay packets to retain talent in a market where poachers abound.        
	However, Chetan Majithia, Amit Kawle and Vishal Rampuria at Crisil Research cite another reason for the poor performance of most of the brokerages. They contend that even as brokerage rates are getting thinner because of the entrance of new players, the shift in trading volumes towards options has added to the woes of industry players.        
	The trio add that while this shift will continue, brokerages having retail and institutional clients and offering a variety of services such as portfolio management services, investment banking and asset management will be better positioned to ride out the storm.        
	However, there are some exceptions. Edelweiss Capital, for instance, posted better than expected numbers, though the company also saw its broking revenues coming down sequentially.

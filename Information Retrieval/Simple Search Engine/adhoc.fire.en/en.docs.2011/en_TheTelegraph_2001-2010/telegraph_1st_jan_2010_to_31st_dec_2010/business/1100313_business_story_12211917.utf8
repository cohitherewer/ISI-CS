          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, March 12: Travel agents claimed a major victory today after the directorate general of civil aviation ordered foreign airlines to pay commission on tickets sold through various business channels.         
	The directive  which was issued on March 5  said the zero commission system that the airlines had tried to foist on travel agents in India had not proved to be beneficial for travellers.         
	The civil aviation regulator said the zero commission system had been detrimental to consumer interests in more than one way. It said 13 foreign airlines were forcing consumers to pay more in the form of transaction fees. This had given rise to market dominance by a few big travel agents who were charging exorbitant amounts by way of transaction fees. In return, they were receiving hefty amounts from the airlines in the name of productivity, the directive said.        
	The airlines not paying commission include British Airways, Lufthansa, KLM Royal Dutch, Singapore Airlines, Delta, Continental, North West Airlines and Air France.         
	I am proud that we have achieved the desired results and have created history for the world to follow, said Rajji Rai, president of the Travel Agents Association of India.         
	The directive will prove to be most beneficial to small agents who were literally forced to shut down shops, Rai said.

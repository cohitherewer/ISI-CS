          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          New strategy                                  
	Mumbai, May 28: The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group (ADAG) is consolidating its power generation assets under one roof.        
	ADAG has decided to transfer generation capacities under the Reliance Infrastructure banner to another group company, Reliance Power.        
	The consolidation exercise involves Reliance Power acquiring 433MW of generation assets from Reliance Infrastructure at a transfer value of Rs 1,095 crore. These assets comprise 200MW at Samalkot in Andhra Pradesh, 165MW at Kochi in Kerala and 48MW at Zuarinagar (Goa).        
	A statement issued by the group said, With the acquisition and commissioning of its 600MW Rosa power project in UP, Reliance Power will have over 1000MW of operating capacity in its portfolio.        
	All three cycle gas based power plants have significant potential for capacity expansion, the statement added.         
	Reliance Power intends to implement power projects with an aggregate capacity of 35,000MW. This includes the proposed Dadri project in UP which was recently at the centre of the battle for the supply of gas between the Ambani brothers. It is expected that the ADAG group may choose to relocate the gas-based proposed Dadri project closer to the KG-D6 basin.         
	The group has had trouble with land acquisition at Dadri and may also relocate the proposed plant to get closer access to the source of gas (KG-D6 IN Andhra Pradesh) after the recent Supreme Court judgment on the supply of gas.         
	The plans to set up 35,000MW of capacity include 25,000MW of coal fired and hydro power plants which are at various stages of implementation. Reliance Power is also developing three mega projects awarded by the government.        
	The valuation of the power generation assets of Reliance Infrastructure has been done by KPMG. The Reliance Power scrip closed 1 per cent higher on Friday on the BSE at Rs 156.50, while the Reliance Infrastructure share closed flat at Rs 1,056.25.

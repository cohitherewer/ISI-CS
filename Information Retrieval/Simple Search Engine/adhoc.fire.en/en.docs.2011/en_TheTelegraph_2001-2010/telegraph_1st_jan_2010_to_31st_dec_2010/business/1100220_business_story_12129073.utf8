	Calcutta, Feb. 19: The Securities and Exchange Board of India has granted an exemption to the United Bank of India (UBI) from Clause 49 of the listing agreement at the intervention of the government.         
	According to Clause 49, a company can get listed on the domestic bourses only if it has 50 per cent independent directors on its board.         
	The city-based PSU bank has only two independent directors on its seven-member board. This could have delayed the listing of UBI shares after its initial public offer.         
	We have already applied to the government for four independent directors and the government is yet to take a decision, said UBI executive director T.M. Bhasin.         
	However, the government has brought this to Sebis notice and the market regulator has allowed the listing of the UBI shares on the stock exchanges provided we give an undertaking that as soon as the independent directors are appointed, we should inform them, Bhasin said.         
	He said the appointment of four directors, including a shareholders director, would be completed latest by June.        
	The bank has fixed the price band for its maiden float at Rs 60-Rs 66.         
	It will enter the market on February 23.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bankers see healthy rise in credit growth
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bankers see healthy rise in credit growth
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Nair: Game for more                          
	Mumbai, April 5: Bankers expect credit growth to hover in the range of 20-22 per cent this fiscal  about 4-6 percentage points higher than the 16 per cent growth recorded in the last fortnight of March.        
	Senior bankers met the mandarins of the Reserve Bank of India here today  a quarterly ritual before a monetary policy review which is due on April 20  and said they were not planning to raise lending rates immediately.        
	The bank chiefs expressed concern over the surge in inflation and urged the central bank to adopt monetary measures to check rising prices  a tacit admission that they were ready to accept a slight increase in benchmark interest rates such as the repo and the reverse repo.        
	However, it is learnt that they advised the central bank not to raise the cash reserve ratio (CRR) which currently stands at 5.75 per cent. The CRR is the device that the RBI uses to suck out excess liquidity from the financial system. It represents the proportion of their overall deposits that the banks must park with the central bank.        
	On March 19, the RBI raised the repo and the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points each to 5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively, to contain inflation. The reverse repo is the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity against government securities and repo signifies the injection of liquidity.        
	After the meeting, M.V. Nair, chairman and managing director of Union Bank of India and chairman of the Indian Banks Association, told reporters: The general expectation is that the 8.5 per cent GDP growth (this year) will happen. Credit and deposit growth are expected to hover in the range of 20-22 per cent.        
	Pointing out that liquidity in the system was adequate to meet credit demand, Nair said inflation was one of the issues that dominated the discussions and banks would wait till the monetary policy before they take a decision on their lending rates.         
	Inflation is a matter of concern, Nair said. The numbers are higher than what the RBI has projected. The general consensus is that there will be reasonable liquidity to support credit growth. Monetary action may have to be on containing inflation.

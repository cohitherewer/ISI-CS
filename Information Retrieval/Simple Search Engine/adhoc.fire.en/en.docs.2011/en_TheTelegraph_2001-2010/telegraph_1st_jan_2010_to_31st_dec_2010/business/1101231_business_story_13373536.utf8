          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: State-owned power producer NTPC is expected to invite tenders within a month to buy nine supercritical units of 800MW capacity each following an approval by the Union cabinet. The order is worth Rs 18,000 crore.        
	The tender will be out in a month and the orders will be placed within nine to 10 months, sources in NTPC said.        
	Supercritical plants burn less coal to generate the same amount of power and are, thus, considered environment friendly.        
	NTPC would float the tender to secure nine supercritical boilers and nine turbine and generator sets for its projects at Lara (Chhattisgarh), Kudgi (Karnataka), Darllipalli and Gajamara in Orissa.        
	The government also cleared the revised estimate of Rs 913.63 crore for the 60MW hydro power project in Mizoram that will be set up by North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd.        
	Export relief        
	The government approved Rs 1,400 crore for the settlement of claims under the interest subsidy scheme being operated by banks for the benefit of exporters.         
	The measure will mitigate the effects of global meltdown across labour intensive export sectors and help them to be internationally competitive, an official statement said.        
	Under the interest subsidy scheme, which was introduced in July 2007, the government provides an interest subsidy of 2 per cent per annum to all scheduled commercial banks for rupee export credit to the specific exporters.        
	The scheme covered labour intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, handicrafts, engineering products, marine products, plastics, carpets, gems and jewellery and small and medium enterprises.         
	Meanwhile, a Hopsitality Development and Promotion Board will be set up both at the central and state levels for speedy clearances of hotel projects.        
	The government today also approved several amendments to the Mines Act, 1952, related to workers health, safety and welfare. A bill on this will be introduced in Parliament.

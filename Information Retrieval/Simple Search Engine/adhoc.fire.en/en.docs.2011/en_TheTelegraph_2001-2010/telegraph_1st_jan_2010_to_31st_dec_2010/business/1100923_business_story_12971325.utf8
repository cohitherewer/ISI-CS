	Calcutta, Sept. 22: Waiting in a queue at a toll plaza on a highway could soon be history if a new tolling system is put in place by the middle of next year.        
	Union road and transport minister Kamal Nath said the user friendly and India specific toll technology would cost car owners Rs 70-80. Nath was speaking at the AIMA conference in Calcutta today.         
	The radio frequency identification-based device has been suggested by a committee headed by Nandan Nilekani.        
	In developed countries, a car owner can buy a pre-paid card, which gets adjusted on use at every toll gate. He does not have to wait in a queue to pay at the toll gate.        
	Earlier in the day, at the 156th annual general meeting of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, Nath said the government was planning to restructure the bidding process in infrastructure to keep a check on companies posting lower bids for road projects.        
	We are checking whether there are gaps between the lowest bid and the next lowest bid. In some cases there is a huge gap. We need to ensure that roads are built through a viable procedure, Nath said .         
	The government has announced 126 projects for bidding, of which only 17 have not received any bids. The government plans to restructure these projects to make them more viable.        
	The government plans to construct 9,000-10,000km of roads this fiscal compared with 7,500km last year. We are setting a target of 20,000 km of roads every year, he said.

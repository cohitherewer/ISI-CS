	Calcutta, Oct. 16: Amazan Agro Products, part of the Rs 500-crore Amazan Agro Group, has forayed into edible oil with its Pureline mustard oil.         
	This is the first food and beverages foray of Amazan Agro, which is into supply chain management for agricultural, food products and food ingredients.         
	The mustard seeds will be outsourced from Jaipur, Alwar and Bharatpur and the oil will be produced at a plant in Jaipur.         
	Joydeb Garai, MD amp; CEO of Amazan Agro, said the launch of the mustard oil would mark the companys entry into retail which is in line with its core supply chain business.        
	Bengal, which has a Rs 3,500-crore branded edible oil market, is key for us. After Bengal, we will launch in Jharkhand, followed by Bihar and Assam, Garai said. Amazon is present in 35 countries with more than 150 customers.

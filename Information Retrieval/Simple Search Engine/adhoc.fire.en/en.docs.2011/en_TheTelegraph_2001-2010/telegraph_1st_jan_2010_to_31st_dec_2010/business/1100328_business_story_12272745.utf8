	Calcutta, March 27: Shipment of raw jute from Bangladesh is yet to pick up despite the country lifting the ban on export of the golden fibre in January.        
	Local exporters are not keen on exporting the raw fibre as there is more profit in trading finished jute goods.         
	At present, there is no export of raw jute from Bangladesh. We have to take a call on exports based on this years production. We have, however, lifted the ban, Bangladesh industries minister Dilip Barua said on the sidelines of an event organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	The Bangladesh government had imposed a ban on the export of raw jute in December last year to ensure adequate supply for the local mills after production dipped last year.        
	Bangladesh produces about 40-50 lakh bales of jute every year.         
	The domestic consumption is around 20 lakh bales and the rest is exported.         
	India, Pakistan and China are the major buyers, besides Britain, Spain, Ivory Coast, Germany and Brazil.         
	There was a decline in raw jute production last year but this year the agriculture minister has indicated that production will be better. So, we hope to export some quantity of jute after meeting the demands of local mills, Barua said.         
	India imports about 7-12 lakh bales of raw jute from Bangladesh, depending on factors such as price and crop size. According to industry experts, the import of jute from Bangladesh might come down to just about 3 lakh bales this year.         
	Meanwhile, the minister had yesterday said the Bangladesh government was open to negotiating with the Tatas. The Tata group had expressed interest in pumping about $2-3 billion into a slew of projects in Bangladesh, including a steel mill, a fertiliser unit and power plants.        
	The proposals got stalled because the Bangladesh authorities did not agree to the Tatas request for providing gas at cheaper rates.         
	An Indian business delegation will visit Bangladesh in April to explore opportunities.

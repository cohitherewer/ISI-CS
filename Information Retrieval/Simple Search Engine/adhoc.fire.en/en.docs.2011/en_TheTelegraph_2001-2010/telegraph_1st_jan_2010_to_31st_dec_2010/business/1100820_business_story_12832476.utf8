          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      R.S. Agarwal in Calcutta on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                          
	Calcutta, Aug. 19: Emami is gearing up for acquisitions worth Rs 2,500 crore in India and abroad.        
	It is in talks with a few domestic players for deals worth Rs 800-1,000 crore, chairman R.S. Agarwal said.        
	He said the personal care major had appointed Ernst amp; Young to scout for opportunities locally but refused to divulge the names. Agarwal was speaking on the sidelines of the companys 27th annual general meeting here today.        
	He said Emami was looking at a deal size of up to Rs 1,500 crore for buyouts outside the country. We are scanning opportunities in the Commonwealth of Independent States, West Asia and southeast Asian countries.        
	The company had bid for two firms in the UK and Turkey but did not succeed.        
	Emami had acquired Mumbai-based Zandu Pharmaceuticals for around Rs 750 crore last year and had merged it with itself.         
	The new domestic target could be bigger than Zandu.        
	Agarwal said the company had the financial strength to pull off a bigger acquisition. The promoters can rake in Rs 700-800 crore by offloading 10 per cent in the company to part finance the deal.        
	At present, Emami has a market capitalisation of Rs 7,000 crore, up from Rs 1,300 crore at the end of 2008.        
	The company has four brands in its portfolio with sales worth over Rs 100 crore.         
	Agarwal said the firm hoped to make at least 10 Rs 100-crore brands in the next five years.

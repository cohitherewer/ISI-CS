          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharma: Confident                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: ONGC Ltd has posted a 6 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 5,388.77 crore in the second quarter of the fiscal, helped by a revision in gas prices and an increase in global crude rates.        
	Net profit during the same period last fiscal stood at Rs 5,089.64 crore.         
	Sales rose to Rs 18,238.98 crore from Rs 15,134.04 crore a year ago.        
	ONGC said it paid Rs 3,019 crore as fuel subsidy against Rs 2,630 crore last year.        
	Net realisation on crude sales stood at $62.75 a barrel after giving Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation a discount. Its net realisation in the year-ago quarter was $56.41 per barrel.        
	The government is likely to favourably consider ONGCs demand of reimbursing the royalty it pays for Cairn Indias prolific Rajasthan block.        
	Though ONGC has a 30 per cent interest in the block  Cairn has 70 per cent interest  it has to pay the entire royalty.        
	The government has given an assurance it will favourably consider reimbursing the royalty being paid by ONGC beyond its stake in Rajasthan block, sources said.        
	Chairman R.S. Sharma said he was confident that the government assurance would materialise.        
	Cairn India show        
	Cairn Indias net profit for the second quarter has grown more than three times to Rs 1,585.08 crore from Rs 469.52 crore a year ago.         
	Analysts had expected the net profit to be around Rs 1,000 crore.         
	The rise in profit can be attributed to the use of the Barmer-Salaya pipeline to transport crude from its Mangala fields to refineries.         
	Cairn earlier used to transport the crude via trucks.

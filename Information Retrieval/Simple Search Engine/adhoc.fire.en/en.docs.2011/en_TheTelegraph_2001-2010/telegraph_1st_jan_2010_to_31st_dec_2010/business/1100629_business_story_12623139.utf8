                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      CPT plans facility for bulk cargo
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      M.L. Meena in Calcutta   on Monday. (PTI)                          
	Calcutta, June 28: The Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) is considering a joint venture with Shipping Corporation of India Limited, Steel Authority of India Limited and the Inland Waterways Authority of India to develop a transloading facility for large ships carrying coal.        
	M.L. Meena, the new chairman of the CPT, said the port was looking at two locations to carry out the operation throughout the year.        
	The CPT had made similar arrangements before when large crude carriers came at Sandheads in winter. Transloading involves double handling: unloading cargo from big ships, which cant come to Calcutta or Haldia because of their low depths, to smaller ships which will carry the cargo to the ports.        
	The CPT wants to use the same facility round the year, even during the monsoon, not only for oil but also for bulk cargo such as coking and thermal coal used by steel and power plants, respectively.        
	Continuous siltation has choked the Haldia port, blocking large ships from entering.         
	Meena, who was speaking at an event organised by the CII here today, said one of his priorities would be to improve the quality of dredging in Haldia.        
	Meanwhile, around 4,000 officers from the 12 major ports have begun satyagraha to protest against the delay in wage revision.

	The decision that will have financial implications of Rs 1,065.42 crore was taken at the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Around 12.92 lakh non-gazetted railway employees will enjoy the pre-festival bonanza with the government announcing bonus equivalent to 77 days of their wages for the financial year 2009-10.        
	The beneficiaries of the bonus will be non-gazetted employees of the railways and will exclude the Railway Protection Force and Railway Protection Special Force, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni told reporters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cairn shareholders okay deal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cairn shareholders okay deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Gammell: Looking ahead                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: Shareholders of Scotlands Cairn Energy Plc today approved the sale of a majority stake in the companys Indian arm to Vedanta Resources, but the closure of the deal depends on certain conditions, including an open offer from Sesa Goa that is likely to miss the October 11 start date.        
	A Cairn Energy Plc spokesperson said shareholders with 99 per cent of its shares have approved the sale of 40 per cent to 51 per cent stake in Cairn India to Vedanta Group.        
	We are pleased that Cairn Energy shareholders have approved the proposed transaction with Vedanta. This is an important step in the process towards completion (of the deal), the spokesperson said from Edinburgh where the shareholders met today.        
	The shareholder approval means that state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which partners Cairn India in several of its properties including the giant Rajasthan oilfield, will not be able to make a counter-offer or exercise its pre-emption right.        
	Asked about the state-owned firms next move, R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director of ONGC, told The Telegraph, When we take the next step everybody would come to know about it.        
	Besides, Cairn Energy needs to take the approval of Indias oil ministry. Officials said the production sharing contracts for Cairn Indias 10 properties require either the governments or ONGCs approval prior to a stake sale.        
	Bill Gammell, chief executive officer of the Edinburgh-based firm, has met government and ONGC officials twice since the deal was announced.         
	A senior oil ministry official said a decision on the production sharing contracts would be made by the end of the year.        
	Meanwhile, Vedanta Group firm Sesa Goas open offer for acquiring up to 20 per cent in Cairn India will be delayed as market regulator Sebi is yet to approve the scheme.         
	Energy analyst Arvind Mahajan said, The road map for the deal to go through seems to be clear and I do not see the government or ONGC putting any road blocks as it would send a wrong message to investors especially when the country is planning to attract global players for the next round of oil and gas bidding.

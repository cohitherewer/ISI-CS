The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bulk of govt borrowing in first half
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bulk of govt borrowing in first half
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai/New Delhi, March 29: The Centre will borrow Rs 2.87 lakh crore  or about 63 per cent of its total borrowing needs for 2010-11  during the first half of the financial year (April-September), just a tad lower than what the bond markets had anticipated.        
	Treasury market observers had expected the government to issue bonds worth around Rs 3 lakh crore in the first half of the year.        
	The announcement that it would be less than the anticipated figure sparked a small rally in bond prices by around 25 paise. As demand for credit is forecast to pick up further in the second half of the fiscal, it was widely anticipated that the government would front-load its borrowing in the first half when demand for credit was usually slack  just as it did last year.        
	In other words, bond market circles were looking forward to most of the borrowing requirements being met in the first half. Last year, the government completed two-thirds of its borrowing in the same period to ensure that the private sector did not face a credit squeeze in the second half.        
	The borrowing programme was finalised in the capital today by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Union finance ministry.        
	We have kept government borrowings in the first half at Rs 2.87 lakh crore based on our assessment of fund inflows and outflows, the trends in the economy and the fact that corporates and institutions will have better access to external commercial borrowings, finance secretary Ashok Chawla told reporters after a meeting with RBI deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath.        
	Gopinath said the central bank would endeavour to ensure a smooth government borrowing programme. The government will borrow in tranches of Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 15,000 crore every week in April through September depending on repayment of earlier bonds, she said.        
	There are five instruments of choice based on tenures: under 5 years, 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, 14 to 19 years, and 20 years and above. The two main instruments of choice are the medium term instruments  5 to 9 years, and 10 to 14 years.        
	Under the borrowing schedule released by the RBI late in the evening, the 5 to 9-year bond will be used to raise a maximum of Rs 1,33,000 crore and the 10 to 14-year bond to rustle up Rs 1,24,000 crore.         
	Officials said that governments programme to borrow Rs 4,57,143 crore in 2010-11 would not impact the credit requirements of the private sector. The borrowing plan for the year 2010-11 is around Rs 6,000 crore higher than the previous years level.        
	A North Block official said the RBI had assured that the borrowing would be carried out in such a manner that the private sector was not elbowed out of the market.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, J. Moses Harding of IndusInd Bank said the borrowing calendar did not come as a surprise to him as it was anticipated that 60 to 70 per cent of the requirements would be mopped up in the first half.         
	They have delivered on that expectation with coverage of around 63 per cent, Harding said.         
	Harding, who expects the central bank to raise key interest rates by around 1 per cent in the fiscal, said there would be ample liquidity in the system, particularly with huge dollar inflows coming into the country.        
	Harihar Krishnamurthy, treasurer at FirstRand Ltd, said the bond markets liked the calendar as it fell short of the anticipated sum by around Rs 20,000 crore.        
	He said liquidity would remain robust with strong inflows from foreign institutional investors, strong spending by the government and an anticipated overseas interest in the PSU disinvestment programme.        
	The heavy borrowing plans, needed to fund the estimated 5.5 per cent fiscal deficit for the year, analysts said, could make funding costlier and scarcer for industry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Honda presses local recall button 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Honda presses local recall button 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          SWITCH SWAP				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: Honda will recall about 8,532 units of its sedan City in India as part of a global initiative triggered by reports of defective power window switches.        
	The companys Indian subsidiary  Honda Siel Cars India (HSCI)  today said the affected sedans are second-generation City manufactured in 2007. They will be recalled for preventive replacement of the power window switch.        
	The announcement comes a day after Honda announced a global recall of 6.46 lakh units of the City and the Jazz models. In India, this is the second recall of the Honda City. In 2004, the company recalled about 13,000 units of the 1.5-litre sedan to fix a problem with its shock absorbers. HSCI had sent letters to its customers to get the front damper get repaired free of cost.        
	In 2007, Honda sold 36,800 units of the City here. Between October 2003 and October 2008, HSCI sold 1,77,000 units of the second-generation sedan.        
	The third-generation City, currently being sold in India, will, however, be not affected by the recall. Launched in November 2008, around 54,000 units of the latest City variant have been sold till December.        
	The recall will also not affect the Honda Jazz here. In India, the company introduced the second-generation Jazz in June, while the global recall is for the first-generation Jazz.        
	HSCI is proactively replacing the part in these vehicles related to the potential problem of smoke coming out from the power window switch if water enters the driver window when it is left open during heavy rains or is exposed to any other liquid because of spillage, the company said in a statement.        
	The replacement will be free of cost and the company will communicate directly with the owners of the cars covered under this part replacement, said HSCI.        
	We are making adequate preparations. Most likely the new switches will be imported from our vendor in Thailand. Once the new batch of switches start arriving, we will send letters to the customers concerned to get their cars repaired. It should not take more than a day to replace the new switch, said the company spokesperson.         
	Analysts say though a recall temporarily creates a negative brand image, it also highlights the responsible nature of the company.        
	Stringent regulations put in place by our government and internal standards set by companies themselves have pushed them to own up their mistake, auto analyst Abdul Majeed from PricewaterhouseCoopers told The Telegraph. By servicing their customers, these companies are building long-term relationships and not taking the car owners for a ride. It only explains a responsible behaviour, Majeed added.        
	Meanwhile, local auto parts makers are keen to supply their wares to global car companies in a big way.

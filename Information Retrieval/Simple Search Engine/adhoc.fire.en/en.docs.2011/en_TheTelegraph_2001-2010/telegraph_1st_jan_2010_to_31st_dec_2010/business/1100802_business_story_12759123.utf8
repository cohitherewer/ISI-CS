The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Vodafone sets terms for spectrum levy pay

          JAYATI GHOSE                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: Vodafone Essar is willing to pay a one-time charge for holding spectrum beyond 6.2 megahertz (MHz) under certain conditions.        
	In a letter to telecom minister A. Raja, the countrys third largest GSM operator said, There is no basis for the Telecom Regulatory and Development Authority (Trai) to recommend that the GSM operators be called upon to pay a one-time charge for allocations beyond 6.2Mhz.        
	However, it is willing to pay a one-time fee provided the government migrates to a uniform spectrum use fee regime of around 3 per cent annually.         
	At present, the operators pay between 2 per cent and 8 per cent of their annual gross revenue to the government for using radiowaves.        
	Vodafone also said the one-time fee should not be linked to the price of 3G radiowaves and should be applicable only in a prospective manner.        
	The letter comes in the wake of a meeting convened by Raja on July 7 to discuss a set of proposals by the telecom regulator to impose a fee on operators with more than 6.2Mhz spectrum.         
	Trai has suggested linking the 2G fee to 3G spectrum price, and to charge it on a retrospective basis from 2007 onwards.         
	We would, however, like to submit that we are willing to consider agreeing to an alternative such as the payment of a reasonable one-time charge as a quid pro quo for migrating to a uniform rate (say 3 per cent of the annual gross revenue) spectrum use charge regime, Vodafone Essar stated in the letter.        
	It said the determination of the 2G spectrum fee on the basis of 3G value was inappropriate. Therefore, any one-time price in exchange for migrating to a flat rate system should be reasonable.        
	CDMA operators such as Etisalat DB and Reliance Communications, however, maintain that Trais proposals will create a level-playing field.        
	The Association of Unified Service Providers of India (Auspi)  the lobby group for CDMA players  has demanded that Raja ensures that the fee for excess 2G spectrum be four times the cost of 3G airwaves. This is because India is a market where voice and text messaging services, that use 2G predominantly, are making this spectrum more valuable, Auspi secretary-general S.C. Khanna said.         
	On linking the 2G fee with 3G price, Vodafone said, It is surprising for Trai to recommend that 3G prices be applied to 2G spectrum from 2007 onwards, when new telecom licences or spectrum awarded in 2008 were allocated at Rs 1,650 crore. It is beyond all economic logic to propose that spectrum allocated around 2002 be priced at the 3G price in 2010 when spectrum allocated in 2008 was given at 2001 prices.

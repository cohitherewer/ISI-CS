                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Local firms take a shortcut to success
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, April 6: Corporate frauds are fast increasing in India. The reason: pressure to meet earnings targets and weak internal control systems.         
	In a survey by global consulting firm KPMG, over 60 per cent of the respondents said meeting market expectations and performance-based remuneration were the main motivation behind fraud, while some cited tax evasion as a reason.        
	According to the survey, conducted among senior managers of about 1,000 firms in India, bribery and corruption are viewed as an inevitable aspect of doing business, particularly in seeking routine regulatory approvals and winning new business.        
	Almost 87 per cent of the respondents said their firms had incurred losses of more than Rs 10 lakh ($22,471) because of fraud.        
	Nearly 81 per cent feel financial statement fraud is already an epidemic in the country. About 38 per cent believe bribery and corruption to avoid legal hassles and to lure prospective clients are part of any Indian business firm.         
	The recent volatile economic conditions and increasing business and technological complexities have led to greater opportunities for fraud, said Rohit Mahajan, executive director of KPMGs forensic advisory practice in India.        
	Being a fast-paced economy, fraud management is an extremely vital issue confronting us today. Managing the risk of fraud is essentially no different from managing any other type of business risk, he added.        
	Around 53 per cent of the respondent companies said ecommerce and computer-related fraud would be a source of major concern, with supply chain fraud a close second, followed by bribery and corruption and intellectual property fraud.

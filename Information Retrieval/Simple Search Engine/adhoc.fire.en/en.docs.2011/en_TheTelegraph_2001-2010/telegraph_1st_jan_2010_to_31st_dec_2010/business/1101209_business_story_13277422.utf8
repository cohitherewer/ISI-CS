                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fame tug-of-war on share screen
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 8: Shares of Inox Leisure rose 3 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today on reports that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had cleared its open offer for multiplex operator Fame India.         
	The market was abuzz with rumours that Sebi had also cleared the application for an open offer by Reliance MediaWorks, which has been involved in a takeover tussle with Inox for Fame India.         
	Shares of Reliance MediaWorks closed at Rs 216.20, a fall of 3 per cent on the BSE. The Inox scrip closed 3 per cent higher at Rs 66, while Fame India shares closed at Rs 81.40, an increase of 1.50 per cent on Wednesday.         
	Spokespersons for Reliance MediaWorks and Inox Leisure were unavailable for comment. Both Reliance MediaWorks and Inox Leisure made the open offer applications in February, which are pending before the market regulator.        
	Inox holds a 50.2 per cent stake in Fame India and its open offer is priced at Rs 51 per share, while Reliance MediaWorks, which holds about 16 per cent in Fame through Reliance Capital, has made an offer at a price of Rs 83 per share.         
	While Reliance MediaWorks declined to comment, unconfirmed reports said the company was likely to approach shareholders by December 13.         
	The market is eagerly waiting for the next move by Reliance MediaWorks and Inox Leisure.         
	The battle for Fame started in February when its promoters sold a 43 per cent stake to Inox for Rs 44 per share. This was lower than the Rs 80-per-share offer made by Reliance MediaWorks, which runs the BIG chain of cinemas.         
	Subsequently, Inox picked up a 7 per cent stake in Fame from the market and took its stake to over 50 per cent.         
	Inox thereafter made the mandatory open offer for an additional 20 per cent at Rs 51 per share, while Reliance MediaWorks, on its part, made an open offer for Rs 180 crore at Rs 83 per share.         
	If Inox gets Fame, the duo will have 205 screens, second only to Reliance MediaWorks BIG Cinemas, which has 242 screens.        
	Sebi order        
	Sebi today restrained six Gujarat-based companies and one entity from Maharashtra from dealing in the securities market after they failed to redress investors grievances.        
	These companies are Ishwar Medical Services, Neon Resins and Industries, Indo American Optics, Bhuvan Tripura, Akar Laminators, Chicago Software and Hindustan Industrial Chemicals.

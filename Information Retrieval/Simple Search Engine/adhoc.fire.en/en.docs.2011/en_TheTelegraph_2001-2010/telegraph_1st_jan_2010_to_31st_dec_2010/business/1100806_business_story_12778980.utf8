The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IDBI stake in Ramsarup 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      IDBI stake in Ramsarup 
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, Aug. 5: IDBI Bank has picked up a 10 per cent stake in Calcutta-based steel maker Ramsarup Industries.        
	The financial institution bought into the company after invoking shares pledged with it.        
	The transaction took place on July 29 when IDBI acquired 35,07,486 shares in Ramsarup, which makes steel wire and TMT bars at four of its plants in Bengal.        
	Pledged shares are collateral for a loan; invoking the shares means the lender transfers the shares to itself when the borrower fails to pay back the loan.        
	When contacted, Ashish Jhunjhunwala, chairman and managing director of Ramsarup, said, The issue has been sorted out with IDBI.        
	He did not say why the financial institution invoked the shares.         
	Ramsarups filing with the stock exchange reveals that a large chunk of the promoters holding is pledged.        
	As of June 4, 2010, around 68.28 per cent of the holding was pledged. The owners held 75.89 per cent in Ramsarup as on March 31, 2010, of which 61.84 per cent was pledged.        
	Ramsarup has about Rs 1,050 crore debt on its book. It has decided to raise long term resources to cut the massive debt pile.        
	The board is meeting on August 13 to decide on issuing preferential shares as well as stocks to qualified institutional buyers.        
	We are raising funds to cut debt and finance our expansion, which will be worth watching out for. I am born and brought up here (Bengal). I want to make the state proud, Jhunjhunwala said.        
	Incidentally, the firm is in discussion with multinational entities for a joint venture, a tie-up or a demerger. The name of ArcelorMittal has been doing the rounds as well.        
	Ramsarups stock has kept pace with the buzz about the induction of a strategic partner and has rallied 42.5 per cent in the last one month.         
	It closed at Rs 108.30 on the BSE, up 4.54 per cent or Rs 4.74 today, while the benchmark BSE sensex was marginally down 0.24 per cent. About a month back, the Ramsarup scrip was at Rs 76.        
	The capital raising is likely to make the company debt-free, indicating that the management may raise around Rs 1,000 crore.         
	Ramsarup has about 1,200 acres in Bengal and an iron ore mine in Orissa. Such a huge land bank may attract foreign partners to invest in the company.

	Calcutta, June 15: Dunlop hopes to make yet another attempt this year to kickstart meaningful operations at its plants in Bengal and Tamil Nadu.        
	Chairman Pawan K. Ruia said the company was expected to clock Rs 550-crore turnover this fiscal by scaling up production.         
	It plans to increase tyre manufacturing at its troubled Sahaganj plant in Bengal to 60-70 tonnes a day later this year, up from 30 tonnes. Ruia plans to start the production of two- and three-wheeler tyres simultaneously at Ambattur in Chennai.         
	Right now, we are breaking even with the production. Once scaled up, the business will turn profitable, he said at the companys 83rd annual general meeting here today.        
	Ruia had taken over the ailing company in 2005-end. Since then repeated attempts to get it going have yielded little result. However, during this period, he took Dunlop out of BIFR and managed to lift the eight-year-long suspension in the trading of the stock. On whether the political situation in Bengal has impacted business at Sahaganj unit, he said, Industry is apprehensive. But I am not worried, as the industry has to be boosted notwithstanding whoever comes to power.

	Calcutta, Sept. 6: The State Bank of India (SBI) may extend its teaser home loan offer beyond September 30.        
	Under the special scheme, the countrys largest lender offers a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent in the first year and 9 per cent in the second and third year on home loans.         
	We got an overwhelming response from borrowers and we found the 8 per cent home loan scheme profitable, said SBI managing director S.K. Bhattacharyya on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry here today.        
	The SBI has already extended the scheme  initially launched for three months  several times with some modifications. The current offer is valid till September 30.         
	The scheme has received a good response. The banks home loan portfolio grew from Rs 57,513 crore at the end of June last year to Rs 74,669 crore as on June 30 this year.         
	While other lenders such as HDFC and ICICI Bank called off their teaser loan offers after the introduction of the base rate system, the SBI decided to continue.        
	However, we shall have our asset-liability committee meeting this month which will take a final call on whether to extend the scheme or not. I dont see reasons why we shouldnt continue it, said Bhattacharyya.        
	The PSU lender will make a 70 per cent provisioning coverage for its non-performing assets, as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India, by September 2011.         
	At present, our provisioning coverage is 59.5 per cent, Bhattacharyya said.        
	On overseas operations, Bhattacharyya said the bank was targeting to earn 20 per cent of its net income from overseas operations by 2013. At present, foreign branches contribute 12 per cent to the net income.        
	HDFC Bank rate        
	Private sector HDFC Bank has hiked its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 0.50 per cent to 16.25 per cent.        
	The increase comes into effect from today. Our cost of funds has been rising in the last two months and we felt that this was the right time to hike our BPLR, a bank official said.         
	The banks move to hike its BPLR is in line with that of the industry with several banks hiking their rates.

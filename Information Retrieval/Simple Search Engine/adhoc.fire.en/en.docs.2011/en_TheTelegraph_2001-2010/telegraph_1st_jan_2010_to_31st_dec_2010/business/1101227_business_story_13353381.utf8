	New Delhi, Dec. 26: The government is planning to offer additional export incentives to the struggling labour intensive sectors such as tea, handicrafts and readymade garments in the first half of January.        
	The incentive could include interest subsidy and additional benefit under focus-market and focus-product schemes, commerce ministry officials said.        
	They said the performance of different sectors since the global economic crisis had been analysed after consultations with export organisations.        
	The new incentive is likely to be announced in the first fortnight of January. There will also be some incentive rejig with the government withdrawing it from those sectors which have come out of the woods, the officials said.        
	According to A. Sakthivel, member of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, The timely assessment of the sectoral export performance will help the government to come up with comprehensive and timely measures to further push export growth.         
	Sources said some of the sectors that could receive fresh incentives include carpets, tea, textiles, leather, handicrafts and some engineering goods.        
	Commerce secretary Rahul Khullar and director-general of foreign trade Anup Pujari will hold the final round of talks early January on the incentives.        
	Growth trend        
	Exports grew a robust 26.8 per cent in November 2010 to $18.9 billion, while exports in the first eight months of the fiscal were 26.7 per cent higher at $140.3 billion.         
	Most sectors have now returned to the growth track except for tea and handicrafts. Exports of ready-made garments are also marginally lower compared with the previous year.         
	According to officials, exports of these sectors are lagging behind because of the weak demand in traditional markets such as Europe. The incentives should encourage them to explore new areas.        
	The government in its annual supplement to the foreign trade policy in August had announced incentives of Rs 1,050 crore for the ailing labour-intensive export sectors to help them tide over slackening demand.

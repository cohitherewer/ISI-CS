	Calcutta, Oct. 5: Bengal Shriram Hitech City plans to launch a residential and IT project at Uttarpara on land belonging to Hindustan Motors within two months.         
	The company, equally owned by two US-based private equity firms  Starwood Capital and Walton Street Capital  and Shriram, is developing the 314-acre plot carved out of Hindustan Motors (HM) plant.        
	Debashish Som, former bureaucrat and CEO of Bengal Shriram, said around 20 million square feet would be built in phases, which would include residential area, retail space, a hospital, a school and a hotel.         
	It will also have an IT park with built-in space of 5.2 million square feet spread over 60 acres.        
	Bengal Shriram has paid Rs 285 crore to HM for the land. The CK Birla company, which manufactures the Ambassador car, is also entitled to get 4 per cent of the sale value.        
	A launch date, which will mark the beginning of sales, is significant for cash-strapped HM.        
	The project has undergone changes following the exit of Tata Motors Nano from Bengal two years ago. The developer has dropped a plan to build an auto component park here as it does not envisage much demand.         
	The company was hoping to attract second and third tier manufacturers in the park who would supply to the Nano vendors in Singur. After Tatas exit, the entire 60 acres are being devoted to the IT park. We hope to attract IT companies developing embedded software for auto companies. There is a lot of demand, Som said.        
	Ennore Coke        
	Ennore Coke, a Shriram group company engaged in the production of met coke, is waiting for coal mine allotment from the Bengal government. It plans to set up a coal gassification unit to produce 1,050 tonnes per day of ammonia.

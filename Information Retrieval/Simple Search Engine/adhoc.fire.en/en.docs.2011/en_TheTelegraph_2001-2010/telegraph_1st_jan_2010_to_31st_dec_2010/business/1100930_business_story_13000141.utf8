          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 29: Discussions on the merger of Mahindra Satyam with Tech Mahindra will begin in the middle of November after the scam-scarred entity comes out with its second-quarter results for the period ended September 30.        
	Vineet Nayyar, chairman of Mahindra Satyam, told reporters in Hyderabad today that the merger of the two software firms was on track.         
	He recalled that when the M amp;M group acquired Satyam Computer Services, both he and Anand Mahindra had hinted that they had plans to merge the two companies.        
	According to Nayyar, a merger process normally takes around 9 to 12 months to complete. However, it hasnt been decided which entity will subsume its identity after the merger.        
	Both the companies will have to seek approvals from their shareholders and the high courts of Bombay and Andhra Pradesh.        
	Valuers will be appointed to determine the valuation for the merger, Nayyar indicated.        
	Analysts are split over whether Tech Mahindra will merge into Mahindra Satyam or whether it will be the other way round. Most, however, believe the Hyderabad-based company will be amalgamated with Tech Mahindra. Observers are already speculating that shareholders of Mahindra Satyam will receive one share of Tech Mahindra for every seven or eight shares they hold.        
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the Mahindra Satyam stock closed at Rs 98.90, a marginal gain over the previous close after hitting an intra-day high of Rs 102.45. On the other hand, the Tech Mahindra scrip ended in the green at Rs 793.20.        
	Analysts believe the Mahindra Satyam stock will rise tomorrow as there are positive indications on the road ahead coming from the financial results declared today.        
	In a recent report, brokerage CLSA said it saw a merger between the two companies by March next year.         
	While a merger would help reduce overhead costs to some extent, we do not see either company being stronger post the merger, analysts Bhavtosh Vajpayee and Nimish Joshi said in a note to its clients.        
	In another report, Morgan Stanley said that if a merger between the two companies were to occur, based on the current prices, the swap ratio would work out to one share of Tech Mahindra for every 7.3 shares of Mahindra Satyam.

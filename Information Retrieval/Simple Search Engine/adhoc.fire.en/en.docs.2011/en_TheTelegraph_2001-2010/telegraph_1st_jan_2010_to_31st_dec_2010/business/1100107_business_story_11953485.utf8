	Mumbai, Jan 6: Mahindra Satyam  the phoenix that rose from the ashes of a scam-scarred Satyam Computers  is in fine fettle as it squares up to face the anniversary of its Day of Infamy last year.              
	On January 7 last year, Ramalinga Raju  Indias biggest corporate shyster  had confessed he had cooked the books of the infotech giant for years. He claimed at that time that he had been riding a tiger not knowing how to get off without being eaten.        
	The promised restatement of Satyams accounts will have to wait till the middle of this year but the markets and its clients have kept faith with the company.        
	The Satyam scrip, which had plunged to a 52-week low of Rs 11.50 a share after Rajus shocking revelations, has just crossed the Rs 100 mark in the new year. On Wednesday, the scrip closed at Rs 109.30.        
	On January 5  just two days before the anniversary  Mahindra Satyam saw the turnover in stock trades vault more than five times to over Rs 230 crore from Rs 43 crore the previous day, placing it among the volume toppers of the bourses.              
	We are definitely focusing on large deals, Gurnani said. We have beefed up our sales team; there is a judicious mix of existing and new sales people with industry relevant experience.        
	Gurnani said the customers had been patient and understood that the fundamentals of the company were strong. Many of our existing customers like GE and GSK have announced the extension of their relationship with Mahindra Saytam for periods ranging from three to five years. The momentum is positive and we are focusing on emerging markets and verticals in a big way to drive our revenues.

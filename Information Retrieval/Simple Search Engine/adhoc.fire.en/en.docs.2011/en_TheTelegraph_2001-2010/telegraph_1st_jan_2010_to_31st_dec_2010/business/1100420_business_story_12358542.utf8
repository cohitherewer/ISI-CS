The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Philips-Videocon pact
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Philips-Videocon pact
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 19: Videocon Industries will make and sell television sets under the Philips brand name in India for five years.        
	The Dutch consumer electronics major, which announced its first-quarter results on Monday, said, Philips has entered into a five-year brand licensing pact under which Videocon will assume responsibility for Philipss consumer electronics activities in India.        
	This move is consistent with Philips objective to bring the television business back to structural profitability, the statement added.        
	The financial arrangement between the two companies for the five-year pact was not available.        
	Videocon Industries chairman Venugopal Dhoot told The Telegraph, It is a win-win situation. Videocon has a robust infrastructure for manufacturing, sales, marketing and after-sales service. We have made and sold televisions for other brands such as Hyundai and Akai in the past. Now, we will do the same for Philips. The Dutch brand in turn will assist us with technical expertise.         
	The television market in India is dominated by Korean brands such as Samsung and LG and Philipss arrangement with Videocon will help it to build its presence in the extremely competitive and price-sensitive market.         
	Videocon has capitalised on its low manufacturing costs and has been seeking distressed assets and global brands worldwide.         
	After acquiring Electrolux, Videocon made efforts to buy Daewoo Electronics for roughly $700 million. However, the deal flopped after the creditors of Daewoo rejected Videocons bid.        
	Last year, Videocon made an attempt to strike a deal with Finnish company Elcoteq. These negotiations also failed.        
	Philips had earlier stated that it wanted to focus on the healthcare and lifestyle segments in India.                                 
	The company expects that the deal with Videocon will help it make profits in the television business.

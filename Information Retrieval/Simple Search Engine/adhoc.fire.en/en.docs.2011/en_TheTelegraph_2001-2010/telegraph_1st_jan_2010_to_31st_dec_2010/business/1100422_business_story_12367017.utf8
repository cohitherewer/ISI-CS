	Calcutta, April 21: Phillips Carbon Black has fixed the floor price of its qualified institutional placement (QIP) at Rs 200 a share.        
	The RPG Enterprises venture today informed the bourses that it would raise Rs 100 crore through QIP.        
	The Phillips Carbon scrip rallied on the news to close at Rs 211.75, up Rs 8.80, or 4.34 per cent, after touching a high of Rs 216.70 on the BSE.         
	The QIP announcement will roughly coincide with a preferential allotment to the promoters, Goenka family, at Rs 196 per share. It will raise around Rs 25 crore through stocks allotted to the promoters.         
	Phillips Carbon is issuing fresh shares to finance Indian and overseas expansions. It plans to invest about Rs 150 crore in India and Rs 200 crore abroad.

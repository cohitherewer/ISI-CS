	Mumbai, Nov. 21 (PTI): The amount of money mopped up by Indian firms through initial public offers (IPOs) and rights issues in September jumped more than four-fold to Rs 4,802.4 crore over the previous month.        
	This amount was mobilised through 18 offers, including 15 IPOs.        
	Corporate houses had raised only Rs 1,049.7 crore in August when a total of six offers  comprising three IPOs and three rights issues  came up, the Securities and Exchange Board of India said.        
	During September, Rs 4,802.4 crore was mobilised in the primary market through 18 issues against Rs 1,049.7 crore mobilised through six issues in August, said the latest issue of Capital Market Review released by Sebi.        
	However, the number of qualified institutional placements (QIPs) more than halved in September, with only three hitting the market against seven in August.        
	The amount raised from QIPs fell over 48 per cent to Rs 2,227 crore from Rs 4,342 crore in August.

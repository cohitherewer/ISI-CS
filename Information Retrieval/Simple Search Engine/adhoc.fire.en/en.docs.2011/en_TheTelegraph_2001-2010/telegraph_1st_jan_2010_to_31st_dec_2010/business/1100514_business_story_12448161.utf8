	California-based Sybase sells programs that make it easy for users to access business software via smartphones and other mobile devices.         
	SAP already uses the technology to let customers access its applications when they are on the move. Sybase also sells a powerful database that large companies, such as banks, use to store sensitive information.         
	Sybase is the fourth-largest maker of database software after Oracle, IBM and Microsoft Corp.        
	With this transaction, SAP will dramatically expand its market by making available its market-leading solutions to hundreds of millions of mobile users, combining the worlds best business software with the worlds most powerful mobile infrastructure platform, Bill McDermott, co-chief executive officer and member of the executive board of SAP, said.         
	Deutsche Bank and Barclays advised SAP, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Sybase.

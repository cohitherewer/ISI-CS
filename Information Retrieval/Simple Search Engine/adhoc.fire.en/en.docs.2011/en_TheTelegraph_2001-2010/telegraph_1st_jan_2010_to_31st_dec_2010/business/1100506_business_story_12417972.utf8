The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel ministry relents on SAIL chief choice
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Steel ministry relents on SAIL chief choice
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Verma: New horizon                                  
	New Delhi, May 5: The steel ministry seems to have given up its reservations about the selection panels choice of the next chairman of Steel Authority of India Limited.        
	The ministry, which had at one stage favoured giving temporary charge of the state-run steel maker to a senior director while the hunt for a permanent chairman continued, has now forwarded the name of C.S. Verma, who was first on the selection list.        
	The Public Enterprises Selection Board had picked Verma, finance director of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, for the post of SAIL chairman.         
	Steel minister Virbhadra Singh had a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last week at the PMs parliamentary office. However, officials said the meeting had focussed on steel industry issues, including India-Korea co-operation.         
	Arup Roy Chowdhury, chairman of infrastructure firm NBCC, was placed second on the list and might be considered as a chairman of a core sector PSU.         
	Steel ministry insiders had opposed Verma because he did not have enough knowledge of the market to enable SAIL to fend off competition from global leaders ArcelorMittal and Posco, as well as the Tatas.        
	However, Vermas expertise in finance will be in demand at SAIL, which plans to launch a follow-on public offering to raise around Rs 16,000-18,000 crore.         
	The government has decided to divest 10 per cent of its stake in SAIL, while the company will issue additional shares worth 10 per cent of the expanded equity base. SAIL will take up a Rs 70,000-crore expansion programme to ramp up its production to 23 million tonnes from 14 million tonnes by 2012.        
	The governments current stake in SAIL is 85.82 per cent of the companys total paid-up share capital of Rs 4,130 crore.

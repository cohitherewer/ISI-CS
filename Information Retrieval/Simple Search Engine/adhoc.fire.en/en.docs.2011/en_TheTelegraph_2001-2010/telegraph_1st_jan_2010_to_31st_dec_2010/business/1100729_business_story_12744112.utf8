The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gas panel keeps Anil waiting
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Gas panel keeps Anil waiting
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sundareshan: Put on hold                                  
	New Delhi, July 28: The empowered group of ministers (eGoM) today deferred its decision on the supply of gas from Reliance Industries fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin to Anil Ambani firms as well as to state-owned NTPC Ltd.        
	The eGoM decided to meet again to discuss gas allocation. RIL will ramp up production in KG basin to peak capacity in fiscal 2012, petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said.        
	The group, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, met for the first time after the Supreme Court gave its verdict on the gas dispute between the Ambani brothers.         
	The spat between RIL and NTPC over gas is still pending in Bombay High Court.        
	The panel also reviewed the availability of KG gas in the years to come. Sundareshan informed the eGoM that production in KG basin is expected to be 60 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in 2011. The capacity is likely to be ramped up to its peak in fiscal 2012.        
	According to a development plan of the gasfield, approved by the directorate-general of hydrocarbons, output from the fields will increase to 80mmscmd in 2012.         
	Sundareshan said the oil ministry would be inviting proposals from the fertiliser and power ministries for the utilisation of the gas.         
	They will give their requirements, based on that we will again go to the eGoM for new allocations.        
	The eGoM, he said, has allocated about 63mmscmd from the KG-D6 fields to fertiliser, power, petrochemical, steel and refinery firms. There would be a shortfall of around 3mmscmd as RIL can produce up to 60mmscmd of gas at present.         
	So, the ministerial panel decided to replace KG-D6 with ONGC for gas supplies at Uran in Maharashtra and the state-owned firms LPG unit. The surplus gas, thus, available from the KG basin can fill the supply gap, officials said        
	Users waiting to sign the gas purchase agreement with RIL include state-run NTPC (1.14 mmscmd), Essar Oils Vadinary refinery in Gujarat (0.6 mmscmd), ONGCs LPG units (0.406 mmscmd), Rithala power plant in Delhi (0.4 mmscmd) and Bawana power plant (0.93 mmscmd).        
	Of the current production, about 14 mmscmd is sold to fertiliser plants, 28 mmscmd to power units and 10 mmscmd to petrochemical plants and refineries.         
	The remaining 7 mmscmd of gas is consumed by sectors such as sponge iron plants, LPG units, city gas distribution firms and the East-West pipeline.

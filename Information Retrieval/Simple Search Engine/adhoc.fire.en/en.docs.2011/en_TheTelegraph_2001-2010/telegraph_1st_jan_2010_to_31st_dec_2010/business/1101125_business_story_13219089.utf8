          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          FUNDS SPLASH                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 24: Mauritius-based Pragnya Fund has put in around $10 million (Rs 45 crore) in two Bengal projects executed by the Paharpur group.        
	Paharpur has formed a special purpose vehicle with Pragnya called the Paharpur Pragnya Realty Private Ltd in which the local company owns 51 per cent.        
	The investment conforms to FDI norms, which ensure that funds remain locked in for at least three years.         
	Paharpur Pragnya will build Genexx Towers at Barrackpore with 1,100 apartments on 11.3 acres.         
	It will come up with another project  Genexx Exotica  comprising 749 apartments on 9.26 acres in Asansol through a wholly-owned subsidiary. The plot is located on GT Road. The project is targeted at upper and middle-income groups. Both the projects will include commercial complexes.         
	Paharpur also plans to construct a commercial complex of approximately 3,00,000- square-foot in front of the Joka project Genexx Valley  which still awaits final approval.        
	Genexx Valley on 21 acres at Joka on the southern fringes of Calcutta is Paharpurs first major project.

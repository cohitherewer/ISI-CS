The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to break GST deadlock
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bid to break GST deadlock
          JAYATI GHOSE                             Mukherjee, Dasgupta: Decision time                                
	New Delhi, May 16: The empowered committee of state finance ministers will take up the issue of compensation from the Centre next week to facilitate the launch of the goods and services tax (GST) from the next fiscal year.         
	States have demanded a compensation of Rs 1 lakh crore to adopt GST, which is seen as the biggest tax reform undertaken by the government, and may lead to a fall in revenues for some states.         
	A task force set up by the 13th Finance Commission had suggested a compensation of Rs 50,000 crore for the states to offset the revenue loss on account of the reduction in central sales tax (CST).         
	The states have lowered CST to 2 per cent, signalling its gradual elimination with the launch of GST.        
	In January, negotiations between the Centre and the states were marred by disputes over the compensation package.         
	Official sources said the two sides were likely to reach a compromise soon. They added that the Centre could be ready to compensate the states in the initial years, provided there was a consensus on the broader framework for GST, including an acceptable rate.         
	Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who is also the chairman of the empowered committee, met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee on Friday to discuss various unresolved issues, including compensation.         
	Earlier, Vijay Kelkar, chairman of the 13th Finance Commission, had said the Centre could consider a compensation package, which was higher than the proposed Rs 50,000 crore.         
	Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, having a high concentration of manufacturing industries, were most vocal in their demand for more relief during the January meet.         
	The finance minister in his address at the Confederation of Indian Industrys annual session, recently, said the Centre would shortly start releasing CST compensation funds.         
	According to analysts, the governments willingness to release funds will remove a friction point, which has disrupted the implementation of GST.         
	The launch of GST requires constitutional amendments as the existing demarcation between the kinds of taxes the Centre and the states can collect will have to be removed.         
	The GST rate will be another debatable issue at the meeting. While the Centre has proposed a revenue-neutral rate of 12 per cent, the states have demanded a rate of 18-20 per cent.

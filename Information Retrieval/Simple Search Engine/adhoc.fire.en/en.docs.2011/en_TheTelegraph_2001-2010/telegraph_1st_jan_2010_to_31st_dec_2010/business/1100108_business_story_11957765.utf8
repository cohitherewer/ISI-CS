          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Jan. 7: Pfizer has joined hands with Bangalore-based Strides Arcolab to sell the latters generic drugs in the US.         
	Strides-Pfizer is another instance of global pharmaceutical giants tapping Indian firms to supply generic drugs in the developed markets.         
	Last year, Hyderabad-based Aurobindo Pharma had entered into an agreement with Pfizer to manufacture several off-patented or loss of exclusivity products for marketing by Pfizers established product business unit.        
	The initial deal was for Pfizer selling around 39 drugs in the US, 20 in Europe and 11 in France. However, the scope got expanded when Pfizer acquired rights to 55 solid oral dose products and five sterile injectable products for various countries.         
	GlaxoSmithKline has also inked an agreement with Dr Reddys Laboratories to develop and market selected products across the emerging markets, excluding India.         
	According to recent reports, Pfizer is also in talks with Cipla for the sale of generic drugs in the US.         
	News of the pact sent the shares of Strides soaring on the stock exchanges today where it hit a two-year high.         
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the scrip ended with a gain of 8.21 per cent, or Rs 19.30, at Rs 254.25.         
	Strides said Pfizer would commercialise off-patented sterile injectable and oral products in the US.         
	The finished dosage form products would be licensed and supplied by Strides, Onco Laboratories and Onco Therapies  two joint ventures between Strides and South Africas Aspen.         
	The financial terms of the supply agreement were not disclosed.         
	Strides said it would deliver 40 off-patented products, many of which came under the oncology segment. These will be available to healthcare providers and patients.         
	The first products commercialised under this collaboration are expected to be launched this year.         
	The collaboration is new and exciting, and we are encouraged about the potential of this relationship, said David Simmons, president and general manager of Pfizers established products business unit.

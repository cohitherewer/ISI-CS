  Slowdown main culprit          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, March 23: The forecast for growth in the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12) is now 8.1 per cent against 9 per cent earlier, with the slip attributed to global recession.        
	A full meeting of the Planning Commission, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, today undertook a mid-term review of the Eleventh Plan and lowered the forecast.        
	The planners, however, projected a higher growth of 9-10 per cent in the Twelfth Plan (2012-2017).        
	The average rate of growth in the plan period could be a little over 8 per cent. However, the economy should be in a growth trajectory in the next plan and experience a growth of 9 per cent to 10 per cent, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, told reporters after the meeting.        
	He called for several course-correction measures in the remaining years of the Eleventh Plan.        
	Ahluwalia said the government should raise the prices of fuel, fertiliser and food sold under welfare schemes to keep its subsidy bill at targeted levels. India has budgeted Rs 101,000 crore for subsidies next fiscal.        
	In his opening remarks, the Prime Minister said that the return to high growth should not be taken for granted as the global environment was likely to remain difficult in the year ahead.        
	Our strengths can help us return to a 9 per cent growth trajectory by 2011-12. However, as the mid-term appraisal rightly emphasises, restoration of high growth should not be taken for granted, he said.        
	He said exports were likely to grow more slowly than they did before recession.        
	India had targeted to earn $200 billion from exports in 2008-09, but the global economic crisis put paid to this hope and the country ended the year with $185 billion in exports. This fiscal it may earn $160-165 billion from abroad.        
	We will need another source of demand to offset slow exports growth and that demand should ideally come from an expansion in investment in infrastructure, both in rural areas and the economy in general, he said.        
	The Prime Minister said the country could expect a strong rebound in farm production as the monsoon was expected to be a normal one. Severe contraction in farm production in the third quarter of this fiscal has pulled down growth to 6 per cent from 7.25 per cent in the second quarter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Vedanta targets $775m from bonds
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Vedanta targets $775m from bonds
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Agarwal: Raising funds                           
	Mumbai, March 2: Vedanta Resources, the metals and mining major, will raise $775 million through convertible bonds to refinance its debt and meet general corporate expenses.         
	The offering is the biggest convertible bond issue in Europe this year.         
	The announced size of $775 million may be increased by up to $75 million by way of an over-allotment option granted to the joint bookrunners, allowing them to subscribe for up to an additional $75 million of bonds by March 26, 2010, Vedanta said.        
	The Anil Agarwal company had a net debt of about $200 million by the end of the last financial year, according to the financial details available on the company website.        
	Vedanta will give priority to existing shareholders in the allocation of the bonds.         
	However, Volcan Investments Limited, the majority shareholder of Vedanta, will not be participating in the transaction, the company said.        
	The bonds are expected to have a coupon rate of 3.50-4 per cent, payable semi-annually. Bonds will be converted into fully paid ordinary shares.         
	The conversion price is likely to be a premium of around 40 per cent to the average share price between its launch and pricing.        
	The announcement of the issue led to Vedanta shares taking a beating on the London Stock Exchange.         
	Vedanta Resources was recently in the news when the Church of England sold shares worth 2.5 million in the company because of concerns on the companys record on human rights.         
	Recent reports have said that three other investors have also sold Vedanta shares of over 2 million in the market.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sun offer for Taro shares
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 15 (PTI): Sun Pharma today made a fresh offer to buy the remaining shares of Israels Taro Pharma that were not tendered by the shareholders during the latest offer, which expired today.        
	Mumbai-based Sun Pharma, through its subsidiary Alkaloida, had made the fresh tender offer to Taro shareholders to acquire all its outstanding ordinary shares.        
	Sun is pleased to be able to finally close the offer, Sun Pharma CMD Dilip Shanghvi said.        
	On the expiry of the offer, 29,382 ordinary shares, or 0.07 per cent of Taros outstanding shares, had been tendered. The new offer begins today and will expire on September 28.         
	On September 15, 2010, Alkaloida commenced a subsequent offering period for all remaining ordinary shares that have not yet been tendered, Sun said.        
	The company is offering $7.75 per share, the same as in the earlier offer.        
	The promoters of Taro  the Levitt family  have a 12 per cent stake.        
	Sun has been fighting to take control of the Israeli firm since 2008 when a $454-million merger deal between the two failed.        
	Sun  the single-largest shareholder in Taro with a 36 per cent stake  has received a favourable ruling from Israels supreme court for the open offer, paving way for it to gain control of Taro.         
	We will now make every effort to consummate our option agreement to purchase the Levitts controlling shares of Taro, Shanghvi added.        
	Sun Pharma shares closed at Rs 1,800.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, up 3.09 per cent from its previous close of Rs 1,746.30.

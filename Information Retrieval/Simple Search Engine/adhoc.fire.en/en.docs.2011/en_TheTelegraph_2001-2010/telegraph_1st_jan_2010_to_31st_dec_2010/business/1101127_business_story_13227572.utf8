          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, Nov. 26: Investigations into the housing loan scam that erupted on Wednesday have started to deepen, sending a frisson through the stock markets.        
	The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) today sent out showcause notices to 21 companies implicated in the scam, while officials at market regulator Sebi said they had started poring over a mass of transactions to look for signs of insider trading.        
	On Wednesday, the CBI had arrested eight officials of banks and financial institutions, including Ramachandran Nair, chief executive officer at LIC Housing Finance, Naresh Chandra, secretary (investments) at LIC and Rajesh Sharma, chairman and managing director, Money Matters Financial Services.        
	Money Matters is a small financial intermediary, which is at the centre of the bribes-for-loans scandal.        
	The full list of companies that received the showcause notices was not available.        
	Meanwhile, market regulator Sebi is checking to see whether some of the loan beneficiaries had diverted the funds into a booming stock market.        
	Sebi sources confirmed the market regulator would investigate charges of price manipulation, insider trading and front-running.         
	Front-running occurs when an investor buys or sells shares with prior knowledge of a big transaction in a particular stock.        
	It is understood that Sebi started this process after the CBI shared some information relating to its investigations into the housing finance scam. The CBI sleuths have already asked the stock exchanges to provide details in the trading of certain scrips.        
	At present, Sebis investigation is limited to individuals or entities listed by the CBI.         
	According to the CBI, Chandra had allegedly passed on inside information on several companies, including Religare, Adani Enterprises, DB Realty, Jaiprakash Power Ventures and Pantaloon, to Sharma. The tipoff has sparked suspicions of front-running or insider trading in these shares.        
	It is learnt that the market regulator is looking into the trading pattern in some of these scrips. A Sebi official said information had been sought on trading and price patterns in more than a dozen stocks.        
	On Friday, investors seethed as many of these stocks floundered in an extremely nervous market.         
	The LIC Housing Finance stock tumbled close to 12 per cent to Rs 932.10, an indication that the markets apprehensions hadnt been assuaged by LICs statement that the scam wouldnt impair its balance sheet.        
	Similarly, the Central Bank of India  whose director was arrested by the CBI  saw its shares plunge nearly 10 per cent to Rs 188.50.        
	Suzlon Energy, which had retained Money Matters as a financial adviser for a loan-raising exercise last year, saw its stock slide by 4.16 per cent to Rs 44.90. Likewise Adani Enterprises nosedived a huge 17 per cent to Rs 584.70.        
	Realty stocks continued to be battered on worries that funds flow to the sector would be badly affected because of the scam, sparking an erosion in property values across the country.        
	The BSE Realty index was the biggest loser, dropping 4.68 per cent. DLF ended with losses of 1.71 per cent, Unitech dipped close to 4.76 per cent, India Bulls Real Estate around 12 per cent, while DB Realty slumped nearly 10 per cent to hit a new low of Rs 211.75.        
	The 30-share sensex fell below the critical 19000-level in intra-day trades but clawed back some of the losses when it closed at 19136.61, down 181.55 points.        
	Analysts said equities could stage a rally next week but advised investors to stay away from the realty pack.

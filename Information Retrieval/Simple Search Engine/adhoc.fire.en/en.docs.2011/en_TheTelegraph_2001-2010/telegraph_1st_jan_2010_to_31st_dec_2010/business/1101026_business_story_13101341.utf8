          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manwani: Upbeat                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 25: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL)  the countrys largest FMCG maker  beat market expectations by posting a 32 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 566 crore for the second quarter ended September 30.        
	The net profit number was bolstered by exceptional items that include a one-time gain from the sale of properties. Profit after tax before exceptional items grew 6.8 per cent.        
	Exceptional gains of Rs 40 crore during the period compared with exceptional costs of Rs 135 crore in the previous year led to a 32.1 per cent growth in net profit, the company said.        
	Analysts were, however, impressed by the sales growth the company achieved across businesses as volumes picked up. HULs net sales increased 11 per cent to Rs 4,680 crore from Rs 4,228 crore a year ago.        
	Sales were driven by a 14 per cent volume growth in the consumer businesses and were broad-based across both the home and personal care and food segments.        
	On the firms performance, HUL chairman Harish Manwani said, Our domestic consumer business has delivered double-digit underlying volume growth for the third quarter in a row. This has been led by bigger and better innovations supported by strong execution in the market. We continue to strengthen our core business, while at the same time leading market development in emerging categories.        
	Home and personal care grew 9 per cent, and the Rin re-launch pushed sales of the brand into double-digit levels.        
	Personal products grew 15 per cent as the companys launches such as Vaseline Men and Fair amp; Lovely Max Fairness fared well.        
	The food business, which has often faced stiff competition, grew 13 per cent with beverages and ice-cream posting a 9 per cent growth, while processed foods grew 26 per cent. Kissan and Knorr grew rapidly, the company said.        
	The company hopes that the good monsoon this year will increase spending in rural markets that are likely to have a beneficial impact on sales in future.

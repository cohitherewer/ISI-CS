          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Clear signal                                  
	New Delhi, May 4: Soaring prices of 3G spectrum indicate a bounty for new telecom players keen to induct strategic partners through equity sales.        
	Telecom firms are scrambling for 3G spectrum  radiowaves through which voice and data travel  and have pushed up the pan-India licence fee to more than Rs 10,000 crore against a base price of Rs 3,500 crore. The auction is expected to continue for another week, meaning the final price will be higher.         
	Buoyed by the 3G sale success, the government plans to sell all future spectrum (2G and 3G) using the latest auction price as a benchmark.         
	Analysts said that 2G spectrum could easily now be valued at Rs 2,000 a megahertz.        
	Videocon-promoted Datacom, which offers GSM-based mobile services in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Mumbai, have plans to sell a 26 per cent stake to foreign players.         
	Bahrains leading operator Batelco is keen to hike its shareholding in Chennais C. Sivasankaran-promoted S Tel by 6.3 per cent. A firm owning 4.4Mhz of 2G spectrum will be worth over Rs 8,000 crore, or $2 billion, at least today, said Sudipto Bose, a telecom analyst.         
	Earlier, DB Group-promoted Swan Telecom (now Etisalat DB) sold a 45 per cent stake to UAE-based Etisalat for $900 million, while Sanjay Chandra-promoted Unitech Wireless sold 67 per cent in its telecom venture to Norway-based Telenor for $1.1 billion.         
	The only assets these companies had were the allocated spectrum. Both the firms had paid Rs 1,650 crore to get spectrum to operate in all 22 circles.         
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India is expected to issue recommendations on the new methodology to be adopted to award 2G airwaves after the completion of 3G auction.        
	A department of telecom panel had earlier said only start-up spectrum should be given for free.

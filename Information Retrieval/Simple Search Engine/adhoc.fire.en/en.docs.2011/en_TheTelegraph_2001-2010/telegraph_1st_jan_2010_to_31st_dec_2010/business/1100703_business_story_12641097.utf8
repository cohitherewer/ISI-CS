          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 2: The Reserve Bank of India today winched up two benchmark short-term interest rates  the reverse repo and the repo  by 25 basis points, signalling its determination to clamp down on runaway inflation which is running at just over 10 per cent.        
	The repo was increased to 5.5 per cent and the reverse repo bumped up to 4 per cent as the central bank decided not to wait for the monetary policy review on July 27 before declaring an all-out war on inflation. The spook already threatens to nudge higher as the effects of the recent auto fuel price hikes seep into the economy.        
	The reverse repo is the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity against government securities while the repo is the rate at which it provides money to banks.         
	This is the third time that the RBI is raising the benchmark rates this year as inflation continues to hover well above all the official forecasts. The RBI has forecast an inflation rate of 5.5 per cent by the end of March next year.        
	A hike in the two short-term rates was a foregone conclusion with inflation hitting double digits and the Union government increasing petrol, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene prices last Friday.        
	Bankers, however, said the rate hike would not immediately impact EMIs of home and personal loan borrowers.        
	However, a senior banker with a nationalised bank said a hike in interest rates would largely depend on the central banks action at its July 27 meeting.        
	He added that interest rate movement would depend on the amount of cash in the financial system. As the government is expected to resume spending, we may see liquidity returning to the system over the next three or four weeks. In that situation, banks may decide not to raise their lending rates, he added.        
	In the past few weeks, the bankers were trying to second guess when the RBI policy makers would pull the rate trigger. Several bankers felt that the RBI would go for a mid-cycle policy action of 25 basis points while others reckoned the rates would be increased by 50 basis points on July 27.        
	The RBIs action, particularly on the repo rate front, is significant as this is the operating policy rate. The liquidity in the banking system is now tight on account of advance tax outflows, and the money spent on the 3G and broadband wireless auctions. As more than Rs 100,000 crore of liquidity moved out of the banking system in June, banks have been tapping the repo window, borrowing funds of around Rs 60,000 crore on a daily basis from the RBI.        
	An immediate impact of the RBI action will be that rates across the yield curve will move up. In other words, companies will now have to pay a higher interest rate while accessing the bond markets. It is felt that yields on the benchmark 10-year security, which today closed at 7.57 per cent, could jump by 10 basis points on Monday when trading resumes.        
	The RBI action comes just two days after banks announced their base rates, the minimum rate at which they will lend to corporate and retail borrowers.        
	It is largely felt that the hike in repo and reverse repo rates will not result in an immediate increase in the base rates of most of the banks.        
	Explaining the rationale for the monetary policy measures, the RBI said the developments on the inflation front raise several concerns. Overall wholesale price index (WPI) inflation increased to 10.2 per cent in May, up from 9.6 per cent in April 2010. Food price inflation and consumer price inflation remain at elevated levels. There has been some moderation in food price inflation, but the price index of food articles continues to increase. More importantly, the prices of non-food manufactured goods and fuel items have accelerated in recent months, it said.        
	The RBI said the recent increase in fuel prices was justified from the point of view of long-term fiscal and energy conservation objectives, but it would have an immediate impact of around one percentage point on WPI inflation, with second round effects being felt in the months ahead.         
	Two-thirds of WPI inflation in May was contributed by non-food items, suggesting that inflation is now very much generalised and that demand-side pressures are evident, it said.

  Buzz of Mukesh stake in Infratel          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, June 14: Anil Ambani has decided to spin off Reliance Infratel  the telecom tower subsidiary of Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com)  and offer a stake to other telecom players, including elder brother Mukesh.        
	Sources said Mukesh-owned Reliance Industries could bite the bait, with speculation growing that it could acquire as much as 26 per cent in Reliance Infratel, possibly through one of its subsidiaries.        
	Analysts estimated that R-Com could raise at least Rs 25,000 crore by offloading 50 to 55 per cent in the demerged entity in which no telecom operator, including R-Com, will have a controlling interest.        
	R-Com also said it would be seeking a cash-and-stock payment for the deal from the new partners, sparking talk that Anil could also end up with some stake in the Mukesh Ambani-owned entity that invests in Infratel.        
	Cross-holdings        
	It is a fair possibility that Mukesh Ambani would pick up a stake in Reliance Infratel in the light of the recent camaraderie between the two siblings, said one analyst.        
	The crucial question is whether he will offer a mix of cash and stock to seal the deal. Analysts do not rule out the possibility of shares of an unlisted company in Mukesh Ambanis portfolio being offered to R-Com in exchange for the stake. This raises the prospect of cross-holdings among the Ambani brothers  an unthinkable prospect when they split Dhirubhais empire in 2005.        
	Mukesh Ambani needs to buy into a ready-made infrastructure company that will provide the backbone to the 4G services he hopes to launch in the next two years using the high-speed broadband wireless spectrum.         
	Last Friday, the RIL chieftain picked up a 95 per cent stake in Infotel Broadband Services Ltd for Rs 4,800 crore (just over $1 billion) that emerged as the only holder of a pan-India licence for broadband wireless spectrum after a hard-fought, 16-day auction.         
	R-Com currently holds 95 per cent in Reliance Infratel, which has over 50,000 towers.         
	At separate meetings held today, the boards of the two Anil Ambani companies approved a proposal to restructure the ownership of Reliance Infratel.        
	A statement from R-Com, which hinted at the plan to offload a majority stake in the tower company, said the restructuring will create the worlds largest independent telecom infrastructure company, not owned and/or controlled by any telecom operator.         
	Analysts said this indicated that R-Coms stake in the company might fall below 50 per cent.        
	The Anil Ambani company added that the restructuring proposal would be implemented through a demerger and/or other suitable value-creating options with respect to Reliance Infratels assets against which it hoped to receive a combination of cash and stock.        
	It also pointed out that both the companies were at an advanced stage of discussions with several domestic and international strategic and financial players. It expects to announce a transaction shortly.        
	Paring debt        
	Rahul Jain, telecom analyst at Angel Broking, said the spin-off of Reliance Infratel was a positive for R-Com and it could mop up anywhere between Rs 25,000 crore and Rs 30,000 crore from the deal.         
	Recent deals in the telecom tower market had yielded good valuations. GTL Infrastructure Ltd bought Aircel Ltds over 17,500 towers for Rs 48 lakh per tower and Quippo Infrastructure Ltd acquired Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltds 2,500 towers at a price of Rs 52 lakh per tower.         
	Assuming the same valuation, the consideration to R-Com should be at least Rs 25,000 crore.        
	For R-Com, a stake sale in Reliance Infratel would bring down its huge debt of over Rs 30,000 crore on its books. Nearly half of it is accounted by Reliance Infratel.         
	I am delighted that this endeavour will benefit R-Com through debt reduction, and enhanced financial flexibility, chairman Anil Ambani said.

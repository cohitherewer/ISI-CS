The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Air India for capital infusion at one go
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Air India for capital infusion at one go
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Patel: Making room for funds                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: Air India wants a one-time capital infusion instead of in small portions, which will hugely reduce its debt-to-equity ratio that can encourage banks to restructure its massive loan burden of Rs 19,000 crore.        
	At a four-hour board meeting in Mumbai, the airline decided that it would seek a single equity infusion of Rs 2,000 crore, over and above the Rs 1,231 crore that the finance ministry has agreed to give. The capital prop will be sought in the next quarter.         
	The airline and the civil aviation ministry have been for some time seeking a large one-time capital dose as well as sovereign guarantees for its loans. A fresh attempt will be made this time on the grounds that the airlines debt-to-equity ratio will be a huge 40:1 even after getting the cash support of Rs 1,231 crore; without this money, the debt-equity ratio is at 200:1.        
	It is a commitment of the government to ensure that the national carrier is in good health, civil aviation minister Praful Patel, who attended the meeting, said earlier today.        
	However, top finance ministry officials said the parameters set by a committee of secretaries to cut losses were not yet met. Its no use doling out money till we are satisfied the money is being well spent.        
	Under the parameters prepared last year, the management needs to integrate Air India and the former Indian Airlines, set up separate business units for engineering and ground handling, return leased aircraft, redeploy staff to cut expenses and shut down overseas offices where Air India does not operate. Patel said some parameters have already improved, but much more needs to be done.        
	The airline also plans to transfer 10,000-12,000 employees to two subsidiaries  Air India Air Transport Services Ltd which is into ground handling and Air India Engineering Service Ltd, in charge of aircraft maintenance. However, the management needs to get the labour unions on board.         
	Plans for a loan recast, discussed at todays meeting, would bring down the interest payout to about 8.5 per cent from 11-12 per cent now. The airline says seeking capital infusion is only a baby step in its efforts to recast loans. A sovereign guarantee would give us the highest credit rating in the market, the officials said.         
	Aviation ministry officials argued that it was natural for governments to support their national carriers, citing the examples of Japan, the US and the UK.

	Mumbai, Sept. 2: After a lull, insurance companies have started offering unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) that meet the new guidelines of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda).         
	Two private insurers  Future Generali and Kotak Life Insurance  today launched three Ulip products.         
	Other players such as SBI Life Insurance, Reliance Life Insurance and HDFC Standard Life have announced their products in line with the new norms that came into effect from Wednesday. They are yet to launch their product.         
	Irda has cleared 51 of the 68 unit-linked products that were filed with it. Each insurer has to come out with a minimum of two products.         
	Future Generali Select Insurance Plan announced today will allocate 97 per cent of the premium in the first year and 98 per cent in the remaining years, Deepak Sood, managing director and CEO of Future Generali, said.         
	Kotak Life Insurance has announced two schemes  Kotak Secure Invest Insurance and Kotak Wealth Insurance. The insurer said the first plan offered capital guarantee and would help the customer gain from market participation through the guarantee fund.         
	The second plan provides investment growth along with comprehensive triple benefit to the nominee on the death of the customer.

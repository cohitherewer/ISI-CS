        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay gives a thumbs-up to daily systematic investment plans of MFs                                        
	Satish works for a management consulting firm. He has worked hard to rise to the position of a project manager. His father, a retired bank officer, had taken a loan to send him to a business school. In the early years on his job, Satish had hardly any savings as he was busy paying back the education loan.         
	Satish has been stashing away whatever savings he had in bank deposits. He has stayed away from stock markets because of the high chances of losses in such investments. But Satish now wants his money to grow, he has more disposable income, too, but his deposits hardly earn him anything. He wants a safe entry into equities. A simple solution would be to go for mutual funds, preferably a daily systematic investment plan.         
	Safe and simple        
	There are simple ways of making money from equity investments without taking much risk. What one needs is disciplined and regular investments. Money is made when stock prices go up. Money can be made when prices go down.         
	In fact, money is made most when markets sink. There is a popular saying in the stock markets that what goes up, comes down and what goes down, comes up. Thus, in the long run, these wild swings get ironed out over an upward moving trend line.         
	While the chances of capital loss in equity investment is minimal in the long run, risks are higher in the short and medium term. One can beat the market returns by sticking to a systematic plan.         
	In 1998, when Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund talked about systematic investment plans, people took it as another selling gimmick. But the concept now has come full circle with many fund houses talking about daily systematic investment plans.         
	Before we illustrate how systematic investment helps earn better returns on investment, let us first clear one misconception about SIPs.         
	A systematic plan is applicable to a portfolio of equities rather than a single stock. When a stocks price comes down, there may be some bad news triggering the slide and it may not be a wise decision to buy the stock at lower prices to bring down the average cost of acquisition.         
	But when a pack of stocks representing different sectors decline, the trigger may be investors sentiment or unfavourable macro-economic conditions.         
	Better returns        
	Let us now see how systematic investment helps you earn a better return. For illustration purpose, we have considered Reliance Vision Fund (growth option). Had you invested a fixed sum of money systematically every month in this fund between January 1, 2000 till January 1, 2010, you would have got an annualised return of 32.44 per cent.         
	But had you put in a lump-sum amount in this fund on January 1, 2000, by January 1 this year your investment would have yielded an annualised return of only 26.14 per cent. The BSE 100 index, the benchmark index for the fund, yielded only 13.40 per cent during these 10 years.         
	In equities, systematic investment or investment of a fixed amount at regular intervals over a long period of time yield a much superior return than a lump-sum investment. The higher return also comes with lower risks since you have made investments through the highs and lows of markets. It is on this premise that life insurance companies claim that the returns on their unit-linked plans will be superior to mutual fund investment.         
	In life insurance plans, you basically follow a systematic investment by paying the premium on a monthly or quarterly or yearly basis.         
	Daily dose        
	Most of the systematic investment plans of mutual funds offer monthly or quarterly investment intervals. However, fund houses, such as ING, Bharti Axa, IDFC and Sahara, have come up with daily SIPs.         
	Daily SIP is a better option than monthly SIP. In a monthly SIP, your investment date in each month is fixed, you cannot reap the benefit of the market volatility during the period between the two successive investment dates.         
	In a daily SIP, your money is invested every business day. The adjoining table shows how a daily SIP helps you reduce investment loss.        
	Since the beginning of this calendar year till February 4, the 30-share sensex on Bombay Stock Exchange has given a negative return of 7.596 per cent. But had you invested a fixed sum every day, you would have suffered a loss of only 4.984 per cent.         
	In other words, when the market makes a U-turn, you will be the first to break even into profits simply because your losses are less than the investor who has put in a lump-sum or who has chosen the monthly SIP route.        
	Daily SIP thus works as a better tool to manage both short-term and long-term volatility in equity markets.        
	But the sad part is not many fund houses are offering the daily SIP facility. Now that fund houses cannot charge any entry load in any of their schemes, you can yourself buy everyday units of the chosen scheme from your preferred fund house if it is not offering the daily SIP facility.         
	Fund houses are now offering online purchase and sale of mutual fund units through their respective websites. Some fund houses such as HDFC MF is also offering the facility to transact using mobile phones without any additional charges.        
	In case you have a lump-sum amount to invest, invest it in a debt fund and instruct the fund house to transfer a specified amount from this to your targeted equity fund on a daily basis. However, this process may involve some cost.         
	Daily SIP is best suited for salaried people like Satish who have regular income but cannot fork out a large sum at one go. Once Satish started a daily SIP, he understood that income minus savings is equal to spending and not income minus spending is what you save. This is the basis of wealth creation. The more you save, the more you earn.

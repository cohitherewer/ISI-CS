The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Liquidity crunch to linger
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Liquidity crunch to linger
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           High alert                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 9: The liquidity crunch in banks is likely to persist till the end of this fiscal even if the Centre pumps cash into the system through its expenditure programmes, according to Standard Chartered Research.        
	Grappling with tight liquidity conditions, banks are borrowing heavily from the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) repo window apart from raising deposit rates.         
	On Wednesday, they borrowed over Rs 1.27 lakh crore from the central bank.         
	Though the RBI has announced various measures that include relaxing the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirement, the funds crunch has not eased. SLR is the amount which banks are mandated to park in government securities.        
	It is feared that the liquidity situation can turn more tight due to advance tax outflows in mid-December.         
	The liquidity shortfall following the tax outflow may be a bit larger than an earlier StanChart research projection of Rs 1.4 trillion by the end of the month.         
	While bankers expect the liquidity crunch to ease once the government starts spending, the liquidity crunch is likely to persist till the end of this fiscal, Samiran Chakraborty, StanChart Researchs regional head of research, India, and Nagaraj Kulkarni, senior rates strategist, said in a note.        
	They arrived at this projection on the basis of two scenarios of fiscal deficit and government spending in the remaining months of the fiscal.        
	In the first scenario, where the fiscal deficit is assumed to be 5 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product), the report said this could be maintained if the government limited 2010-11 expenditure to Rs 12.2 trillion (against a budgeted Rs 11.1 trillion). This will mean that the government will spend Rs 4.7 trillion between December 2010 and March 2011. As a result of limited government expenditure and other cash flows from the banking system, we estimate the end-March 2011 liquidity deficit at Rs 75,000 crore under this scenario.         
	On the other hand, if the fiscal deficit is 5.5 per cent of GDP, the government will have to spend around Rs 5 trillion in the rest of this fiscal, and the liquidity deficit will be around Rs 50,000 crore.

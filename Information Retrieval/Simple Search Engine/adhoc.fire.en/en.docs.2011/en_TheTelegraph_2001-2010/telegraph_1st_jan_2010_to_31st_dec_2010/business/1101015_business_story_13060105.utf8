The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI steps in to halt rupee rise

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 14: The Reserve Bank of India today purchased dollars to check the tearaway rise in the rupees value, intervening for the first time this year in the forex market to keep the exchange rate at an acceptable level.        
	Foreign investors have been pouring money into local bourses and have already funnelled over $22 billion into Indian equities till date. The rising ride of dollars has sparked concerns about a hardening rupee that could seriously undermine the countrys export prospects. The commerce ministry has set a $200-billion export target for this fiscal.        
	Forex circles said the RBI today bought dollars in small lots when the rupee touched 44.10 to a dollar in intra-day trades. The Indian currency had opened strong at 44.25/26 per dollar against its previous close of 44.51/52 before climbing to the days high of 44.09. It later closed the day fairly firm at 44.11 to a dollar.        
	Until now, the RBI has refrained from intervening as the purchase of dollars releases rupees into the financial system that could exacerbate inflationary pressures. Inflation is now riding at 8.5 per cent.        
	From todays intervention, it seems that the central bank will see that the rupee does not breach the 44 levels, said a treasury chief with a foreign bank. The rupee has appreciated by around 5 per cent this year and it is felt that if dollar inflows continue, it could hit the 43.50-mark.        
	The gush of dollars is expected to surge next week when Coal India Ltd comes out with its maiden issue of over 63 crore shares seeking to raise over Rs 15,000 crore  making it the biggest initial public offering (IPO) to hit the local markets.        
	The Coal India issue opens on October 18 and pundits are expecting an inflow of about $2 billion next week. Some experts say this number can surge two to three times if there is an over-subscription.        
	As 50 per cent of the Coal India issue are reserved for qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) of which foreign investors form a significant chunk, it has been felt that consequent huge dollar inflows could see the rupee hardening above the Rs 44 to a dollar mark.         
	A rise in the rupees value is not good news for exporters as it erodes their competitiveness in foreign markets. Market observers had expected the RBI to intervene to check the dollar inflows that could blunt the countrys export competitiveness.        
	Duvvuri Subbarao, the RBI governor, had said at a panel discussion in Washington last Saturday that the apex bank might intervene if the inflows are lumpy and volatile, or if they disrupt the macro-economic situation.        
	Subbarao had then also admitted that the RBI did not intervene unlike some of the other central banks given Indias high current account deficit. It has been widely believed by many, including Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, that the huge inflows will bridge the current account deficit. Other central banks that have intervened include the Bank of Thailand and Bank of Korea.        
	US threat to China        
	The US is poised to pass legislation aimed at pressuring China to raise the value of its currency, unless Beijing works with the US to address its concerns, according to Reuters We must find a path forward that allows China to meaningfully appreciate its currency to the benefit of both of our economies, senate finance committee chairman Max Baucus said in Beijing on Wednesday.

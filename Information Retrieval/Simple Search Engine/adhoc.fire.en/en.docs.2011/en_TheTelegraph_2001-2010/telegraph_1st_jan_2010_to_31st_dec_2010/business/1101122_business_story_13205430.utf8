The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ireland set to seek bailout

	Dublin, Nov. 21 (Reuters): Ireland will seek a bailout from international lenders, finance minister Brian Lenihan said on Sunday, ending weeks of speculation that it would need aid to prop up its banks and help it to secure cheap state funding.        
	The bailout  which would be the second rescue package for a euro zone country this year  would be less than 100 billion euros, he said, but did not give the details of the likely cost. I will be recommending to the government that we should apply for a programme and open formal negotiations, Lenihan told public broadcaster RTE. He said a plan to restructure Irelands banks was likely to be a main feature.        
	However, he dismissed pressure on Dublin from other euro zone countries to raise low business taxes that have attracted many multinational companies to Ireland, saying changes to corporation tax were off the agenda and would hamper growth.        
	Sources said Ireland might need 45-90 billion euros ($63-$126 billion), depending on whether it needed help only for its banks or to cover general government spending too.        
	If the government goes for a loan to cover three years worth of state financing requirements it would need about 65-70 billion euros. Lifting the core Tier-1 capital ratios of the countrys three largest listed lenders would add another 15 billion euros to that figure.         
	Yields on Irish government bonds have shot up during the current crisis, meaning the state would have to pay prohibitively high interest rates to borrow commercially.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Emami gets ready to plug into power
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Emami gets ready to plug into power
          SAMBIT SAHA                          R.S. Agarwal: Thinking big                                  
	Calcutta, April 20: The Emami group is set to jump on to the power bandwagon with forays into thermal, hydel and solar electricities.         
	Radheshyam Agarwal, co- chairman of the Rs 5,000-crore group, said Emami was working out a strategy to enter all the three segments and had set a target of at least 1,000 mega watt (mw) capacity by the next four to five years.        
	This will be the latest venture from one of the citys fastest growing business groups having a presence in paper, cement, edible oil, retail, healthcare and FMCG.        
	The group has signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Madhya Pradesh for a 500mw unit.         
	It is also looking at Gujarat and port sites in a few southern states to set up a facility using imported coal. Emami has not ruled out Bengal, though the company was a little worried over the volatile business environment in the state.        
	The Northeast and Uttarakhand are the obvious choice for the hydel projects.        
	The group has also engaged consultants to help it to choose the right foreign technology partner in its solar power venture.        
	Overseas mines         
	Radheshyams younger son Harsha Vardhan Agarwal said he was in talks with miners in Indonesia and Mozambique to acquire coal assets.        
	We are not limiting our option either on the asset size or deal value. It could be big or small. Let us take the initial step first, he said.        
	At present, it is evaluating the quality of coal mines and their potential reserves.         
	Indonesian owners make big claims but are often found wanting when the reserve is measured.         
	Australia is the best place for coal deals but their mines are expensive.        
	R.S. Agarwal said he was looking at the Down Under with trepidation after a spate of racial attacks on Indians.        
	I am concerned about the safety of my people. Will they be able to work there? he said. Many domestic power firms have bought overseas mines  the latest being JSW Energy in South Africa.         
	Power buys        
	Harsha said the group had appointed Ernst amp; Young to scout for buyouts in power.         
	There are units in different stages of development. Some are stuck for funds. We may buy them, he said.         
	He, however, did not rule out the acquisition of operating units.         
	Funds will not be a constraint for the group in any of the power-related ventures, he said.

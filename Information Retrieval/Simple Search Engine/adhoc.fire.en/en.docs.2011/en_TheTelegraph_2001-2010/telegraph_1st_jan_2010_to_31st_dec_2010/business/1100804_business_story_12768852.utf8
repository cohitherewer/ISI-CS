	Mumbai, Aug. 3: Adani Enterprises is acquiring Australian firm Linc Energys Galilee thermal coal property in Queensland in a deal worth $2.7 billion.         
	The consideration includes a combination of cash and royalty payments.        
	Adani Enterprises will pay Aus $500 million ($455 million) to Linc Energy plus a royalty payment for a 20-year period linked to production.         
	Although the company did not disclose further details of the royalty payment, reports put it at Aus $2 per tonne, thus taking the total deal size to $2.7 billion.        
	Adani, through its step down Australian subsidiary, Adani Mining Pty, has concluded a binding agreement with Linc Energy Ltd, to purchase a 100 per cent interest in their Galilee coal tenement in the Galilee Basin, Queensland, the company said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange today.         
	The Adani Enterprises stock gained 2.11 per cent, or Rs 12.85, to close at Rs 622.55 on the BSE.        
	The Galilee tenement has estimated coal reserves of 7.8 billion tonnes, which makes it the largest single tenement in Australia in terms of coal resource, Adani said. The company added that the purchase had secured the approval of the Foreign Investment Review Board and the indicative approval of the Queensland government.

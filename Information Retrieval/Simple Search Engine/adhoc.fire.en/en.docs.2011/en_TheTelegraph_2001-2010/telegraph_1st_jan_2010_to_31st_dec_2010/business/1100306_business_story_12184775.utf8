          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	New Delhi, March 5: The department of telecom (DoT) today asked S Tel  a joint venture between Bahrain Telecom Company (Batelco) and the Siva group  to stop mobile services in Himachal Pradesh, Orissa and Bihar circles, citing security concerns.         
	The order, a first of its kind issued by the DoT, will take effect immediately. The Chennai-based service provider, which started operations in December last year, has over six lakh customers in these three circles.         
	Yes, we have received the letter a few hours ago. We are surprised that after giving us the permission (to start operations) through letters dated December 11, 2009 and December 21, 2009, we should receive this letter today, said P. Swaminathan, president of Siva Group.         
	DoTs letter states that S Tel should stop voice and data services in three circles because of national security concerns without providing any details of those concerns. DoT officials said home ministry and security agencies had some issues with licences granted to S Tel. They refused to give further details.         
	We are trying to ascertain what are the concerns for any supportive action from our side. As far as we know, we have followed the process and have obtained all necessary approvals and permissions, said Swaminathan.         
	Sources told The Telegraph that the home ministry had issues with the identity of investors in S Tel, which is part of the Siva Group  formerly Sterling Infotech Group  with a majority shareholding with Skycity Foundations and Mauritius-based Telecom Investments.         
	Bahrains Batelco has formed a combined entity Batelco Millennium India Company Limited backed by Dubai-based Millennium Private Equity to acquire 49 per cent in S Tel. Batelco is listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange and has the Bahrain government as its principal shareholder.         
	Batelco recently entered into a partnership with Bahrain-based Islamic investment bank Global Banking Corporation, which would acquire an 11 per cent stake in S Tel for $50 million. GBCs acquisition of 11 per cent will indirectly raise Batelcos stake in S Tel by 6.3 per cent to 49 per cent.         
	S Tel has an unified access services licence and spectrum to operate in six states  Bihar, Orissa, Jammu amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, the Northeast and Assam. The Bihar circle includes Jharkhand.         
	S Tel created ripples in the telecom industry with its offer to pay Rs 13,500 crore for a pan-India licence against the official price of Rs 1,651 crore.        
	Recently, S Tel signed an infrastructure agreement for telecom towers, transmission for BTS sites and fibre backbone for inter-city connectivity with Reliance Communications.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 22: Rabobank of the Netherlands, which is planning to set up its own banking operations in India, today sold part of its stake in Yes Bank.        
	It sold 11 per cent, or 3.73 crore shares, to a clutch of institutional investors at an average price of Rs 263 per share for a consideration of Rs 981 crore. The stake sale will bring down the stake of Rabobank in Yes Bank to 4.9 per cent.         
	Rabobank placed these shares of Yes Bank in block deals on the Bombay Stock Exchange with a diversified group of investors, both domestic and foreign. These included Birla Mutual Fund, DSP Merrill Lynch Mutual Fund and Citigroup Global Markets, Mauritius.        
	Rabobank, which has been present in India for over 12 years and has a 100 per cent owned non-banking finance subsidiary Rabo India Finance, was one of the initial investors in Yes Bank, which was founded in 2004. However, it now wants to set up its own operations in India, and the stake sale is part of that process.        
	Current regulations of the Reserve Bank do not permit a foreign bank which holds more than 5 per cent in a domestic bank to set up its own operations in the country.        
	Rabobank, as a part of its overall business plan for India, is obliged under the regulations to reduce its shareholding in Yes Bank pending approval of its application for a full banking licence in India, it said in a statement today.        
	The bank added that it had laid out an international strategy to focus on major growth markets that have a strong food and agricultural base.         
	Rabobank wants to participate and contribute to Indias growth in these and other sustainable sectors, including renewable energy and clean technology. Rabobank is keen to establish its own banking presence in India and has sought the necessary regulatory approvals, it added.        
	The stake sale impacted the share prices of Yes Bank, which lost 3.51 per cent, or Rs 9.90, to close at Rs 271.80 on the BSE today.                                                  
	Following the stake sale, Sipko Schat, member of Rabobanks executive board, will step down from the board of Yes Bank.         
	Schat said Rabobank would retain 4.9 per cent in the private sector bank.        
	As a food and agribusiness bank, Rabobank is keen to participate in these areas and other sectors like clean technology in India.              
	Rabobank is not the only foreign entity wanting to set up a bank in India.               
	While existing players like Stanchart and Citibank are expanding their operations, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) received an in-principle approval in March from the central bank for a foreign banking licence in India.               
	In the same month, Credit Suisse also received the go-ahead from the banking regulator to set up branches. Goldman Sachs has also applied for a banking licence in India.              
	The stake sale by Rabobank impacted share prices of Yes Bank which lost3.51 per cent, or Rs 9.90, to close at Rs 271.80 on the BSE today.

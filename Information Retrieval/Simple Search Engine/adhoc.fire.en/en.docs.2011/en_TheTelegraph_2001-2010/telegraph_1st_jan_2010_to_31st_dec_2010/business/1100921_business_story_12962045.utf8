The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GST solution still elusive
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      GST solution still elusive
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Yadav: Awaiting outcome                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: The BJP-led states continued to oppose the draft of the constitutional amendment bill to bring in the goods and services tax (GST).         
	Most states, however, agreed to electing a vice-president for the GST council and to keep petroleum products out of the new indirect tax regime.         
	GST seeks to replace central and state indirect taxes such as excise duty and sales taxes with a value-added levy charged at the point of consumption to be shared equally between the Centre and states.        
	The empowered committee of state finance ministers today met to discuss the revised draft bill, but a consensus could not be reached because the BJP-ruled states feared a loss of autonomy.        
	DMK-ruled Tamil Nadu and BSP-run Uttar Pradesh also opposed the draft.        
	Mostly the BJP-ruled states are opposing. UP is also not agreeing and Tamil Nadu is concerned that its autonomy would be affected. I think there is some political agenda that has to be dealt with by the BJP high command, Haryana finance minister Ajay Singh Yadav told reporters after attending the meeting.        
	Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat suggested an alternative GST model. However, most states were not open to discussing any new model.        
	Madhya Pradesh finance minister Raghavji said, States autonomy would be affected by the constitutional amendment. We have opposed it. We have suggested an alternative model by which an amendment to the Constitution is not required.        
	Most states agreed to electing a vice-president for the GST council and keeping petroleum products out of GST, said sources.        
	The revised draft of the constitution amendment bill had promised to change the structure of the GST council saying the council can take a decision only when there is a consensus.        
	Earlier, the bill had proposed setting up a GST council to take decisions on GST with the consent of the Union finance minister and a two-thirds majority of states.

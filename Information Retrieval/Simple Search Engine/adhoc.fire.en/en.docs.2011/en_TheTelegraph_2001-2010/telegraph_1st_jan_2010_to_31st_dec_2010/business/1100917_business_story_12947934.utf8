	Calcutta, Sept. 16: The city-based Peerless group will invest Rs 275-280 crore in hotels.        
	Peerless Hotels is looking for land to set up four-star facilities in Bhubaneswar, Noida and Navi Mumbai, according to a senior official of the company.        
	Our negotiations with the Orissa government for the Bhubaneswar project are at an advanced stage, and if we get the land that we have chosen, the construction of the 80-room hotel will start in another one year, Peerless Hotels chief executive officer Kunal Sen said.         
	According to group managing director S.K. Roy, the company will set up another hotel on the vacant land adjacent to the Peerless Inn property in the city. It will involve an investment of around Rs 20 crore, he said.         
	The new property will have 47 rooms and construction work will start by October-end or early November, Sen said, adding that it will be operational in another two and a half years.         
	The Peerless Inn property has 122 rooms. The properties in Navi Mumbai and Noida will have 100 rooms each.        
	The setting up of a four-star hotel with 80-100 rooms entails an investment of between Rs 75 crore and Rs 95 crore, including land cost that may be between Rs 15 crore and Rs 35 crore depending on location, Sen said.        
	This translates into a total investment in the region of Rs 275-280 crore in four properties.         
	Mutual pact        
	Peerless Funds Management Company today signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Bank of India for distribution of mutual fund products.

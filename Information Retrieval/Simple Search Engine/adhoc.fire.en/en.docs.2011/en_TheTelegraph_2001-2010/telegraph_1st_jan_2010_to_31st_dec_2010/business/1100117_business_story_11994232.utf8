          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          President Pratibha Patil with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and RBI governor D. Subbarao (right) in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 16: RBI governor D. Subbarao today met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, ahead of the monetary policy review later this month.        
	The RBI governor reportedly discussed the impact of inflation on economic growth and the need for monetary tightening, if any, sources said.        
	Analysts expect a marginal hike in key policy rates as inflation is turning out to be a bigger challenge than sustaining growth.         
	Subbarao, however, refused to reply to reporters query on whether the rate of inflation (at 7.31 per cent in December) had breached RBIs comfort zone. The RBI had projected inflation to reach 6.5 per cent by March-end.        
	Inflation jumped to 7.31 per cent in December from just 4.78 per cent a month ago on higher food prices, raising the possibility of an RBI clampdown on an easy credit regime. The RBI is scheduled to review its monetary policy on January 29.         
	Earlier this week, China had increased reserve requirements for banks as a faster global recovery had prompted policy makers to exit monetary stimulus.        
	Economists said a rate hike would set back the recovery process, but if the RBI did raise rates, it would be to prevent the rise in food prices from spilling over to other sectors and to dampen inflationary expectations.        
	Given the risk of excess liquidity nudging up asset and general prices, we expect the RBI to begin withdrawing liquidity through the cash reserve ratio and to hike interest rates gradually Food inflation is rapidly becoming the key policy challenge as the purchasing power of poor households is being eroded, Tushar Poddar, economist with Goldman Sachs said.        
	With recovery gaining pace and inflation in the uncomfortable zone, there is little doubt that we will soon see an interest rate hike. But timing the rate hike in todays scenario is a major challenge. If you raise rates too soon, you risk jeopardising the recovery that has just begun, and if you do it too late, you risk inflation, said D.K. Joshi, economist at Crisil.        
	Bankers had earlier asked the RBI to hold rates as any hike in interest rate would result in a slump in credit growth.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 24: The auction of wireless broadband spectrum, which started today, is expected to fetch over Rs 15,000 crore for the government, according to telecom minister A. Raja.        
	All the 11 qualified bidders  Bharti Airtel, Reliance, Idea, Aircel, Augere Mauritius, Infotel Broadband Services, Qualcomm, Spice Internet Service Provider, Tata Communications Internet Services, Tikona Digital Networks and Vodafone Essar  put in their bids.        
	After five rounds of bidding, Delhi, Mumbai and category A circles such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu showed a 45 per cent increase over the base price of Rs 160 crore to reach Rs 232.96 crore.        
	The reserve price for broadband at Rs 1,750 crore for all the 22 circles is half that of 3G spectrum. The bidding is expected to be intense as there are just two slots to be won among 11 players, unlike 3G that had three slots for nine bidders.        
	India has just 8 million broadband connections compared with around 600 million phone connections.

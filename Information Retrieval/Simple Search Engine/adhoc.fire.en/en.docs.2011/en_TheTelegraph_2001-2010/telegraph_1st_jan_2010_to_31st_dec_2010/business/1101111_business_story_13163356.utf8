	New Delhi, Nov. 10: Passenger car sales jumped 37.99 per cent to 1,82,992 units in October from 1,32,615 units in the same month last year, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).        
	This is for the fifth consecutive month that we are seeing record sales in cars. We see festive season demand spilling over to November, Siam director-general Vishnu Mathur said.        
	Overall auto sales continued to break the record for the fourth consecutive month in October, with Siam stating that 14,60,655 vehicles were sold in the country.        
	According to Siam, the record numbers were driven by best monthly sales not only in cars but also motorcycles and two-wheelers.         
	Total sales in September stood at 13,29,086 units.         
	Total vehicles sold in October grew 45.93 per cent from 10,00,953 units in the same month last year.        
	Demand was good because of the festive season. Basic fundamentals of the industry remain strong. Interest rates continue to be favourable despite a marginal increase and there is a strong availability of financing, Mathur said. Launches have also helped to increase excitement in the market and create demand, he added.        
	Motorcycle sales of 8,76,810 units, up 43.31 per cent from 6,11,828 units in the same month last year, reached a new peak. The previous high of 7,78,352 units was achieved in September.

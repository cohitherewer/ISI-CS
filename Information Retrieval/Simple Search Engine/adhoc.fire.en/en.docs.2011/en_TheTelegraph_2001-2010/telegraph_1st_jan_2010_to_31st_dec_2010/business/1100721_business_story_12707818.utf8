The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cash chase hint in Fortis share pledge
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cash chase hint in Fortis share pledge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 20: Fortis Healthcare Ltd, which is locked in a bruising battle with Malaysian fund Khazanah to gain control of Singapore-based Parkway Holdings Ltd, today announced that its promoter firm  Fortis Healthcare Holdings Ltd (FHHL)  had pledged a 37.78 per cent stake in the company.         
	The development sparked speculation that the pledge of shares may have been made to raise funds for the Parkway acquisition.        
	In a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange, Fortis Healthcare said its holding firm had pledged 3.3 crore shares on July 9, taking the total number of pledged shares to 15.3 crore, which is 37.78 per cent of the total outstanding shares of the firm.         
	However, Fortis did not specify how much money it had raised. Incidentally, the latest pledging comes just two days after FHHL had revoked 56 lakh shares.        
	In March this year, Fortis had acquired a 25 per cent stake in Parkway Holdings Ltd, from TPG Capital. In the following month, Khazanah Nasional, which holds little over 24 per cent, made an offer to increase its stake in Parkway to 51.5 per cent at a price of S$3.78 per share.        
	Parkway has a network of 16 hospitals having 3,400 beds spread over six countries in Asia, including India.        
	Early this month, Fortis upped the ante when it announced an offer to acquire the remaining shares (around 75 per cent) in Parkway at a higher price of S$3.80 apiece. This marked a slight premium to the offer made by the Malaysian fund. Khazanah is likely to revise its bid shortly.         
	Fortis is understood to have roped in a consortium of banks led by Axis Bank to fund its offer that will close on August 12.         
	Reports say the consortium will include around 10 banks. Analysts estimate that Fortis will need around Rs 11,000 crore to fund the acquisition.         
	In its offer letter, Fortis had indicated plans of a merger between Parkway and the company.

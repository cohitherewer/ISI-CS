	Calcutta, June 9: Andrew Yule has entered the high-margin premium tea segment with the launch of three variants today.        
	The company, which ranks among top five tea producers by production capacity, launched organic, green and limited edition designer tea.        
	Sushil Munshi, chief executive of the tea division, said the new products would be sold at a premium and add to the bottomline, making up for the small volume.        
	Yule produced 11 million kg from 15 gardens spread across Assam, the Dooars and Darjeeling.         
	Its sale of specialty tea was a meagre 4,000 kg. The company expected to sell 15,000 kg this year.        
	Yule is in the process of tying up with a retail chain to distribute the premium tea. It is also talking to a pharmacy chain.        
	The tea division contributed Rs 135 crore to the turnover of Yule.

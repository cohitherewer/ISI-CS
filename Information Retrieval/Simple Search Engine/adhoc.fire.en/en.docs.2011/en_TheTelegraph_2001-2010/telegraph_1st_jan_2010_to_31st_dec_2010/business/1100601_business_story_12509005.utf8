          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, May 31: Adhunik Metaliks Ltd has acquired a 50 per cent economic interest in an iron ore mine in Orissa for an undisclosed sum.        
	The Suleipat mine, located in Mayurbhang district, has reserves of 80 million tonnes (mt) of medium-to-high-grade ore.        
	The company hopes to start mining within 18-24 months.         
	We will invest around Rs 150 crore, including the acquisition cost, an Adhunik official said.        
	The acquisition was carried out by Adhuniks wholly owned subsidiary Orissa Manganese and Mining Ltd.        
	According to the agreement, Orissa Manganese and Mining will mine and sell the produce and retain 50 per cent of the proceeds.        
	A joint venture company will be formed with the existing owner to execute the project aimed at producing 1.5mt ore annually.        
	The official said Adhuniks strategy would be to consolidate the steel business and grow in mining and power.         
	Adhunik has capacity to produce 450,000 tonnes of steel, half of which is special grade catering to auto, power, and oil and gas.         
	The company will not invest in steel in the next two to three years.         
	However, it plans to step up captive power generation capacity by 45 mega watt (MW), up from 35MW.         
	The steel business is located in Rourkela.        
	Plans for subsidiary        
	Adhunik also plans to increase Orissa Manganese and Minings capacity to 2.5mt and set up a 1mt pellet plant to use fines.        
	Last year, it produced 1.1mt ore and targets to increase it to 1.5mt this year.        
	The initial public offer plan for Orissa Manganese has been put on the backburnert. We intend to grow the firm before taking it to the public, the official said.         
	Adhunik has posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 58.59 crore for the quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 2.82 crore during the year-ago period.         
	Consolidated net sales rose to Rs 442.93 crore from Rs 287.52 crore in the same period a year ago.

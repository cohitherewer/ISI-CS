          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Priority check                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: Operators can start 3G services only if they are in a position to offer number portability, the government has said.        
	The department of telecom wants to meet the October 31 deadline for number portability, which allows customers to retain their mobile numbers while changing service providers. All operators need to upgrade their networks to accommodate portability.        
	It has been decided that permission to launch commercial service in any area with effect from September 1, 2010 shall be given to only those licensee(s) who are MNP compliant, said a DoT note.        
	Mobile service providers  Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Reliance, Tata Tele, Idea, STel and Aircel  are getting ready to launch high-speed 3G services from next month, for which they have paid over Rs 50,000 crore as spectrum fees.         
	State-owned BSNL and MTNL have already started 3G services.        
	All existing mobile service providers, national and international long distance operators, who have permission to launch commercial services, also must move to the MNP platform, the DoT said.        
	Since MNP creates genuine competitive pressures, its biggest upside is a marked improvement in the quality of service.         
	Analysts said it could also marginally reduce tariff in areas such as international roaming and value-added services where there was insufficient competition.         
	Telecom regulator Trai has recently written to the DoT about the lack of action from state-run BSNL and MTNL that may lead to a further delay in the implementation of portability.        
	According to Trai, the latest status report on MNP showed that all the service providers were at various stages of testing, except for BSNL and MTNL.         
	BSNL is yet to start testing as its MNP gateway is not ready, while MTNL is still in the process of placing the purchase order.         
	Industry sources said some new operators were also far away from putting in place the required infrastructure and testing equipment.        
	According to the DoTs note, For the purpose of being MNP compliant, it may be ensured that the inter-operator test for porting as well as call scenario test has been completed.        
	MNP was to have been implemented in 2009, but had met with severe resistance from operators.         
	More recently, the deadline for its implementation was shifted first to March 31, then to June 30 and later to October 31.         
	Besides, the home ministry has security issues with Telcordia  one of the two US-based firms selected to manage portability.         
	Syniverse Technologies is the other firm that would provide portability services.        
	The country is divided into two zones of 11 circles each for the implementation of MNP, and all operators need to interconnect their networks with the two MNP operators.        
	Mobile number portability has been implemented in Hong Kong, the UK, Australia, the US, Germany, France, Singapore and Pakistan.

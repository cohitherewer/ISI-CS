                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Electrosteel arm mulls IPO
          SAMBIT SAHA                          In the pipeline                                  
	Calcutta, March 7: City-based Electrosteel Integrated Ltd aims to raise about Rs 400 crore through an initial public offer, for which it plans to file a draft red herring prospectus by the end of this month.        
	The company, which is nearing the completion of a greenfield plant in Jharkhand, is promoted by Electrosteel Castings Ltd (ECL)  majority owned by the Kejriwal family  which is the largest ductile iron pipe maker in the country.        
	Uddhav Kejriwal, a director of ECL, said he expected the new facility to be operational by the end of this year. We will hit the market ahead of that, he said.        
	The EIL project envisages an investment of Rs 7,262 crore with an equity component of Rs 1,815 crore.        
	Electrosteel Castings has put in about Rs 700 crore as equity. The UK-based metal group Stemcor has invested Rs 400 crore. Along with the contribution from individual investors and private equity players, EIL has so far raised Rs 1,646 crore.        
	The gap of about Rs 170 crore will be met by the IPO, while another Rs 230 crore from the float will be used for general corporate purposes.        
	EIL has already arranged loans worth Rs 5,447 crore from 29 financial institutions, which include Hudco and the LIC. The company had managed to complete the financial closure in mid-2009, when very few steel or manufacturing firms could do that.        
	The plant, coming up in Bokaro, will manufacture 1.2 million tonnes of wire rod and rebar, 0.7 million tonne of billet and 0.3 million tonne of ductile iron pipe. Electrosteel Castings will supply coal and iron ore to EIL, thereby reducing costs.        
	Electrosteel Castings has got a coking coal mine at Parbatpur in Jharkhand, which has reserves of about 230 million tonnes. It has also got allotment of an iron ore mine at Kodolibad having reserves of around 91 million tonnes.         
	The ore is said to have a ferrous content of 65 per cent.        
	The company may start the production of coal during the next fiscal.         
	The parent company has undertaken a Rs 1,200-crore investment plan, which includes developing coal and iron ore mines, building a railway siding and setting up a 12 mega watt power plant.

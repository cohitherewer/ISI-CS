          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Vasant Mehta in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 16: Gems and jewellery items have posted a robust 16 per cent growth in exports at $28 billion in 2009-10 on the back of a revival in demand in the US and Europe. Exports stood at $24.49 billion a year ago.         
	After undergoing a challenging time in 2008-09, the Indian gems and jewellery sector rose like a phoenix because of our constant endeavour to sustain trade relations with the US and also expansion by penetrating other markets, Vasant Mehta, chairman of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said.         
	The sector expects to grow at least 10 per cent this fiscal and is lobbying the government to restore a 2 per cent interest subvention, create a special dollar reserve of $3-4 billion and negotiate with Brazil, Russia and China to reduce import duties.        
	Mehta said the industrys decision to stop the import of raw diamond for a month and cut jobs had helped it to survive the crisis.        
	Export of cut and polished diamonds increased 20.11 per cent to $17.54 billion in 2009-10 from $14.6 billion a year ago. Exports of coloured gems stones grew 10.55 per cent to $286.65 million from $259.29 million in the previous fiscal, while gold jewellery export rose 9.38 per cent to $9.42 billion from $8.61 billion in 2008-09.

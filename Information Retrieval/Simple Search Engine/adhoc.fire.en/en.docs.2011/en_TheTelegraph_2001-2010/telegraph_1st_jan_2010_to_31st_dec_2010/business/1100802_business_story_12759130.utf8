          SOUNAK MITRA                          Seeds of growth                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: Diversified agri-business company Godrej Agrovet Ltd is exploring acquisitions in micro irrigation, dairy and seeds. The company plans to finalise at least one deal in the next three to four months.        
	These are the markets we are planning to enter very soon. Acquisitions will be the most preferable route to make an entry. We may also go for greenfield ventures if we do not find feasible buyout options, Balram Yadav, managing director of Godrej Agrovet, told The Telegraph.         
	The company is yet to set aside a war chest for the acquisitions. Funds will not be a concern for us. We are waiting for the right deal, Yadav said.         
	The company has appointed separate advisers for the different sectors.        
	Godrej Agrovet will invest up to Rs 60 crore in each greenfield project in micro irrigation, while buying out a mid-sized firm will cost about Rs 100 crore.        
	In the seeds and corn seeds area, we are conducting commercial trials with two companies based in south India. If satisfied with the trials, we are likely to go for acquisitions, Yadav said. However, these would be technology buyouts or tie-ups, he added.        
	In Bengal and Bihar, the company will invest Rs 60 crore to set up animal feed mills. These mills will come up in one year. We will require five to six acres for the mills, Yadav said. The company spent around Rs 40 crore to set up a feed mill near Lucknow and Varanasi and it has acquired one in Bhubaneswar.         
	Godrej Agrovet expects a 15 per cent jump in its topline and a 25 per cent growth in profit in the current fiscal (2010-11).         
	The company had reported a turnover of over Rs 1,600 crore in the last fiscal.         
	In its oil palm business, Yadav said the company aimed to triple its topline over the next five years.

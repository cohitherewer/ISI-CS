                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      DLF seeks to revive Bengal infotech SEZ
                              New beginning                            
	New Delhi, May 25 (PTI): Realty major DLF has approached the government to reclaim its infotech SEZ in Calcutta, which it had surrendered last year.        
	Now, the developer (DLF) has requested for rescinding the notification de-notifying the SEZ stating that the demand for IT/ITES leasing space is showing signs of improvement, an official said here today.        
	The sector-specific unit for IT and ITeS services at Rajarhat, Calcutta, was over an area of 10.48 hectares and notified on June 23, 2008.         
	In 2009, DLF surrendered the SEZ and applied for denotification, which was taken up by the Board of Approval on June 2, 2009. The SEZ was finally denotified on February 23 this year.        
	The inter-ministerial Board of Approval (BoA) will take up the case at its next meeting scheduled for June 8, the official said.        
	Meanwhile, two developers  NSL SEZ and Bata India  want to surrender their projects.        
	Besides, as many as 32 developers, including Reliance Haryana SEZ of Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Limited, Indiabulls, Unitech and TCS, have sought more time.        
	Five applications for new projects are likely to come up before the BoA headed by commerce secretary Rahul Khullar.        
	The new applicants include Hindalco Industries, Sealand Ports and L amp;T. Hindalco wants to set up a sector-specific tax-free enclave for aluminium in Madhya Pradesh, and L amp;T proposes to set up a new IT zone in Karnataka. Sealand Ports is seeking permission for a multi-product SEZ in Gujarat.        
	Reliance Haryana SEZ wants an extension of the formal approval beyond June 20 for setting up a zone in Gurgaon.        
	The Navi Mumbai SEZ, promoted by RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani and his close aide Anand Jain has also sought more time.

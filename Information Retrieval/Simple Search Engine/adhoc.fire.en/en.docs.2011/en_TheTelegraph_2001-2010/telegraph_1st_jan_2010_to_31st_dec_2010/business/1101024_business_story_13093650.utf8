          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: Indian Telephone Industries (ITI) Limited, a loss-making PSU telecom equipment maker, expects to get orders worth Rs 2,800 crore over the next six months, including 30 per cent of BSNL and MTNLs orders.        
	The government had recently directed BSNL and MTNL to continue giving 30 per cent of their mobile equipment orders to ITI for two more years to keep the Bangalore-based ailing equipment vendor afloat.         
	The extension of the quota policy would be applicable for products manufactured by ITI and on turnkey projects, including telecom network rollout.        
	Contracts from BSNL and MTNL account for 70 per cent of ITIs revenue.         
	The government has also asked BSNL and MTNL to give 70 per cent advance payment against the orders placed with ITI so that the company does not face the problem of working capital for the execution of the orders.        
	ITI had outstanding orders worth Rs 2,515 crore as on September 1, 2010. Once the sole telecom equipment maker in India, ITI has been struggling to get new orders and generate revenue as global mobile equipment vendors captured the Indian telecom market with the latest technology and low-cost products.        
	Accumulated losses of the equipment maker stood at Rs 3,513 crore as on March 31, 2010.         
	Analysts said ITI has been posting losses for the past several years because of high overhead costs.

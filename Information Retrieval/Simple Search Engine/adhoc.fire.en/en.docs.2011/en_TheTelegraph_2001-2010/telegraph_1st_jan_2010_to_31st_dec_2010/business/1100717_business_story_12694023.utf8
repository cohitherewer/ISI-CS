The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nano set to get dearer by 4 per cent
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Nano set to get dearer by 4 per cent
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Higher price                          
	Mumbai, July 16: Tata Motors will raise the price of the Nano by 3-4 per cent with immediate effect for new customers.         
	However, the first one lakh customers, chosen on the basis of a lottery, will get their cars for Rs 1 lakh (ex showroom price).         
	Of the initial one lakh customers, 45,129 have received their Nanos till June.        
	Prospective buyers who missed out on the lottery but had retained their bookings would have to shell out more. Despite a steep increase in input prices, their Tata Nanos are being priced only three to four per cent higher, depending on the model, than the price announced at the launch, the company said in a statement.        
	The retainee-customers have received interests on their deposits, the company said. The retainees were offered 8.5 per cent interest on the booking amount if the car was delivered within two years from the date of allotment and 8.75 per cent if the car was delivered after two years.        
	With the Sanand plant in Gujarat, which will make 2.5 lakh Nanos per year, becoming operational ahead of schedule, the company will ramp up production of the car.         
	This is the final step before the company opens up sales of the Tata Nano, the statement said.        
	While construction work was on at Sanand, the company manufactured the car at its Pantnagar facility.        
	Increasing input costs, especially that of steel and rubber, have put pressure on the margins of auto companies.         
	Ashok Leyland, Hero Honda, Bajaj Auto and General Motors have announced price hikes, while Tata Motors has raised the prices of its commercial vehicles.        
	Firms such as Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Kirloskar are also evaluating their options.

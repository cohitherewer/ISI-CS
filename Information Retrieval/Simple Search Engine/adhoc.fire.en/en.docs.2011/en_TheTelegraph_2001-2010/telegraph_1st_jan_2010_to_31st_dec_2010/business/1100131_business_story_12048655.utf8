The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coal India faces selloff cap
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Coal India faces selloff cap
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: The government may divest only a 10 per cent stake in Coal India Ltd (CIL) against the earlier planned 15 per cent as regulatory provisions bar the company from reserving shares for employees.        
	We may only divest a 10 per cent stake. We would not be able to reserve about 2 per cent shares for the employees. Under Sebi rules, you cant give shares to subsidiaries. If you cant give it to them, there is no point, Partha S. Bhattacharyya, chairman and managing director of CIL, said on the sidelines of a CII summit here today.        
	The company also plans to divest an additional 3 per cent in the second phase; proceeds from the selloff will be given to the people whose land has been acquired for mining.        
	The 3 per cent stake we were looking to sell over and above the planned 10 per cent could now happen only in the second tranche, Bhattacharyya added.        
	While coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal had said around 10-15 per cent of the governments stake could be up for sale next fiscal, company officials were keen on a 15 per cent divestment.        
	A delegation, comprising senior officials from CIL, the coal ministry and the department of divestment, is expected to meet Sebi early next month to consider the divestment proposal.        
	The company expects to get cabinet approval by August, paving way for the initial public offer in the next financial year.

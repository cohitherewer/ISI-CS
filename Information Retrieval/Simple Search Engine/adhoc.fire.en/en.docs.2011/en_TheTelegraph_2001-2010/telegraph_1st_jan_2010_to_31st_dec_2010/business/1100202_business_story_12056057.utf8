The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Union Bank links cash course to budget
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Union Bank links cash course to budget
          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                          Nair: Money matters                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 1: The Union Bank of India will review its fund-raising plan after the Union budget.        
	We want to get a clear idea from the budget to know from which sector growth will come and accordingly firm up our fund-raising plan, chairman and managing director M.V. Nair said after opening a branch at Jangipur, Murshidabad, on Sunday.         
	At the end of December 2009, the bank had a capital adequacy ratio of 13.76 per cent and the tier-I capital (equity capital plus reserves) stood at 8.7 per cent. The bank is keen on maintaining its tier-I capital above 8 per cent.        
	This means a large part of the additional capital requirement will have to be funded through the equity route. However, the government holding of 55.43 per cent doesnt provide enough room for a second public issue of fresh equity shares. There have been reports of the bank considering a rights issue.         
	Bad loan watch        
	The Union Bank is likely to get the governments recapitalisation support. The bank has seen a surge in non-performing assets in the third quarter of the current financial year.         
	Till December, we witnessed a 5 per cent slippage in our Rs 4,700-crore restructured loan, Nair said, adding that bad loans can rise in the next two quarters. But we hope to maintain our gross NPA level below 2 per cent by the end of this financial year.        
	The growth in NPAs of banks is much higher than the growth in advances in the current financial year. But the rise in bad assets is much less than the 5 per cent estimated by credit rating agencies.        
	With no gains from treasury operations immediately, a 0.75 percentage point hike in the cash reserve ratio by the Reserve Bank will put pressure on bank margins, Nair said.        
	Mutual foray        
	The Union Bank expects to start its mutual fund business from May. The bank has tied up with KBC International of Belgium for the venture.        
	KBC International holds a 49 per cent stake in the mutual fund joint venture and we own a 51 per cent. The mutual fund will start operations hopefully from May this year, Nair said. Last year, the bank had entered the life insurance business.        
	Nair, who is also the chairman of the Indian Banks Association, said the National Payments Corporation of India was working on a project to introduce a high-power switch in the ATM payment system for efficient transfer of more data.         
	RTGS and NEFT transfers and cheque clearing systems will be integrated to this system so that all retail payments are brought on one platform and services are rendered 24x7 in the next four to five years, Nair said.         
	The National Payment Corporation was incorporated in December 2008 and promoted by nine banks, including the SBI and the Union Bank.

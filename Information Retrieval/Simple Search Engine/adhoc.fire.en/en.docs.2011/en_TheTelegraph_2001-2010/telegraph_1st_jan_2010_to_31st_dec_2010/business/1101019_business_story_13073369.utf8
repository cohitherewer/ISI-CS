	Mumbai, Oct. 18: Foreign institutional investors poured money into Coal India Ltds (CIL) initial public offering touted as the biggest-ever capital issue to hit the market  even as retail investors chose to sit on the sidelines and weigh their options.        
	At the end of the day, more than a third of the public issue was subscribed with qualified institutional bidders (QIBs) stumping up most of the bids.        
	Data available from the stock exchanges in the evening showed that against an issue size of over 63.16 crore shares, the IPO received bids for nearly 21.35 crore shares, showing a subscription of 0.34 times.        
	It was a sedate start for the coal monolith and was in sharp contrast to the mad scramble that the Reliance Power flotation triggered in January 2008  which ranks as the biggest maiden issue till date. The Reliance Power issue was sold out within a minute and had been oversubscribed 10.64 times at the end of the first day.         
	But those were heady days, just after the sensex had surged to 21000  and only a couple of weeks before a tremendous crash from which the market has only now started to recover. There was hype and euphoria surrounding the IPO of Reliance Power which was then the first mega power company to come out with an IPO and, more importantly, it came from the Anil Ambani stable, recalls Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS.        
	Kejriwal reckons that the CIL offering can see active interest from retail investors on Wednesday and Thursday. Most market pundits, including Kejriwal, believe investors should subscribe to the IPO which is well priced with enough room left for the stags to make a pile of cash when they flip the shares on listing.        
	One should subscribe to the black diamond for an auspicious start to Diwali, he says, adding that investors could look out for decent listing gains as well. CIL shares are expected to get listed on November 4, a day ahead of muhurat trading.        
	Market experts feel mutual funds, insurance companies and local financial institutions will start showing interest in the IPO tomorrow. Non-institutional investors are also expected to subscribe to the issue.        
	Data of bids submitted for the IPO on the NSE show that QIBs bid for 1,64,805,250 shares against 2,84,236,398 shares reserved for the category with FIIs bidding for 1,42,354,500 shares. In contrast, retail investors bid for only 1,55,69,000 shares against the 1,989,654,79 shares reserved.        
	The IPO will raise between Rs 14,200 crore and Rs 15,400 crore and, after the discount to retail investors, the amount is anywhere between Rs 13,909 crore and Rs 15,151 crore.         
	The price band for the issue has been fixed at Rs 225 to Rs 245 per share and retail investors are entitled to a 5 per cent discount on the issue price.        
	While many analysts have been recommending investors to subscribe, the CIL offering has had its impact on the secondary markets as investors have been selling other stocks to raise money so that they can invest in the IPO.        
	Seven in queue        
	Confident about the success of the CIL float, the department of divestment has lined up seven more issues this fiscal, reports our Calcutta bureau.        
	Smaller issues by Hindustan Copper, Power Grid Corporation, MOIL (formerly Manganese Ore India) and Shipping Corporation will hit the markets between November and December, said Sumit Bose, secretary at the department of divestment, who is in Calcutta for a roadshow of CIL along with company chairman and managing director Partha S. Bhattacharyya.         
	Larger floats by ONGC, Indian Oil Corporation and Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) will follow.        
	Bhattacharyya said Coal India had decided to allot the unsubscribed portion of its IPO reserved for employees to other categories of investors.        
	Meanwhile, SAIL has appointed six merchant bankers for the companys follow-on public offer and is in discussions with them to finalise the timeline of the float, which is expected to raise Rs 8,000 crore in the first phase.        
	SAIL chairman C.S. Verma is expecting to start the first phase in the middle of December. If the deadline is missed, the issue will take place in January-February.

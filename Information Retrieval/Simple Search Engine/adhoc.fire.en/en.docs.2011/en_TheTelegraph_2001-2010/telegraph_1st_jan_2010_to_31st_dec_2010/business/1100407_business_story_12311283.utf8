                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Persistent Systems sizzles on debut run
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 6: Software developer Persistent Systems today jumped 31.61 per cent to close at Rs 408 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on its debut trade.        
	After opening firm on the BSE, the scrip rallied to a high of Rs 448, a gain of 44.50 per cent over its issue price of Rs 310.        
	On the National Stock Exchange, the scrip closed at Rs 404.70, up 30.55 per cent. The company listed 4 crore shares on the bourses. On the volume front, over 2.41 crore shares changed hands on the two bourses.        
	The Pune-based firm had raised about Rs 168 crore last month through an initial public offer (IPO), which was subscribed 94 times.        
	Though the scrip finished the day on the higher side, the close was a tad short of what the grey markets had expected. However, market observers felt the share was unlikely to see a major drop in its value as investors remained confident of its business model.        
	Persistent Systems is promoted by first generation entrepreneurs Anand Deshpande and S. P. Deshpande.        
	Speaking at the listing ceremony, managing director Anand Deshpande said the company was targeting a revenue of Rs 675 crore from both the domestic and overseas markets.         
	We will use part of the proceeds to establish development facilities in Pune and Nagpur and to procure hardware, Deshpande told reporters here.        
	The company also plans to use the proceeds to capitalise its subsidiaries, he said.        
	Upbeat about the companys prospects, Deshpande said they would maintain a steady growth.        
	We will continue to maintain our growth of at least 20-25 per cent in the years ahead, he said.        
	The company plans to increase its headcount to 4,900 from the present 4,600 by the end of fiscal 2010-11. We will be hiring at least 300 professionals for our domestic offices by the end of this fiscal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dubai to present debt plan 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Dubai to present debt plan 
                            
	Dubai, March 23 (Reuters): Dubai World will present plans to restructure its $26-billion debt pile to creditors this week, with details emerging as soon as Wednesday, sources said.        
	The plan on how the Gulf Arab emirate plans to repay its commitments will be discussed with an informal committee, which represents 97 creditors to the state-owned conglomerate, in Dubai, the sources said.        
	State-owned Dubai World, which has ringfenced key assets such as ports operator DP World from the restructuring, has been in talks with a panel made up of seven banks.        
	A final proposal could involve tranches with different repayment profiles, one with repayment over three to five years with the principal discounted, and one with repayment over seven to nine years with no discount. Support from Abu Dhabi has been seen as a key component of any Dubai offer and would likely determine how good or bad a final proposal would be.         
	A Dubai government spokesperson said meetings with the core creditor committee, known as CoCom, were part of an ongoing dialogue on the restructuring process.

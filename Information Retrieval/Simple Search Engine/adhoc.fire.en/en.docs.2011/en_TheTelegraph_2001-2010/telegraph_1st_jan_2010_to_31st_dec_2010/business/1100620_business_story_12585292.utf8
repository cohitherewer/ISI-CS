The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Insurance watchdog to control Ulips

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 19: The government today brought the curtain down on the controversy over unit linked insurance products (Ulips), ruling that such schemes would be monitored by the insurance regulator.        
	Life insurance business shall include any Ulip or any such instruments. This would set at rest all the issues regarding Ulips between the two financial regulators, the government said in a statement after promulgating an ordinance to make the necessary changes in the law.        
	The ordinance, which was promulgated last evening, amended the RBI Act 1934, the Insurance Act 1938, the Sebi Act 1992 and the Securities Contract Regulations Act 1956.        
	A tussle over the control of Ulips broke out in April when the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) banned 14 life insurers from issuing fresh Ulips. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) immediately reacted and asked the insurers to ignore the Sebi order.        
	The matter went to the finance ministry, which asked them to maintain status quo and seek legal advice.        
	Ulips account for more than 50 per cent of the life insurance business and part of the money collected is invested in equities.         
	In its April order, Sebi had indicated that new Ulips issued after April 9 would be under its regulation.        
	Insurers had been accused of giving up to 40 per cent commission on first years sale of Ulips to garner large number of buyers. According to critics, this sometimes leads to mis-selling of the products.        
	To address this concern, the IRDA, in a circular dated April 27, asked insurers to declare commissions payable to agents/brokers upfront while selling Ulips.         
	Moreover, the insurance regulator recently capped surrender charges at 15 per cent, and extended the minimum term of these plans to five years.        
	Sources said these moves convinced the finance ministry that the IRDA should continue to manage Ulips.        
	The promulgation of the ordinance will allow insurers to go ahead with their stalled schemes.        
	High-level panel        
	The government has set up a high-level committee chaired by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to sort out all issues of jurisdiction regarding hybrid products. The committee will include the finance secretary, the financial services secretary and the heads of the RBI, IRDA, Sebi and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority.

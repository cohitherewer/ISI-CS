The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Excess spectrum rules set to change

	New Delhi, Dec. 19: Rules for additional 2G spectrum, beyond the 4.4 megahertz given to mobile firms to start services, are likely to change soon.        
	Sources said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), which is working on the pricing and allocation of additional radio waves, was studying the possibility of moving away from the subscriber-based criteria.        
	Depending on the actual need for radio waves in each circle, additional spectrum can be auctioned or linked to a specific rate. The regulator is studying all the possibilities, said sources.        
	Spectrum  radio waves over which mobile calls travel  is a scarce resource. According to the current norm, operators get 4.4MHz as start-up spectrum and subsequently additional 1.8 units, subject to meeting certain subscriber targets.         
	Trais recent data show that while mobile operators have reported 687.7 million subscribers at the end of September, only 70 per cent of the customers were found to be active users. Active users are subscribers who make calls or send text messages regularly.         
	Mobile operators count every SIM card issued to calculate the total subscriber base even if a connection is not in use for a certain period of time. Users who have taken lifetime pre-paid/post-paid cards but are not using the connection indefinitely are included into the count. Only non-lifetime subscribers not using the connection for 90 days are excluded.        
	Industry experts said the governments subscriber-linked criteria might be encouraging operators to continue updating inactive users in their customer base.        
	Recent investigations into the irregularities of getting licences and spectrum by new as well as existing companies is another reason why the regulator is thinking of delinking spectrum allocation from an operators subscriber base, said sources.        
	The telecom sector has been for years troubled by controversies over spectrum allocation and allegations of inflated customer base.         
	Companies such as Tata Teleservices have demanded that the telecom department should audit the subscriber base of operators to prevent any player from hoarding spectrum.         
	Dual-technology operators such as Reliance and Tata have alleged that GSM players were given additional air waves beyond the contracted limit of 6.2MHz without charging any market-linked fee, resulting in huge losses to the government.         
	The Comptroller amp; Auditor General of India, in its recent report, pointed out that allocations beyond the contracted limit to old GSM operators had caused a notional loss of Rs 37,000 crore to the exchequer.         
	Old GSM operators maintain that spectrum has been allocated on the basis of the subscriber base, which has been the official policy of the government since 2002.        
	Beyond the first chunk of 4.4MHz, spectrum is allocated on the basis of number of subscribers that an operator has. The rationale for this is to achieve a better utilisation of spectrum by allocating it to those who need the spectrum more because of a higher subscriber base, Marten Pieters, chief executive of Vodafone, had said in a recent statement.

	Calcutta, July 29: Berger Paints India is looking for buyout opportunities and planning to invest about Rs 400 crore in expansion over the next five years.        
	According to chairman K. S. Dhingra, the company is in talks with a local speciality paints maker for a possible acquisition. We have appointed Ernst amp; Young to advise on the deal, he said on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting here today.        
	The buyout talks have been going on for the last 7-8 months. The issue will be taken up at our next board meeting, Dhingra said.        
	Capacity boost        
	Berger plans to double the annual capacity to 500,000 tonnes from 250,000 tonnes over the next five years. In the pipeline are two greenfield plants in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra along with expansion of the existing units.        
	The company has acquired 50 acres at Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh to set up a 150,000-tonne water-based plant. The unit is expected to take off by 2012.        
	In Maharashtra, we are reviving our plan to set up a 50,000-tonne automotive paint plant at Pune with an investment of around Rs 100 crore, the chairman said. In 2008, the company shelved the proposed plant because of the slowdown in the auto sector.        
	The company expects a revenue growth of 18-20 per cent during 2010-11, managing director Subir Bose said. The rise in raw material prices may impact the companys margins, he added. In the last six months, raw material prices have increased 7-8 per cent.         
	According to Bose, Berger Paints is set to increase prices, for the third time this year, from August 1.         
	It had revised prices in May and July. Taking into account all these three hikes, the total increase in the prices would be around 7-8 per cent compared with March this year, he said.

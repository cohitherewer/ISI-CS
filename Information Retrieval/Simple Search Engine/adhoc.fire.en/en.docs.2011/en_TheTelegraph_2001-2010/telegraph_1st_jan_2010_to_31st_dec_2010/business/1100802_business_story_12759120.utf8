The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Logic for return of cap on royalty

	New Delhi, Aug. 1: India may reimpose the cap on royalty payments to foreigners if its revenues and the interests of local investors take a hit.        
	The Reserve Bank of India had recently removed the royalty cap  it was 5 per cent of sales  paying heed to complaints by local entities about MNCs unwilling to share the latest technology, or equipment, because of the restriction.        
	It is now being felt that in the absence of the cap, foreign companies might charge high royalty rates, lowering the profit margins as well as the taxes paid by their Indian arms.        
	For instance, if an American firm charges more as royalty from its Indian subsidiary, the net profit of the US multinational rises but the taxable profit of its Indian arm is reduced, eroding both the stock value and the tax mop-up.        
	Recently, Japans Suzuki hiked the royalty paid by its Indian subsidiary Maruti from an average 3.4 per cent of sales to 5.1 per cent. Maruti reported a 20 per cent drop in net profits in the first quarter ended June 30, which was blamed partly on the higher royalty expense, while the stock took a beating on the bourses.         
	Officials, however, say the hike is not huge as, globally, auto companies charge 3-8 per cent as royalty for technical know-how.        
	Several other MNCs are considering a rise in royalty rates, and the finance ministry is keeping a close watch.         
	Reduction in profits because of transfer of a part of the companys income through royalties and technical fees are a favourite tactic of MNCs worldwide. That is why the cap had been put in place. If we feel the decision to remove the cap is being abused, we will study the matter afresh, the officials said.         
	According to the officials, royalty paid by subsidiaries can be compared with that of independent entities to ascertain whether the payout is excessive.        
	MNCs usually dictate the royalty paid by their subsidiaries, but independent entities have a greater bargaining power and are able to set their rates.         
	Globally, software companies charge 15-25 per cent of sales as royalty, tool manufacturers 3-7 per cent, baby goods 5-7 per cent; while biotech firms charge as much as 50 per cent.         
	Usually new proprietary technologies attract higher royalties and older technologies have lower or even zero royalties. Sometimes to make a product popular or to keep its price low, the royalty rate is lowered, even made zero, said the officials.         
	Maruti case        
	Maruti is also involved in a tax dispute. The income tax department has raised objection to the deductions sought on advertising for promoting Suzukis S mark that replaced Marutis M mark. According to the tax authorities, Suzuki should have compensated its Indian subsidiary for the promotion.         
	A Delhi High Court ruling has, however, stated that the IT authorities took a mathematical approach to the case and the benefits of the brand promotion accrued more to Maruti.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 9: Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions today beat analysts estimates to post a 28 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profit, or earnings, on the back of a higher sales revenue.        
	The company reported a profit of $144 million, or 47 cents a share, during the fourth quarter, up from $112.3 million, or 38 cents apiece, a year ago.         
	Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings per share rose to 50 cents from 41 cents. Revenue rose 20 per cent to $902.7 million.         
	The company also outlined a strong outlook for the current year with a rebound in technology spending.         
	According to Cognizants forecast, it expects 2010 earnings to be $2.19 a share on a minimum $3.94 billion in revenue. First-quarter targets were set at 52 cents a share and $935 million in revenues.         
	Cognizant, which has most of its software-development centers in India, has seen sales grow. In November, the company had forecast earnings at about 45 cents a share and a revenue of at least $880 million.         
	During the fourth quarter, operating margins fell to 18.5 per cent from 18.9 per cent. Other expenses fell to $4.5 million from $12.3 million.        
	The investments we made in our business leave us in an even stronger position than when we entered 2009, Cognizant president and CEO Francisco DSouza said.         
	During the year, Cognizant hired more than 16,700 professionals worldwide.        
	We have strengthened our balance sheet in 2009 with our cash, short-and long-term investments increasing by over $210 million during the fourth quarter, and over $625 million for the full year, to a total of approximately $1.55 billion, said chief financial and operating officer Gordon Coburn.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Sept. 29: Shares of Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd today crashed 8.50 per cent on the BSE after Madras High Court ordered the closure of its copper smelter unit at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu.        
	Investors feared the order could lead to the unit closing down. On Tuesday, Madras High Court asked Sterlite to shut the 4-lakh-tonne copper smelter plant on the grounds of being close to an ecologically fragile area. The court said Sterlite had not developed a green belt around the unit.         
	Sterlite opened lower at Rs 172.90, slipped to a low of Rs 160.50 before settling at Rs 161.50, a drop of Rs 15, or 8.50 per cent over the previous close. Kamlesh Bagmar and Archit Singhal, analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher, said the development, which followed the Vedanta Aluminium debacle, had intensified the uncertainty surrounding the stock.         
	The environment ministry had rejected Vedantas bauxite-mining project in Orissa. Both Sterlite and Vedanta are Anil Agarwal-promoted firms.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                
	Mumbai, July 9: Infotech giant Infosys Technologies soared to a new 52-week high of Rs 2,882 and telecom stocks spiralled upwards as a bullish fervour started to build up in the stock markets ahead of the first quarter earnings season that kicks off next week.        
	Infosys rallied on expectations that it would report strong results and once again beat the guidance it gave out at the end of the January-March quarter. Analysts are expecting its numbers to reflect higher volumes and a steady pricing environment.         
	On the BSE, Infosys opened strong at Rs 2,832 and then raced to its 52-week peak before closing at Rs 2,871.90, a gain of 1.63 per cent, or Rs 46.15. Analysts expect Infosys to not only beat projections but also revise its full year guidance.        
	Mumbai-based brokerage Sharekhan expects the company to report net sales of Rs 6,213 crore and a net profit of Rs 1,542 crore. It said Infosys would raise its 2010-11 dollar-term revenue growth guidance of 16 to 18 per cent and the rupee EPS growth guidance as visibility on volume growth improves with the progress of the fiscal year.        
	Telecom cheer        
	The other big story on the bourses was the surge in telecom stocks, triggered by a Credit Suisse report which upgraded its rating for Bharti to an outperforming stock. It also expected Idea to outperform, while it upgraded its rating of Reliance Communications to neutral from underperform.        
	Credit Suisse is the second brokerage after Anand Rathi to upgrade Bharti and Idea.        
	Bharti jumped 9.7 per cent to close at Rs 308.10, and Idea vaulted 13.3 per cent to Rs 66.85. Both stocks gained the most since May 18 last year when the sensex soared 17 per cent on optimism triggered by the Congress biggest election victory in two decades.

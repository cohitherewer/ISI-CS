          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 4: The rupee ended higher by 14 paise to 44.22 against the American currency following the fresh selling of dollars by banks and exporters on the back of a weak dollar overseas amidst a strong equity market.        
	At the interbank foreign exchange (forex) market, the local currency opened higher at 44.26 per dollar against yesterdays closing of 44.36. It moved up further to 44.16 per dollar before ending at 44.22.        
	The dollar today hit an 11-month low against the basket of currencies in London after the US Federal Reserve launched a new bout of quantitative easing and investors chased currencies with higher yield.        
	Banks preferred to reduce their dollar position because of a weak dollar in the overseas market, along with the rise in equity markets on sustained capital inflows from foreign funds.        
	The rupee rise was mainly on account of hectic capital inflows. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pumped in over $26 billion in the current calender year.        
	Meanwhile, global crude oil was trading at $86 a barrel in London today.        
	The rupee premium for the forward dollar recovered on fresh paying pressure from banks and corporate houses. The benchmark six-month forward dollar premium payable in April finished higher at 134-136 paise from 129-131 paise on Wednesday.        
	The RBI has fixed the reference rate for the dollar at 44.32 and the euro at 62.59.        
	In cross-currency trade, the domestic unit rose against the pound sterling and the Japanese yen while declining against the euro.        
	The rupee moved up to 71.45 against the pound sterling from Wednesdays close of 71.54 and firmed up against the yen to 54.61 per 100 yen from 54.89 previously. It, however, declined further to Rs 62.88 per euro from its last close of 62.31.

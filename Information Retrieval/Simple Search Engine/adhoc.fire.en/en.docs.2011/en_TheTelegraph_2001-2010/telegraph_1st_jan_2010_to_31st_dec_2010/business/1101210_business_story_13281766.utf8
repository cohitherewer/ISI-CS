          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: The power sector will need an investment of $400 billion in the Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-17) to offer adequate and reliable supply at reasonable prices, minimise losses and set up transmission network, power secretary Uma Shankar said at an industry event.        
	The government has set a capacity addition target of 100,000 mega watt (MW) each during the twelfth and thirteenth five year plans. At present, power generation capacity stands at 167,000MW.         
	He said the government was planning huge capacity additions and an increase in transmission capacity. However, the sector has to deal with a lot of challenges such as timely supply of equipment, fuel availability and environment and forest clearances.         
	Coal continues to be the chief raw material, with thermal plants accounting for nearly 53 per cent of installed capacity. The demand for coal is likely to go up from 445 million tonnes (mt) during this fiscal to 532mt in the next and to 850mt by March 2012, he said.        
	The government will import 85mt coal in 2011-12 through MMTC and State Trading Corporation of India Ltd.         
	We are importing 46mt in 2010-11. It would rise to 85mt in 2011-12, he added.        
	Capacity addition in the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12) has fallen short of target. Against a plan panel estimate of 78,000MW, actual addition will be around 62,000MW.

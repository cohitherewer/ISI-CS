          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 30: Tech Mahindra has reported a 1.3 per cent fall in quarterly profit because of interest costs on borrowings to fund its acquisition of Satyam Computer Services.        
	Tech Mahindras net profit during the quarter ended March fell to Rs 227 crore from Rs 230 crore in the year-ago period.         
	According to the company, interest costs during the quarter stood at Rs 31.1 crore compared with Rs 2.3 crore a year ago. Revenues rose 12.6 per cent to Rs 1,183 crore.         
	This quarter saw us consolidate our position in complete end-to-end outsourcing. Our robust performance this quarter is a measure of our ability to understand customer needs and tailor solutions specific to these needs, chairman Anand Mahindra said.        
	The company board has proposed a dividend of Rs 3.5 per share on the face value of Rs 10 for 2009-10.        
	During the quarter the company added 3,120 personnel, taking its headcount to 33,524.        
	The Tech Mahindra scrip today closed at Rs 773.60 on the BSE, up 0.69 per cent from the previous close.         
	Tech Mahindra had bought scam-tainted Satyam in April last year and rebranded it Mahindra Satyam.                                       
	Tech Mahindra owns a majority stake in Mahindra Satyam, which has not been merged with its new parent so far, as its financials are being restated.

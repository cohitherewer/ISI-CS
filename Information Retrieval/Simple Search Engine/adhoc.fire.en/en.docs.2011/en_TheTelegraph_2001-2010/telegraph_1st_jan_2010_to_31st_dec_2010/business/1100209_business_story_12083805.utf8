          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 8: Canada plans to sign another trade agreement with India besides the proposed comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) later this year.        
	We expect to sign these trade agreements during Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Canada later this year, Joseph Caron, high commissioner of Canada in India, said here today.         
	Caron, who was speaking at the Merchants Chambers of Commerce, said the two-way trade between India and Canada was expected to touch $5 billion during 2009-10. Once the trade agreements are in place, this figure will increase many fold, he added. At present, a joint study group is finalising its report for the CEPA.        
	According to Caron, business collaborations in science and technology, environment, energy and security will help both the countries increase bilateral trade.         
	At present, there are trade ties between firms from India and Canada in information and communication technology, sustainable and alternative energy and environment technologies.

	Mumbai, Sept. 25: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) is planning to invest around Rs 50,000 crore over the next five years.         
	The money will be spent on power plants, expansion of refineries, exploration and production and distribution.        
	BPCL, which is planning to foray into power, is initially looking to set up a 500MW plant that is expected to come up after five years.         
	Though the power plan is at a preliminary stage as the company is yet to identify the plant site or the feedstock, around Rs 1,000 crore is likely to be invested in the project.         
	At a press meet on Friday, BPCL chairman and managing director S. Radhakrishnan said the foray into new revenue streams such as power was part of Project DreamPlan that would direct the companys aspirations over the next five years.         
	In refining, BPCL is looking to increase the capacity to over 40 million tonnes from 30.5 million tonnes. The plan is to add six million tonnes to its Kochi refinery, which now has a processing capacity of 9.5 million tonnes.         
	The capacity of the upcoming Bina refinery in Madhya Pradesh  that will be implemented by joint venture company Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd  will also be ramped up.         
	Commercial production at the 6-million-tonne Bina unit is expected to begin by next calendar year.         
	Oman Oil Company, BPCLs partner in the venture, has increased its stake in the project.        
	According to Radhakrishnan, BPCL will start work on capacity expansion at Bina from the middle of next year as the current six-million-tonne capacity will be inadequate to meet the demand from the region.        
	In exploration and production (E amp;P), BPCL has participating interests in 26 blocks and is present in seven countries, including India.         
	Two discoveries have been made in Brazil and Mozambique and the operator has initiated development plans there.         
	Exploration is now underway in other blocks where BPCLs exploration subsidiary Bharat PetroResources has participating interests. The company will invest over Rs 7,500 crore in E amp;P over the next few years.

	Calcutta, Aug. 19: Concerns over inflation are overblown to a great extent, new chief statistician T.C.A. Anant today said.         
	The rate of price rise will come down to a manageable level by the end of the year and the deregulation in petrol prices will have a dampening effect, Anant said at an event of the Bharat Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	According to Anant, inflation should be analysed by taking into consideration global and domestic economic trends.         
	While global commodity prices are stable, domestic growth is also not too high to cause overheating of the economy by increasing demand and pushing up the prices of commodities.        
	The countrys chief statistician expects inflation to fall below 7 per cent. An inflation rate of lower than 7 per cent generally doesnt attract much criticism, he added.        
	Food price        
	Food inflation declined by over a percentage point to 10.35 per cent during the week ended August 7 because of cheaper vegetables, especially potatoes and onions. Inflation in food items was 11.40 per cent in the previous week and 14.18 per cent a year ago.        
	We will continue to see weekly fluctuations. Although the monsoon has been good, in certain agricultural areas such as Satara in Maharashtra there have been supply disruptions because of floods, Axis Bank chief economist Saugata Bhattacharya said.

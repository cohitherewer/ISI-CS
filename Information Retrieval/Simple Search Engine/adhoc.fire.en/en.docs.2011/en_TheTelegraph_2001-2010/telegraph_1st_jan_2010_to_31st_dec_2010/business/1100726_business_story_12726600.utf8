          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 25: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is widely expected to raise key rates in its quarterly review on Tuesday, a move that may result in both deposit and lending rates inching up.        
	Most bankers and economists feel Duvvuri Subbarao, the RBI governor, will raise the repo and the reverse repo rates in a calibrated manner by 25 basis points each to tame inflation.         
	The central bank has raised the rates thrice this year, each time by 25 basis points. The repo rate, which is the rate at which the RBI provides money to banks, was increased to 5.50 per cent in July. Reverse repo  the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity against government securities  was raised to 4 per cent on that day.        
	Bankers expect the RBI to continue to follow a tight money policy with inflation hovering over 10 per cent for the last five months.         
	However, the hike will not be aggressive because of the uncertainty over global recovery and the tight liquidity in the banking system.        
	Arun Singh, senior economist with Dun amp; Bradstreet India (D amp;B), said, Containing inflationary expectation is likely to remain at the forefront of the RBI policy. D amp;B expects the RBI to hike repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points each in the first-quarter policy review. Inflation is likely to begin moderating from September-October as high base effect sets in. Although inflation is likely to witness some moderation, it will largely be a statistical phenomenon and inflationary pressures are likely to persist during the current financial year.        
	Ashutosh Datar, an economist at IIFL, said while inflation pressures had intensified, the growth outlook continued to remain strong. Notwithstanding the 50-basis-point hike in policy rates by the RBI this year and the tight liquidity conditions, lending rates have not gone up. We expect the RBI to continue its gradual normalisation of the monetary policy by hiking both the repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points.         
	Bankers point out that even a small hike in rates will nudge up both the deposit and lending rates. Given the tight liquidity now and the fact that it may last for some more time, a hike in repo and the reverse repo can see both deposit and lending rates going up. Deposit rates may be raised first, a senior PSU bank official said.        
	In March, over Rs 100,000 crore was flushed out of banks on account of advance tax outflows and money spent to buy 3G spectrum. Banks are borrowing Rs 50,000 crore every day from the RBIs special repo window.        
	Rupa Rege Nitsure, an economist with Bank of Baroda, is in favour of an aggressive policy. The baby steps taken by the RBI have not been effective so far in controlling inflation. It should go for a 50-basis-points hike in the repo and reverse repo rates, she told The Telegraph.

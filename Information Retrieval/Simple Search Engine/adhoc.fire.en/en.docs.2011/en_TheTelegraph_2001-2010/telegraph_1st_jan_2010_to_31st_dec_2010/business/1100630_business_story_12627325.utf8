The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Birla opening in Lodha stronghold
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Birla opening in Lodha stronghold
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, June 29: Shareholders owing allegiance to the Birla family have scooped up nearly 10 per cent voting rights in Birla Corporation, the flagship of the MP Birla group, now under the control of Harsh V. Lodha.        
	The voting pattern in the annual general meeting of Birla Corp today revealed that about 9.98 per cent shareholders opposed the resolutions (except the one pertaining to dividend) moved by the management under Lodha.        
	In the AGM last year, around 5.53 per cent shareholders had voted against the resolutions moved by Lodha, who is fighting a legal battle with the Birla family over the ownership of the MP Birla assets.        
	Various investment companies under Lodhas control own around 62.9 per cent stake in Birla Corporation.         
	The Birla family had moved the Company Law Board seeking a freeze on the voting rights of promoters holding but without any success.         
	Many investors who bought shares in the company in the last one year support our case, a Birla camp confidant said.        
	The case filed by the Birla Education Trust and various consenting shareholders at the CLB sought interim relief such as a freeze on promoters voting rights as well as the deferment of the AGM, which would have prevented Lodha from becoming a director and then the chairman of the company.        
	A freeze on promoters voting rights may throw up many possibilities, including a change in the management.         
	The 10 per cent holding of shareholders who support the Birlas could prove crucial at that point. But the CLB had declined to pass any such interim orders.         
	Birla Corp defence        
	Birla Corporation in the petition filed at the CLB mentioned that most of the consenting shareholders, representing 7.44 per cent of Birla Corps stake, bought shares in the company after the death of Rajendra Singh Lodha, father of Harsh Lodha, in October 2008.        
	Lodha was bequeathed the MP Birla estate through a disputed will of Priyamvada Birla executed in 1999. The senior Lodha became chairman of Birla Corp after Priyamvadas death, while Harsh was a director.         
	The Birla Corp counsel had questioned the logic of shareholders owing allegiance to the Birla family and with no trust in the Lodha management buying shares of the company.        
	Why are they buying into a company which is allegedly mismanaged and then voting against the management, said a Lodha camp confidant.

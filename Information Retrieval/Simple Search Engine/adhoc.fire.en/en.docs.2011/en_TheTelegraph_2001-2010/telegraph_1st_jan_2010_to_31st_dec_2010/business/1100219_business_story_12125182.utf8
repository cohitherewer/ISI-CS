The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court allows Dunlop to dematerialise shares
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Court allows Dunlop to dematerialise shares
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Taking stock				                                 
	Calcutta, Feb. 18: Delhi High Court today allowed tyre maker Dunlop to dematerialise 2.7 crore shares and trade them on the stock exchanges.         
	The shares were issued by the company in 2007 on a rights basis.         
	The development comes close on the heels of the resumption of trade in Dunlop shares on January 12 after an eight year hiatus. But the Bombay Stock Exchange did not allow trading in the shares issued on a rights basis.        
	Dunlop chairman Pawan K. Ruia expressed happiness over the order by Justice Sanjay Kishan and Justice Veena Birbal.        
	The stay was imposed by the high court in an interim order on November 7 following a special leave petition by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.         
	The Dunlop scrip today closed at Rs 97.40, down 4.97 per cent from the previous close. The stock has doubled in value since it resumed trading.        
	The rights issue was made by Dunlop to tide itself over a financial crisis, and the company was following an order of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).        
	The board also exempted the company from complying with Sebi regulations to reduce the time taken to complete the rights issue.        
	After the issue opened, the the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), which held an 8.29 per cent stake in Dunlop, filed a complaint with Sebi about not receiving the information on time. Sebi then asked Dunlop to extend the issue for 15 days, following which the LIC subscribed on terms similar with other shareholders.        
	However, the market regulator moved the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction against the BIFR order, and the matter went to court.        
	In their order today, Justices Kishan and Birbal said BIFRs order exempting the company from adhering to Sebi norms would not be treated as a binding precedent for future cases.        
	They also asked the Dunlop management to furnish several details to the market regulator.         
	The rights issue had helped the company to turn its net worth positive and come out of the purview of the BIFR and AAIFR.         
	The development comes at a time the company is stabilising its operations at Sahagunj and Ambattur.

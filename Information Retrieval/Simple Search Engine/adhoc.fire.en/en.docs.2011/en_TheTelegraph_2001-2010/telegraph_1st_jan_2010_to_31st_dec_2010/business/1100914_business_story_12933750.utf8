The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ABG gets Haldia signal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ABG gets Haldia signal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 13: Shipping major ABG has finally started operations in Haldia after the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) issued a final commissioning certificate to the company on Friday.        
	The company had received the letter of intent from the CPT in April last year and invested Rs 160 crore to install mechanised cargo handing facilities in two berths.        
	The company could not start operations in time  work was due from December  mainly because of rivalry between Left trade union Citu and workers backed by the Trinamul Congress.        
	The CPT also sat on the clearance that delayed the commissioning of the facility, which could increase productivity by 50 per cent.        
	ABG and its French partner LDA finally started operations after intervention by the Union shipping ministry and a nudge from Calcutta High Court.        
	The port stands to gain from the ABG facility as it will charge shippers Rs 210 per tonne of cargo, while paying ABG Rs 80.25 per tonne on berth 2 and Rs 69.05 per tonne on berth 8 to carry out operations using mobile harbour cranes.         
	ABG is expected to handle around 9 million tonnes of cargo (mainly import of coking/non coking coal) every year for 10 years.        
	Labour issues        
	Trouble began when ABG tried to recruit people through contractors. Contractors backed by the Left and the Trinamul both wanted to bag the deal. ABG then decided to induct people bypassing the contractors. The move irked both parties and they did not allow ABG dumpers to enter the dock area. The company did manage to bring 37 dumpers with protection from the Rapid Action Force following a court directive. It has taken some 400 people on its rolls.         
	ABG again went to court in July seeking a commissioning certificate from the CPT. The high court favoured ABG and asked the shipping ministry to do the needful. The ministry wrote to the port to issue the certificate.

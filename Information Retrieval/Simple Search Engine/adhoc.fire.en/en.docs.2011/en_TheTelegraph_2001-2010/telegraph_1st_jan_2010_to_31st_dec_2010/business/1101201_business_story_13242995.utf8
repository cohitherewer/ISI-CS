          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: Delhi High Court today said it would consider after a fortnight the plea of private airlines to stay the new ground handling policy of the government .        
	A two-judge bench of the high court, while declining to grant a stay as sought by the Federation of Indian Airlines, said it would consider whether to accept the petition or not after a fortnight.        
	Jet Airways, Kingfisher Airlines, SpiceJet, Indigo and GoAir have jointly filed a writ petition against a government policy to bar private carriers from ground handling at six airports  Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Calcutta.         
	Instead, they would have to hire national carrier Air India or independent agencies nominated by the airport operators.         
	Ground handling companies have been waiting for the change in policy to take effect from January. But private airlines have been lobbying hard against the policy.

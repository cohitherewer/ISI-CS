          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          In line of fire                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: The railways have been slack on safety and failed to utilise the funds on this count, the Comptroller and Auditor General said in a report tabled in Parliament today.        
	CAGs observations come at a time railway minister and Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee is facing a barrage of criticisms over her functioning; particularly after the collision in the early hours of July 19 between the Uttarbanga Express and Vananchal Express at Bengals Sainthia that left more than 60 dead.         
	At the receiving end of the audit cops ire is the railways corporate safety plan (2003-13), for which it had allotted Rs 31,835 crore. The plan was to be implemented in two phases  first phase by 2008, and the second by 2013.        
	However the railways have utilised only 65 per cent of the budget in most years. It has replaced 12.6 per cent of the faulty crossings, while it continues to use old locomotives. Besides, the report said, 20 per cent of wagons are overloaded.        
	The railways could not fully achieve the phase I target to provide improvement work at level crossings for road users, target for replacing over-aged locomotives, technological improvement on maintenance of tracks and bridges, the CAG said.        
	In April, junior rail minister E. Ahamed had said otherwise. Till the fiscal ended March 31, 2009, 75.05 per cent of safety-related works indicated in this corporate safety plan had been completed. The remaining is likely to be completed by end of the plan, he told the Lok Sabha.        
	One of the targets of the safety plan was to reduce the rate of accidents per million train kilometers to 0.17 from 0.44 by 2013. Another target was to reduce accidents attributed to human failure by 40 per cent.         
	However, during the four months of this fiscal, there have been 42 accidents, including two collisions and 22 derailments. This is marginally lower than 48 accidents during the year-ago period when there were two collisions and 26 derailments.        
	The report found that of the 1,252 level crossing to be replaced at an estimated cost of Rs 8,000 crore, only 152 have been replaced for Rs 1,050 crore.         
	Till 2006, Indian Railways had about 110,000 kms of tracks and operated about 11,000 passenger and goods trains. The rail network that serves more than six billion passengers every year has about 17,000 unmanned level crossings.

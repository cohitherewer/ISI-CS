	New Delhi, March 4: The government may consider lifting the ban on the exports of wheat and rice next week even as food inflation rose to 17.87 per cent during the third week of February.         
	Analysts said prices might rise further with truckers charging more after the hike in petrol and diesel prices. Truckers, who carry about 65 per cent of the goods in the country, have increased rates by as much as 15 per cent.        
	On an annual basis, prices of rice increased 10 per cent, wheat 14 per cent, pulses 35 per cent, onions 11 per cent and potatoes 28 per cent.        
	A group of ministers will meet next week to discuss the export status of wheat and rice.         
	The Centre has a stock of 206.23 lakh tonnes of wheat and 256.58 lakh tonnes of rice as on January 31. Farm minister Sharad Pawar said the country was all set to harvest another record quantity of wheat this year.

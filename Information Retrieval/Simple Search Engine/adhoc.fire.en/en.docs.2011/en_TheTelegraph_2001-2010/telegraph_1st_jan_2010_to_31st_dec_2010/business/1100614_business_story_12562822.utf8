The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal bid to retain steel project
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bengal bid to retain steel project
          SAMBIT SAHA      
	Calcutta, June 13: Faced with the grim possibility of losing out to Karnataka, the Bengal government has decided to go ahead with land acquisition for Bhushan Steels project at Salanpur near Asansol without waiting for a formal no-objection from Coal India Ltd.        
	Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen has directed the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) to begin the process of acquiring 2,500 acres after realigning a 350-acre plot according to CIL demand.        
	Bhushan had signed an agreement with Bengal in 2007 for a two-million-tonne (mt) steel plant, which was later enhanced to 6mt. Last week, the company had signed a similar deal with Karnataka where many of its local and global peers such as Tata and Mittal are zooming in.    
	Delhi-based Bhushan has made it clear that it will not be possible to build two plants of a similar size at one go as each will involve an investment of Rs 30,000 crore. If Karnataka moves ahead, it will be a curtain call in Bengal for many years.        
	Given the predicament, the state has decided to kick off the acquisition process though a joint committee, including the state and CIL officials, is yet to arrive at a consensus.        
	We cannot wait endlessly. I have told my officials to go ahead, Sen told The Telegraph.        
	The state government had initiated the land acquisition notification for 1,100 acres in the middle of 2008, but the same had lapsed after CIL objected to the states effort to put up the facility on coal-bearing land in March last year.            
	Bhushan had said they could make minor adjustments but could not relocate the project. Japans Sumitomo Metal is keen on participating in the venture because of its proximity to the highway, water source and coal mine.        
	The WBIDC will try to acquire land with a new realignment where around 350 acres are being adjusted. Sen said some minor adjustments could also be done when the land is finally acquired.            
	There are two villages within the identified area having around 1,500 people, and uncertainties exist on acquisition given the political turmoil in the state and the assembly elections next year.        
	The company is hoping that the government at least partly completes the process before the polls.        
	Top bosses of Bhushan Steel are understood to have met Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee in Delhi and sought her co-operation. She is believed to have given her approval on the condition that no farmland is taken for the project.        
	The land is largely arid. Besides giving cash compensation, the company is keen to build township for the displaced families with modern amenities, as it has done in Orissa.        
	The ground beneath Bhushans proposed land is believed to hold 150mt of coal but is outside of CILs leasehold area.        
	Many industries who have come up in the Asansol-Barakar region have bought land on their own. If Bhushan wants to buy land directly, none can stop it. The company has sought our help as it wants a large land parcel, Sen said.        
	The Bengal government is keen that scarce coal resource is left unutilised, Sen said, stressing the need to strike a balance between industry and mining.        
	Bhushan has been allotted a coal block in Bengal where its share is about 200mt. In Karnataka, it is hoping to get iron-ore mine allocation. The southern state has promised to give land in Bellary district soon.        
	We have to see which one kicks off first. But it is certain that we cannot do two similar projects simultaneously at two different locations, a company official said.        
	It will be worthwhile to see if the state government shows political will to save the project from being indefinitely delayed.

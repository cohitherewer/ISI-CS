The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Higher levy to make cigarettes dearer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Higher levy to make cigarettes dearer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 26: Cigarette prices are set for an unprecedented rise after the budget proposal of a steep hike in excise duty.        
	Tucked away in the fineprint of the finance bill, the FM has raised the effective tax incidence by as much as 18 per cent in some cases.        
	Except in two categories  cigarette length below 60 mm both in cases of filter and non-filter  prices of almost all other forms of tobacco have been increased.        
	There is no clarity if duties on bidi have been raised. Murshidabad, the district in Bengal FM represents in Parliament, is a strong base for the bidi industry.        
	However, there is hardly any ambiguity that cigarette prices are set to soar.        
	A spokesperson from ITC, Indias largest cigarette maker, said the company was studying the budget proposal and would decide on the pricing strategy.        
	Its a very steep increase, the spokesperson added, without quantifying any number.        
	Incidentally, ITC had increased prices of some of the top brands ahead of the budget. Packs of Gold Flake King, Classic, India Kings have been raised. However, prices of Filter Wills and Gold Flake regular have not been hiked.        
	The budget proposal clearly spelt bad news for the ITC stock, which crashed 6.17 per cent on a bullish Bombay market, which was up 1.08 per cent.         
	Analysts expect any increase between 5 per cent and 6 per cent can be absorbed by ITC or passed on to consumers. In the past, tobacco companies have generally been able to pass on the hike to consumers.        
	The steep hike came at a time ITC  which has close to 70 per cent market share  has been able to increase sales. FM in his budget speech also proposed some changes in the tax structures.         
	At present, cigars, cheroot and cigarillos attract ad valorem rate of basic excise duty and additional excise duty (health cess).                                       
	These rates are being replaced with an unified composite rate.        
	Excise duty on chewing tobacco, gudaku, jarda, snuff have also been increased among others.

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Money matters                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: The civil aviation ministry will push for a Rs 1200-crore infusion into ailing Air India later this month.        
	We will get the equity infusion through  the airline needs the money and everybody understands it, said civil aviation minister Praful Patel in an interview to The Telegraph.        
	The civil aviation minister has been urging the management to cut costs as the equity infusion will take place only if the airline makes enough efforts to turn around.         
	Air India received its first dollop of equity infusion of Rs 800 crore from the government last fiscal but has to further trim costs to receive the next tranche.        
	The management needs to speed up the integration process between Air India and the former Indian Airlines, return leased aircraft, redeploy staff to cut expenses and shut down overseas offices where Air India does not operate.        
	Civil aviation ministry sources said the Air India board was meeting this weekend to discuss financial restructuring and route planning amid allegations that the carrier was hiring high-cost employees while cutting costs on its existing staff.        
	The board may also discuss plans for Air India Express, the international low-cost arm of the state-run airline, to fly on domestic routes.         
	On the agenda are shifting the low-cost operators base from Mumbai to Kochi, rebranding the airline to take into account its domestic foray and improving fleet usage.        
	Domestic operations could start as early as next year. Air India Express would follow the model of successful low-cost airlines such as Indigo and SpiceJet.        
	It will be a no-frills airline, having online bookings and a dynamic ticket pricing system that would adjust prices to demand.        
	It would try to integrate AI Expresss international operations by giving connections to feeder cities.

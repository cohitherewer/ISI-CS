          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 29: State-run trading firm MMTC today announced a bonanza for its shareholders in the form of a dividend, bonus issue and stock split.        
	MMTCs board has proposed to split its equity shares of face value of Rs 10 each into Re 1 apiece.        
	The board has also approved the issue of bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1 along with the payment of a dividend of 90 per cent for 2009-10 on every share of a face value of Rs 10. The company will convene an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders on July 20 to seek approval for the proposals.         
	The MMTC scrip today closed at Rs 31,943 on the BSE, down 1.82 per cent.         
	The stock had hit a 52-week high of Rs 40,000 on December 14, 2009 and a low of Rs 25,600 on July 13, 2009.        
	The company has an equity capital of Rs 50 crore.         
	MMTC had announced a board meeting for a bonus issue and stock split on June 14. Since then, the stock had risen 14.06 per cent in 10 sessions to Rs 32,536.55 on Monday from Rs 28,525.15 on June 14.        
	The companys net profit rose 54.21 per cent to Rs 216.24 crore during 2009-10. Net income stood at Rs 45,124.19 crore.         
	The government, which owns a 99.33 per cent stake in MMTC, is considering divesting part of its stake this fiscal.        
	A Mumbai stockbroker said the stock split was a clear indication that a follow-on public offer was on its way.         
	They are trying to create a buzz of excitement before an FPO just as they have done with the stake sale at Engineers India Ltd, he said.         
	In March, EIL had announced a split in the face value of its shares into Rs 5 per share from Rs 10 per share and a bonus issue in the ratio of 2:1. The Centre is now divesting 10 per cent of its equity in the company through an FPO.

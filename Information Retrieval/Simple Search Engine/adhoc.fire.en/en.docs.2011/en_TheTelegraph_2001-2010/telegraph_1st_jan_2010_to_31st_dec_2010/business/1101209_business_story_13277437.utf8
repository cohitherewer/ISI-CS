The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mittals to spin off stainless steel wing
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mittals to spin off stainless steel wing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Strategic move                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 8: ArcelorMittal  the worlds largest steel maker  is going to spin off its stainless steel business into a separate company and list it on stock exchanges.        
	The shareholders will get one stock of the proposed stainless steel company for every 20 shares held, Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal said.         
	The new company will be listed on the Paris, Amsterdam and Luxembourg stock exchanges. The process is likely to take place in the first quarter of 2011. The decision follows the inability of steel makers to come together by combining stainless steel businesses to counter overcapacity.         
	Last year, rival ThyssenKrupp AG had abandoned consolidation plans as it could not get a favourable valuation.        
	The spin-off will generate a depreciation charge of about $800 million, representing the difference between the book value and the lower estimated market value, the company said. The stainless steel business will have around $1 billion as net financial debt.        
	The unit, with facilities in Belgium and Brazil, produced 1.59 million tonnes during January-September, with sales of $4.18 billion, representing 6.8 per cent of ArcelorMittals total revenue.         
	The division reported a $219-million operating profit against a loss of $172 million in the year-ago period.        
	ThyssenKrupps stainless unit had suffered a loss of 946 million euro ($1.2 billion) last year, the biggest among its divisions.        
	In July, ArcelorMittal chairman Lakshmi Mittal had said the group was confident of the future of the stainless business and believed that the creation of a separate company would create additional value for shareholders.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 10: Widex India, one of the key players in the digital hearing aids business, is lobbying with health insurance companies to bring hearing aids under insurance coverage in India.         
	We are in talks with the insurance companies and trying to make them understand the importance. There are many surgical equipment that are currently under insurance cover, T. S. Anand, managing director of Widex India, said here today.        
	According to Anand, hearing aid insurance is a must once the warranty period expires. Usually, hearing aids come with a one-year warranty. During this period, the user is insured against loss and damage. Some hearing aids may come with a warranty period of 2-3 years. Once the warranty period expires, it is the users responsibility to opt for a suitable policy.        
	However, it would take time to get insurance cover for hearing aids in India, he added.

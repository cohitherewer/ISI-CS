The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Microfinance gets moral support
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Microfinance gets moral support
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Subir Gokarn in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 7: Microfinance institutions may be under stress, but there is no threat to their survival as yet, Reserve Bank deputy governor Subir Gokarn said today.         
	Its a fact that MFIs are finding the going tough as banks are shying away from them. But they are not under threat, he added.        
	Keeping the recent developments in mind, the RBI has restricted the time frame for the submission of the Y.H. Malegam Committee report on MFIs to two months.        
	It is true that a longer time frame is needed to make the findings of the committee more comprehensive, but a balance has to be struck between the time frame and its comprehensiveness, he said.        
	The RBI appointed the Malegam committee in mid-November following a crackdown by Andhra Pradesh on MFIs. The Andhra government had received a number of complaints that MFIs operating in the state were charging high interest rates and indulging in aggressive loan recovery practices from overburdened borrowers.        
	The RBI regulates 45 MFIs, accounting for more than 80 per cent of total microfinance lending in the country, and Andhra Pradesh is the single largest market for MFIs in the country.         
	The Malegam committee is expected to submit its report by the middle of January.        
	The report will reflect the views of all stakeholders, Gokarn said.        
	According to him, microfinance institutions do constitute an important component of financial inclusion because they have got the last-mile reach. However, they will have to upgrade themselves and operate in a consistent way, he added.        
	Asked whether non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) would be allowed to act as business correspondents of commercial banks to achieve the financial inclusion target of the RBI and the government, Gokarn said there was a conflict of interest.        
	Since banks were engaging business correspondents for last-mile connectivity to extend their services, the NBFCs were also reaching out to the unbanked areas.         
	Here NBFCs are competitors to commercial banks. However, we have allowed for-profit companies to act as a business facilitator/business correspondent a few weeks back. This has widened the choices for banks to appoint their correspondents. But some bridges are yet to be built and these for-profit companies will have to come up with their business model (for business correspondents) and banks should engage in dialogue with them to evolve a financial inclusion model that is viable. Things have started to unfold, Gokarn said.        
	There is no commercially viable model available (for financial inclusion) and we are trying every possible way to facilitate this, he added.        
	Gokarn was present at a function where the United Bank of India adopted Chandokhali-Kumarhat, an unbanked village in South 24-Parganas, for 100 per cent financial inclusion.

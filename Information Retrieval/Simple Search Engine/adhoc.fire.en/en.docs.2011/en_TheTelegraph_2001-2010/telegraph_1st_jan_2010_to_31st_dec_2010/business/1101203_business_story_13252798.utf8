The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rolls shuns Airbus deal, turns its back on billions
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Rolls shuns Airbus deal, turns its back on billions
          DAVID ROBERTSON                          Engineering change                                   
	London, Dec. 2: Rolls-Royce could be squeezed out of an engine market worth up to half a trillion dollars over the next two decades after Airbus announced plans to upgrade its workhorse A320 aircraft.        
	Airbus said it would put new engines in the A320  the worlds best-selling passenger jet  to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by about 15 per cent. The move could give Airbus a significant competitive advantage over the Boeing 737 in a market expected to be worth $1.63 trillion by 2029.        
	Rolls, which supplies the existing engine for the A320 in partnership with Pratt amp; Whitney, has decided not to take part in the re-engining, however, potentially missing out on sales worth billions of dollars. It will hope to re-enter the market in the next decade with a revolutionary new design. The A320s new engines will be provided by Pratt amp; Whitney and CFM International  a joint venture between General Electric and Snecma.        
	The A320 and 737 are single-aisle, short-haul jets favoured by airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair and they outnumber long-haul aircraft globally by about three to one. With an estimated 21,000 single-aisle aircraft forecast to be built by 2029, the engine market alone could be worth between $400 billion and $500 billion.        
	Since the 737 uses only CFM International engines, Rolls could find itself locked out of the single-aisle market when the A320neo (new engine offering) is introduced in 2016.        
	A leading aerospace analyst said, This is the volume end of the market but Rolls has determined that the risk and reward of developing a re-engined product is not worth it.        
	The Derby-based company appeared unconcerned by the possibility of losing market share. It believes it can return to the single-aisle market with a radical engine design when Boeing and Airbus introduce entirely new versions of their aircraft, probably in the 2020s.        
	In the meantime, it will concentrate on its market-leading engines for longhaul jets such as the A380 superjumbo.         
	The company said, We have been unable to construct an acceptable business case for re-engining and have elected not to participate in the A320neo.         
	We are confident that we will have competitive product and service offerings available when our customers launch aircraft programmes in the future.        
	The Airbus decision has turned the focus on Boeing, which may have to slash the price of its 737 to retain market share against the more fuel-efficient A320neo. Boeing will hope to regain the initiative by introducing an all-new 737 in about 2021 with fuel savings of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent.        
	Alternatively, it could try to match the A320neo with its own re-engining programme. That is thought unlikely, however, as the design of the 737 would make it a far more costlier enterprise than the $1.5-billion Airbus will spend.         
	Boeing said, We maintain the ability to select two other options based upon what our customers want, that is a new engine option or an all-new airplane option. Our goal remains to offer the best product in every segment we serve.        
	Airbus expects to sell more than 4,000 of the new aircraft and said the fuel savings would be equivalent to 3,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide per plane per year.         
	Analysts said the companys decision to re-engine suggested that it would not be introducing a new version of the A320 before 2025. They were also sceptical about whether Airbus would stick by its declared intention to continue to offer the old A320 at a discount to the new model.        
	Airbus admitted yesterday that one of the main challenges it faced in developing the A320neo was recruiting enough engineers for the project. Tom Enders, the chief executive, said, Finding the necessary resources for the A320neo wasnt exactly a walk in the park.                     THE TIMES, LONDON

          JAYATI GHOSE                          Pending message                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: The telecom regulator has proposed mobile numbers beginning with 3 or 7, instead of the usual 9 and 8.        
	At present, over 90 per cent of the countrys 500 million 10-digit mobile numbers begin with 9, and the rest with 8.        
	If two additional series, say 3 and 7, is allotted, it will increase mobile numbering resources by another 2 billion. Even with a 60 per cent efficiency, this will cater to 1,200 million more subscribers, which is sufficient to meet the requirement for the next 7-10 years, said officials.         
	Earlier, the department of telecom (DoT) had decided to convert the existing 10-digit number series to an 11-digit one from this month.         
	Operators were against such a move as the conversion would involve massive technical changes in software and network configuration.         
	The DoT then sought recommendations from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. The regulator has initiated a consultation paper on numbering and will send the proposals to the DoT over the next two months.        
	At present, all mobile numbers are made up of 10 digits, split into OO-AA-NNNNNN where OO is the operator code, AA is the code for the telecom circle and NNNNNN is the subscriber number.        
	The mobile number series beginning with 9 is set to get exhausted over the next two years.         
	The country has over 500 million cellphone customers, but over 700 million numbers have been used up because a new number is issued every time a customer switches operators.        
	Unlike the West, used numbers are not recycled back into the system in India. Also 150 million customers are being added every year.        
	The existing numbering plan kicked off in 2003 and the DoT expected it to be in place till 2030.         
	The subscriber base had reached 500 million in 2009. The authorities had expected to attain the number in 2030

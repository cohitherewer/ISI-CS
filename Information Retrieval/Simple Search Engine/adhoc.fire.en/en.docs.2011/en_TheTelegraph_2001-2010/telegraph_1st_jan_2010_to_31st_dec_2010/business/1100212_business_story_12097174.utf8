The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | April burial for teaser rates
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      April burial for teaser rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Cheap no more				                                 
	Mumbai, Feb. 11: The interest rate lollies for new home loan borrowers will disappear in April.        
	Once banks fix the base rate for their stack of interest rates for different loan categories, the rate differential between what new borrowers have to pay and those set earlier for older borrowers will disappear, said K.R. Kamath, chairman and managing director of Punjab National Bank.        
	The RBI yesterday ordered banks to fix the base rate for all commercial loans and advised them to stop the discrimination between old and new borrowers.         
	Last year, banks came out with teaser or lowball rates in the initial years to entice new customers. These rates werent offered to the older borrowers and the central bank felt that banks ought to end this pernicious practice.        
	At present, the prime lending rates (PLRs) of the top five banks hover in the range of 11 to 12 per cent. Since April 2003, the PLR has served as a reference rate for the entire edifice of interest rates offered by banks. But as competition grew among banks, they started to offer loans at sub-PLR rates, rendering the reference rate irrelevant.        
	It is estimated that existing floating rate borrowers who had taken a loan a couple of years ago are paying an interest rate in the region of 9.25 to 9.5 per cent against a floating rate of 8.75 per cent offered to new customers. The difference will be greater if one takes into account the teaser rates that some banks offer in the first or the second year.        
	Bankers are now speculating that the base rates of banks  which will depend on a variety of factors, including their cost of funds  will settle in the range of 8.5 to 9.5 per cent.         
	Kamath reckons that the interest rates on home loans will even out by the time the base rate kicks in. He feels that all the schemes offering teaser home loan rates will be wound up by April.        
	The PNB chief said the new system would introduce transparency in rates and would benefit some sections of borrowers who are paying higher interest rates.         
	On the other hand, top-rated companies that have been getting the benefit of sub-PLR rates (8 to 9 per cent) could be affected.                                
	It will bring transparency in pricing and bargaining (for loans) will now be scientific as those customers entitled to lower risk premium will get better rates, he added.        
	Kamath did not expect the changes to impact growth in credit disbursals to companies even if they try to scout for alternative sources of funds.

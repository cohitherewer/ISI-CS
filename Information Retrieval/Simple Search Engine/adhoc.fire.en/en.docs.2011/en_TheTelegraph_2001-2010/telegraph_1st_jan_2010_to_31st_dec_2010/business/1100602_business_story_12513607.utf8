The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks tank on freak RIL trade 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stocks tank on freak RIL trade 
  - Sensex slumps, recovers later        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Mumbai, June 1: The sensex slumped 600 points in mid-morning trade today after a freak transaction at the Reliance Industries counter sent the markets into a tizzy.        
	A little over 2,00,000 shares of RIL  which has the highest weightage on the sensex of over 12 per cent  were sold at various prices below Rs 1,000, the lowest being Rs 840, said market participants.        
	Traders said that around 66,000 RIL shares were sold at Rs 840 apiece, while the rest were sold at various prices below Rs 1,000. The weighted average price was around Rs 920 for this freak trade that was obviously an error of some sort, said a trader with a leading Mumbai-based brokerage.        
	Soon after the transaction at around 1pm, the RIL stock fell 20 per cent. The stock dropped Rs 205.05 to Rs 840.55, sending the bellwether index down 3.7 per cent. It, however, recovered within seconds and ended the day lower by 3.21 per cent at Rs 1,011.         
	The sensex closed 372.6 points lower on Tuesday at 16572 points as global cues broke its four-day winning streak.         
	The broader 50-share Nifty fell below the 5000-point-mark to close 2 per cent lower at 4970 points.        
	The Bombay Stock Exchange is investigating the trades in RIL.         
	The weakness in the Indian markets on Tuesday was also a reflection of how the global markets fared with the European markets opening 2 per cent lower and Dow futures down over a 100 points, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (equity strategy) of Motilal Oswal.        
	He expected the market to swing 5 per cent either way in the extreme short term. Gaurav Dua, Sharekhans head of research, said there were other global factors as well that pulled the sensex down.        
	The Chinese manufacturing data were not encouraging and attempts made by BP to stem the oil spill have also failed, said Dua.        
	There are also short-term capital flows to watch out for. According to Sonthalia, corporate earnings and capital flows will determine the reaction of the markets. This year foreign institutional investors have bought stocks worth $6 billion and sold $2.5 billion in May, he added.        
	There were 1,796 declines during the day on the BSE compared with 1,005 advances out of a total of 2,898 scrips.         
	Metals, realty and the oil and gas indices were worst hit. Maruti Suzuki ended the day 1.80 per cent higher as the car maker recorded strong sales in May.        
	Widespread selling was witnessed across sectors. All the 13 sectoral indices finished in the red, falling in the range of 1 to 4 per cent. Jaiprakash Associates sank 6 per cent, the most among sensex stocks.

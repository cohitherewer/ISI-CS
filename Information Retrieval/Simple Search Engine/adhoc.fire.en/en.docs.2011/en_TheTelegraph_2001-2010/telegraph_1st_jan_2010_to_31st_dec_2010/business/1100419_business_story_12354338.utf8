The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to limit subsidised LPG sales
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bid to limit subsidised LPG sales
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Costly affair                                  
	New Delhi, April 18: Moves are afoot at the behest of the oil ministry to restrict subsidised domestic LPG cylinders to five or six per annum for each consumer.         
	For extra cylinders, consumers will have to pay a market price of about Rs 600 a cylinder, almost double the amount they pay now.        
	In Calcutta, PSU oil marketing firms suffer a loss of Rs 265.27 from selling a 14.2-kg LPG cylinder at Rs 328.79.         
	Till the time there is complete data and mechanism of direct transfer of subsidy to BPL families, the restriction will reduce the losses of oil firms, a senior petroleum ministry official said.        
	According to the officials, with the spread of city gas network to over 150 cities by 2014, pressure on domestic cylinders will come down. Data showed that about 65-70 per cent of consumers bought around five to six cylinders a year.        
	Sale of subsidised cylinders constituted 86.5 per cent of the total sale of 749 million units in 2008-09.         
	The subsidy on domestic LPG had grown to Rs 17,600 crore in 2008-09 from Rs 5,523 crore in 2003-04 and is estimated to be around Rs 14,152 crore in 2009-10.         
	Officials said the huge gap between commercial cylinders, which cost Rs 1,000-1,200 per 19-kg cylinder, and the domestic ones has led to the latter being used for commercial purposes.        
	According to the Kirit Parikh committee report, the subsidy burden will keep increasing with the growth in LPG consumption and a spike in global rates.        
	The panel has recommended a hike in the price of each cylinder by at least Rs 100 and a periodical revision of the rate based on the per capita income.         
	For BPL households, the panel has recommended that subsidy should be in the form of direct cash transfers.        
	Analysts said a sharp increase in LPG prices might be politically uncomfortable for the government at a time inflation is nearing double digit at 9.90 per cent.         
	The Opposition also plans to corner the government by bringing in a cut motion against the finance bill over rising prices.        
	Sources said restricting the sale of cylinders would have to wait till oil firms came up with more data on the pattern of consumption and the UPA government was politically comfortable to push through the reform process.        
	The budget for 2010-11 has allocated Rs 3,108 crore for LPG and kerosene subsidies. Finance ministry officials said the government did not intend to increase the subsidy burden as it could impact the fiscal deficit.

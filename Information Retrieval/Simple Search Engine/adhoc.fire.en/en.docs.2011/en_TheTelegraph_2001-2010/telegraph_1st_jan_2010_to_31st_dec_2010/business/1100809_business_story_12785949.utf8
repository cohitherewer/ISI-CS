          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 8: IPFonline Ltd, the Chennai-based business-to-business publishing company, is looking for private equity investors.         
	However, it is yet to decide on the amount of stake sale to the PE firm.        
	At present, IL amp;FS owns 44 per cent of IPFonline, while HDFC holds 12 per cent. Its founder R.V. Pandit owns the rest 44 per cent.         
	We are looking for somebody who will be directly involved in the business and will not just restrict itself to funding, Linus Lobo the companys CEO, said. IPFonline has Adventis Capital as its adviser.        
	Lobo expects that the private equity funding to be at least Rs 15-20 crore higher than IPFonlines enterprise value. He, however, refused to disclose the enterprise value of IPFonline.        
	According to Lobo, Pandit is going to retire soon and his heirs are not keen on the publishing business.         
	All the investors are willing to sell off their full holding, if we get somebody who will properly run the business. We can go for a partial stake offload as well, he said.        
	The company is debt free and has good bookings for the next few years.         
	IPFonline publishes the Industrial Products Finder  a magazine that carries advertisements on industrial products.         
	The magazine is available through a prepaid annual subscription to businesses, industries and technical and managerial personnel.        
	We are in talks with Indias top two credit rating agencies for a possible joint venture to offer rating services to the small and medium enterprises, Lobo said.         
	The company expects to finalise a deal with one of the agencies by the end of this month. However, Lobo declined to reveal the name of the firm.        
	According to Lobo, this was part of the companys diversification plans, which include entering the e-commerce market. e-commerce is on our radar. But it will take some time to start that at IPF, he said.        
	The company is also entering into other businesses such as organising trade fairs and conferences across the country.         
	We have our trade show calendar ready for a year, Lobo said.

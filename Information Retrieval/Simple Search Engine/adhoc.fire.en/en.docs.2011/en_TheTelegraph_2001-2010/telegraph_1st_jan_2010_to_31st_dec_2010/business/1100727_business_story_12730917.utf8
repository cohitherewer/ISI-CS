The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Moodys ups local currency debt rating
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Moodys ups local currency debt rating
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Value addition                                  
	Mumbai, July 26: International credit rating agency Moodys Investors Services today raised Indias local currency debt rating by a notch to Ba1 from Ba2  just below investment grade  reflecting the resilience of its economy and the Manmohan Singh governments strong commitment to fiscal and economic reforms.        
	However, the rating agency retained its Baa3  or lowest investment grade rating on Indias foreign currency debt.         
	The rating upgrade came after the government freed petrol prices last month and promised to lift subsidies on diesel as well.        
	Moodys said the upgrade was because of the institutional and structural reforms. According to the rating agency, the deepening of reforms will result in gradual improvements not only in the governments financial strength but also support fiscal credibility, and improve economic resilience. The rating agency said the domestic economys resilience throughout the global recession was another reason for the upgrade.        
	Recently, the Centre had raised fuel prices and mobilised huge sums of money through the auction of 3G and broadband wireless spectrum. Divestment receipts are also expected to bring down the fiscal deficit this fiscal.        
	The upgrade of the local currency sovereign rating to Ba1 was prompted by the governments adoption of a medium-term (2010-2015) fiscal consolidation strategy, which is supported by a broadening structural reform programme, said Aninda Mitra, Moodys vice-president and the companys lead sovereign analyst for India.        
	He said the ongoing policy normalisation, divestments, fuel subsidy reforms, along with impending tax reforms, would support the governments fiscal and debt position. He added that they were in line with and might even outperform the governments debt targets envisaged in the revised road map for fiscal consolidation as laid out by the Thirteenth Finance Commission.        
	The sovereign ratings also reflect the ability of policymakers to temporarily mount sizeable counter-cyclical policies without weakening institutional credibility or damaging local investors faith in the government, Mitra said.

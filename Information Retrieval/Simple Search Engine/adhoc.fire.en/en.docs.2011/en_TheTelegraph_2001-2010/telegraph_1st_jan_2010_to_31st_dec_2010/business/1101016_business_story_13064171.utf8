          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Oil minister Murli Deora (right) with his deputy Jitin Prasada in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: India has set an initial investment commitment of over $1.1 billion for the 34 blocks it put on offer in the ninth round of oil and gas bidding launched today.        
	Nelp 9 (New Exploration Licensing Policy) is being launched in the background of positive economic conditions, including revision of APM (administered price mechanism) gas price and market determination for price of petrol, petroleum minister Murli Deora told reporters here.        
	The 34 blocks, which include 15 recycled ones, cover a sedimentary basin area of 88,807 square km. The deadline for making a bid for the blocks is March 18, 2011.        
	The investor response this time will be extremely good because all the 34 blocks have been carefully analysed  A smaller number of blocks which have high potential have been sieved and put on the market. We are very optimistic, oil secretary S. Sundareshan said.         
	India expects investment commitments in the current round to exceed the $1.1-billion it received in 2009, Sundareshan said.        
	The ninth round of bidding offers blocks from 10 sedimentary basins, including eight deepwater blocks, seven shallow water blocks, and 19 onland blocks.        
	The onland blocks fall in Assam (2), Gujarat (11), Rajasthan (2), Madhya Pradesh (2), Tripura (1) and Uttar Pradesh (1). The seven shallow water and eight deep water blocks are off the east and west coasts, but no area in the prolific Krishna Godavari basin is on offer.        
	The government plans to complete the process of awarding the blocks by June next year after it receives the bids, directorate-general of hydrocarbons S.K. Srivastava said.        
	We hope to sign the production sharing contracts (with winning bidders) in three months after receiving bids, he said.         
	The government has secured investments of $14 billion in oil and gas exploration activities from the eight earlier rounds of Nelp.        
	Cairn stake        
	Sundareshan said the government would take a call by December on Cairn Energy selling a stake in subsidiary Cairn India to Vedanta group companies. The decision will be taken on the basis of merit.        
	Sources said the solicitor-general had told the oil ministry and ONGC that according to the production sharing contracts, the Centres approval was required before a controlling stake in a company that operates acreages such as Cairn India in Rajasthans Barmer are sold off.        
	The opinion is expected to put pressure on Cairn Energy to seek fresh approvals from the government and a no-objection from ONGC.        
	Cairn Energy is selling a 51-60 per cent stake in Cairn India for $8.5-9.6 billion to Vedanta group firms. However, issues surrounding Cairn Energy taking permission of ONGC have cast doubts on the deal. ONGC is a partner of Cairn India in the latters Rajasthan fields, among others.         
	Meanwhile, ONGC has made two new oil and gas discoveries. An oil discovery was made in an onland Cauvery Basin block and a gas find in the offshore Krishna-Godavari Basin, ONGC said.

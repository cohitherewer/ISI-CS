The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Retail investment cap in IPOs up
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Retail investment cap in IPOs up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 25: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today raised the investment limit for retail investors in an initial public offering (IPO) to Rs 2 lakh from Rs 1 lakh earlier even as it tightened norms governing the preferential issue of equity shares.        
	However, the market regulator hasnt yet specified an effective date for the implementation of the measure, which is coming soon after the grand success of the Coal India IPO  the biggest maiden flotation in India  which was oversubscribed over 15 times even though the retail segment clocked just 2.1 times.         
	The retail investors subscription limit is being raised after a period of five years. Experts said it was a positive move and should be considered in the light of the higher disposable incomes with households and the rise in inflation.        
	Therefore, there was a case for raising the limit, said a research head of a domestic brokerage.        
	However, critics said the move would make it harder for small investors to obtain shares through IPOs. They argued that investors who subscribed to only the minimum number of equity shares in an IPO will now get fewer shares whenever there is an over-subscription. It is felt that the market regulator should have raised the quota reserved for retail investors from 35 per cent of the share issue in tandem with the increase in the investment limit.        
	Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database said, The decision would surely lead to edging out the small investors. First-time investors typically enter in a testing mode with small amounts. This is also true for lakhs of existing small investors.        
	With the investment limit increased to Rs 2 lakh, the richer individual investors, courtesy proportionate allotment, will further eat into the allocation to the small investors, he added.        
	Haldea said the policy was wrongly based around the concern that large IPOs might not elicit sufficient retail response.         
	Good companies with right price will always see phenomenal response from retail. Why should any one be bothered if the retail portion goes undersubscribed in bad issues; it should actually make every one happy.         
	At a board meeting held today, the market regulator decided that in the case of preferential issues, if a promoter or any promoter group entity has on an earlier occasion subscribed to the warrants of the company but failed to exercise the warrants, the promoters and promoter group will not be eligible for the issue of equity shares or convertible securities or warrants for a period of one year from the date of cancellation of the warrants.        
	The regulator also decided that if any member of the promoter or the promoter group have sold shares in the previous six months, they will not be eligible for allotments on a preferential basis.        
	Promoters use the preferential issue route to raise their stake in companies. One such way is via convertible warrants wherein the promoters initially pay a part of the warrants value and there is an option to buy shares of the company at a particular price before a set date.         
	However, the mechanism has come under the market regulators lens over the past few years with critics pointing out that promoters are misusing the preferential allotment norms by selling shares at high prices and opting for preferential allotment at the minimum price stipulated by Sebi guidelines.        
	The Sebi board also mandated additional disclosures for life insurance companies that intend to come out with an IPO. These companies will now have to disclose risk factors specific to the sector, give an overview of the insurance industry and come out with other disclosures specific to the industry.        
	However, the Sebi board did not take a decision on the new takeover code. Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave said the board needed more time to decide on the revised code and it could be taken up at the next meeting.        
	In July, a Sebi committee had proposed changes in the takeover rules to give more rights to minority shareholders. The panel had recommended to make it mandatory for acquirers to make an offer for up to 100 per cent stake in any listed company against 20 per cent now.        
	The regulator also asked companies coming out with IPOs to come clean on their media coverage in the run-up to the public issue by making adequate disclosures to the watchdog and investors about all the news reports.        
	According to Sebi, the provision is to ensure that information appearing in the media is consistent with the disclosures made in the public offer document.        
	The (Sebi) board (has) decided that the merchant bankers may submit a compliance certificate as to whether the contents of the news reports that appear after filing of draft offer document are supported by disclosures in the offer document or not, the regulator said after the board meeting.

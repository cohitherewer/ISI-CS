	Mumbai, March 15: Mobile phone operator Reliance Communications (R-Com) has crossed the 100-million-subscriber milestone, the second to do so after Bharti Airtel.         
	R-Com reached the figure seven years after the launch of its services. The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group-controlled company said it was the quickest in the world to get to 100 million subscribers.         
	With this, R-Com becomes the fourth operator in the world to serve over 100 million in a single country.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Vivek Garg, regional head (east) of R-Com, said the company was now targeting the 200-million mark in the next 1,000 days, which is less than four years. It is confident of an aggressive growth in the eastern region. Within the next five years, our revenue and subscriber base will make us the market leader, Garg said.         
	To achieve this target, the company is expanding its GSM and CDMA mobile networks and also focusing on customer-friendly measures.         
	R-Com promoter Anil Dhirubhai Ambani said, The landmark 100 million mobile customer base makes us the youngest telecom operator to achieve this milestone in such a short span of time. As we take the leap to achieve the 200-million mark, we will lead it from the front with more customer-centric innovations and service approach.

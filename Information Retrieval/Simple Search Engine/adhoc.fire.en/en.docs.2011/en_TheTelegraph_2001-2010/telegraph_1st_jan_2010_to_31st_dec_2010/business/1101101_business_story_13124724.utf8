                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cash ash
        A pack of cigarettes less each day could save you   a fortune, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Last night after dinner I settled down for a smoke on the balcony and was thinking hard on a topic for this column. After a few puffs on my cigarette, it suddenly struck me: am I paying too much to kill myself? I started calculating.         
	By spending Rs 40 a day, I had burnt off Rs 1,46,000 in the last 10 years. I have been a smoker since my university days in the late 1980s, so the sum I had burnt away was huge.        
	Quickly the investor in me prompted: how much would I have made had I invested the money? After all, it is the opportunity cost of what I had already wasted smoking.        
	I would have been a millionaire by now had I stopped smoking and started investing my monthly outgo on cigarettes from January 1, 2000 in a fund like the Reliance Growth Fund of Reliance Mutual Fund through a SIP (systematic investment plan). A monthly SIP of Rs 1,200 in Reliance Growth Fund would have generated Rs 13,51,642 as on September 30, 2010!        
	If I could put this amount in a Post Office Monthly Income Account, it would give me a monthly interest income of Rs 9,011.         
	In other words, by spending Rs 1,200 a month on cigarettes in the last 129 months (from January 2000 to September 2010) I had not only wasted Rs 1,54,800, but also lost the opportunity to earn Rs 9,011 a month free of labour.         
	Healthy and wealthy        
	So smokers, its time to stub the cigarette out. Here is a good reason for you to quit smoking, or at least cut down on your cigarette/tobacco consumption to live life literally healthy and wealthy.        
	Fascinated by the calculation, I tried to work out some more. The results are even more amazing. Had I saved Rs 50 a day and made a monthly SIP of Rs 1,500 in the same mutual fund, I would have got Rs 16,89,552, that is Rs 3,37,910 more than what I would have got from a monthly SIP of Rs 1,200.         
	In other words, a saving of an additional Rs 10 a day would have fetched me Rs 3,37,910 more over a period of less than 11 years.         
	Thus smoking is not only injurious to your health, but is also injurious to your finances. However, for a smoker, quitting the habit is easier said than done. What you can do, however, is follow a strict routine  everyday before going to work, take out Rs 40 or Rs 50 or whatever amount you want to save and keep the money in an envelope or a piggybank. When you go out with less money in your purse, you will be forced to spend less.         
	At the end of the month, deposit the money in your bank account. While doing this remember to deposit your money in the bank account before the post-dated cheques that you had given to the fund house for the SIP come up for credit.         
	Even many non-smokers have various conspicuous consumption, which if cut down can make you wealthier.         
	Eighth wonder        
	One may argue that the above mentioned calculations are based on the past performance of Reliance Growth Fund and there is no guarantee that the fund can generate the same return in future. True. But then even a reasonable rate of return on small investments can yield wonders over a long period of time. This is the magic of compounding, what Albert Einstein called the eighth wonder and the most powerful thing in the universe.        
	For example, post-retirement financial security is a big issue with many of us who are not eligible for government pension. Now consider this: a monthly investment of Rs 1,200 (that is, a saving of Rs 40 a day) can generate Rs 25,00,000 over a period of 30 years at a growth rate of 10 per cent.         
	If we assume an inflation rate of 5 per cent (the average of rate of inflation was 5.94 per cent in the past 10 years) and real economic growth rate of 6 per cent, the nominal GDP growth rate works out to 11 per cent. If the economy grows at 11 per cent, corporations are likely to post 15 per cent profit growth. Hence, a 10 per cent return on equity investment is conservative enough.        
	Now that fund houses such as Reliance Mutual Fund are offering monthly SIP at a minimum of Rs 100, wealth creation with regular savings has become easier for common people. What you need is the discipline of saving and investing regularly. Over a long period of time, risks from equity investments get ironed out.        
	Take a SIP        
	A systematic investment plan gives you more control over your investment because you have the discretion of increasing or decreasing the installment amount. You also get the flexibility of withdrawing a part of your investment as and when required to meet financial contingencies. Housewives, in particular, can use the advantage of SIP to a great extent. Almost all housewives have the great knack of saving a small amount from monthly household expenditure. You can put this monthly saving in expenditure in a SIP for future wealth creation.

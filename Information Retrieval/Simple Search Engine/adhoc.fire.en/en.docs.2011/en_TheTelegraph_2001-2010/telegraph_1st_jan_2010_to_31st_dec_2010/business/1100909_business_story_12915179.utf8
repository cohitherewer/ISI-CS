The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Move to free savings rate
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Move to free savings rate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RBI deputy governor Usha Thorat and Duncan Martin, partner and director of Boston Consulting Group, London, in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 8: The interest rate on savings bank accounts  currently capped at 3.5 per cent  is likely to be freed.        
	This is the only category among bank interest rates that is still regulated by the Reserve Bank of India.         
	The RBI is now weighing the option of giving banks the freedom to fix the interest rate on their savings accounts.        
	Usha Thorat, the RBI deputy governor, told bankers at a conclave here today that the central bank would soon establish a working group to examine the possibility of deregulating the interest rates.         
	Deregulation of interest rate is on our radar. A working group will soon be set up to examine the possibility of deregulating interest rates. We have to examine whether the deregulation can help to bring more people into the formal banking system, Thorat said.        
	The savings rate has been pegged at 3.5 per cent for around eight years. Any move to free the rate can spark a rate war as banks scramble to beef up their savings account base, which remains one of the cheapest form of cash.         
	Some bankers said this might not be good news for banks as it could lead to higher costs, thereby impacting their margins.        
	This isnt the first time that the RBI has spoken about deregulating the savings bank rate. But until now it has tread cautiously as it chose to wait for some consensus. While several banks have been pushing for a deregulation of the savings rate, others have opposed the move.         
	Back in June, deputy governor K.C. Chakrabarty had said though the central bank was in favour of deregulating all interest rates, including the savings bank rate, the decision would be taken only after adequate debate.        
	Those opposed to the move had in the past given the example of the turmoil that the US faced in the mid 1980s when banks vied with each other to offer attractive rates. Many of the banks had to subsequently invest in risky assets to offset the higher interest rates they were paying on these deposits.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Handset firms keen on common software

          JAYATI GHOSE                                                Clear connection        
	Barcelona, Feb. 19: Global telecom firms want to create a common software for their mobile applications.        
	Twenty-four firms, including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, AT amp;T, Sprint Nextel, Orange, NTT DoCoMo and China Mobile, have come together so that the applications can perform seamlessly on different handsets.        
	Most applications work on only one type of device, or the phones of one carrier. An iPhone application will not work on a Nokia phone; neither will it work on Googles Android system or Microsofts new Windows Phone.        
	Mobile applications include music players with downloads, social networking platforms, satellite tracking systems, games, maps and shopping platforms.         
	Globally, sales of applications are expected to rise 62 per cent this year to $6.8 billion, according to research firm Gartner.         
	Nokia and Intel are coming together to create an open Linux-based platform, MeeGo, that can be used across a variety of devices.         
	We believe this will be good ultimately for the consumer because it will give them more choices, said Peters Suh, chief executive of Joint Innovation Lab.         
	This is another group formed by China Mobile, Verizon Wireless, Vodafone and SoftBank Mobile to develop applications

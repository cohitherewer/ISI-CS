          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, May 3: CK Birla flagship Hindustan Motors, which built Indias first automobile plant at Uttarpara in Bengal in 1948, may turn sick.        
	The company will soon report its net worth erosion to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). HMs net worth stood at Rs 164 crore as on March 31, 2010, while the accumulated loss was Rs 132 crore.        
	Section 23 of the Sick Industrial Companies (special provisions) Act of 1985 says a company must report to the BIFR if its net peak worth has been eroded by 50 per cent, or more, during the preceding four financial years.         
	In HM, 80 per cent of its net worth have been eroded. Net worth is calculated by deducting total liabilities from total assets.        
	If accumulated loss exceeds net worth, the company will be referred to the BIFR, which will restructure it. However, company officials claim such a situation will never occur.        
	The auto market has improved a lot. Our sales are growing. If the momentum continues, there is no question of going to the BIFR, Malay Chowdhury, general manager of HMs Uttarpara unit, said.        
	The company employs 2,500 people at Uttarpara after reducing the workforce by 1,200 two years back.        
	The factory produced 1,075 units of the Ambassador in March compared with 500 produced during the recession-hit months of 2008-09.        
	Chowdhury said sales of the light commercial vehicle Winner were going up steadily. Sales of the Mitsubishi range from the Chennai plant were rising. The auto component business has turned around, he said.        
	However, when most auto firms earned good profits in the last fiscal, HM continued to suffer losses despite claims of a turnaround.        
	The company suffered a loss of Rs 50.52 crore in the last fiscal on a consolidated basis. Losses stood at Rs 31.82 crore during the fourth quarter. HMs stock tanked near 7.51 per cent today to close at Rs 23.40. HM has not been able to build upon the proceeds from a land sale three years ago. It had sold 314 acres to south-Indian developer Shriram Properties for Rs 295 crore.

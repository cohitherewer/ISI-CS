	Mumbai, Nov. 17 (PTI): Professional forecasters have revised their projections for GDP growth in this fiscal to 8.5 per cent from the earlier estimate of 8.4 per cent, according to an RBI survey.        
	Forecasters have revised their real GDP growth rate estimates marginally upwards to 8.5 per cent in 2010-11 from 8.4 per cent in the last survey, driven mainly by increased agricultural growth and higher growth in services in the subsequent quarters, according to the Reserve Banks 13th Round of Professional Forecasters report.        
	The apex bank has clarified that the survey does not represent its views.         
	The forecasters also expect growth to be 8.5 per cent next fiscal, lower than the governments 9 per cent estimate.        
	The forecast for agricultural growth this fiscal has been revised to 4.9 per cent from 4.1 per cent in the RBIs last survey .

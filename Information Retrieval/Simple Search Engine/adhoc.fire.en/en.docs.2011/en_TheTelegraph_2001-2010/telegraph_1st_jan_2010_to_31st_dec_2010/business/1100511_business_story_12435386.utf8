	Calcutta, May 10: The Reserve Bank of India will soon come out with a report on the steep rise in food prices.        
	At a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today, RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn said, The paper will look into whats driving food prices up. We want to understand the long-term and short-term forces behind food price inflation. The report will come out in the next few weeks.        
	According to Gokarn, the excessive rise in prices, particularly of pulses, milk and sugar, is worrying and indicates a long-term structural change in the food habits of people.        
	The annual food price inflation was 16.04 per cent for the week ended April 24.        
	Inflation bottomed out in the first quarter of 2009-10, but thereafter it has been rising steadily, though there was a mild moderation in the rate of price rise last month, Gokarn said.         
	However, a key concern for the central bank is the V-shaped trend in the prices of non-food manufacturing goods.         
	Non-food manufacturing goods comprise 52 per cent of the wholesale price index. A V-shaped rise in the price of non-food manufacturing goods indicate that inflation is fuelled by growth expectations. Containing this inflation level will be a key consideration of the monetary policy announcements, said Gokarn.        
	The deputy governor, however, said the liquidity in the system was adequate and when the RBI announced its policy measures in April it took into consideration the borrowing needs of the government as well as the corporate sector.         
	We are getting more and more comfort from the global side, notwithstanding the Greece episode, he said.         
	Gokarn said the capital flow would influence the central banks future policy.

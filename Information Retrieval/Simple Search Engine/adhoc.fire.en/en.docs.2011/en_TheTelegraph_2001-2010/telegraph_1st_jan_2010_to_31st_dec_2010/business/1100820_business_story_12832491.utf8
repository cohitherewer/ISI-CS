The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GM files for public offer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      GM files for public offer
                              Big leap                            
	New York/Detroit, Aug. 19: (Reuters): General Motors took a big step towards repaying a controversial taxpayer-funded bailout by declaring plans for a landmark stock offering that represents a critical test for the Obama administration.        
	The auto maker said it planned to list the shares on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange in an initial public offering that comes amid a still-weak global market for cars that is vulnerable to a further downturn.        
	The Obama administration wants to be able to cast its $50 billion GM bailout as a financial success in the face of public skepticism and Republican political opposition but some analysts are still wary of the offering.        
	GMs IPO could be the biggest since Visa Incs $19.7 billion March 2008 offering, and could raise up to $20 billion, though analysts cautioned that its size depends on still-untested investor demand for a restructured auto maker with only two consecutive quarters of profits.        
	GMs initial filing with US securities regulators did not say how many shares would be sold or give an expected price range for the IPO.        
	Were looking at a second half that is potentially weaker than the first half, said Dennis Virag, president of Automotive Consulting Group. That could certainly hurt the sale of the shares.        
	I dont think this is a good time to be going public, Virag said. Its more political than practical.        
	Trading in GM shares is expected to start between late October and the US Thanksgiving holiday on November 25.         
	A stock offering in late October will mean trading will start just before the November congressional elections.        
	Government officials and GM executives have repeatedly denied any link with the elections.        
	The 102-year-old onetime blue chip is expected to return to the NYSE under the GM ticker symbol it had before the government-funded bankruptcy.        
	Adding a stock listing in Toronto underscores the role the governments of Canada and Ontario played as junior partners to the US treasury in keeping GM from liquidation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Plea to ground Andal airport city
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Plea to ground Andal airport city
          SAMBIT SAHA                                      
	Calcutta, Dec. 6: A consortium of steel makers, including ArcelorMittal-promoted Uttam Galva, has taken the Bengal government to court seeking an order to cancel the airport city project at Andal, Burdwan or shift it elsewhere.        
	In its petition, the consortium said around 7 square kilometre surface area of a mine allocated to it by the Centre, in concurrence with the Bengal government, fell within the airport city project undertaken by private developer Bengal Aerotropolis Projects (BAPL), where Singapores Changi owns a 26 per cent stake.        
	It has argued that around 700 million tonnes of coal will be lost if the project comes up and hence sought court direction to stop work.        
	Justice Jayanta Biswas did not pass any interim order before hearing out all the parties, especially the Central government, which has also been made party to the case. The matter will come up for hearing next Monday.        
	The six members of the consortium are Calcutta-based Adhunik Metaliks, Ramsarup Industries, Howrah Gases, Vikas Metal amp; Ispat and national players such as ACC and Uttam Galva. The Centre has allotted the Moira Madhujore (north amp; south) coal block to it.        
	Incidentally, the majority of the companies in the consortium intend to use the coal from the mine for plants outside Bengal.        
	The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation  made a party in the case  has already provided around 1,800 acres to BAPL, one of the most successful instances where a large tract of land was acquired for industry without much resistance. It requires another 300 acres for the first phase and 1,000 acres more for the second phase.        
	BAPL has appointed Simplex Infrastructure to build the airport, which is slated to come up by April 2012, assuming the present case is resolved fast.        
	The airport will be a regional one, designed to handle aircraft such as Airbus 320/319 and Boeing 737.        
	The petition filed by the consortium alleged that only 800 odd acres would be used for the airport and the rest for social and industrial infrastructure, which can be done elsewhere.        
	The state government has formed an expert committee to see how both the mine and the airport city projects can co-exist.        
	Subrata Gupta, managing director of the WBIDC, declined to comment saying the matter is sub-judice.         
	However, senior government officials said the state did not subscribe to the view that all economic development should be stopped to allow mining underground.        
	They argued that the entire Asansol-Durgapur sub division had coal deposits underneath. Historically, coal mining and habitation have co-existed.        
	With improved technology, it should not be a problem for the consortium to raise coal while allowing BAPL to build the airport city, they added. But it may put an extra cost on both the parties.        
	The Moira Madhujore block is spread over a 15.5-square-kilometre area. Some experts said that not more than 1-2 per cent surface area were required to raise coal via underground mining.        
	State officials said the government did not play a dubious role in the whole issue as alleged in the petition.        
	Had that been the case, the state could have withdrawn its consent to the mining project. After all, many investors in Bengal are waiting for coal mines while most of the coal from Moira Madhujore would go outside, asked an official.        
	Incidentally, a consortium member will require a mining lease, the final permit to raise coal, from the state.        
	Past conflict        
	The airport city project had ran into rough weather in the past as well when Coal India Ltd (CIL) raised objection citing huge quantity of coal would be lost if the project came up. Subsequently, around 400 acres were left out to appease CIL.

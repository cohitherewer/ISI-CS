The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Firms eye Salt Lake, Rajarhat 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Firms eye Salt Lake, Rajarhat 
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Attractive option                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Calcuttas Salt Lake and Rajarhat can become attractive places for offices to lease space as rents have fallen and many new buildings have come up, according to a study by the Confederation of Indian Industry and real estate consultancy firm Jones Lang Lasalle Meghraj.         
	Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad are also likely to be attractive office properties this year, the study said.         
	Net absorption of office space is forecast to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 29.5 per cent to 42.6 million sq ft in 2012 from 19.6 million sq ft in 2009 on the back of demand from the banking, IT and telecom sectors.        
	Last year, 20 million sq ft were leased out, and this year it will go up 50 per cent to 30 million sq ft.         
	Salt Lake is an established office destination of Calcutta, offering excellent retail and residential catchments, hotels and regional connectivity to IT/ITeS occupants. Rajharat will score high because of the ongoing SEZ projects, quality office and residential properties, besides proximity to the airport, said Abhishek Kiran Gupta, head (research and REIS) of Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj.        
	Salt Lake has an established infrastructure but lacks scope for real estate growth. Therefore, landlords must continue to offer affordable rents.        
	Companies with a global footprint such as Amazon, FirstData, ANZ Bank, who are facing cost pressures, do not want to miss out on the cost arbitrage benefit. These companies will lead the race to acquire spaces in the top seven favourable destinations.        
	Global firms with a significant presence in India such as RBS, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, E amp;Y and Accenture will follow.        
	Domestic firms such as TCS, Wipro, Uninor and Reliance will also explore opportunities.        
	The study also states that despite demand, commercial lease and rental space will witness excess supply till 2011.        
	With the predicted growth of net completions expected to outpace that of net absorption, a significant supply overhang is expected to remain over the next one year. This will lead vacancy level across India, which was 17.2 per cent in 2009 to rise to mid-20 per cent by 2010, said Gupta.        
	The IT/ITeS sector will continue to lead the demand for office space followed by telecom, pharma and financial firms. Industrial growth might spur office space demand from the manufacturing and engineering sectors.

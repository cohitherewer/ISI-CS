	Calcutta, Dec. 13: The Bengal government has handed over the proposed Katwa power project to National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (NTPC) and is likely to do the same with the Santaldih thermal power station.         
	NTPC takes over the Katwa project from West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd (WBPDCL), which has acquired 387 acres of the 1,035 acres required for the project.        
	The plant will be set up by NTPC. We have signed a power purchase agreement with the state government for the Katwa project, NTPC chairman Arup Roy Choudhury today said.         
	WBPDCL managing director Krishna Gupta said, We had been talking to Bhel and NTPC for joint ventures.        
	While Bhel was silent, NTPC preferred to go it alone in Katwa.        
	According to NTPC director I.J. Kapoor, the power PSU will reimburse all incidental costs, including the acquisition of land, incurred by WBPDCL or the state government.         
	He said the Bengal government would acquire the remaining land for the project.        
	NTPC has scaled up the size of the Katwa project to 1,600MW from 1,320MW to be set up at an investment of Rs 9,600 crore.         
	Bengal will get 800MW from the project, while 560MW will go to other eastern states; the remaining will be allocated according to a power ministry directive.        
	Santaldih plans        
	Roy Choudhury said NTPC was in talks with the state government for projects at Santaldih in Purulia.        
	While we are more interested in setting up a greenfield project, we are not averse to taking over the power plants at Santaldih. However, the government has not come up with a proposal. Once we get that, we can decide on the capacity and investment, he said.        
	NTPC is willing to set up two projects each of 660MW capacity at Santaldih.         
	Gupta said WBPDCL was in talks with NTPC for its power station (810MW) at Santaldih.         
	On whether the projects are being given to NTPC because of WBPDCLs weak financial health, Gupta said, WBPDCL is a state-owned firm and any equity capital infusion comes from the state government. Whether the government is willing to pump money into projects developed through joint ventures can be answered by the government itself.         
	Only last month, West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company had signed an agreement with NTPC to buy 1,762MW from its five power stations in the state.

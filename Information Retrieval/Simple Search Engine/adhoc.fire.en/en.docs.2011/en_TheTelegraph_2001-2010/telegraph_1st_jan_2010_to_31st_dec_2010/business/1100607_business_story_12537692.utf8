        Systematic investment planning in MFs can be a good way to beat volatility in shares, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Household savings in India as a percentage of gross national savings is the highest (69 per cent) in the world. Yet, our average per capita net worth is less than 25 per cent of the world average.         
	This is because while 35 per cent of our household savings go into physical assets, such as house, land properties, jewellery and so on, more than 55 per cent of the financial assets are put in low-yielding but secure bank deposits.        
	Less than five per cent of the households financial savings find their way into equities. Even in China, 22 per cent of the financial assets of households comprise equity or equity-related investments.        
	But then, given the option of other investment avenues, who would like to see ones hard-earned money fluctuating wildly between the extremes of profits and losses in equity markets?         
	True. Volatility is one thing retail investors are not fond of in particular.         
	Which is why retail investors in our country have not embraced equity investment despite the fact that equities have given a compounded annual return of 15.96 per cent, that is doubling your money in every four-and-a-half years!        
	The middle path        
	What if there was a middle path?         
	It is a simple way. It only requires you to be a little more disciplined, thats all. Instead of putting all your money at one go, spread the investment over a period of time.         
	You got it right. I am talking about systematic investment planning.         
	It might sound clichd to discuss about the advantages of SIPs over lump sum investments now. But in 1998, when Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund introduced the concept, there were a few takers.         
	The revival of the concept in the last couple of years reinforces its strength to beat extreme market volatility.        
	When it comes to systematic investment plan, various options are now available. You can choose a quarterly SIP, a monthly SIP or even a daily SIP. The question is which one is more efficient in reducing exposure to volatility and at the same time give a better return.         
	We shall focus here on monthly and daily SIPs.         
	A quarterly SIP is similar to a lump sum investment for three months.        
	First, let us see how systematic investment helps you earn a better return. Had you invested a fixed sum systematically every month in HDFC Top 200 fund between January 1, 2000 and May 1, 2010, you would have got an annualised return of 32.91 per cent.         
	But had you put in a lump sum amount in this fund in January 1, 2000, then by May 1 this year your investment would have yielded an annual return of only 30.33 per cent.         
	The benchmark index for the fund, BSE 200, gave an annual compounded return of only 17 per cent during these 10 years. This shows that in the case of equities, systematic investment or investment of a fixed amount at regular intervals over a long period of time yields a superior return than a lump sum amount, irrespective of the market volatility.         
	A similar systematic investment is present in unit-linked plans of life insurance companies where your monthly or quarterly or annual premiums are invested at regular intervals over a long period of time.         
	Daily formula        
	Now that many fund houses are offering daily SIP, let us see whether this can give you a better return over monthly investments.        
	In a monthly SIP, your investment date in each month is predetermined. So, you cannot reap the benefit of market volatility during the period between two successive dates.         
	This shortcoming of a monthly SIP is overcome if you choose a daily SIP. In a daily SIP, your money is invested every business day. The table shows how a daily SIP scores over a monthly SIP. Here we have considered a daily SIP of Rs 1,000 since January 4, 2010 (the first trading day) through May 31. Given that there were only 101 trading days, your total investment amounts to Rs 1,01,000.        
	For these five months, we have considered a monthly SIP of Rs 20,000. In both the cases, we considered the sensex return.        
	In case of the monthly SIP, your investment will amount to Rs 9,8871.51 (month end NAV of Rs 96.502 x 1,024.554 units). In daily SIP, the investment amount is Rs 100,483.86 (month end NAV of Rs 96.502 x 1041.262 units).        
	Had you invested Rs 1,00,000 at one go on January 4, your investment would amount to Rs 96,500 by May-end. Daily SIP, thus, works out to be a better tool to manage both short-term as well as long-term volatility in equity markets.         
	But not many fund houses offer the daily SIP facility. Moreover, monitoring the investment on a daily basis is not an easy task.        
	There is, however, a better way. Some fund houses, such as UTI Mutual Fund, offer a facility wherein you can invest a lump sum amount in a liquid fund and ask the fund house to withdraw a fixed amount everyday from this liquid fund and reinvest the money in an equity fund of your choice.         
	Till the money lies in the liquid fund, you continue to earn a return that is generally greater than a bank savings deposit. Now that fund houses cannot charge any entry load in any of their schemes, the systematic transfer of investment from the liquid to the equity fund wont attract any additional cost.         
	A disciplined and systematic plan can hold the key for a steady and decent return on your investments.

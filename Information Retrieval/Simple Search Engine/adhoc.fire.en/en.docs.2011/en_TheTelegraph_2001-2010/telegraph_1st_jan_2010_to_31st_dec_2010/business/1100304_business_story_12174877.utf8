          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 3: The government could consider lowering the proposed 10 per cent service tax on domestic and international air travel.        
	We are having a dialogue (on service tax) with all the carriers and stakeholders. We should arrive at a rate which is not excessive and should not pass undue burden (to passengers), V. Sridhar, chairman of the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), said at a seminar organised by industry body Assocham.        
	CBEC member Y.G. Parande clarified that the service tax would be calculated on the base fare.         
	The service tax is charged at a flat rate of 10 per cent. Whether that is too heavy and whether we need to peg the rate at some different level (is to be considered), Parande told reporters.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel today said in Hyderabad that he would approach finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to fully rollback the levy on air travel.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 29: Food inflation eased by over one percentage point to 16.61 per cent in mid-April on hopes of a normal monsoon and the arrival of the winter crop in the market.        
	However, the fuel price index rose to 12.69 per cent for the week ended April 17, marginally higher than the previous weeks reading of 12.45 per cent. Food price inflation fell to 16.61 per cent from 17.65 per cent in the previous week, government data showed today.        
	The government expects prices of essential items to fall further after the Met office forecast a normal monsoon.         
	The outlook is further brightened by the fact that a normal monsoon is predicted this year. Indications of softening of food inflation are clearly visible. It is expected that this decline will continue in the coming months uninterruptedly, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has said.        
	On an annual basis, potato prices fell 28 per cent because of a supply glut, while onions became cheaper by 10 per cent.

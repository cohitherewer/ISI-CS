                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Leave legacy
                                Please clarify whether leave salary and NSS are taxable in the hands of the legal heir of an employee?          Mandira Mitra, Belgachia
                    Leave salary is part of salary and, hence, is taxable in the hands of the employee during the employment period. However, if the cash equivalent of leave salary is paid to the legal heir on the death of the employee, the amount is not taxable in the hands of the legal heir. As regards to the payment of NSS, the Central Board of Direct Taxes had clarified through a circular in 1989 that the payment would not attract tax for the legal heir of an employee.                                  Bond show       What is the taxation rule for redemption or sale of zero coupon bond of Rural Electrification Corporation that has been notified by the CBDT?        Bimal Chakraborty, Calcutta
                    According to the notification, the bonds must have a tenure of 10 years; the bonds should be issued on or before March 2011; the number of bonds to be issued is 25 lakh; the amount to be paid on maturity or redemption of the bond will be Rs 30,000; and the total discount given shall be Rs 4,736.25 crore. The sale or redemption of the bond will be taxable in the hands of the bondholder. There will be short-term or long-term capital gains tax liability depending on whether the bond is held for less than a year or more than a year. If the bonds are held as stock in trade, the difference between the purchase price and the sale price will be considered as business income and will be taxed accordingly.                                  Deduction rule      Can I deduct the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) as expense from my capital gain from selling shares?        Akhilesh Sahu, Howrah
                    From financial year 2008-09 (that is assessment year 2009-10), STT has been allowed for deduction as expenses under Section 36 (xv) of the Income Tax Act. However, this deduction is available only in cases of income from share trading, speculative trading and derivative transactions. It is not allowed for deduction from capital gains under Section 48. Thus, if you are selling shares as investment, you shall not get the benefit of STT deduction.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Demat dilemma
                                I have a demat account with ICICI Bank for a long time. In spite of my repeated requests, the bank is not sending my closing balance of stock holdings as on March 31, 2007, March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009. All the charges associated with the demat account are being deducted from my savings account. I require the statement of closing balances for income tax purposes. I am told that a large sum will be deducted if I choose to close my account. I am a senior citizen. What should I do?          Sundar Nath Barick, Calcutta
                    You write a complaint letter to the bank branch and keep a copy of the letter duly acknowledging the receipt by the branch manager. You can also send an e-mail and keep a hard copy of the mail with you. Wait for a month for the bank to take action on your complaint. If the bank doesnt take any action or if the response is not to your satisfaction, approach the banking ombudsman at the regional office of the Reserve Bank of India on N.S. Road. The ombudsman will solve your problem then and there.                                  Hard to track      I earn monthly pension through an account with the SBI, Shalimar branch. I had invested money in three fixed deposits, one of them in 2007, with the bank branch. My total income is below the taxable limit. I was under the impression that Form 15H would not be obligatory because TDS would be applicable if the interest amount exceeded Rs 10,000 per year. Unfortunately, the bank branch deducted Rs 1,811 towards TDS. Had the bank done the right thing?        Pinaki Ranjan Khatua, Andul
                    As you said, you had three fixed deposit accounts with the bank, besides the savings-cum-pension account. The tax law says that TDS will be applicable if your total interest income from different accounts that you have with a particular bank branch exceeds Rs 10,000 in a financial year. It is not always possible for a bank to keep track of the total interest income for each and every customer from his/her different accounts. Thats why there is a provision that depositors whose annual income, including interest income from bank deposits, doesnt exceed the basic exemption limit should submit a declaration through Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source.

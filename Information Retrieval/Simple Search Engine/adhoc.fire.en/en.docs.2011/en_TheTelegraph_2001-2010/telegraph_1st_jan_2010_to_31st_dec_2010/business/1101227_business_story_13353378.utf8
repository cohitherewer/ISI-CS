	New Delhi, Dec. 26 (PTI): State-owned Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd (RCF) is conducting due diligence on a proposal to acquire a 25 per cent stake in a rock phosphate mine owned by Russias Acron Group for $366 million.        
	We have signed a confidentiality agreement with Acron Group to acquire 25 per cent equity in the Oleniy Ruchey rock phosphate mine in Russia. Acron is asking $366 million for the stake. We are carrying out due diligence, a top RCF official said.        
	Acron had secured the rights to develop the mine through an auction and the licence was issued in 2008. Rock phosphate is a key raw material in the manufacture of fertilisers such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and single super phosphate (SSP).        
	India imports over five million tonnes of rock phosphate every year, which account for over 90 per cent of the countrys annual requirement.        
	The phosphate project, located some 500 miles away from St. Petersburg, holds around 62 million tonnes of reserves. Acron began development activities on the project in 2008 and expects production to commence in the first half 2012. Acron has estimated the required investment in the first phase of the project at around $400 million, out of which $100 million have been spent.        
	We are carrying out due diligence. However, the price Acron has tagged for a 25 per cent stake in the mine is a bit too high. After the due diligence, if we find its okay, we will proceed, the official said.

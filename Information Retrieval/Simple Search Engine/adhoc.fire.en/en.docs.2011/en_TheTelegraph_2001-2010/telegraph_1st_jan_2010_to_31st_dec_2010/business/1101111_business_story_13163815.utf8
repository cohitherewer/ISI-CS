          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Raju in Hyderabad on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, Nov. 10: B. Ramalinga Raju, the prime accused in the Rs 6,700-crore Satyam Computer fraud, and five others today surrendered before a local court, just 72 days after their release in August.        
	CBI DIG (Hyderabad zone) V.V. Lakshmi Narayana said the accused would be in judicial custody till July and would not be able to apply for bail till then.        
	The CBI officer said Raju and the five other would be in Chanchalguda Central Prison, where they were lodged after their arrest last year.        
	After rejecting Rajus plea seeking an extension of todays deadline, the Supreme Court had directed Raju to surrender before the special court.        
	The accused are directed to surrender on or before November 10, otherwise the CBI shall take appropriate steps in accordance with law, the apex court had said.        
	Observing that the fraud eroded the corporate credibility of the nation, the apex court on October 26 had cancelled the bail granted to Raju by Andhra Pradesh High Court on August 18.        
	The CBI had contested his bail in the Supreme Court, arguing that Raju would scare away the witnesses as most of them were his ex-employees.         
	Besides Raju, the others who surrendered are his brother B. Rama Raju, former Satyam CFO V. Srinivas and three former employees of the IT firm  G. Ramakrishna, Venkatapathi Raju and Srisailam.         
	As soon as Raju arrived with his defence counsel and other accomplices at the court he was taken to a hospital for check-up by CBI officials. He was taken into custody after the court proceedings were completed.         
	The jail authorities said the tainted software tycoon would get all the benefits of B class political prisoners that he enjoyed during his earlier stay in 2009. He was permitted the use of a double-bed room for himself and his brother with a separate toilet and kitchen.         
	A pall of gloom had descended on Rajus bungalow at Jubilee Hills over the last few days.         
	Close members of the family, including his sons Ram Raju and Teja Raju, were with him on Tuesday.

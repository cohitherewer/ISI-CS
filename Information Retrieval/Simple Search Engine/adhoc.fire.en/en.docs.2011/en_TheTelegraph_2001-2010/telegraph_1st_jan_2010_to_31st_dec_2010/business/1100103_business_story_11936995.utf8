	New Delhi, Jan. 2: Ashok Leyland today said it would roll out 25 products in 18 months from its recently launched truck platform to compete with Tata Motors.        
	The company will also shift existing products to the new platform by 2013.        
	We have a large number of products coming from the new U-Truck platform. Starting April, we will launch 25 products in 18 months. Each model will have different variants, Ashok Leyland managing director R. Seshasayee told reporters here.        
	Ashok Leyland will initially manufacture U-Trucks at its new factory in Pantnagar, Uttarakhand. Production will begin by March. Later, the company plans to produce U-Trucks at its Hosur factory near Chennai.         
	The two units will have a combined capacity of 150,000 trucks and buses a year, Seshasayee said.        
	On the companys capital expenditure, Seshasayee said, In the next two years, there will be no major capacity expansions.         
	Last year, Leyland had reduced its capex by Rs 1,300 crore to Rs 2,000 crore for 2009-12 on account of a downturn in the commercial vehicle industry.        
	On the joint venture with Japans Nissan, Seshasayee said there would be no joint branding for light commercial vehicles.        
	Ashok Leyland and Nissan had announced three joint ventures in 2007 for making light commercial vehicles and co-develop, manufacture and market light trucks and engines for the local and international markets. It also had plans to set up a plant near Chennai at an investment of Rs 2,300 crore.        
	There will be no joint badging. Some products in the value segment will bear the Ashok Leyland name, while those in the niche segment will have a Nissan badge, Seshasayee said. The two firms will sell their respective products through their own networks.        
	Production will be split between two plants as land issues have not been sorted out. Some will roll out from the Hosur plant and some will come from Renault Nissans facility at Oragadam near Chennai. However, there could be a greenfield plant in the second phase and details will be worked out later, he said.        
	Ashok Leylands U-Truck is part of the companys plan to cash in on the potential growth in the segment with road infrastructure getting a boost from the government.        
	The company expects trucks to comprise 80 per cent of its total sales by 2013. The remaining 20 per cent of the sales will come from buses, Seshasayee said.        
	The company also expects to sell up to 68,000 trucks and buses in the current fiscal, Rajive Saharia, executive director of marketing, said.

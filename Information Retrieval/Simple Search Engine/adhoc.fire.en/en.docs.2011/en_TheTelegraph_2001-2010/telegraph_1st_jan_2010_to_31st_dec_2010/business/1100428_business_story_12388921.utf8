          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 27: The export duty on iron ore lumps will be raised to discourage bulk shipments, commerce minister Anand Sharma today said. The levy on iron ore fines, however, will remain unchanged.        
	There will be no increase in the export duty on iron ore fines, but there will be a marginal increase in the export duty on lumps, said Sharma.        
	Steel makers use the lumps, while the fines are primarily exported to countries such as China.         
	Steel firms have been lobbying for an increase in duty to stall excessive exports to foreign rivals and keep a check on domestic raw material prices.         
	The duty hike on the lumps may increase the availability of this mineral in the domestic market.         
	At present, iron ore is priced in the range of $120-160 per tonne, up 90 per cent from a year ago.        
	Steel prices are moving upwards on the back of a rise in the cost of vital raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal as well as high demand from automobile and infrastructure.        
	According to A. Sai Prathap, minister of state for steel, Steel demand is expected to grow at 9-10 per cent this financial year (over the last fiscal). Indias steel demand in 2009-10 rose 7.6 per cent to 56.32 million tonnes.        
	Cashing in on the rising demand and high cost of raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal, domestic steel producers such as Tata Steel and SAIL have increased prices by around Rs 6,000 a tonne since February. At present, steel prices in the domestic market are hovering in the range of Rs 29,000-50,000 a tonne.        
	The government at present levies an export duty of 10 per cent on iron ore lumps and 5 per cent on iron ore fines. Sources said the export duty on iron ore lumps could go up by another 5 per cent, but government officials would not confirm.        
	Last week, senior officials from the steel, mines, commerce and finance ministries discussed the issue of raising the export duty on the different types of iron ore.

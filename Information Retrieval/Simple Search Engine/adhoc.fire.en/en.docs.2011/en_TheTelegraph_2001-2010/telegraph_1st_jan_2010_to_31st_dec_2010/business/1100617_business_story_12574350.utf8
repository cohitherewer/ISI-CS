The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | July deadline for Fortis
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      July deadline for Fortis
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 16: Fortis Healthcare must make an offer by July 30 for the majority control of hospital chain Parkway Holdings, Singapore regulator Securities Industry Council said today.        
	In March, Fortis had acquired a 25 per cent stake in Singapore-based Parkway from TPG Capital (formerly Texas Pacific Group). The deal size was around $685.3 million (Rs 3,200 crore).        
	However, last month, Malaysian fund Khazanah, which holds a little over 24 per cent in Parkway, offered to pay S$3.76 per share to increase its stake in the hospital chain to 51.5 per cent.        
	The Securities Industry Council said Parkway shareholders should be given sufficient information, advice and time to enable them to reach an informed decision on the offer by Khazanah. Last week, Khazanah group entity Integrated Healthcare Holdings formally submitted documents to the Singapore stock exchange for the offer.        
	Fortis is expected to come up with a counter-offer soon. It has taken certain steps in this direction. On June 9, the company said it would raise up to Rs 2,750 crore from the securities market, apart from increasing its borrowing limit to Rs 6,000 crore.         
	Observers feel Fortis is building its war chest for a possible counter-offer. Recent reports indicate that the Indian firm has hired Macquarie, RBS and Religare Capital to raise funds. After the offer by Khazanah, Fortis Healthcare announced that it was keeping its options open in relation to the offer and it would continue to evaluate its options in the best interests of its shareholders.        
	Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley today said one of its investment arms  FrontPoint Management  has bought 1.15 lakh shares in Parkway at S$3.77 per share.        
	With this, the total number of shares held by Morgan Stanley in the Singapore-based healthcare provider has gone up to 3.9 lakh shares. Morgan Stanley had acquired 1.1 lakh shares of Parkway at S$3.84 apiece last week. Morgan Stanley is the independent financial adviser to Parkway for Khazanahs partial offer.

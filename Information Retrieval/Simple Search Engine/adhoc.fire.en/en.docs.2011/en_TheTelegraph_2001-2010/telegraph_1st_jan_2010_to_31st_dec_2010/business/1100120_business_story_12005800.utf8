The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | India-EU meet next week on trade pact
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      India-EU meet next week on trade pact
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: Indian and European Union officials will begin negotiations to narrow down their differences over market access and intellectual property rights, leading to a possible free trade pact by the end of this year.        
	The eighth round of talks will be held in Delhi between January 25 and 29.         
	Daniele Smadja, the head of the European Commissions delegation to India, said she was hopeful of progress now because of the political impetus from an India-EU summit late last year and removal of uncertainties over the appointment of the new European Union trade commissioner.        
	So we know what are the objectives which were reconfirmed at the highest level during the summit. On the European side we have confirmed that our mandate is coming from the member states, our mandate didnt change when we changed trade commissioners from Peter Mandelson to Cathy Ashton ... to Karel de Gucht, Smadja told reporters.        
	The talks are taking place as differences persist over non-trade issues raised by the EU such as child labour and human rights.        
	Commerce ministry officials said India has taken a position to keep non-trade issues outside the ambit of the free trade agreement. Analysts said EUs constant focus on these issues could derail talks.

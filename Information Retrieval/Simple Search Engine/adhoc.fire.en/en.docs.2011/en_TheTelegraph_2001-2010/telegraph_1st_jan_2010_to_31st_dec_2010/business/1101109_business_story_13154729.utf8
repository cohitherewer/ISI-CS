          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Nov. 8: The trial of the Rs 6,760-crore Satyam Computer Services scam started today with the CBI submitting a list of witnesses for examination before the court.         
	Of the six witnesses  all bank officials  to be examined today, only one was examined.        
	Former Satyam chairman B. Ramalinga Raju, his elder brother Rama Raju, former chief financial officer Vadlamani Srinivas were among those who attended the hearing.        
	This is Rajus first appearance before the special CBI court after his bail was cancelled by the Supreme Court last month. Raju and five others have to surrender before the court by Wednesday.         
	The Supreme Court had directed the trial be completed before July 2011.         
	The CBI had wanted to interrogate 697 witnesses and examine 3,057 documents in the court.        
	However, the CBI today said it would considerably reduce the number of witnesses to around 300 and documents to 1,000 once their petition to do so is okayed by the court concerned.        
	Raju seeks time        
	B. Ramalinga Raju has approached the Supreme Court seeking extension of time beyond Wednesday to surrender. His application, however, does not state anything on the time he needs to surrender.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Prepaid meter rollout hits a hurdle

	Calcutta, Nov. 29: The introduction of prepaid electricity meters all over Bengal will take time because of technical glitches faced by the distributors.        
	While the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (WBERC) has ordered a flat tariff irrespective of the energy units consumed for 2010-11, distributors said an all-Bengal rollout of prepaid meters would not be possible soon as they needed to first resolve the technical difficulties in the meters, particularly in the reading of electricity duty.        
	There are some technical problems in the rolling out of a prepaid metering system across the state and we are taking up the issue with the regulator and the government, said Anirban Guha, director of West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (WBSEDCL).         
	WBERC chairperson Prasad Ranjan Roy, however, said WBSEDCL had no problems in introducing the system, while CESC had some technical glitches to sort out.        
	According to Guha, a former adviser (tariff) with the WBERC, There are problems pertaining to electricity duty. At present, consumers using up to 300 units of energy a month dont pay the duty, while others do. This difference poses a problem for the prepaid metering system.        
	Users consuming more than 300 units per month pay an electricity duty at the rate of 10 per cent on the energy bill. According to sources, WBSEDCL will suggest a flat 5 per cent duty irrespective of the units consumed to resolve this problem.         
	WBSEDCL also wants to have its own server and proprietary software to run the system.         
	Negotiations with metering system providers are taking time, said WBSEDCL chairman and managing director Malay Kumar De.        
	De, who is now the power secretary of the state, said, While an all-Bengal rollout of prepaid metering system may take another year or so, to start with we plan to introduce the meters on a larger scale in Salt Lake.         
	In its tariff order for 2010-11, the WBERC fixed a duty of Rs 4 per unit for domestic consumers and three duty slabs for commercial subscribers depending on the time of use.        
	Earlier, prepaid meter users used to get a marginal discount on their bills, while paying the same rate of tariff as post-paid users.

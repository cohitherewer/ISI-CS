The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Didi no bar to divestment
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Didi no bar to divestment
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Banerjee: Close watch                                  
	New Delhi, June 11: The finance ministry will go ahead with its plans to sell stakes in a number of state-run firms, including SAIL and Engineers India Ltd, despite Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjees opposition to the Coal India public issue.        
	The ministry looks to take the opposition to divestment in Coal India in its stride and will concentrate on fulfiling a criterion that calls upon firms listed on the bourses to offload 25 per cent equity.         
	Sources said Mamatas opposition to bringing state-run companies to the market would not stymie the governments plans.         
	Mamata is opposed to divestment in what she considers core areas.         
	However, she may not object to minor stake sales or even fresh divestments in entities that are not in the core areas.         
	Finance ministry officials said she was expected to stay away from cabinet committee meetings on divestment unless they concerned PSUs that were of immediate concern to her, such as Coal India.        
	Coal Indias headquarters are in Calcutta, and the PSUs unions have been meeting her regularly to stall the exercise.         
	The government misread her determination to stop this sale which is on her home turf. It went ahead with appointing merchant bankers, actions which she did not respond to, though she mentally noted them for further action, said Trinamul sources.         
	The DMK has similar objections to any sale in Neyveli Lignite Corporation. Though Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaiks BJD is not part of the ruling coalition, he has objections to the sale of a stake in Nalco and is expected to lobby Mamata and the DMK to help him stop the sale in the aluminium major.         
	However, North Block believes Mamata will not interfere in listed firms as this is a legal requirement. New rules announced last week make it mandatory for all listed state-run companies as well as private firms to maintain a public holding of at least 25 per cent, and to attain that level by selling at least 5 per cent stake every year.         
	The value of stocks of state-run firms to be sold in the current year is over Rs 44,000 crore against a government divestment target of Rs 40,000 crore. Over a five-year period, the government could actually earn at least Rs 1,24,000 crore.

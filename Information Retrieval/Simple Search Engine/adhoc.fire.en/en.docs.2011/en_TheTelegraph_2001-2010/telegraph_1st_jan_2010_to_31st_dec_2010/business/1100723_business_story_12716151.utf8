          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, July 22: JSW Steel today said its board would meet on Tuesday to raise resources by issuing equity shares or other convertible instruments on a preferential basis to a strategic investor.         
	The announcement has fuelled speculations that JFE Steel Corporation of Japan will pick up a stake in the Sajjan Jindal firm.         
	It is learnt that JFE will pick up a little over 14 per cent in JSW Steel at a price of over Rs 1,400 per share, which will help the Indian steel firm raise nearly Rs 5,000 crore.        
	JSW Steel today gained Rs 26.50, or 2.26 per cent, on the Bombay Stock Exchange to close at Rs 1,201.25.        
	Industry observers rule out the possibility of JFE making an open offer as its stake will not cross the 15 per cent mark.        
	Talks of JFE picking up a stake in JSW Steel have been doing the rounds since the companies joined hands in November.         
	Areas of collaboration include JSW Steel using JFEs technology to produce auto-grade steel in India. The duo had said they would explore the possibility of picking up equity stakes in each other.        
	Besides auto steel, the companies will explore opportunities in other segments of steel making. They will undertake energy reduction and environmental programmes and procure raw materials both within India and overseas.        
	Last month, JSW Steel vice-chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal had said the companys Bengal project at Salboni and the Jharkhand project  both in Maoist zones  were making good progress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stake sale before Anil tower IPO
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stake sale before Anil tower IPO
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Deal talks                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Communications is likely to sell a 5 per cent stake in its tower unit Reliance Infratel before the planned initial public offering.        
	Banking sources said the company had begun talks with strategic and financial investors and was hoping to raise about Rs 2,500 crore from the proposed sale.        
	JM Financial is the lead manager for the stake sale; JP Morgan, Enam Financial, Deutsche Bank, ICICI Securities and HSBC are the co-lead managers.        
	A company spokesperson declined to comment citing Sebi guidelines that bar an entity from disclosing information about itself after getting approval for an IPO.        
	Last week, Sebi okayed R-Coms proposal to sell 10 per cent in its tower unit  Reliance Infratel.         
	Sources said the IPO could raise up to Rs 5,000 crore for a 10 per cent stake, valuing the company at Rs 50,000 crore.        
	In 2007, R-Com sold 5 per cent in Infratel for Rs 1,400 crore to seven financial investors  George Soros, HSBC, Fortress Capital, New Silk, Galleon, DA Capital and GLG Capital  in a deal valuing the firm at Rs 28,000 crore.         
	In 2007-08, the tower subsidiary had a revenue of Rs 1,500 crore, which more than tripled to Rs 5,000 crore in 2008-09. In the same period, the net profit rose five-fold to Rs 1,700 crore.         
	If the pre-IPO talks materialise into a stake sale and the planned 10 per cent IPO takes place, then R-Coms stake will reduce to 80 per cent.        
	Reliance Infratel has 50,000 towers and optic backhaul infrastructure in 25,000 towns and 600,000 villages. At present, two mobile operators use its towers. The company expects to bring in 4-7 more as new players roll out services.        
	Many mobile operators are operating their towers as standalone entities.         
	Bharti Airtel, Vodafone-Essar and Idea Cellular in 2007 came together and decided to spin off their towers into an independent company  Indus Towers  that has over 100,000 towers.        
	GTL Infrastructure had announced last week the acquisition of Aircel Cellulars tower business in a Rs 8,400-crore all-cash deal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Patel talks tough on airfares
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Patel talks tough on airfares
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Patel: Stern stand                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 13: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel today said he was not fully satisfied with the steps taken by airlines to reduce fares and asked them to further lower tariff rates.         
	We have already advised airlines to do further (in this regard), Patel told newspersons after a meeting of the newly-formed civil aviation economic advisory council.        
	Airlines had brought down spot fares by 20-30 per cent from those ruling in mid-November after the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) hinted at tough steps if immediate action was not taken.         
	Airlines, which were charging between Rs 9,000 and Rs 17,000 for spot fares on the Delhi-Calcutta route in mid-November, had filed plans to raise this to Rs 40,000. They are now charging between Rs 5,500 and Rs 10,400 for flights within 24 hours.         
	These rates are similar to those charged in the first two weeks of November. However, they are higher than the fares in the festival month of October.        
	Prior to the intervention of the DGCA, airlines, in filings with the government, had said that for spot fares they could even charge Rs 40,000 on distances more than 1,400 kilometres.         
	Patel said the DGCA could take further action under Rule 135 of aircraft rules, which dealt with transparency in publishing airfares.         
	The DGCA had advised airlines to ensure transparency by keeping passengers informed about the tariffs available sector-wise and date-wise in a simple language.         
	It had said high fares were hurting not only tourists but also business travellers.        
	The advisory committee today decided to set up a working group to work out a new method of fixing rates.         
	However, critics said the advisory body, comprising bureaucrats, airline representatives and consumer forums, did not have the independence of a regulator. It would function only as an adjunct to a government office  the DGCA.

	Calcutta, July 25: More than half of the policyholders stop renewing their insurance cover after the initial four or five years.         
	Persistency over the last five years shows a declining trend and this is a concern for the life insurance business, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has observed.         
	Persistency is the proportion of policies that remain in force till the end to the total number policies sold in a given period. It is the percentage of business retained without policies lapsing or being surrendered. A high persistency means low lapses and vice-versa.         
	For most private life insurance companies, 15-20 per cent of the policies sold do not get renewed after the first year itself. The lapse rate increases to more than 30 per cent for two-year old policies.         
	Mis-selling and the tendency to invest in the short term are the main reasons for rising policy lapses, said P. Nandagopal, managing director and chief executive officer of IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company  a joint venture of Bank of Baroda, Andhra Bank and UKs Legal amp; General.        
	Insurance agents are under pressure to meet targets and hold on to their licences. They sell the policies, particularly unit-linked plans, without paying heed to the risk profile and financial strength of customers many of whom fail to continue with the premium payment.         
	High attrition of agents also leads to policy lapses. The IRDAs move to set performance parameters for agents  the minimum number of policies to be sold every year is 20 and the minimum premium income to be procured is Rs 1,50,000  is a fresh blow to agents. Lower commission on Ulip sales from September will also act as a deterrent.         
	These are days of high regulations, said Ashvin Parekh, partner and national leader (global financial services), Ernst amp; Young Pvt Ltd. But it seems that the insurance regulator is making stipulations while further moving away the goal posts.        
	According to Parekh, high lapses will affect the valuations of life insurance companies that are planning to enter the capital market. Only new businesses, including all renewals, are considered for the valuation of an insurance company.         
	The embedded value is the net present value of future cash flows from policies sold by a life insurance company, said Nandagopal. An insurer doesnt get any income from a lapsed policy. Hence, the higher the lapse rate, the lower will be the profitability and embedded value of an insurer.        
	The IRDA said because of selective withdrawals, the average mortality of the remaining policyholders would make premiums insufficient to cover the risk.         
	Poor persistency renders the loading of expense in the premium per policy insufficient, leaving the extra burden not only on the insurance company but also making insurance costlier for new policyholders, the regulator noted.        
	Prospective policy buyers should examine whether an insurer has a high or low persistency ratio. Low persistency means the premium cost will not only be higher, but also the chances of repudiating claims will be higher.

	Calcutta, July 14: Exide Industries will invest Rs 600-650 crore in the next two years to meet growing demand.         
	Indias largest lead-acid storage battery manufacturer, both in the automobile and industrial segments, will invest Rs 400 crore in all its plants this year and the rest in the next fiscal.         
	The expansion will create a 15-20 per cent capacity hike in all segments, except two-wheelers. Production of batteries for two-wheelers will go up more  as much as 60 per cent  with the commencement of operations in the Ahmedabad plant from next month.        
	Exide also plans to ramp up the procurement of recycled lead, T.V. Ramanathan, managing director and chief executive officer of the company, said. The company targets to increase the use of recycled lead in the next two to three years by 70 per cent from 42 per cent now.

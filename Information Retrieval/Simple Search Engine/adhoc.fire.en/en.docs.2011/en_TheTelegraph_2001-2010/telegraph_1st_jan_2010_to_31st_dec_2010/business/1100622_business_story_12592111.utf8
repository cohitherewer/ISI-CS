The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deora wants states to trim tax on fuel
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Deora wants states to trim tax on fuel
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Balancing act                                  
	New Delhi, June 21: The petroleum ministry has asked states to cut local taxes on petrol and diesel and make duties specific rather than ad valorem. Analysts say this can mitigate the impact of a price hike when the Centre goes for a free market pricing regime for fuel.         
	VAT/sales tax rates are very high in most of the states, and need to be reduced. Ad valorem taxes imposed by the state governments aggravate the impact of international oil prices on the consumer. Levying specific tax rates instead will help cushion the effect of a rise in global oil prices, petroleum minister Murli Deora said in a letter to the chief ministers of states.        
	He said the high level of local taxes on petroleum products were clearly unsustainable, if we are to protect the interests of the consumers, particularly the vulnerable sections of society.         
	According to analysts, by asking the states to part with some of their revenues, Deora was paving the way for implementing the recommendations of the Kirit Parikh committee on free market pricing of petrol and diesel.         
	If the UPA goes ahead with freeing prices, it can result in a hike of up to Rs 3.80 a litre.        
	The empowered group of ministers, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, could not go ahead with the fuel reforms as Congresss allies such as the Trinamul Congress, NCP and DMK were opposed to any hike at a time general inflation was in double digits and food inflation hovered around 17 per cent.        
	Analysts said the letter to the states was an attempt by the oil minister to suggest that they could not cry foul and earn higher revenues at the same time. Deora said in some states, taxes on petrol and diesel were as high as 33 per cent and 24.69 per cent, respectively.         
	The three oil firms IOC, BPCL and HPCL are losing over Rs 200 crore per day on selling fuel below imported cost. If prices were kept unchanged, their losses could touch Rs 90,000 crore in this fiscal.

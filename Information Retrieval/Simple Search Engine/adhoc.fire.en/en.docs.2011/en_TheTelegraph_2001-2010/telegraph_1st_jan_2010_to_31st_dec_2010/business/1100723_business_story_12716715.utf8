          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Thursday. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	New Delhi, July 22: New units in upcoming SEZs will enjoy income tax exemptions for some time even after the implementation of the proposed direct taxes code (DTC) next year, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.        
	When asked about the fate of new units in existing SEZs once DTC comes into force, Mukherjee said, For them also, certain extra time will be given.        
	According to the revised DTC draft, which will replace the Income Tax Act of 1961 after approval by Parliament, exemptions will be provided only to existing special economic zone (SEZ) units and not to new units. DTC is likely to come into effect from April 1, 2011.        
	Of the 580 approved special economic zones, only 111 are operational.         
	An SEZ is considered operational if at least one unit in it has started exports.        
	Mukherjees assurance could provide comfort to SEZ players who were worried about the continuance of the present 10-year tax holiday for SEZs once the income tax act was replaced by DTC.        
	The SEZ promoters had expressed concern that no new units would come forward to set up business in the special economic zones in the absence of the income tax benefits.        
	GST boost        
	The government today said the successful implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) could give a trillion-dollar boost to the economy, taking the countrys total output to $2 trillion within a short time.        
	The gain from GST will propel the country from a $1-trillion economy to $2 trillion in a short span of time, Mukherjee said at a function organised by Ficci.         
	GST will subsume all indirect levies such as excise, VAT and local taxes. At present, the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the sum of total goods and services produced in a year, is over $1 trillion (Rs 58.68 lakh crore). The proposed GST will provide a level playing field to domestic producers besides stimulating the economy by removing tax distortions and tax competitions, Mukherjee said.        
	The successful implementation of GST will create win-win situations for the Centre, states, industry and consumers, the minister said.        
	Mukherjee had yesterday proposed three GST rates  20 per cent for general goods, 12 per cent for essentials and 16 per cent for various services  to be shared equally between the Centre and states.

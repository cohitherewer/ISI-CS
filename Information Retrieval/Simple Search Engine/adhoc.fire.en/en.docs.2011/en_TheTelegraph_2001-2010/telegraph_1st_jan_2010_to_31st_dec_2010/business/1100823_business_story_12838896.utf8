                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      No respite now
                                I am 54 years old. I got an interest income of more than Rs 1,90,000 from my late husbands deposits. I invested Rs 50,000 in NSC. I submitted Form 15G to my bank but it didnt accept it because my interest income was higher than the basic exemption limit for women. Now I have to claim the refund of the TDS. Is there any way to avoid non-deduction of tax at source?          Mita Ganguly, Ballygunge
                    No. There is no way out. You shall have to live with this harassment for this financial year. Next year, when the new direct tax law become effective, you may get some relief because the government is expected to increase the basic exemption limit on income.                                  Return rate calculator      I am a housewife. I wish to invest in an equity fund. How is the average return for different years calculated?        S. Chatterjee, Khidderpore
                    The return of a mutual fund scheme for different time periods that you see published in various newspapers, magazines and websites are not the average return but the compounded annual growth (decline) rate in return. It is not an easy calculation. However, several websites, such as www.moneychimp.com, have return rate calculators where you yourself can do it. In a compound interest rate calculator, you can calculate how much your investment will grow over a defined time period at a given rate.                                  Number crunching      I am a college student. I wish to invest in an equity mutual fund. The returns of a fund are 41.10 per cent in one year, 14.10 per cent in three years and 26.73 per cent in five years. If I had invested Rs 10,000 five years ago, what would be my redemption amount after one year, three years and five years?        Sudip Banerjee, Khidderpore
                    If you had you invested Rs 10,000 a year ago, it will become Rs 14,110 now at a return rate of 41.10 per cent. A rate of 14.10 per cent in three years means you will get Rs 14,854 now. A return rate of 26.73 per cent in five years means the Rs 10,000 you had invested would become Rs 32,689 now.

          SAMBIT SAHA                          Room for more                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 17: City-based real estate developer Bluechip Projects Pvt Ltd is bringing worlds largest hotel chain Wyndham Hotel Group to Bengal.        
	The US-based company has signed a definitive agreement with Bluechip to use one of its brand names to the latters upcoming hotel in Asansol.        
	Wyndham has over 7,000 hotels offering 581,000 rooms and operating under several brands  from the upscale Wyndham Grand Collection and mid-scale Ramada to Days Inn in the economy category and budget class Super 8.        
	Only Intercontinental Hotels Group has more rooms than Wyndham though it operates around 4,000 properties.        
	Wyndham, which earns $4.4 billion in revenues, runs 12 hotels in India mostly under the Ramada brand in Mumbai, Delhi, Goa and Bangalore among others. Seven more projects are under construction.        
	Bluechip plans to start work on the Asansol hotel within the next two to three months. It has finalised the design and drawing, which have been approved by Wyndham.        
	The plan has been submitted to the Asansol Municipal Corporation for sanction. I hope to complete the project by the end of 2012 even as the target launch date is a year later, Ritwik Das, managing director of Bluechip Projects, said.        
	The 100-cottah plot is located on National Highway 2. The local developer has taken it from the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority on a 99-year lease with an option to renew it for another 99 years.        
	Around Rs 25 crore will be invested in the project. Branded as Day Hotel, it will be a 100-room property. The developer plans to kick off with 60 rooms and add another 40 rooms later.        
	According to the franchisee agreement, Wyndham will provide the technical support and will include the property within its marketing network. The developer will own and operate it.        
	Das said an extensive survey had been carried out to gauge the potential of a business hotel in the Asansol region. There are no similar properties nearby except Peerless and Rose Valley (erstwhile Ginger) in Durgapur. However, this is the first time an international brand has shown interest in that region.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Jan. 21: ICICI Banks third-quarter net profit dropped 13.4 per cent to Rs 1,101 crore from Rs 1,272 crore in the same period last year on account of treasury losses caused by a fall in the prices of government bonds.         
	During the third quarter, treasury income showed a loss of Rs 26 crore against a gain of Rs 976 crore in the same period last year as yields on government securities went up on worries that the RBI would hike interest rates. Yields on government securities are inversely related to their prices.         
	The profits were in line with analyst estimates. In its core business, ICICI posted a net interest income (NII) of Rs 2,058 crore, up from Rs 1,990 crore in the corresponding period last year. NII is interest earned minus interest paid on deposits and instruments.         
	Fee income went up to Rs 1,422 crore (Rs 1,347 crore), while non-interest income was lower at Rs 1,673 crore (Rs 2,515 crore) because of the losses on trading in government bonds. ICICI Bank said during the quarter it saw sustained growth in savings and current account deposits.         
	Banks have been laying stress on deposits to lower their cost of funds. Total deposits were Rs 1,97,653 crore on December 31.        
	ONGC gain        
	The net profit of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) jumped 23.4 per cent to Rs 3,053.58 crore in the third quarter.         
	ONGC attributed the good show to lower payouts to state-owned oil refiners, for selling fuel below cost, and higher crude oil prices.Turnover was up 23.6 per cent to Rs 15,506.14 crore in the October-December quarter.         
	However, the state-run explorer is likely to fall short of its production target of 25.76 million tonnes for the current fiscal by one million tonne, chairman R.S. Sharma said. Production is declining faster than estimated. Production is definitely under a lot of pressure.         
	Kingfisher loss        
	Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines has reported a higher net loss in the third quarter of this fiscal, though it has taken more passengers.        
	The airline recorded a net loss of Rs 420 crore during the three months ended December 2009, 2 per cent higher than the third quarter of 2008-09. Net income fell over 6 per cent to Rs 1,352 crore from Rs 1,448 crore as the airline cut capacity by 19 per cent.

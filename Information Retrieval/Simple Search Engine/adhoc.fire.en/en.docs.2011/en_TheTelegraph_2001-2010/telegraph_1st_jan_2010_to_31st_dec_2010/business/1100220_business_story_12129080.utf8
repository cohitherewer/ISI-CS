The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti rating under S amp;P watch
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bharti rating under S amp;P watch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Feb. 19: Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) has placed Bharti Airtels long-term corporate rating on credit watch with negative implications.         
	Bharti has bid $10.7 billion to buy the African assets of Kuwaits Zain, and the two sides are in exclusive discussions till March 25.         
	The credit watch reflects our expectation of a significant deterioration in Bhartis cash flow protection measures and a weakening of its business risk profile if it acquires Zain Africa BV, S amp;Ps credit analyst Yasmin Wirjawan said. The agency said a debt-funded acquisition and the near-term 3G licence auction could further increase the companys consolidated debt         
	Bhartis business risk profile could weaken because of the macro-economic and political risks associated with, and the lower profitability of Zain Africas operations, Wirjawan said.         
	Zain Africas EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margins were about 33 per cent for the nine months ended September 30, against Bhartis 45 per cent for the 12 months ended December 31.         
	According to S amp;P, the deal will provide Bharti with meaningful growth opportunities in Africa, which has a relatively low mobile penetration. Zain Africa has close to 42 million subscribers. The Bharti scrip today closed at Rs 278.25, down 1.01 per cent from its previous close on the BSE.

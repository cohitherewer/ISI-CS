The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | StanChart rights to raise $5bn
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      StanChart rights to raise $5bn
                              Money matters                            
	Hong Kong/London, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered has launched a $5.3-billion rights issue to bolster its finances for new capital rules and provide the firepower to take advantage of growth opportunities.        
	The bank said it made record profits and income in the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year. Income in the third quarter rose faster than in the first-half, and trading levels were almost back to levels before the financial crisis, it said.        
	StanChart wants to continue to seize opportunities across Asia, Africa and the West Asia, it said, adding that the new capital rules could have constrained its asset growth unless new cash was raised. Its to safeguard the banks ability to grow, to take advantage of the opportunities in our markets, while also meeting the anticipated changes in the regulatory world, CEO Peter Sands said.        
	He dismissed rumours that the cash would be used for a big deal, such as in South Africa. This is not a war chest for acquisitions.         
	Analysts said the move should be well supported by investors, and it sent a signal that Britain and some other countries would apply tougher capital rules than the new global standard.         
	Clearly the message is that the UK regulator may be accelerating the Basel III implementation timetable, said Joseph Dickerson, analyst at Execution in London.        
	Regulators, seeking to prevent a repeat of the global credit crisis, agreed to force banks to raise the amount of top-quality capital, which they must hold in reserve.        
	StanChart, based in London but deriving over three quarter of its profits in Asia, follows Deutsche Bank in raising capital because of the new rules, after the flagship German lender this month raised 10.2 billion euros ($14.2 billion), partly to lift capital.         
	By 0800 GMT StanCharts London shares were down 3.7 per cent at 1,837 pence, valuing the bank at 37 billion. Its Hong Kong-listed shares were down 1.3 per cent at HK $227.        
	StanChart said it would offer shareholders the right to buy one new share for every eight shares held at a price of 1,280 pence, a steep 33 per cent discount to Tuesdays close.        
	The banks core tier one capital ratio of 9 per cent at the end of June was comfortably above the new global minimum of 7 per cent. The rights issue will raise that level to about 11 per cent, although that would dip to 10 per cent after applying a higher risk weighting to its assets under the new Basel rules.        
	Basel regulations will be difficult for some western banks and they want to jump ahead of the line in raising capital before some of the European banks do that, CLSA analyst Daniel Tabbush said.

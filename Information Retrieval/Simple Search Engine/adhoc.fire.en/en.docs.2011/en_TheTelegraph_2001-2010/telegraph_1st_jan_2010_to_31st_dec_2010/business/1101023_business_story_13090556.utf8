The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wipro fails to cheer 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Wipro fails to cheer 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Azim Premji in Bangalore on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 22: Azim Premji-controlled Wipro disappointed the Street with a 10 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 1,285 crore during the second quarter ended September.        
	The markets showed their disapproval as the stock fell nearly 5 per cent to Rs 448.40 today on the BSE. The disappointment was palpable as other IT firms such as TCS and Infosys have beaten analyst expectations quite comfortably.        
	The Bangalore-based software firm, with interest in IT products, lighting and consumer goods, saw operating margins for IT services decline because of lower forex realisations as the rupee appreciated against the dollar and wages increased.        
	Total revenue rose 12 per cent to Rs 7,731 crore. IT services, which represented 74 per cent of total revenue and 91 per cent of operating income, stood at Rs 5,747 crore, an increase of 15 per cent over the same period last year.        
	We saw strong growth momentum in demand as customers tried to catch up with the under investment in IT in the previous years, chairman Azim Premji said.         
	While the macro environment continues to remain uncertain, there is a higher degree of confidence at the micro level. For the quarter ended December 31, we expect revenue from IT services to be in the range of $1,317-1,343 million, a sequential rise of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent, he said.         
	An analyst at a Mumbai-based brokerage termed the guidance as muted.        
	During the reporting quarter, Wipro added 2,975 employees, taking the total number of IT services employees to 1,15,900.         
	The IT services business added 29 clients and recorded a 6.6 per cent volume growth during the period.

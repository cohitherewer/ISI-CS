	Hyderabad, April 20: The Ambani brothers have been trumped in the big bucks game of spousal generosity on birthdays.

	Reddys generosity overshadows two famous birthday bestowals: the first was by Mukesh Ambani who had given wife Nita a Rs 240-crore Airbus plane on her 44th birthday.         
	Brother Anil had gone one better in 2008 when he gave wife Tina a Rs 400-crore luxury yacht.         
	Closer home, a local politician had given away 5 acres of prime urban land in Hyderabad in 2002 when the land costs had shot up to Rs 15 crore per acre.         
	Hyderabad has witnessed ostentatious displays of spousal affection in the past. The last Nizam Osman Ali Pasha had presented a palace, 100 kg of gold, 100 horses and 1,000 slaves to his favourite queen Durru Shah on her 40th birthday.         
	Gift tax was abolished in September 1998.

          JAYATI GHOSE                          IN SEARCH OF ANSWERS                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: BlackBerry maker Research in Motion (RIM) is likely to get time beyond the August 31 deadline to provide a monitoring system for corporate emails sent through BlackBerrys.        
	The government had earlier said the BlackBerry services might be banned if the Canadian firm failed to provide a solution to the security agencies by August 31.        
	Officials from the home ministry and the department of telecom (DoT) will be holding a series of meetings with RIM over the next few days.        
	While a monitoring solution is expected by Monday, it will have to be vetted by security agencies before a final system to decode emails in real time is put in place. That will take some time. Till then, it is unlikely that services will be curtailed, sources told The Telegraph.        
	Depending on the outcome of the meetings, the deadline can be extended as it is a complex technical issue, the officials added.        
	The discussions are moving in a positive direction. We expect a solution by Monday, said a DoT official present at the meeting today.        
	RIM proposal        
	RIM offered on Thursday to lead an industry forum to look at Indias need to have lawful access to BlackBerrys encrypted mail and messenger, according to Reuters.        
	RIM will lead an industry forum focused on supporting the lawful access needs of law enforcement agencies while preserving the legitimate information security needs of corporations and other organisations in India, the firm said in a statement.        
	Security agencies want to get information on encrypted emails exchanged between two BlackBerrys as and when they are sent.

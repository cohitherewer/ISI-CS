          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: The Railway Board has approved plans to implement a nationwide real-time tracking system  satellite imaging for rail navigation (Simran)  to prevent accidents.        
	The project, which can reduce accidents at unmanned level crossings, and warn of collisions, went through exhaustive trials and will be implemented in a phased manner over two years, sources said.        
	The implementation cost is being worked out, and Simran is likely to be installed by the end of 2012-13. Initial estimates indicate that it can cost around Rs 1,000 crore.         
	Simran is a satellite-based railway tracking system that uses the global positioning system and general packet radio service used in mobile technologies to provide information about the location of trains and the direction they are heading. The information will be displayed at stations for official use.         
	The Sam Pitroda-led expert committee on ICT favoured the implementation of the project, which could be a boon for efficient freight handling and safe passenger services.        
	Officials said the railways were yet to completely replace manual tracking of trains. Station masters call up the control room at the divisional headquarters every time a train passes their station.         
	Till November, the information used to be manually plotted on a map.         
	Now computers do the mapping, but the system still relies on the calls of the station masters, which makes the tracking tardy and even inaccurate at times.        
	Simran was proposed in 2002, and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur took three years to develop it. Pilot projects began in 2005, but so far it has been installed on 70 trains running from New Delhi, including some Shatabdi, Garib Rath and Duronto trains.        
	For the nationwide implementation, the railways have to install the devices in about 7,000 locomotives and similar number of stations.        
	Simran will be in addition to the anti-collision devices (ACD) that the railways plan to install in all locomotives.         
	The network of ACD system prevents high-speed collisions in mid-sections, station areas and at level-crossings.        
	Officials said the results of the ACD tests in the Arakkonam area of Southern Railway were being studied, and the road map for its implementation would be drawn out depending on the findings.         
	The installation of ACD could have prevented the latest accidents between Uttarbanga Express and Vananchal Express at Sainthia in Bengal and the ramming of a goods train on the stationary Indore-Gwalior Intercity Express in Madhya Pradesh.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 22: The Bombay Stock Exchange today upped the ante in its battle with the National Stock Exchange when it slashed the membership deposit and fee requirements for new members.         
	Under the new plan, membership can be obtained by paying a deposit of Rs 10 lakh instead of the existing Rs 1 crore. In addition, they will have to pay just Rs 1 lakh upfront against Rs 5 lakh earlier.        
	The BSE has been taking various steps to close the gap with its rival.         
	Its latest move comes at a time the stock markets are ruling strong with the economy recovering and foreign institutional investors putting in huge sums of money. It is felt that more individuals, corporate houses and partnerships would now be keen on a membership.        
	The BSE said it had not only reduced the membership deposit but also relaxed other fees that new members had to pay.         
	The base minimum capital requirement for new members has been relaxed. Though the base minimum capital remains at Rs 10 lakh, earlier this had to be maintained in cash only.         
	The bourse now says that Rs 1.25 lakh should be in cash and Rs 8.25 lakh can be in cash equivalents.        
	By offering this exciting pricing scheme, we intend to make it affordable to all those aspiring for BSE membership. We hope this new scheme will generate a good response from the market participants, building and expanding our existing membership base to promote financial inclusion, said Madhu Kannan, managing director and CEO of the bourse.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Regulatory failures ruled out in Citi fraud
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Regulatory failures ruled out in Citi fraud
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pranab: Allaying fears                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: The government today dismissed charges of a systemic failure and described the multi-crore fraud at Citibank as an individual misdemeanour.         
	There are routine regulations and all other precautions are being taken, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said about the alleged fraud at Citibank, which is feared to run into hundreds of crores.         
	If there is any individual misdemeanour, it has to be acted on. The law will take its own course of action, Mukherjee said, seeking to reassure investors on money kept with the banking system.        
	The fraud is said to be the handiwork of Citibank employee Shivraj Puri, who has allegedly forged a Sebi letter to lend credence to fake schemes that he sold to unsuspecting investors.         
	The money that individual investors placed with him was transferred to other accounts and withdrawn.         
	Citi said it had initiated a probe recently into suspicious transactions, which led to Puri. It is investigating the fraud and has assured customers that their money was safe.         
	This issue does not impact other accounts, transactions or customers of the bank, a senior official of the bank said.         
	Police sources said the scam, initially thought to be worth Rs 100 crore, could actually run into a larger sum. Around 30 high net worth clients of the bank had been affected.         
	A police officer supervising the fraud said most of the corporates which invested the amount with Puri belonged to the Hero group, according to PTI. Naveen Munjal of Hero Exports alone had given around Rs 50 crore to Puri for further investment, the officer said. Neither Munjal nor group spokesperson could be contacted.         
	The Haryana police have issued a lookout circular for Puri.

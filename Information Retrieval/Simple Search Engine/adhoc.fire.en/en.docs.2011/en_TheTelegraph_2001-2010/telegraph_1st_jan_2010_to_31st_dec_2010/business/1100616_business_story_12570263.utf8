                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cipla makes biotech foray with twin deals
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, June 15: Cipla has ventured into biotechnology by acquiring 40 per cent and 25 per cent stakes in two biotech firms.         
	The company plans to invest over $65 million in these firms over three years.         
	Cipla today informed the bourses that it would acquire a 40 per cent stake in an Indian biotech firm by subscribing to fresh shares of the company, which is setting up a state-of-the-art facility for biosimilar products in Goa. Cipla will have the rights to market the products in India and overseas.         
	It is also purchasing a 25 per cent stake in another firm in Hong Kong. The investment will be made through a wholly owned overseas subsidiary. The Hong Kong firm also has plans to set up a facility for biosimilars in Shanghai.         
	Biosimilars are new variants of biopharmaceuticals whose patents have expired. They are similar to the original product in terms of safety and efficacy.         
	Sources said Cipla would fund the acquisition through internal accruals.         
	Though the company did not disclose any further details on the acquisition or the therapeutical categories that it would target, sources said it planned to bring biosimilars to India at an affordable price. They said Cipla would target anti-cancer and asthma categories.         
	The deals mark the second buyout by Cipla within a month. In May, it had announced the acquisition of two facilities, which were making formulation and bulk drugs exclusively for Cipla, for Rs 82.02 crore.         
	This included the acquisition of a company for Rs 51 crore which had a facility at Sikkim that manufactured tablets, capsules, injections and ointments.

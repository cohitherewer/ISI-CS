The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IPO: Myth amp; reality
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      IPO: Myth amp; reality
        Dhirendra Kumar argues why new share offers are a bad choice for retail investors                                        
	Once upon a time, retail investors used to await IPOs eagerly. All one had to do was to do a few rudimentary checks to filter out the absolute duds and fill the application forms for all IPOs.         
	The allotment ratios were not great but you could be certain that most of the shares you were actually allotted could be sold off at a reasonable profit.         
	In fact, so certain was this strategy that sometime in the mid-nineties, I remember reading a research paper about it.         
	The papers author had figured out that statistically, the best possible strategy was to apply for every single IPO and then sell all your allotment as soon as the stock listed.         
	This scenario actually dates back to the eighties, when IPO prices were fixed by an arm of the Government of India called the Controller of Capital Issues (CCI). The CCI always under-priced the issues severely, effectively turning the IPO application process into a lottery.        
	However, those days are long gone.         
	Over the last few months, there has hardly been any IPO in which the retail investor has shown any interest at all.        
	This has been specially true of the large power IPOs as well as all the PSU divestment issuances.        
	This disappearance of the retail investor has generally been seen as a bad thing in some parts of the investing community and the media.         
	The belief        
	In India, we believe in this notion that the IPO is a form of investing that is specially suited to the small, retail investor and that great effort should be made to induce such investors to apply for IPOs.         
	This has resulted in all manners of special quotas and pricing to ensure that such investors buy shares in IPOs.        
	However, my opinion is the exact opposite. There is nothing about IPOs that makes them specially suited for the casual retail investor.         
	If anything, IPOs are actually less suitable for such investors than stocks with a long history.         
	Unknown devil        
	The reason is simple. IPOs are less known quantities. The balance of power (in the sense of information) lies with the seller. The companies have not been in public eye at all. Invariably, the promoter has spent the preceding months carefully building up an image to ensure that the investing public has a positive image (unless the promoter is the Government of India but more on that later).         
	Unlike listed stocks, the financials havent been scrutinised by analysts quarter after quarter for years. And of course, the price is the promoters gambit, rather than one that has been through the price discovery cauldron of the market.        
	All in all, this is not the kind of situation in which the retail investor has any way of knowing whether a stock is worth buying or not.         
	With the same money, he is far more likely to get a better deal in the secondary market with some stock that are well understood and analysed over a long period.        
	Deal distortion        
	The only way that IPOs can be made attractive to retail investors is by giving them a special deal in some way in the form of a lower price. But these special deals do not work. They distort the market in some way.         
	If they are made attractive enough, then they lead to non-retail investors masquerading as retail, which is a potential source of scam. If they are not made attractive enough, then the retail investor is not interested, as we are seeing now.        
	In any case, if you look at this situation from the promoters and, in the case of FPOs, the existing shareholders, then why should any special deal be given?         
	If there is a prices at which professional investor are willing to buy a stock, then it doesnt make any economic sense for the promoter to sell it so anyone else at a lower price.        
	Unique culture        
	The whole situation is a mess created by this uniquely Indian cultural hang-up about IPOs being the preferred vehicle for the small investor to get into the stock markets.         
	This is not. This idea is a mutated descendant of the CCI legacy and it should be laid to rest now.         
	IPOs and small, retail investors are especially unsuitable for each other. Most sensible retail investors have already discovered this, and its time that this became the generally recognised truth.        
	Which brings us to the Government of Indias IPO and FPO adventures, which promise to enthral and entertain the investment community over the next year.         
	As has become clear by now that investors are simply not interested. Its possible that if one buys and holds these issues for years, some of them may turn out to be good investments but in Indias investment culture, those kind of investors do not really exist in any numbers.         
	We have punters who are focussed on flipping the stocks within days or even hours of listing.        
	The government needs money to fill its budget hole and so its rushing into a series of hastily planned and poorly executed issues.         
	If three issues that have happened so far are any indication, most of them will be oversubscribed by virtue of public sector banks and the LIC.         
	In fact, on current evidence, this exercise has degenerated into a blatant transfer of policyholders funds from the LIC into the central governments coffers.        
	Private and government put together, the coming year could well see the biggest amount of fresh stock to be sold to Indian investors.         
	However, unless something drastically unexpected happens, retail investors should not pay any attention.

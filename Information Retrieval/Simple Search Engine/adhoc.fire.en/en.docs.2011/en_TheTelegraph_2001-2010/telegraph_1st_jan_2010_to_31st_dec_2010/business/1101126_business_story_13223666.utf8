The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | LIC starts system review 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      LIC starts system review 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Vijayan: Clean-up act                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 25: V.K. Sharma will become the new chief executive officer of LIC Housing Finance.        
	Sharma, at present the southern head of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), will replace Ramachandran Nair who was arrested, along with another senior official, by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) yesterday for their alleged role in the housing finance scam.        
	Sharmas appointment is part of an exercise that LIC launched today to check the effectiveness of its risk management system.        
	The exercise, which will cover the LIC and its housing finance arm  LIC Housing Finance Company  could lead to a revamp of its internal systems.        
	We are trying to have an internal inquiry into this matter. Our asset quality has not been impaired, LIC chairman T.S. Vijayan said, adding that he had briefed the government about the latest developments.        
	On Wednesday, the CBI had busted a multi-crore housing finance scam perpetrated by Money Matters Financial Services Ltd, a Mumbai-based financial services company, which had bribed senior officials of public sector banks and financial institutions to facilitate loans to real estate developers and other firms.        
	According to the CBI, former LIC Housing boss Ramachandran Nair allegedly received a Rs 45-lakh bribe from Rajesh Sharma, chairman and managing director of Money Matters, in November last year for showing undue favours to the latters clients. Naresh Chopra, secretary (investments) at LIC, who was also arrested, allegedly got Rs 16 lakh for passing on information on the companys investment strategies.        
	Vijayan said the scam was limited to certain individuals within the organisation.        
	We will see whether the internal system needs tightening, whether risk management needs tightening and whether there was any procedural shortcomings, he said.        
	Vijayan said the corporation had set up a team to find out what insider trading information had been leaked by its investment secretary to Money Matters.        
	Vijayan said real estate companies owed Rs 380 crore to LIC Housing Finance, and this was well within prudential limits. He added the LIC was providing all the relevant information to the CBI to help it to conduct its investigation into the scam.         
	The housing loan scam would not impair its balance sheet, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Andhra Cement to cut debt
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Andhra Cement to cut debt
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 6: Gouri Prasad Goenkas Andhra Cement today approved a preferential allotment of shares to two financial institutions  HDFC and IDFC  to cut its debt burden.        
	The duo will pay Rs 24 a share, a 26 per cent premium to the closing price on the BSE. The Andhra Cement stock was up 7.63 per cent to close at Rs 19.05, while the bellwether BSE sensex rose 1.86 per cent.        
	Goenka said the preferential allotment was part of concerted efforts by the company to reduce debt. The company has a debt of Rs 350 crore. We are trying to reduce it, he said.        
	He said the management was trying to get overseas funds to invest in Andhra Cement as part of the debt reduction plan. Apart from retiring debts, it wants to raise capital to fund new expenditure.        
	The promoters holding is high in the company. We have leeway to raise capital. Funds will come from overseas. I want people having a medium-term horizon (five years) to invest, he said.        
	Andhra Cement will soon expand its capacity to 3.5 million tonnes, up from 1.4 million tonnes. The company had to pledge shares to finance the expansion.        
	A filing with the bourses said promoters hold a 69.62 per cent stake in the company. However, almost 95 per cent of that holding is pledged.        
	The preferential allotment to HDFC and IDFC will reduce the companys debt burden by around Rs 18.64 crore. Together, the financial institutions will pick up a 4.79 per cent stake in the expanded equity of the company. While HDFC will pick up 2.12 per cent, IDFC is buying 2.69 per cent in the company.        
	Following the preferential allotment, the promoters holding will fall to 66.28 per cent.        
	HDFC had invoked some of the pledged shares in Andhra Cement on August 24, scaling up its stake by 1.8 per cent to 6.12 per cent.        
	Two of the main promoter group companies in Andhra Cement had recently disclosed in multiple filings to the stock exchange that part of their holdings had been sold off in the open market by entities to whom the shares were pledged.        
	Goenkas fund raising plan comes at a time the cement industry, especially those located in the south such as Andhra Cement, is facing a squeeze in profitability because of over-capacity.

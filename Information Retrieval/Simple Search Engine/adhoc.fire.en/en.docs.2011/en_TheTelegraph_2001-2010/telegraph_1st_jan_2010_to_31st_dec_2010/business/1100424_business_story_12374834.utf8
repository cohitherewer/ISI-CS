	Calcutta, April 23: Taiwan-based handset maker HTC aims to capture at least 15 per cent of the estimated 3.5 million smartphone market in India by the end of this year.        
	In 2009, we had about 10 per cent share of the 2.5 million smartphones sold in India. We had a 100 per cent growth in the first quarter (January-March) and growing faster, HTC country manager (India) Ajay Sharma told The Telegraph.         
	HTC, which has recently introduced the 3G-enabled HTC Smart in India to foray into the mass market, expects the device to contribute at least 50 per cent to the companys sales in India in 2010. The smartphone is priced below Rs 10,000.         
	The company is taking a number of initiatives to enhance its customer reach and market share. Of the 10 models that HTC sells in the country, eight are 3G-enabled.         
	We intend to launch three to four models each quarter, taking the total portfolio to over 20 by the end of 2010, Sharma said.         
	Newer handsets will be mostly priced between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000.        
	The company is awaiting the rollout of 3G services, which it hopes will boost sales significantly. 3G will also boost the market for mobile Internet. Surfing, emailing and downloading of applications will be the most sought-after feature, he said.        
	HTC phones run on Windows, Android and Brew operating softwares.        
	We are quite small in India. We are considered a niche player here and lacked a holistic approach. The lack of brand awareness was an issue. But now, we have set up a team and have learnt more about the market. We have understood its price sensitivity. We are more focused and capable of positioning our products well. The growth for us will come from the mass-market segment now, Sharma said.

        Get your priorities right before choosing insurance plan, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	A couple of months after the sub-prime mortgage crisis surfaced in the US in May 2007, The Business Week magazine carried an article Profiting from Mortality by Matthew Goldstein. It talked about a seminar in New York attended by 600 delegates from institutions such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, UBS, Wachovia and Wells Fargo to discuss the next exotic investment. It was, as the author had put it, death bonds  a new way of making profit from people dying.        
	Scary as it may sound, the author noted that some 90 million Americans own life insurance, but many find the premium too expensive; others simply prefer to cash in early.         
	The other option is life settlement  an arrangement that offers policyholders the chance to sell their policies to investors who keep paying the premiums until the sellers die and then collect the insurance payout.         
	For the investors, its an actuarial gamble: The quicker the death, the more profit is reaped. Now, Wall Street sees huge profits in buying policies, throwing them into a pool, dividing the pool into bonds, and selling the bonds to pension funds and other professional investors. If the market develops as Wall Street expects, ordinary mutual funds will soon be able to get in on the action, too, Goldstein said.        
	Know the basic purpose        
	Life settlements are not allowed in our country. But it is not uncommon to see policyholders finding it difficult at times to pay the premium for life insurance plans.         
	If you are not prudent enough in choosing your life insurance policy, it may later put your financials in disarray.         
	If you carefully consider the basic purpose of buying a life insurance, it will help you shortlist two types of plans  term and whole life  among an array of plans on offer.         
	No one can escape death, yet no one knows when one will die. This uncertainty of an infallible incident of life has given rise to the business opportunity, called life insurance.         
	Life insurance is all about taking a bet against life. When you buy a policy for, say 30 years, your odds are that you wont live beyond 30 years. When an insurer sells you the policy, it assumes that youll live longer than 30 years. You are a gainer if you die within the policy term, but the insurer will gain if you survive the policy term.        
	Now, the question is whether you want to provide a financial hedge to your family against any loss of income because of death or disability during your working life or do you want to protect your family, irrespective of when you die.        
	The objectives of the two questions are very different.         
	In the first case, your objective is to make good use of your earnings in case of any eventuality during your working life. The objective for the second case is to provide the family with a cash value after your death.        
	For any other objective, such as childrens education and marriage and buying a house, dont buy a life insurance. Benefits under a life insurance plan accrues only when the policyholder dies and not on his/her survival.         
	If you want survival benefits, there are various other savings and investment instruments capable of providing higher returns.        
	Count your needs        
	Now, if you want to protect your family from loss of future income in case of your death or disability during the working life, you need an insurance equivalent to your potential future earnings estimated at the time of buying the policy.         
	Since the sum assured involved here is too high, the premium charges of such a plan should be low so that you can afford the cost.         
	A term assurance policy fits this bill since it provides only the death benefit and, hence, costs the least among all life insurance plans.        
	Go for a whole life plan if you want to provide your family with a cash value, irrespective of when you die. The premium of whole life plans is high since they come with a savings component.         
	However, these plans are available in a variety of configurations, such as limited premium payment term or single premium, with or without profit. They offer guaranteed cover throughout the life of the policyholder.         
	There are no maturity dates for whole life plans. However, a policyholder can take the sum assured plus all accrued bonuses (in the case of with profit plans) after attaining the age of 80 years or 100 years, depending on the insurer.        
	The total premium cost of a whole life policy may become cheaper than term assurance if a policyholder lives longer. The premium paid for term assurance is not refundable since it provides only the death benefit, that is the sum assured.         
	Best of both        
	The best way is to have a term assurance as well as a whole life plan. Many insurers are now offering online purchase of term assurance plans at a much cheaper rate.         
	If you are 25-years-old, for a paltry premium of Rs 4,050 per annum you can buy Aegon Religares iTerm policy (online term assurance policy) with a sum assured of Rs 30 lakh and a policy term of 25 years. Aegon Religares iTerm is the cheapest term assurance plan available in the market.        
	Along with this buy a whole life plan from Reliance Life Insurance Company (the cheapest plan available).         
	For a sum assured of Rs 5 lakh, the insurers whole life plan (maturity at the age of 85 years) will cost you an annual premium of Rs 43,973 payable for five years only.        
	Your annual premium outgo for the two plans for the first five years will be Rs 48,023 (or about Rs 4,000 per month) and Rs 4,050 for the next 20 years. Your total cost towards premium thus works out to be (Rs 4,050 x 25)+(Rs 43,973 x 5), or Rs 3,21,115, for which you can claim income tax deduction under Section 80C.        
	Let us now see how much financial protection you have got for your family through this strategy. Let us assume a six per cent annual bonus on your whole life plan.         
	a) If you die before the age of 50, your family will get between Rs 35 lakh and Rs 40 lakh;         
	b) if you die after the age of 50 but before 85 years, your family will get between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 16.5 lakh;        
	c) if you survive beyond 85 years of age, you get a survival benefit of Rs 16.5 lakh. And these are all tax-free!        
	If you seek cover for your family, either go for term or whole life insurance and not anything intermediate.

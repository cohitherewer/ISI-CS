          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 17: The Bank of India (BoI) today said it had raised Rs 300 crore in tier-I capital through perpetual bonds. The fund-raising is part of the PSU banks plan to mobilise over Rs 10,000 crore through both tier-I and tier-II capital.        
	As on June 30 this year, the BoI had a capital -to-risk-weighted-asset ratio (CRAR) of 13.29 per cent. CRAR indicates the strength of a banks balance sheet. Of this, tier-I capital stood at 8.47 per cent. Tier-I capital is the banks core capital, comprising equity and retained profits.        
	Tier-II capital, that includes items such as subordinated debt, was at 4.82 per cent.        
	The BoI had raised the sum last week. The coupon rate on the bonds is 9.05 per cent with a call option after 10 years.        
	Recently, M. D. Mallya, chairman and managing director of Bank of Baroda, said the bank planned to raise up to Rs 4,000 crore this fiscal via tier-I and tier-II capital.         
	Banks are firming up plans to raise funds, given the strong economic growth forecast that will spur demand for credit from corporate houses and retail customers.        
	The lenders are raising funds in various forms. The State Bank of India plans to raise around Rs 20,000 crore from the market via rights. The rights issue is likely to take place in the last quarter of this fiscal.         
	The bank is planning to raise another Rs 250 crore through a bond issue by the end of this calendar year.        
	Last month, the BoI got the boards permission to raise both forms of capital through the issue of equity shares, perpetual debt instruments, preference shares and tier-II bonds up to Rs 10,286 crore after obtaining the necessary approvals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cut in net borrowings fails to mask worries
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cut in net borrowings fails to mask worries
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Money Matters                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The government is pruning its net borrowings to Rs 3,45,010 crore  a fall of 13.4 per cent from the Rs 3,98,411 crore in the revised estimates for 2009-10.        
	But the real worry is that gross market borrowings are projected at Rs 4,57,143 crore  about 1.4 per cent higher than last year, raising concerns that the government can crowd out the private sector, which will be looking to raise loans to finance operations and projects just when the economy starts to shift into a higher gear.          
	The RBI has already indicated that it will be looking to rein its expansionary monetary policy that was put in place in September 2008 when the withering effects of a global recession started to nibble at the Indian economy.  
	The liberal monetary policy had led to a build-up in liquidity  and the RBI has started to soak up some of the excess. The net market borrowings of the government will account for 90.5 per cent of the fiscal deficit of Rs 3,81,408 crore.        
	The rise in gross borrowings has also prompted the government to make a sharp increase in provisions for loan repayments, which are expected to surge 113 per cent to Rs 1,12,133 crore from Rs 52,589 crore in the revised estimates for 2009-10.        
	The government was, however, confident that its robust borrowing programme would not crowd out private players.        
	Last year, the government had front-loaded its borrowing programme in the first half of the year when the slowdown had started to hit the economy and companies were reluctant to raise loans.        
	Till the end of December 2009, the government had borrowed Rs 3,71,430 crore, or 93 per cent of its proposed borrowing of Rs 3.97 lakh crore.        
	The reduction in the net government borrowing programme will be a relief for the fixed income markets as it reduces the pressure on interest rates that would have come from this factor, said Kanwar Vivek, MD of Aditya Birla Money Ltd.

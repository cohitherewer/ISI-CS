                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      US legal heat on Mahindras
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                          Rough ride                                  
	Mumbai, June 16: Mahindra amp; Mahindras (M amp;M) exclusive distributor in the US has filed a lawsuit against the company for taking too long to launch its pick-up truck in that country.         
	In the lawsuit filed before an Atlanta district court, Global Vehicles (GV) had alleged that there had been an inordinate delay in the launch of the truck.         
	Mahindra and GV had entered into an understanding around four years back wherein M amp;M had proposed to launch the truck, based on the Scorpio platform, in 2009. However, this got delayed because of regulatory clearances.         
	The company had set a revised target to enter the US by the beginning of this fiscal but later postponed it to 2010-end. It is learnt that the delay was on account of the changes that had to be incorporated to make the vehicle compliant with the US regulations and also meet American tastes.         
	In its lawsuit filed on June 14, GV said it had spent close to $35 million to prepare for the launch of the vehicles and had inked pacts with around 360 dealers. This also included an initial distribution appointment fee of $8.5 million.         
	The company further said the US dealers had spent more than $60 million in franchisee fees for the right to sell the Mahindra vehicles. It has also initiated arbitration proceedings against the Indian firm.         
	M amp;M officials said the legal actions were without merit and that the company would contest them. They said the firm remained committed to launch its products in the US. Global Vehicles has also asked the court to prevent M amp;M from selling its vehicles through any other dealer or distributor.         
	Proton move        
	Malaysian car maker Proton, which has been looking to enter India for many years, is understood to have resumed talks with M amp;M for a partnership. Talks between the two in 2007 did not fructify, following which Proton had opened a dialogue with some other Indian players, including Argentum Motors.

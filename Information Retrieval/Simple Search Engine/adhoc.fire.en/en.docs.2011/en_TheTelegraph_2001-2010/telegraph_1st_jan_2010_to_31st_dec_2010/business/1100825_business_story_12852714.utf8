	Mumbai, Aug. 24: The promoters of Religare Enterprises Ltd are increasing their stake by around 9 per cent through a preferential allotment, convertible warrant issue and share acquisition from the open market. They will, subsequently, make an open offer to buy another 20 per cent.         
	Religare today said Malvinder Mohan Singh and brother Shivinder would raise their stake in the company to 65.79 per cent from 57.10 per cent by investing Rs 850 crore.         
	The promoters will acquire 8.03 per cent via an investment company through a combination of a preferential share allotment and warrants convertible into equity shares.         
	In July, the board of Religare had proposed to raise Rs 2,000 crore through a capital issue to meet its expansion plans.         
	News of the stake hike by the promoters coupled with the possibility of an open offer saw the shares of Religare rising on the stock exchanges today.         
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, it surged 8.42 per cent to end at Rs 500.80.         
	At present, the company has no plans to delist from the stock exchanges, a senior Religare official told The Telegraph.

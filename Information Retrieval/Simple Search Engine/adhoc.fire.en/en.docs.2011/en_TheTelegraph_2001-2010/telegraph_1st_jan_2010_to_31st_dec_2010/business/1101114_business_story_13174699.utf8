          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (WBSEDCL) today signed an agreement with NTPC to purchase 1,760mw from the latters five new power projects in the eastern region.         
	We shall get some power from next year itself from NTPCs Farakka power project where the company is setting up an additional unit. However, the entire 1,760mw will come to us by 2015-16, said Malay Kumar De, chairman of WBSEDCL.        
	De, who is also the power secretary of the state, said there had been no power shortage even at the peak hours over the past one-and-a-half months.Last summer, West Bengal Power Development Corporation could not produce as much power as it was supposed to and that led to widespread load-shedding. We source almost 70 per cent of our power from WBPDCL. In the last one-and-a-half months, we are running a surplus, De said.

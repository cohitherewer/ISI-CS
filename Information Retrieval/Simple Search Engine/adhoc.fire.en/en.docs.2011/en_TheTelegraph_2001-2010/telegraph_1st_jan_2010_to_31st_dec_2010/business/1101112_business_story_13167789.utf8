                              SBI chairman .P. Bhatt in Mumbai on Thursday. (PTI)                            
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Nov. 11 (PTI): The government today said it would take a call within a fortnight on whether the State Bank of India should be allowed to go for a rights issue, which is expected to be in the range of Rs 18,000-21,000 crore, less than the original estimate.        
	We are number crunching that (the SBI proposal of a Rs 20,000-crore rights issue) at this point of time. I think some decision will be taken perhaps in the next 15 days, financial services secretary R. Gopalan said on the sidelines of an event in New Delhi today.        
	He said the presumptions under which the additional requirement had been asked for were being looked into by the government.        
	So, the amount in any case is dependent on what we arrive at along with the SBI  as to how valid those presumptions are. The exercise is on at this point of time, Gopalan said.        
	The government holds about 59 per cent in the SBI. If it clears the proposal, the government will have to subscribe to the issue to the extent of its holding to maintain its stake at the existing level.        
	Depending on the decision taken, Gopalan said there could be implications on the budget. There can be implications on the budget or it can be neutral on the budget. We will take a view, he said.        
	If the government decides to subscribe to the rights issue in cash, it will have to go for additional expenditure. However, if it decides to subscribe through bonds, the effect may be felt later.        
	The decision will be taken in the current fiscal. However, disbursement can be made either during this fiscal or the next fiscal subject to the decisions taken, Gopalan said.        
	However, the SBI exuded confidence that the rights issue would take place this fiscal. I expect the approvals from the government to come this month and the issue will definitely come out this fiscal, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said in Mumbai.        
	He said the government had accepted that the SBI needed capital.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          J.S. Sarma in New Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, May 28: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will come out with a consultation paper on fourth-generation (4G) technology within a week.        
	We will be ready with a consultation paper on 4G in a week and expect regulations to be in place in the next few months, Trai chairman J.S. Sarma told reporters today.        
	Auction of 3G spectrum raked in over Rs 67,000 crore for the government, while wireless broadband spectrum is expected to fetch around Rs 20,000 crore.        
	Long term evolution (LTE) technology, or 4G, allows more data to be transferred over the same bandwidth used by 3G but at higher speeds.         
	Dual mobile service provider Tata Teleservices has told Trai that 4G spectrum should be auctioned as soon as possible since limited competition in the 3G space could make high-speed services expensive.         
	CDMA player Qualcomm has also sought large chunks of radio waves for advanced technologies like LTE.         
	Compared with a speed of 3 megabits per second (Mbps) offered by third-generation services, LTE can offer speeds up to 10Mbps.                     
	Qualcomm, which is bidding in the ongoing broadband wireless spectrum auction, wants to deploy Time Division Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE) technology in India in collaboration with a domestic partner.         
	4G or LTE, which succeeds the 3G and 2G technology, is already being tested in various parts of the world by foreign players like the US-based Motorola and Ercisson.        
	Motorola had recently said that they would be approaching the DoT to seek spectrum for testing their equipment in India.        
	Trais consultation would look into all aspects, including spectrum band to be allotted for 4G service and quantum and modes of allotment to the operators before sending proposals to DoT.         
	Compared with the 3 megabits per second (Mbps) speed offered by third generation services, LTE can offer speeds of up to 10 Mbps. As a result, service providers should be able to get more data transfer out of their network and possibly lower the cost to run their networks.        
	LTE also allows operators to introduce new exciting services such as HD (high definition) video blogging, HD video on demand, media mobility, online gaming, and brings a significantly improved business proposition with 2.5 times higher capacity, lower cost per bit and media mobility.        
	Globally, LTE is under development with a number of international players, including KDDI in Japan and Verizon in the US announcing trials on their network. Around 59 operators have committed to LTE launches in 28 countries with up to 22 LTE networks in service by 2010 and 37 LTE networks in service by 2011.

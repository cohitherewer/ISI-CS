The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BAPL bid to cash in on solar energy
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      BAPL bid to cash in on solar energy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          New mission                                  
	Calcutta, May 4: Bengal Aerotropolis Projects (BAPL) will seek Solar Valley status for its upcoming project at Andal in Burdwan district.        
	The company, which is building an integrated township around an airport, has earmarked 100 acres for the project.        
	We will send our application to the Centre through the state government in two to three weeks, Subrata Paul, managing director of BAPL, said.        
	The concept of solar valley is still evolving. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh explained it while launching the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission in January this year. The valleys, according to Singh, should be hubs for advanced technological applications using solar energy.        
	The government has set a target to produce 20,000mw of solar power by 2022.        
	BAPL plans to set up industrial zones that will manufacture equipment such as solar cell, panel, module and power conditioning instrument needed to produce power.        
	Every megawatt of solar power generation requires Rs 10 crore worth of equipment.        
	The opportunity is big. We are trying to take the first mover advantage. Our estimate is that our Solar Valley project will attract investments of Rs 2,000-3,000 crore, Paul said, adding that 5000-6000 jobs (direct and indirect) can be created.        
	BAPL is in talks with Taiwanese companies to participate in the solar park. A German delegation will come down shortly to discuss potential investment.        
	BAPL, in which Singapores Changi Airport is a strategic investor, wants to offer developed land to these companies plus the benefit of living in a township close by with civic amenities and also an airport.

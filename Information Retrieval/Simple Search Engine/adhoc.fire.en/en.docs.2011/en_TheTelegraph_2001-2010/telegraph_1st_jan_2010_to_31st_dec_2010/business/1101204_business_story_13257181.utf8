	The mortgage financier has raised its retail prime lending rate (RPLR) against which it benchmarks its adjustable rate home loans (ARHL).        
	The increase is effective from December 1 and will result in the corporations RPLR rising to 15 per cent. This is the second time in this fiscal that HDFC has raised its RPLR.

	HDFC added that for new customers, the ARHL loans would now be priced at 9.5 per cent for loans up to Rs 30 lakh, 9.75 per cent for loans up to Rs 75 lakh and 10 per cent for loans above Rs 75 lakh.

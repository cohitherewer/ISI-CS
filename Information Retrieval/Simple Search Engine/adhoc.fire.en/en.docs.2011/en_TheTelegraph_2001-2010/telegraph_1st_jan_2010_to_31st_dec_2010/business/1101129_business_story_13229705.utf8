The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cover concern
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cover concern
 												      Srikumar Bondyopadhyay runs a check on variable life   insurance to see whether it has anything different to offer                                            
	Thirty-year-old Manoj Roy surrendered his three-year unit-linked life insurance policy in 2008 because it was getting difficult for him to continue with the premium payment. While his employer withheld his annual salary increment on account of the global financial crisis that year, a double-digit inflation had exhausted most of his disposable income.        
	Like Manoj, many would have wished that their insurers would allow them to reduce the insurance cover and pay a lower premium.        
	Till now, policyholders in the country do not have the flexibility to change the sum assured of their policies during the term of the scheme.        
	Recently, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) came out with its final guidelines on variable insurance products (VIPs)  a life insurance plan where the sum assured (the risk cover) can be changed, subject to a threshold limit, any time during the term of the policy.         
	Flexibility pull        
	Introduced in the 1970s in the US, such policies are now quite popular in the developed markets because the flexibility they offer in premium payment and the cash value they accompany.        
	Variable insurance plans have two distinct components like a unit-linked insurance plan (Ulip)  an insurance account and an investment account.         
	However, the Irda guidelines do not allow changes in the annual premium amount payable by policyholders. A policyholder can only change the proportionate allocation of the gross premium to the insurance account and the savings account.         
	If you need a lower insurance cover, you can redirect a higher proportion of premium to the savings account and vice-versa. The Irda guidelines on variable insurance plans, thus, kill the basic utility of such products.         
	Insurers also cannot offer multiple investment options to policyholders.         
	All variable insurance products shall only be offered under the non-unit linked (read, traditional) platform, the Irda guidelines said.        
	Every policy shall have a savings account and the premium net of all charges, including the mortality charge, agency commission and policy related expenses, shall be credited to the savings account. The insurer shall pool in the money into the savings account of individual policyholders and invest it according to the investment pattern set by Irda for traditional plans.         
	While doing so, insurers offering variable insurance products will have to announce an upfront minimum guaranteed investment return on the policyholders savings account for the entire term of the policy. Insurers, however, can credit a higher return to policyholders savings account depending on the return they generate on the investments of the common savings pool.         
	Interestingly, we have not seen many insurers coming out with unit-linked pension plans after the regulator made it mandatory to offer a minimum return of 4.5 per cent from September this year.        
	Variable insurance products, thus, will not be great in terms of returns.        
	Cost worry        
	To understand this better, let us illustrate the position with the kind of cost structure the regulator has proposed for variable insurance products.        
	First, the regulator has suggested a minimum sum assured equal to 10 times the annual premium.         
	Second, it has prescribed a maximum premium allocation charge of 27.5 per cent in the first year, 7.5 per cent for the second and the third year and 5 per cent thereafter. These charges are exclusive of the mortality charges.         
	Now, suppose a 30-year-old person buys a variable insurance plan for 10 years with an annual premium of Rs 25,000.         
	The minimum sum assured the policyholder should purchase is Rs 2,50,000 (= 10 x Rs 25,000). At the start of the policy, the mortality charge (the fee that the insurer deducts to provide the guaranteed sum assured, that is Rs 2,50,000, on the death of the policyholder) will be Rs 350. Expenses and commission charges in the first year will be Rs 6,875. Thus, the first year premium net of charges works out to Rs 17,775 (= Rs 25,000 - Rs 350 - Rs 6,875) which will be allocated to the savings account.         
	Growing at a compounded annual return of 10 per cent, the savings account will stand at Rs 19,552.50 at the beginning of the second policy year. The assumption of a 10 per cent return is on the higher side, given the investment pattern set by the regulator for traditional insurance plans.         
	In the second year, the mortality charge will be Rs 355 and expenses and commissions will be Rs 1,875. The second years premium that will be credited to the savings account will be Rs 22,770. At the end of the second year, the savings account will stand at Rs 46,554.75.        
	The table shows that at the end of 10 years, the value of the savings account of the policyholder will be Rs 3,91,638.        
	Had the person invested Rs 25,000 every year in a mutual fund that gives a similar 10 per cent annual return, his investment value at the end of 10 years would have been Rs 4,27,322, or Rs 35,684 more.         
	Alternative plan        
	The investor can buy a term assurance plan of Rs 10 lakh for 25 years from Aegon Religare Life Insurance for a single premium of Rs 33,653. He will not only get a higher insurance cover (Rs 10 lakh compared with Rs 2.5 lakh), but also a longer period of coverage (25 years compared to 10 years) by choosing the option of mutual fund plus term insurance.        
	Variable insurance as suggested by the insurance regulator would neither benefit insurers (as they will have to give a guaranteed return) nor policyholders (as they will get a lower return as well as a lower cover).

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 18: Ripples of the CAG report on 2G spectrum were felt in the stock markets today with the shares of Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications (R-Com) and Unitech being hammered over concerns that the Centre might launch a probe into the allocation of the scarce resource.        
	The R-Com stock plunged over 10 per cent in intra-day trade, though it recovered some of its losses to finish at Rs 153.90, a fall of Rs 7.90, or 4.88 per cent, over its previous close. The Unitech scrip showed a similar decline during the day and ended lower by 4.24 per cent at Rs 71.20.         
	There are worries that one of the fallouts of the CAG report will be that the Union government may order some kind of probe into the allocation of 2G spectrum and that some licences may even be revoked, an analyst said.        
	In its report, the CAG said Anil Ambani group firm Reliance Telecom was the real owner of Swan Telecom, now known as Etisalat DB Telecom, which had got licences and spectrum in January 2008. Swan had concealed its true relationship with Reliance Telecom.        
	According to the CAG, Unitech Wireless was also a big beneficiary, without any experience in the business. After the company got spectrum, it sold a majority stake to Norways Telenor for a huge sum. Both the companies today said they would co-operate with the authorities in their investigation.         
	R-Com said it would provide all information to resolve the doubts expressed by the CAG, adding that it did not hold any of the licences issued in January 2008. R-Com, through its 100 per cent subsidiary Reliance Telecom, was a 9.9 per cent shareholder in Swan Telecom till December 2007, while Swan was granted the letter of intent only on January 20, 2008. Accordingly, R-Com had no shareholding in Swan Telecom at the time of the grant of licence or any time thereafter, R-Com said in a statement.

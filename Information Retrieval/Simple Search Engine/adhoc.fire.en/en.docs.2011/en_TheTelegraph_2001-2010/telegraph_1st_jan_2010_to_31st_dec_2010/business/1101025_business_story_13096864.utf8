                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ONGC eyes Sistema pact for Russia oil hunt
          R.SURYAMURTHY                          Weighing options                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: ONGC is exploring the opportunity to join hands with Sistema-group promoted OAO Bashneft to participate in the development of Russias largest discovered oilfields  Trebs and Titov.        
	Bashneft is one of the firms qualified to bid for the fields in the Arctic. Russias Federal Agency for Management of Mineral Resources had earlier disqualified Nord Imperial, ONGCs Russian subsidiary, from bidding saying the company lacked financial capability.         
	We have good relations with Sistema and we will certainly like to join hands with them in exploring the opportunities in those regions, ONGC chairman and managing director R.S. Sharma said.        
	On Trebs and Titov, Sharma said, I cannot comment on the specifics. We are in the exploration business and are always scouting for opportunities.        
	Russian oil companies Surgutneftegaz and Bashneft are among the six shortlisted to compete for the Trebs and Titov deposits in the Timan-Pechora region in the Arctic. Crude reserves in the two fields are estimated to be 578 million barrels and 465 million barrels, respectively.        
	Bashneft is a Sistema-group company promoted by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov. Sistema has a presence in the Indian telecom sector through Sistema Shyam Teleservices. ONGC had last year signed an agreement with Sistema to jointly acquire and develop oil and gasfields.         
	The Trebs and Titov deposits  the largest unallotted hydrocarbon fields owned by the Russian government  hold an estimated 200 million tonnes of reserves and will be sold at an auction on December 2.         
	This is the first major oil and gasfield tender in five years by Russia; the bidding is believed to be a test case of Russias commitment towards transparency and fair play in the energy sector.         
	Earlier, several players had been disqualified from bidding for the two fields.

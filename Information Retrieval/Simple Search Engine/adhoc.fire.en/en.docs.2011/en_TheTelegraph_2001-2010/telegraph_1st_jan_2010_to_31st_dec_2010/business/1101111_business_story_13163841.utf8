                              Manmohan Singh in Seoul on Wednesday. (PTI)                            
	Seoul, Nov. 10 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh arrived here today for the G20 summit cautioning against protectionism, while declaring it was in Indias interest to have an open, stable and rule-based international economic environment that includes trade and investment flows.        
	Given the vast development challenges we face it is in Indias interest to have an open, stable and rule-based international economic environment, whether in the field of trade, investment flows, technology transfers or open markets, Singh said on the eve of the fifth summit of 20 advanced and emerging economies (G20) in the South Korean capital.        
	Singhs comments came as the G20 countries worked to rebalance the lopsided global economy and resolve fractious currency disputes, marked by a war of words. The summits theme is Shared Growth beyond the Crisis.        
	The summit, which will be also attended by US President Barack Obama, is expected to see a heated debate on the issue of regulatory reforms of the financial sector.        
	This is a key area of work, and we must guard against complacency in the pursuit of a strong financial regulatory framework and effective supervision, Singh said.        
	His delegation for the two-day summit include Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao and finance secretary Ashok Chawla.        
	We have to be particularly wary of protectionist sentiments. There are also developmental imbalances within and between countries, and rebalancing of the world economy is a major challenge. The success of the mutual assessment process is important in this regard. Singh said.        
	India will actively participate in this process to strike the right balance between ensuring its credibility as well as the national interests of countries, he said. The summit would focus on the G20 framework for strong sustainable and balanced growth, including an ambitious outcome in the form of the Seoul action plan, Singh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL faces key shale gas deadline
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RIL faces key shale gas deadline
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, July 11: Atlas Energy Inc is stepping up the pace of drilling in its Marcellus shale gas prospecting site  a part of which it is developing through a joint venture with Reliance Industries.        
	The Pittsburgh-based company has drilled six wells through the joint venture since the deal was signed in April, it said in a statement issued last Wednesday. It plans to drill another 15 wells in the next quarter and 19 in the quarter after that in order to attain a pre-defined drilling target of 45 wells by the end of this year.        
	At the same time, a key deadline looms for the Mukesh Ambani-based company.         
	August date        
	Reliance Industries will have to take a call by mid-August whether it wants to step up to the plate as a development operator of one of the four project areas that have been carved out of the 300,000 acres in Atlas Energy Incs Marcellus shale acreage in the Appalachian region in south-western Pennsylvania.        
	The first call  categorised as the First Reliance Operator Date in the participation and development agreement between the two sides  has to be made within 120 days of the effective date of the agreement, which was April 20, 2010.        
	Reliance Industries has been hugely upbeat about the prospects from the Marcellus shale acreage. Although it must exercise the first option next month, it wont become the development operator for the project area it picks until April next year. By then, Atlas Energy hopes to drill 68 wells in the core area in which the two partners have a combined interest. However, if the two sides agree, Reliance could become a development operator of one of the project areas sooner.        
	If Reliance decides to pass up this opportunity, it will lose its rights to exercise subsequent options to the other project areas.        
	If Reliance fails to elect within the relevant time limits to become development operator for any of the project areas, Reliance will be deemed to have declined to exercise such option and will have no further rights to become development operator for any future project areas without Atlass consent, says the agreement.        
	The company is keeping the cards close to its chest but no one expects it to pass up its option at a time when large global players such as Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell, StatOil and Mitsui have started pouring billions of dollars into one of the most exciting natural gas production areas of the world.        
	Reliance anticipates a possible further $3.4 billion commitment to our joint venture over the next decade, Edward Cohen, chief executive officer of Atlas Energy, had told analysts in a conference call soon after the deal in April.        
	Exciting play        
	The Marcellus shale deposit  a 95,000 square mile natural gas-rich sediment play  sprawls across four US states: Pennsylvania, southern New York, West Virginia and eastern Ohio. One report said industry expected oil and gas prospectors to drill 30,000 wells in the Marcellus shale area by 2020.        
	In 2009 alone, more than 550 wells were drilled in the Marcellus Shale, making it one of the most active and prominent shale gas plays in the US.        
	Back in April, Reliance Industries picked up a 40 per cent interest in the Marcellus shale acreage in a deal valued at $1.7 billion. Under the terms of the deal, it paid $340 million in cash upon closing the deal and an additional $1.36 billion in the form of a drilling carry for the benefit of Atlas.        
	In addition to funding its own 40 per cent of drilling obligations, Reliance has agreed to fund 75 per cent of Atlas portion of drilling and completion costs until the $1.36 billion drilling carry is fully utilised.         
	Since then, the two parties agreed to expand the acreage by purchasing another 42,334 acres of undeveloped area in the core Marcellus Shale acreage for an average purchase price of $4,532 per acre, which is roughly the same as the price that Reliance paid for the original transaction.         
	Atlas has up to five-and-a-half years to utilise the drilling carry, subject to a two-year extension under certain force majeure conditions.         
	Reliance and Atlas have agreed upon a five-year development plan that calls for the drilling of 45 horizontal Marcellus Shale wells in the joint venture during the remainder of 2010 and that increases to 108 wells in 2011, 178 wells in 2012, and 300 wells in 2013.        
	Drilling costs in the shale area are much lower than that for offshore wells. Atlas Energy had estimated its average drilling cost per well at $1.8 million in its quarterly report for the January-March period. But the costs are rising with the introduction of fracking technology, which has enhanced success rates. Under this technique, operators drill down to a level of about 8000 feet and then go horizontally through the geological fractures in the shale formations.         
	Reliance will have two more option deadlines under the agreement  the second option becoming exercisable sometime in September 2011 (30 days after the first anniversary of the first Reliance operator date) and another one in May 2012 (30 days after the date that marks the end of six months from the second Reliance operator date). Both options will allow it to take over as development operator of two more project areas. But these options can be exercised only if it achieves 85 per cent of the drilling targets specified during that period in the earlier project area.        
	Reliance will also have the right to acquire all or substantially all of another 280,000 acres in the Appalachian acres that are not part of the existing agreement at a price of $8000 per acre  almost 78 per cent more than what it paid for the original transaction. Acreage prices at Marcellus Shale have risen sharply in the past six months and it is unlikely to deter Reliance if it finds the shale play profitable.

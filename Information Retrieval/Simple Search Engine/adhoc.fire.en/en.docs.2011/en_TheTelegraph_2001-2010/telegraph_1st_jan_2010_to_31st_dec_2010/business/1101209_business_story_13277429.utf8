          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          [+ucfirst('D. Subbarao in Calcutta   on Wednesday. Picture by   Kishor Roy Chowdhury')+]                                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 8: Capping of interest rates charged by microfinance institutions (MFIs) is on the agenda of Y.H. Malegam Committee looking into the regulation of these entities, RBI governor D. Subbarao said.         
	By and large, we should not regulate the interest rate, Subbarao said, adding that a final decision could only be taken after the committee submits its report.         
	However, there must be some mechanism to discipline MFIs, he added.        
	The committee is expected to submit its report by the middle of January and will take into account the views of all stakeholders.        
	There are three concerns about the MFIs. First, the rate of interest they charge. Second, their lending practices, such as multiple lending (multiple MFIs lending to the same borrower without taking into account his repayment capability) and lending for consumption purposes and so on. Third, the coercive practices involved in loan recovery, Subbarao said.        
	According to him, the issues will be discussed at the annual meeting of the RBI governing board here tomorrow. Ill let you know if there is any development.         
	The RBI governor today met Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and finance minister Asim Dasgupta and deliberated on the macro-economic situation, including inflation.         
	Inflation is coming down, but it is still above the apex banks tolerance level.         
	On GDP growth, Subbarao said the RBI would revisit the target during the third-quarter policy review in January.        
	Liquidity        
	RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn today said liquidity was easing and moving towards the comfort zone.        
	He said there was nothing to worry about liquidity.        
	It is easing and moving towards the comfort zone..., he said.        
	Also steps taken to ease liquidity will not clash with the policy stance of the Reserve Bank, Gokarn said.

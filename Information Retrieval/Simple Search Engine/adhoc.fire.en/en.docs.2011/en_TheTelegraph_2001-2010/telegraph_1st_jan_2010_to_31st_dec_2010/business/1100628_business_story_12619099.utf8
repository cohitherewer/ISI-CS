The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Debt funds face mop-up test
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Debt funds face mop-up test
          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                          Mutual fear                                  
	Calcutta, June 27: Mutual funds are afraid of losing a sizeable chunk of their institutional investors following a change in valuation norms for money market and debt securities to mark-to-market method from August.         
	After the ban on entry load last year, more than 4,44,000 retail investors had quit equity and balanced mutual fund schemes between November and May.         
	The change in the norms for valuation of money market and debt securities will make debt schemes more volatile in terms of net asset value which many institutional investors may not like, said Sanjay Sinha, chief executive officer, L amp;T Mutual Fund.         
	According to a directive of capital market regulator Sebi, the valuations of debt and money market securities will now have to be marked to their market prices.         
	Even in the turmoil period of September-October 2008, we had not seen mutual funds reporting negative net asset value of their liquid and liquid plus schemes. This was because mutual funds had been using the method of valuation of these securities to their advantages, said Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive officer, Value Research, a company that tracks mutual funds. From next month, things are going to change and investors will look at these funds differently.        
	Liquid and liquid plus funds in particular had so far been looked upon by investors as a sort of assured income investment without any loss of capital, Sinha said. But as the NAVs of these schemes become volatile with the change in the valuation method, investors will carefully consider their investment in such schemes now.         
	The change in the valuation norm will put the skill of respective fund managers (their call on the future movement in interest rates) to test, according to Sinha. The investment portfolio of many such schemes will also undergo a change because no fund manager now cannot afford to take risks of investing in low graded debt papers.         
	During the peak of the credit crisis, the underlying assets of many liquid plus schemes could not be sold because of a lack of buyers of such papers in the market. The markets regulator has changed the valuation norm to avoid such a situation in the future.        
	Over 75 per cent of the industrys Rs 8,00,000-crore plus assets under management comprise debt funds in which mostly institutions, such as banks, corporations and foreign institutional investors invest their surpluses in order to get a tax benefit as well as a slightly higher return.

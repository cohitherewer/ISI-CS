          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tripathi: Upbeat                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: GAIL (India) Limited today reported a three-fold jump in net profit at Rs 860 crore in the third quarter following higher gas sales and lower compensation to state-owned oil marketing companies for selling fuels below costs.         
	Net profit in the October-December period at Rs 860 crore soared 240 per cent from Rs 253 crore last year, GAIL chairman and managing director B.C. Tripathi told reporters here.        
	GAIL plans a 31 per cent increase in its capital expenditure next fiscal to Rs 5,500 crore, with the bulk of this going to strengthen the pipeline network.        
	Indias largest gas pipeline operator has plans to invest Rs 30,000 crore over the next five years to double its pipeline length of 6,700 km and raise transmission capacity of existing pipelines two-fold to 300 million cubic metres a day.        
	Tripathi said the company planned to take a 4.17 per cent stake in the $2.01-billion pipeline that China is building in Myanmar to transport natural gas found off the Myanmar coast.        
	Our board has approved a proposal to take a stake in the pipeline that will transport gas from offshore block A-1 and A-3 to China, he said.        
	Other partners in the blocks operated by South Koreas Daewoo International are ONGC Videsh, Myanmar Oil amp; Gas Enterprise and Korea Gas Corp.        
	We propose to take 4 per cent and ONGC Videshs will be 8 per cent. The proposed equity will be subject to government approval, Tripathi said.        
	Revenues from gas transmission rose 40 per cent to Rs 853 crore. Turnover increased to Rs 6,187 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 against Rs 5,812 crore in the same period previous fiscal.         
	Contributions towards meeting the losses of the oil refiners halved to Rs 455 crore against Rs 905 crore a year ago.        
	The government asks GAIL, Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Oil India to meet the losses fuel retailers suffer on selling petrol and diesel below costs to check inflation. Retailers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lost about Rs 4,500 crore on fuel sales in the third quarter.

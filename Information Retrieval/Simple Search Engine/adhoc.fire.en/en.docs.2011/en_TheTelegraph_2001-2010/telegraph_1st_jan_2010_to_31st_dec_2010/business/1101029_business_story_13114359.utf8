The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coal smudge on SAIL numbers

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: Steel Authority of India Ltd has suffered a 34 per cent drop in second-quarter profit but plans to go ahead with its Rs 8,800-crore follow-on public offer early next year.        
	SAILs net profit fell 34 per cent to Rs 1,090 crore because of a huge increase in input prices of Rs 1,097 crore, of which Rs 939 crore was on account of imported coking coal, SAIL officials said.         
	The steel makers turnover increased 9 per cent to Rs 11,697 crore during the July-September quarter, SAIL chairman C.S. Verma said.        
	Prices of coking coal, a key ingredient in steel making, rose 74 per cent in the quarter from a year earlier. The state-run steel maker imports about 70 per cent of its coking coal requirement, mostly from Australia. With input costs likely to stabilise in the coming weeks, we are confident of overcoming the impact of the market, he said.         
	SAILs share closed at Rs 202.70 on the BSE today, down 4.86 per cent over Wednesdays close of Rs 213.05.         
	SAILs follow-on public offering was expected by November but now seems unlikely before January-February, when the steel maker is likely to improve its performance.         
	Verma said SAIL would finalise its joint venture with Posco to set up a 1.5-million-tonne specialised steel plant at Bokaro by mid-December.        
	Posco, facing environment hurdles in setting up its $12-billion steel plant in Orissa, is expected to take a 51 per cent stake in the joint venture, which will use the Korean firms patented FINEX technology that utilises iron ore fines to make electrical grade steel.        
	Verma, however, denied any joint venture plans with ArcelorMittal. We never proposed a joint venture with ArcelorMittal. We have not discussed with them any plans to set up a joint venture.         
	Earlier this week, Arcelor executives had hinted that the European steel maker had made a proposal to SAIL and was in discussion with SAIL (to set up a joint venture plant).         
	ArcelorMittal is believed to be keen to partner SAIL in setting up a 3-million-tonne steel plant at Sindri, Jharkhand, for which the state-run firm is in the process of getting about 6,500 acres from Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited (FCI).        
	The auto-grade plant could rather have a Japanese partner, according to sources. However, as a precondition to getting the land, SAIL will have to take on the responsibility of reviving FCIs fertiliser plant and setting up a power plant.         
	SAIL is going ahead with a joint venture with Kobe Steel for a half-million-tonne plant, which will use the Japanese firms ITmK3 technology to produce premium grade iron in the form of nuggets.

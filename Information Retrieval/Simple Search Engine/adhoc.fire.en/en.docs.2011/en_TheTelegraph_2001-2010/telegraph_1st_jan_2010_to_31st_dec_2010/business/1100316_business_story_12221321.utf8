          ABHIJIT KUMAR DUTTA AMP; SAMBIT SAHA                                    
	Calcutta, March 15: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is looking to pump money into a new facility at Salt Lakes Sector V.        
	But before it commits any investment, the tax advisory and audit firm wants a reassuring signal from the Centre that it can finally bury the ghost of Satyam  the biggest corporate fraud that rocked India in January 2009  and move ahead.        
	We want some good vibes from the government that they are happy with PwC making some of these investments and supportive of that, PwC India chairman Gautam Banerjee told The Telegraph.        
	The firm has presence in three verticals  audit, tax and advisory. It has a strong presence in Calcutta, employing about 1,800 people and wants to scale it up to over 3,000 in a couple of years.        
	PwCs association with the city dates back to 1880 when the firm opened its office here after setting up shop in London in 1860.         
	PwC global chairman Dennis M Nally will be coming to Calcutta on Saturday to look at expansion possibilities.        
	The firm is planning to move some of its back office jobs here. It has land adjacent to the existing building to put up another office.         
	Calcutta is already a centre for shared services of PwC, and the firm wants to ramp up the operations here.        
	There will be three to four centres around the world, and one of them will be Calcutta provided everything goes right.        
	We have been planning this for a while. If things go right we can add another 2,000 people in the next two years, Banerjee said.        
	However, the firm wants a clear signal from the government before taking a decision.        
	We dont want a witch hunt against PwC. As far as the Satyam case is concerned, we want to draw a line and move on. But we feel that the line has not been drawn as yet and people are still taking potshots at us, the newly appointed India chairman said.        
	Elaborating on what sort of signals it is expecting, Banerjee said he would be happy to settle issues with market regulator Sebi in the Satyam case.        
	PwC had started a consent process with Sebi, seeking an early settlement of the case. According to Sebi, a consent order refers to settling administrative or civil proceedings between the regulator and a party who may prima facie be found to have violated laws.        
	The PwC India chairman said the firm was prepared to face any punishment or pay cash penalty.         
	Banerjee said the firm would not even mind if some sort of restriction was slapped on its Hyderabad operations that did the Satyam audit.        
	We want the uncertainty to end. The consent application to Sebi is a move towards that, Banerjee pointed out.        
	According to Banerjee, the firms internal investigation has not revealed any complicity between its partners and the Satyam management.

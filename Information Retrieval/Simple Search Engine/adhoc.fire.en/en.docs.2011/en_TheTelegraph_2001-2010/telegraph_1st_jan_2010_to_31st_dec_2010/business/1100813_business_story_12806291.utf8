          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Food inflation bounced back to double digits at 11.40 per cent in the last week of July on the back of costlier cereals, fruits and milk.         
	Analysts expect the Reserve Bank of India to keep a close tab on inflationary pressure and follow a tight monetary stance in its next policy review. Inflation in food items was 9.53 per cent in the previous week.        
	The return of food inflation to double digits comes at a time the government is facing flak from the Opposition on food and fuel price rise.        
	Food inflation is not a surprise at all. Last year in this week it fell sharply and then increased again. So increase in the food price inflation is pure (low) base effect, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said.        
	A number of measures have been taken. In a month or so, we will definitely see (food) inflation coming down.        
	On an annual basis, cereals turned expensive by 6.97 per cent. Prices of pulses soared over 20 per cent, while rice and wheat increased 6.89 per cent and 7.93 per cent, respectively.

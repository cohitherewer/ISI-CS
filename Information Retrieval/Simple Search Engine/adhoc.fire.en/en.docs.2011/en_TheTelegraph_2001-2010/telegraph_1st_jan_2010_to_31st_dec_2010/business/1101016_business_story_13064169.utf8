The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bond issue set for debut
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bond issue set for debut
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Oct. 15: The State Bank of India will issue bonds to raise up to Rs 1,000 crore.         
	Indias No.1 bank will pay an interest rate of 9.25 per cent on the first series of the issue, which has a 10-year tenor, and 9.50 per cent on the second series having a tenor of 15 years. The bonds have a call option after five years and 10 years, respectively. If the SBI does not exercise the call option, holders will get higher 50 basis points more interest rates. The issue will open for subscription on October 18 and close on October 25. Close to 50 per cent of the issue are reserved for retail investors and 25 per cent each for high net worth individuals and corporates.         
	Though the bonds will not carry any tax incentives such as the infrastructure bonds of IDFC or L amp;T Infra, the bank expects a good response given the higher interest rates.         
	This is the first time in recent years that a bank is coming out with such a subordinated debt issue, which implies that the payments on bonds will come after prior payment of other liabilities such as deposits in case the entity winds up business.         
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said the issue was expected to enhance its capital adequacy ratio and correct its asset liability structure. This is because most of the banks liabilities (deposits) are short term in nature, while a good chunk of its lendings is long term. Therefore, the bank is keen on raising long-term funds.         
	Bhatt said the SBI also wanted to offer a new product to investors and might also come out with similar issues more frequently in the future. We want these bonds to be available on tap. We will come out with such issues again and again may be quarterly or even monthly, he said.

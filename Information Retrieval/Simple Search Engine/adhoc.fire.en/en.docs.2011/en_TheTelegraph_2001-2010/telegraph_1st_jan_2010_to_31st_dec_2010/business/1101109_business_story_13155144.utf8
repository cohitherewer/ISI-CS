  Official plays down outsourcing worries          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Gary Locke in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: India and the US may look beyond a bilateral investment deal and move towards a comprehensive economic co-operation agreement.        
	The Obama administration also seems to see no threat in IT outsourcing to India costing jobs in the US. White House believes a closer economic relationship will lead to greater orders of American products that should generate employment in the US.         
	There is a lot of interest in CECA (comprehensive economic co-operation agreement), specially from the business community (of both) American and Indian CEOs. We are gradually moving towards more agreements on the ease of investment, US commerce secretary Gary Locke told The Telegraph.         
	India and US are now negotiating a bilateral treaty, which is expected to ease investment flows and assure investors of fair treatment.        
	However, the CEOs of both the countries have been lobbying for the CECA, which is much bigger in scope. The CECA not only allows national treatment of investment in specific sectors but also includes a free trade pact.         
	India has till now signed the CECA with Singapore and concluded talks with Malaysia.        
	Unlike the US, India has long favoured a free trade agreement, though it is wary of opening up agriculture as there is a perception of US subsidising its farmers. New Delhi is also not keen on opening up banking till local banks consolidate.         
	The US have been lobbying to open up the two sectors as well as defence and retail.        
	However, Locke said current negotiations relate to broad discussions on removing barriers to investment but not on specific sectors. Though he called for the removal of FDI caps on sectors, the commerce secretary did not articulate any wish list. He did advocate lower tariff in agriculture.         
	Discussions have been occurring for sometime (on farm produce tariff). We believe its important for India to reduce tariffs that restrict the flow of agricultural products to Indian consumers.         
	The American commerce secretary also played down apprehensions of IT firms on outsourcing. The debate in the US was more centred on manufacturing jobs which Chinese imports were destroying.         
	There are some people who are very concerned (about the outsourcing of jobs to Indian BPOs) (but) we have to look at the total picture in terms of jobs. Indian companies have invested in the US and US companies are selling their products to India, creating jobs back home.

          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Nov. 5: In a welcome start to Samvat 2067, gold and silver prices jumped to their all-time highs today.        
	Standard gold (22 carat)  the benchmark in jewellery  staged a comeback after a brief lull to reach a historic high and within a striking distance of the magical Rs 20,000-mark.        
	In Mumbai, standard gold spurted Rs 285 to end at Rs 19,920 per 10 gram from the overnight closing level of Rs 19,635. Pure gold (24 carat), on the other hand, shot up Rs 280 to Rs 20,015 per 10 gram from Rs 19,735 yesterday. In Calcutta, 22-carat gold surged to Rs 19,105 per 10 gram from the previous close of Rs 18,935. Pure gold was up Rs 175 to Rs 20,135 per 10 gram from Rs 19,960 yesterday.        
	Silver also sizzled in the Calcutta market and closed at Rs 39,000 per kg, up Rs 1,250 from yesterdays close. In Delhi, silver spurted by Rs 1,300 today to Rs 38,900 per kg, a level never seen before, while pure gold jumped Rs 250 to Rs 20,100 per 10 gram, just Rs 20 shy of the record price of Rs 20,120 reached on October 15.        
	Trading sentiment turned extremely bullish as stockists and jewellers purchased heavily to get off to an auspicious start in Samvat 2067.        
	The spurt in bullion prices in the domestic market has been fuelled by cues from the overseas markets.         
	In New York, gold rose to $1,394.60 a troy ounce yesterday, surpassing its previous historic high of $1,387 on October 14 this year. In the international market, silver settled at $26 an ounce yesterday, its highest level since March 1980. International rates dictate the prices of the yellow metal in the domestic market.         
	Prices of precious metals have been firming up since September when the US Federal Reserve started talking about the second round of quantitative easing.         
	On November 3, when the US Fed announced that it would buy back treasury bonds worth $600 billion over the next eight months to boost the US economy, it immediately led to a depreciation of the dollar against almost all major currencies, including the rupee.         
	Since gold price in the international market is dollar denominated, the price of the yellow metal in the global markets started moving up.         
	A depreciating dollar also prompted global investors to look for a safe haven in gold that further fuelled the rise in the prices.         
	The recent run-up in gold prices is exclusively dollar-driven, said a commodity analyst with brokerage house Karvy Comtrade.         
	The US dollar is likely to depreciate at least in the short-run post the quantitative easing, said a senior forex analyst with HSBC.         
	Hence, gold prices are likely to inch up further.        
	Silver prices have already hit a 30-month high in the international markets. Silver is expected to touch the Rs 40,000-mark very soon, said Sanjiv Kejriwal, director, Gold Silver Arts.

	Calcutta, June 18: Life insurance companies may be allowed to invest in bonds of the India Infrastructure Debt Fund to be floated for refinancing greenfield infrastructure projects being set up under the public-private partnership model.         
	The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) has agreed to allow India Infrastructure Debt Fund bonds as eligible investments for insurance companies, according to a senior Irda official.        
	Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an insurance summit organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today, Irda member (finance and investment) R.K. Nair said, We have agreed to the Deepak Parekh Committees recommendations on allowing insurance funds to invest in bonds of the proposed India Infrastructure Debt Fund.        
	Life insurance companies have stayed away from investing in greenfield infrastructure projects being set up by special purpose vehicles (SPVs) because such investments were considered risky.         
	In an earlier occasion, Sashi Krishnan, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurances chief investment officer, said, Though life insurance funds are considered as a prime source of funding for the countrys infrastructure development, the project risk of these greenfield projects are too high for us to consider for investment.         
	We (life insurance companies) had suggested that while commercial banks cannot provide long-term funding for infrastructure projects, they can do the project financing and once the project is commercially operational we can take over the loan requirement of such projects from thereon.

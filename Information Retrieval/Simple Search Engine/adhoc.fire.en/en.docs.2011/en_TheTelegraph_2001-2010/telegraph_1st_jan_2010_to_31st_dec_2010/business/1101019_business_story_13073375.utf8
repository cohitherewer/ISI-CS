          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Shaw: Joining hands                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 18: Biocon today entered a deal with Pfizer Inc to sell biosimilar versions of insulin to fight diabetes.         
	Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will make upfront payments of $200 million. Apart from this, Biocon may receive additional development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $150 million and payments linked to Pfizers sales of the four biosimilars across global markets.         
	Biosimilars are new variants of biopharmaceuticals whose patents have expired. They are similar to the original product in terms of safety and efficacy.         
	In a press statement today, Biocon said Pfizer would have exclusive rights to commercialise these products globally, with certain exceptions, including co-exclusive rights with Biocon in Germany, India and Malaysia. In other words, Pfizer will share the marketing rights with Biocon in these three countries.         
	Biocon said Pfizer would also have co-exclusive rights with existing Biocon licensees for some of the products, primarily in a number of developing markets.         
	According to the deal, Biocon will remain responsible for the clinical development, manufacture and supply as well as for regulatory activities to secure approvals in various countries.         
	Pfizer and Biocon bring together a winning combination of marketing, manufacturing and research excellence which can build a formidable global footprint in diabetes care. Pfizer brings brand strength and a vast and unrivalled global marketing network that will enable Biocon to realise its objective of seeing its insulin portfolio having a worldwide presence, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, chairman and managing director of Biocon, said.         
	According to the World Health Organisation, the market for diabetes drugs and devices is estimated at $40 billion in 2010 with insulins accounting for $14 billion.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 18: Retail investors may soon be allowed to stump up Rs 2 lakh for shares floated through an initial public offering (IPO).        
	The capital market regulator today proposed to double the existing monetary limit of Rs 1 lakh  a move that is designed to ensure greater subscription from the retail investors category.        
	At present, 35 per cent of all shares floated through an IPO have to be earmarked for retail investors.         
	Several large public issues have struggled to fill up the retail investors quota, forcing companies to farm out the excess shares to other categories of investors.        
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has floated a discussion paper on the subject and invited suggestions from the public till September 3.        
	The Rs 1-lakh limit on retail subscription to an IPO has been in force since March 2005.         
	The monetary limit on retail investment was first set in August 2003 and fixed at Rs 50,000. Before that, retail investors could apply for up to 1,000 shares with no monetary limit for subscription.        
	The proposal comes at a time offerings like that of SKS Microfinance and Bajaj Corp Ltd have made a strong debut in the secondary markets even as retail investors have been very selective about IPOs. Market experts are, however, optimistic that retail participation in new issues will improve in the days ahead.        
	Several recent flotations, including the StanChart Indian Depositary Receipt issue, failed to elicit retail investor interest. Other issues that failed to fill the retail investor quota were DB Realty, and two follow-on public issues by Rural Electrification Corporation and National Mineral Development Corporation.         
	Sebi said the Rs 1-lakh limit for retail individual investors needed to be enhanced as an analysis of recent IPO flotations showed that around 75 per cent of the applications in this category had come in the range of Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh. On the other hand, in the non-institutional investor category, the number of applications in the size of less than Rs 5 lakh was negligible.         
	The regulator said this indicated that retail investors who had the capacity and appetite to apply for shares worth more than Rs 1 lakh were being constrained by the monetary cap.         
	They could not make an application under the non-institutional investor category because the allocation there is limited to 15 per cent as against 35 per cent for retail investors in IPOs.        
	As 35 per cent of a new offering are reserved for retail investors, a large capital issue worth Rs 4,000-6,000 crore will have to secure at least 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh applications to fill the 35 per cent retail investors quota.        
	This could be a daunting task considering that in case of well oversubscribed issues, the number of applications received from retail individual investors is in the range of 35,000 to 70,000, it added.        
	In the five-year period since the Rs 1-lakh limit has been in force, the BSE sensex has also risen. As a result, retail investors can now buy fewer shares than they could with the same amount in 2005.        
	Market participants, however, want the limit to be raised higher.        
	Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, said the move was welcome but the limit ought to be raised to Rs 5 lakh.        
	It may be good to look at a higher level, say Rs 5 lakh, considering the fact that the days of at par issues are over. IPOs these days are typically priced around Rs 400 to 500 per share. The move is certainly positive and an early implementation would be welcome, he told The Telegraph.        
	An analyst with a foreign brokerage, who did not wish to be identified, said large capital issuers would welcome the proposal as they could be more certain about full subscription in the retail category.

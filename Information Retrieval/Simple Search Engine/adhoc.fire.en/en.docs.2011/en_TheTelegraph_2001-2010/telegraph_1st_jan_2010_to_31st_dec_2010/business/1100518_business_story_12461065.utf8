	Calcutta, May 17: S.K. Roongta, the outgoing chairman of Steel Authority of India Ltd, today confirmed that the company was in talks with Tata Steel and ArcelorMittal for a joint venture in India, while negotiations with Koreas Posco were at an advanced stage.        
	Both the companies have expressed a willingness to set up a joint venture in steel making, Roongta told reporters in Calcutta. The SAIL chief is set to retire at the end of this month.        
	According to Roongta, There could be three separate projects. We have to see how the talks progress, he said referring to Mittal, Tata and Posco.        
	A steel plant is being proposed with Posco in Jharkhand along with a special alloy unit in Maharashtra.        
	Recently, Roongta had gone to Korea along with the steel secretary to visit the Posco unit which makes steel from finex technology that can use low-grade iron ore and non-coking coal. Roongta said the Posco joint venture might initially have a 2-million-tonne capacity.        
	Roongta refused to comment on whether the lure of captive natural resources such as iron ore or the large swathe of unused land was drawing the global majors to SAIL. You should ask them. All I can say that any joint venture must be win-win for both parties, he said.        
	The Tatas, the Mittals and Posco had announced grand plans to invest in new projects in the last five years but could make little progress because of problems over land acquisition and mine allocation.        
	Roongta said the company had enough land to increase its capacity to nearly 50 million tonnes from 14 million tonnes at present.

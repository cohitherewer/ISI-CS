                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Vedanta sticks to Cairn price 
  - Delay in Sebi okay stalls open offer        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cairn Energy CEO Bill Gammell (left) with Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal in Mumbai on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Oct. 11: The Vedanta group will not raise its open offer price of Rs 355 a share that it has placed before minority shareholders of Cairn India with chairman Anil Agarwal arguing that it remained a very lucrative offer in the current context.        
	Sesa Goa  a Vedanta group company  is looking to acquire another 20 per cent from the minority shareholders of Cairn India, which will give the Vendanta group a majority stake in the oil and gas explorer.        
	Back in August, the Vedanta group had struck a deal with Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy Plc to acquire a 40 per cent stake in Cairn India at a price of Rs 405 apiece that included a Rs 50 per share premium for a three-year non-compete agreement in the markets of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan.        
	The differential pricing has miffed Cairn Indias minority shareholders.         
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi)  the capital market watchdog  is yet to clear the open offer, which was supposed to be launched today.        
	The market has been abuzz with talks that the Vedanta group will raise the open offer price.         
	The Cairn India stock surged 5.35 per cent to Rs 355.90 in intra-day trading. However, the stock shed some of those gains and closed at Rs 345, an increase of 2.13 per cent over last Fridays close.        
	But Agarwal, who was addressing a press conference along with Bill Gammell, CEO of Cairn Energy Plc here today, ruled out a price revision.         
	We have given a lucrative offer (Rs 355 per share) and that stands, he said.        
	The Vedanta group chief said Sebi had asked for certain clarifications from the group, which had been answered.         
	They were normal enquiries  technical points  to which we have replied. Normally, it takes 45-60 days for Sebis approval to come. We will have to wait, he added.        
	Sesa Goa had approached the market regulator for clearance on August 17. This was a day after the group announced a deal to acquire 51-60 per cent of Cairn India for $8.5-$9.6 billion in cash.        
	The deal will also have to be cleared by the Union government.        
	Since the deal was announced on August 16, there have been some hiccups.         
	First, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC), which holds 30 per cent in Cairn Indias main oil asset in Rajasthan, had claimed that it had a pre-emption right, or the right of first refusal, on Cairn Indias assets.         
	The state-owned oil explorer was also sore over a clause in the production-sharing contract that obliged it to pay the entire royalty for the crude oil pumped out of the Rajasthan block even though it had only a 30 per cent stake.        
	On being questioned on these two developments today, Gammell said the royalty payment was an issue between ONGC and the government. He admitted the corporation had a pre-emptive right on an asset sale but it did not extend to a restructuring of the shareholding pattern. He argued that ONGC did not have a first right of refusal in this case as it did not involve a transfer of an asset.        
	The Cairn Plc CEO expressed hope that the deal would be sealed by the end of this year, adding that the whole world was looking closely at the developments. If there were delays or unnecessary hurdles, it would hurt Indias image as a destination of choice for overseas investors, he added.        
	Balco residual stake        
	Vedanta Resources today said the long-drawn arbitration process for buying the governments remaining 49 per cent stake in Balco was over, and the group expected to complete the acquisition by the end of this fiscal.        
	The arbitration process is concluded. Award is expected soon. By March, we hope to acquire the governments residual stake, Vedanta Resources chairman told PTI.        
	The metal and mining group also hopes to take forward the process of buying the governments residual stake in another erstwhile PSU  Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL). The Balco arbitration is about whether call option is valid or not. If it is established (that call option is valid), then it will be valid for Hindustan Zinc as well, he added.        
	The government holds a 49 per cent stake in Balco and a 29.5 per cent in HZL.

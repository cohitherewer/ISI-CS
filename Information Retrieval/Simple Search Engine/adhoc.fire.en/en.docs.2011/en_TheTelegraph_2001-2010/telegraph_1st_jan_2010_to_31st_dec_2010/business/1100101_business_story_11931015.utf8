          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 31: High prices of potatoes and pulses pushed food inflation to 19.83 per cent for the week ended December 19 from 18.65 per cent a week ago.        
	Potato prices more than doubled, while pulses were costlier by more than 41 per cent over the last year.         
	Onion prices rose 40.75 per cent, while vegetables and fruits were dearer by 46.7 per cent and 10.35 per cent, respectively.        
	On a weekly basis, prices of bajra rose 12 per cent, wheat 4 per cent and rice 2 per cent.        
	Barley and urad rose 1 per cent each. However, prices of fruits and vegetables declined 5 per cent on a weekly basis.        
	Poor monsoon and unexpected floods have triggered the price spiral.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said it was a major challenge for the government to check inflation in the short-to-medium term.         
	For equitable growth, farm output should expand at 4 per cent every year. Agriculture grew 2.5 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal and one per cent in the second quarter.        
	The Opposition had stalled parliamentary proceedings over rising food prices, leading to the adjournment of the Lok Sabha for a day during the winter session.        
	Analysts expect the RBI to tighten key interest rates but say the monetary policy can do little to reign in inflation, given the long transmission lags in policy.         
	The RBI has also raised concerns that rising food costs can fan inflationary expectations.        
	RBI deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath has said there is a risk of food inflation spreading and pushing up the cost of manufacturing goods and services.         
	With both growth and inflation surprising on the upside, we believe that a policy action is imminent. The inflation trajectory is likely to show much higher rates in the next six months. We expect inflation to rise to around 6.5 per cent by December and to 8 per cent by March  well above the RBIs projections, Sonal Varma, economist with Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities, said.

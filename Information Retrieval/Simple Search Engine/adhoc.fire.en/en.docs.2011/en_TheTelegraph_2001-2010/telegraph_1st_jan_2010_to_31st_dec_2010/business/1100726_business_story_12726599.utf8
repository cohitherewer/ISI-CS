The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Move to allow retail investors bid last in float
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Move to allow retail investors bid last in float
                              LAWS OF ATTRACTION                            
	New Delhi, July 25 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is planning to segregate the days on which retail and institutional investors can submit their bids for public offers.        
	According to a proposal being considered by Sebi, institutional investors will be asked to submit their bids first, possibly in the first two days. The remaining two days will be open only for retail investors, provided the IPO is open for four days. The move  aimed at attracting more retail investors to the stock market  can lead to a major overhaul in the way public offers are conducted.        
	Retail investors have been traditionally following the cues from the demand generated among large institutional investors and put in their bids on the last day.         
	In the recent IPOs, institutional investors have also been seen waiting till the last moment.         
	As a result, a large chunk of retail investors missed the opportunity to invest in the IPOs where institutional investors came in during the last hours, a senior official at a leading merchant bank said.        
	He said such problems aggravated in recent months when investors lost money in the IPOs, making them hesitant to put in their bids in the initial days.         
	According to the official, Sebi believes the response from the retail investors has been more worrying. While most of the recent flotations managed to get handsome bids from institutions, that was not the case for small investors.        
	The proposal of setting aside separate days for retail and institutional investors is being discussed by Sebis primary market advisory committee.        
	The committee is also considering making the IPOs simpler. Besides the regulation and development of the primary market, the committee advises Sebi on changes for simpler and transparent procedures.        
	The primary market used to be the retail investors favourite investment avenue till a few years ago. But their interest has been dwindling of late. This was reflected even in the recent offers of some PSUs.         
	Sources said the government had also been asking Sebi to revive the interest of public investors in the primary market.         
	MF protest        
	Mutual fund houses are against a Sebi proposal for treating small investors on a par with large institutions in charging exit loads.         
	Sebi, in its latest communication to around three dozen fund houses, has suggested that they charge equal exit loads from both retail and institutional investors.        
	The fund houses are not in favour of such a move as they feel that services offered to retail investors are much costlier and the margins are also less.        
	Exit load is the fee investors are asked to pay when they redeem their investments in mutual funds.

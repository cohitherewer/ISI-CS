                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Now a senior
                                I was born in January 1945. For which assessment year, will I get the tax benefits for senior citizens.          Rajat Roy, Howrah
                    You turned 65 in January 2010. Thus, you can claim tax benefits for senior citizens for assessment year 2010-11 onwards.                                   Gift for parents      If I gift some money to my parents, will it be taxable? Can I get any tax benefit on this?         Amalendu Chatterjee, Calcutta
                    Your parents will be exempt from paying any tax on gift received from you under Section 56 of the Income Tax Act. However, you cannot claim any deduction.                                  Pay and prove      Can the second holder of a joint account claim tax benefit under Sections 80C?        Purva Ghosh, Suri
                    Whoever pays the money for investment will get the tax benefit, irrespective of whether he is the first or second holder. You shall have to prove with documents that you as the second holder have paid the money for investment.                                  Loan plan      I wish to take a home loan for six years. Can I prepay part of the loan every year?        Subodh Sanyal, Tollygunj
                    Most banks allow prepayment of 25 per cent of the outstanding home loan every year without penalty. However, this prepayment is allowed only after the completion of one year of taking the loan. However, for teaser loans, prepayment is not allowed for the first three years. Since home loans are taken for a long period of time, floating rate is beneficial. At any point of time, fixed interest rates are much higher than the floating rate. Teaser rates, which are fixed for first few years and then becomes variable, are better than plain vanilla offers. But when the teaser period gets over, the EMI goes up. Keep this in mind.

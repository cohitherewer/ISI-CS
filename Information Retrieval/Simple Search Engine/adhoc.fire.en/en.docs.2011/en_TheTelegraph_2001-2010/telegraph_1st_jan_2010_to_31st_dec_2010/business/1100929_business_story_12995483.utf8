The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | MCX-SX set to take on Sebi
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      MCX-SX set to take on Sebi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Big fight                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 28: MCX Stock Exchange (MCX-SX) Limited may approach either the Securities and Appellate Tribunal or the high court against the Sebi order that rejected its application to start trading in equities and equity derivatives.         
	Joseph Massey, managing director and CEO of MCX-SX, said there were two forums where MCX-SX could appeal against the order and these were the SAT and the high court. Legal advisers are yet to finalise which forum the exchange will approach, and Massey did not put a timeframe as to when the exchange will challenge the Sebi order.         
	On September 23, the market regulator rejected its application to start trading in shares as it had not complied with regulations pertaining to shareholding structure in recognised stock exchanges.         
	Referring to Sebis view that warrants issued by MCX-SX to its promoters Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited (MCX) and Financial Technologies India Ltd  have economic interest, Massey said the concept of economic interest was found in the securities contracts regulation act or in the The Manner of Increasing and Maintaining Public Shareholding in Recognised Stock Exchanges Regulations, 2006.        
	He said the warrants were also not convertible by any holder in any manner that might result in exceeding the limits prescribed in MIMPS Regulations.         
	MCX-SX had earlier said that an executive director of Sebi had himself advised the exchange to take up the scheme of capital reduction. According to this plan, the warrants were issued to the promoters. Last year, Financial Technologies had reduced its stake to 37 per cent in MCX-SX, while MCX brought it down to 34 per cent. Subsequently the duo brought their aggregate holdings down to 10 per cent in April.

	June 21: High drama marked shareholders vote today on Bank of Rajasthans merger with ICICI Bank, with a local court in Calcutta staying the extraordinary general meeting of BoR only for it to be vacated by Calcutta High Court.        
	The meeting in Mumbai got off to a chaotic start when the BoR management said it was cancelling the meet following a stay obtained by an investor from a civil court.        
	A bench of a civil court in Calcutta had stayed the EGM till further orders on a plea by BoR shareholder Satyabrata Das. Das claimed that through the EGM, BoR was trying to illegally merge with ICICI Bank.         
	However, Bank of Rajasthan then moved Calcutta High Court contending that the city court did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter.         
	A division bench of Calcutta High Court comprising Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice T.K. Gupta vacated the stay.        
	Livid at the initial cancellation of the meeting in Mumbai, about 1,000 shareholders raised slogans. They then went ahead with the voting, with one of them chairing the session.        
	The BoR EGM has happened. A lower court had issued an injunction but Calcutta High Court has now stayed that order, an ICICI Bank official said from Vadodara.        
	Simultaneously, ICICI Banks EGM was held in Vadodara and the results (on approval for merger) will be known tomorrow, he said.        
	Meanwhile, BoR employees went on a strike protesting violation of shareholding guidelines by the promoters Tayal family and opposing the merger with ICICI Bank.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt seeks Cairn facts
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Govt seeks Cairn facts
          OUR BUREAU                          Deora: Decision time                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The government has sought details of the Cairn Energy-Vedanta deal that will lead to the latter taking control of Cairn India.         
	The petroleum ministry has written a two-paragraph letter to Scotlands Cairn Energy seeking more information on the nature of the transaction. Anil Agarwals Vedanta group has proposed to pick up a 51-60 per cent stake in Cairn India for $8.5-9.6 billion through direct share purchase from promoter Cairn Energy and an open offer.         
	We have told Cairn to write to us. Then we will decide, oil minister Murli Deora said today.        
	State-owned ONGC feels it has the first right on refusal for Cairn Indias stake because it holds a 30 per cent interest in the 6.5-billion-barrel Rajasthan block, in which Cairn holds 70 per cent interest. This means ONGC has the rights to 30 per cent of the crude from the Rajasthan fields, with Cairn holding the rights for the rest.        
	So far, Cairn Energy and the London-listed Vedanta Resources have submitted the press statements they issued on August 17 announcing the deal to the government.        
	The ministry letter states that some production sharing contracts (PSC) of Cairn India have parent company guarantees, while others have explicit provisions of prior government consent in case there is a change of ownership, sources said.         
	The PSC for the Rajasthan block asks for government consent only if a party is selling its interest in the blocks but does not make the approval mandatory if there is a change of ownership at the corporate level such as the Cairn-Vedanta deal.        
	Similar is the case with Cairns Cambay basin block and eastern offshore Ravva oil and gas fields.         
	However, the seven exploration blocks Cairn won under the New Exploration Licensing Policy require government approval before any change of ownership.        
	The finance ministry had earlier said Cairn would have to pay capital gains tax of at least $1 billion on the deal.

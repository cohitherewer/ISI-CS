          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 18: Crisis-wracked Bank of Rajasthan has decided to merge with ICICI Bank, the countrys second largest commercial bank.        
	The Tayals  who have been facing the heat from the banking and the market regulators over the past few months  today decided to merge the bank with ICICI and possibly head off the prospect of tough regulatory action.        
	The board of Bank of Rajasthan (BoR) met this evening and cleared the proposal for the amalgamation with ICICI. The board also approved the due diligence of the proposed transaction. Haribhakti amp; Sons will conduct the due diligence.        
	The ICICI Banks board met separately to approve the amalgamation. Reports said the bank agreed on a tentative share swap deal in the ratio of 25 ICICI shares to 118 BoR shares. This is, however, subject to due diligence.         
	If the deal goes through at this share swap ratio, ICICI will be paying a premium of almost 89 per cent to the current market price of the BoR scrip.        
	The market was abuzz with talk of a merger late this afternoon. The Bank of Rajasthan stock surged 19.95 per cent to close at Rs 99.50 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. In contrast, ICICI Bank fell 1.35 per cent to Rs 889.35.        
	Bank of Rajasthan reported a total income of Rs 1,149.28 crore in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2009. In the full year ended March 2009, it had reported a total income of Rs 1,515.10 crore and a net profit of Rs 117.82 crore.        
	The bank had two good quarters in the last fiscal. It had reported a net profit of Rs 17.07 crore in the quarter ended June 30 and followed that up with a net profit of Rs 17.80 crore in the quarter ended September 30.         
	Inexplicably, it ran into trouble in the third quarter (OctoberDecember) when it totted up a Rs 44.70-crore loss though income in the quarter had risen to Rs 395.58 crore. As a result, it ended up with a net loss of Rs 9.83 crore for the nine-month period ended December 31. The bank hasnt yet come out with its fourth quarter results.        
	BoR is a minnow when compared with ICICI, which reported a full-year consolidated income of Rs 59,599.77 crore for the year ended March 31. It had clocked a net profit of Rs 4,670.29 crore.        
	Ownership trouble        
	The Tayals  who reportedly hold a 55 per cent stake in the Bank of Rajasthan  ran into trouble with the banking and the market regulators early this year after preliminary investigations showed that they were responsible for an intricate skein of stock and cash transactions over a period of 30 months through 100 entities to conceal BoRs real ownership structure.         
	All along the Tayals have claimed that they owned just over 28 per cent in the bank. The Tayals had bought the bank from the Bangurs in the late nineties.        
	In early March, four members of the Tayal family and 100 entities were barred from all stock market activity pending a detailed investigation.        
	Sebi said a probe into share transactions in Bank of Rajasthan between June 2007 and December 2009 had revealed that the promoters stake in the bank had leapt to 55.01 per cent by December 2009. The bank, on the other hand, had claimed in a stock market filing last December that the promoters didnt hold more than 28.61 per cent.        
	The stake increase had made a mockery of an RBI directive in February 2005 to all private sector banks to scale back the promoters stake to 10 per cent.         
	The Tayals had claimed to have been complying with that directive and had brought down their holdings from a high of 44.18 per cent in June 2007 to 28.61 per cent by December 2009.

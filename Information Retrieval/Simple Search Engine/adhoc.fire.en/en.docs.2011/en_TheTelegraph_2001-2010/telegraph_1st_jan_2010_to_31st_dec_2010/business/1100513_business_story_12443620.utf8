                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cairn oil set to flow
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, May 12: Cairn will start pumping crude from its Rajasthan fields by the end of this week, bringing down operational costs by $3-4 per barrel.        
	The company has completed the construction of the 590km heated pipeline  the longest in the world  connecting Barmer in Rajasthan with Salaya in Gujarat.        
	Cairn needs to pour in at least one million barrels to ensure that it flows out at the delivery point in Gujarat.         
	It will take about a month before the company starts selling to domestic refineries.        
	The British explorer has contracted to sell up to 143,000 barrels oil per day (bpd) to Mangalore Refinery amp; Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), Indian Oil Corporation, Reliance Industries (RIL) and Essar.        
	The company is ramping up production from the Rajasthan fields to 125,000bpd by June from 30,000bpd. It will go up to 175,000bpd by the end of next year. The Rajasthan block, which comprises Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya fields, is 70 per cent owned by Cairn. ONGC owns the rest.        
	At present, Cairn transports crude from Mangala to the Kandla port by tankers for shipment to MRPL and RIL.         
	The pipeline, once fully operational, will reduce the transportation cost to $1 per barrel from $6-7 per barrel. Overall operational cost will be $5.3 a barrel.        
	Cairn and ONGC have spent $1billion, or Rs 4,450 crore, to build the pipeline that runs about nine feet beneath the ground.         
	The heated pipeline will ensure the smooth flow of the waxy crude. A total of 32 heating stations generating 32 mega watt electricity have been installed along the route at an interval of 18 kilometres.        
	Farmers are allowed to cultivate the land along the pipeline route but Cairn retains the right to dig up if required. No construction will be allowed.         
	The pipeline will be extended till Bhogat in future.

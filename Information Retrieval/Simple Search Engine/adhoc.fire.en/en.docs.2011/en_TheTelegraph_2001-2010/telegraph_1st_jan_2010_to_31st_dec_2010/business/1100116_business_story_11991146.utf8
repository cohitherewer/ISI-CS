          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 15: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Indias largest software exporter, today reported a 33.9 per cent jump in third-quarter profits at Rs 1,823.90 crore, added 32 clients and padded its rolls with over 12,000 new employees  clear indications that the recovery in the software industry has started to gain traction as the global economy claws its way out of recession.        
	It was not a one-sided, but a holistic performance, N. Chandrasekaran, TCS managing director and CEO, said.        
	The software major saw strong growth in both volumes and margins across all geographies. The banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), which accounts for 45 per cent of its revenues of Rs 7,649 crore during the quarter, led the surge among its industry verticals. Revenues from the BFSI space jumped to Rs 3,441 crore from Rs 3,085.81 crore in the year-ago quarter.        
	Analysts had forecast a net profit of Rs 1,630 crore for TCS, but the expectations escalated after Infosys reported better-than-expected numbers earlier this week.        
	Chandrasekaran said the company had signed 10 significant deals even as he maintained that the demand recovery was now broad-based. We are pursuing more deals. It has been a holistic growth. Besides BFSI, telecom, and manufacturing have also shown good growth, he said.        
	During the quarter, TCS reported a volume growth of 6.6 per cent even as net margins improved 164 basis points. Strong client additions supported above-average revenue growth in the energy and utilities space, the company said.        
	In terms of geographies, North America led with a contribution of 52.5 per cent, same as in the preceding quarter, though the share of India and Asia Pacific rose on a sequential basis.        
	There was a gross addition of 12,854 employees (net addition of 7,692). The utilisation rates improved to 81.1 per cent (excluding trainees) and 77.2 per cent (including trainees). The attrition rate was at 11.5 per cent. We have had significant employee additions this quarter and still, have increased our talent utilisation to industry leading levels. We are prepared to meet the growth in demand, said Ajoy Mukherjee, vice-president and head of global human resources.         
	He said the company was hoping to add around 8,500 employees in the fourth quarter. We will look at salary hikes only after April, he said. The TCS scrip finished at Rs 791.80 on the BSE, a gain of 1.23 per cent, over the last close.

	New Delhi, April 14: A move towards uniform gas pricing could face stiff opposition from private players who prefer a market-based regime.        
	Multiple gas rates now prevail in India  from $1.82 per million British thermal unit for ONGC and Oil Indias output to $5.73 per mBtu for BG Groups output  which go against the interests of industrial consumers and have pushed up the subsidy bill.        
	GAIL (India) Limited, commissioned by the government to review the norms, has favoured uniform pricing across the country.        
	Industry sources, however, said the move could scuttle investments in the exploration and production of natural gas, which is a high-risk business.        
	Spanish consultant Marcados Energy Market, appointed by GAIL, has proposed pooling  or determining an average of multiple rates  as the most suited option. Marcator wants pooling on a sectoral basis, meaning rates will be same within an industry but different across industries.        
	The oil ministry has invited comments from stakeholders on the report, before finalising its recommendations for the cabinet.        
	Petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan has said the difference in gas prices is unfair on customers.         
	I am not saying there should be arithmetical equality, but approximate equitable prices all over the country are desirable. You could have a pooled pricing mechanism, which will be approximately like having equal prices, he said.        
	The Marcados report said sectoral pooling would serve the basic objectives without being heavy on administrative arrangements and cost. It would also facilitate an eventual migration to competitive markets.        
	Arvind Mahajan, energy analyst with KPMG, said, Multiplicity of gas producers and gas consumers should give rise to a market-driven price for the commodity. The government intervention in determining and influencing alternative gas prices based on the category of gas consumer creates market distortions and undermines the freedom to market and the freedom to pricing. Gas, like other fuel supplies, should be freed from such constraints.        
	Gokul Chaudhri, partner in BMR Advisors, said that gas should be allowed to be marketed and priced according to market demand and supply. He said consumer interests should be protected via an independent regulator and not by way of price intervention by the state.

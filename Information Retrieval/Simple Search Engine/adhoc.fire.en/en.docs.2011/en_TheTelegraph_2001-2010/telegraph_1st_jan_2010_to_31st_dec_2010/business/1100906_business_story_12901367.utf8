The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Balmer set to sue ICICI Venture
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Balmer set to sue ICICI Venture
          SAMBIT SAHA                                             
	Calcutta, Sept. 5: Balmer Lawrie amp; Co, the city-based public sector conglomerate, is likely to sue ICICI Venture for accounting fraud at its associate company, Transafe Services Ltd.         
	The PSU has hired the services of a battery of legal eagles backed by solicitor firm Khaitan amp; Co to consider the option of initiating criminal proceedings against ICICI Venture, one of the biggest private equity funds in the country with a corpus of over $2 billion.         
	Transafe, which is primarily engaged in manufacturing, selling and leasing of containers and equipment, was a joint venture between ICICI Venture and Balmer Lawrie. Last September, ICICI Venture sold its stake to its partner and exited the company.         
	The PSU claims to have unearthed a multi-layered accounting fraud involving inflated profits, fudging losses to show profits, payment of huge bonuses to top management, and the payment of income tax, dividend and dividend tax on fictitious profits.         
	The creative accounting was discovered when auditors trawled the books after ICICI Venture pulled out of the company.         
	Balmer Lawrie and its subsidiary, Balmer Lawrie Van Leer, bought the stake owned by ICICI Venture at Rs 16 per share after the then Transafe management had furnished accounts to indicate that the company had sound financial strength.         
	Sources said the share acquisition price would have been much lower if the true state of the company was known then.         
	Incidentally, the PSU has already lodged complaints against the former managing director of Transafe and some of the erstwhile employees accusing them of criminal conspiracy and breach of trusts among a litany of charges, which are now being investigated by the Calcutta Police under directions from Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Calcutta.         
	When contacted, the Balmer Lawrie management declined to comment on the latest developments since the police are already investigating the case under the courts direction.         
	An email sent to ICICI Venture went unanswered till the time of going to press.         
	The former MD, a nominee of Balmer Lawrie on the board, had resigned from Transafe shortly after ICICI Venture exited the company.         
	Balmer Lawrie had engaged KPMG to carry out a forensic audit of the books and accounts of Transafe and found huge anomalies spread over at least three financial years.         
	The PSUs filing with the court says Transafe has actually posted a profit of Rs 1.32 crore in 2006-07, but this has been inflated to Rs 4.92 crore.         
	In 2007-08, the company had suffered a loss of Rs 5.31 crore, but the accounts were fudged to show a profit of Rs 8.69 crore.         
	In 2008-09, the company had reported a profit of Rs 8.21 crore when it had actually made a profit of just Rs 93.98 lakh.         
	The accounting shenanigans helped the MD rake in a bonus of Rs 38 lakh, sources said. Moreover, Transafe paid Rs 2.59 crore in excess income tax and paid out Rs 6.94 crore in the form of dividend to shareholders and dividend distribution tax to the government.         
	ICICI Venture and ICICI Trustee Services Ltd held a 70.91 per cent stake in Transafe during this period and controlled all its affairs.         
	Transafe also filed a case against the former MD for misappropriating company funds worth Rs 3 crore.         
	The MD is alleged to have used the funds to acquire club membership and buy expensive articles among other things.         
	The court filing also showed that Transafe had alleged that the external auditors of the company were hand in glove with the management in cooking the books.         
	When contacted, the former MD denied all allegations. He requested this paper not to name him and sully his image that could destroy his career.         
	I left the company in a proper manner. We followed all the auditing norms. The allegations are flimsy and motivated, he said. The MD claimed that the audit committee was headed by the finance director of Balmer Lawrie.         
	On whether the PSU had paid a high price for the Transafe stock based on inflated profits, the MD said, The transaction was between two promoters and the management had nothing to do with the valuation.         
	The petition before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate alleged that the MD had, in connivance with three others, reported dummy sales to show fictitious revenues and doctored debts on the companys books.         
	After his exit, some of the top officials in the company had admitted that some of the outstanding revenues were not collectible.        
	Balmer Lawrie officials denied what the MD said. He has been the chairman of the audit committee since 2006 all through, they said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee: Unwavering                                  
	New Delhi, March 12: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today ruled out rollbacks in the duty hikes on petrol and diesel, announced in the budget, as the countrys fiscal deficit was still very high.        
	I would have loved to respond to the request of the Opposition (for a rollback) but my financial condition does not permit me to do so. Kindly excuse me, Mukherjee in his reply to the debate on the budget.        
	Protesting the governments refusal to roll back the duty hikes, the Opposition walked out of Lok Sabha. The Opposition had also walked out during Mukherjees budget speech when he raised the excise duty on petrol and diesel by Re one per litre and the customs duty on the two to 7.5 per cent from 2.5 per cent that led to petrol and diesel prices rising by about Rs 3 each.        
	UPA ally Trinamul Congress, too, criticised the duty hike during the debate on the budget today. Trinamuls Ratna De said imposing taxes on crude oil and levying service tax on rail freight would lead to price rise which was unacceptable.        
	Mukherjee said the economic situation had improved considerably, and India should return to a high growth path.        
	The finance minister said the lower fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) projected for the next fiscal as opposed to the revised budget estimate of 6.7 per cent of GDP for this year would help to rein in prices.         
	I assure you that a lower fiscal deficit will help correct inflation. Nobody is denying inflation is a problem. But we have taken steps to check it. We have taken measures to remove the supply-side bottlenecks. We have ensured the availability of food items in the market and we have revised import tariffs, he said.        
	On the proposed goods and service tax, Mukherjee said he wanted the rates to be reduced and the base broadened with limited exemptions, so that taxes on both goods and services remained at the same level.        
	Convertibility        
	The government today said full rupee float, which would allow the conversion of the rupee into foreign currencies, was its ultimate goal, but it did not want to introduce it at one go.        
	The full convertibility of the rupee is our ultimate destination and we are taking gradual steps towards this. However, it is felt that it is not the time to jump to that destination at one go now, Pranab Mukherjee told the Lok Sabha in a written reply today.        
	Full rupee convertibility, or capital account convertibility, provides investors and individuals the freedom to convert local currency into foreign currency and vice versa without permission of the RBI and without limits.        
	Full convertibility is also expected to facilitate rapid growth through higher investment and improve efficiency in the financial sector through greater competition.        
	Considering the risks involved in opening the Indian economy fully by allowing complete convertibility of the rupee, the government and RBI have adopted a calibrated approach, Mukherjee said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: The steel ministry plans to place before the cabinet a proposal for a 20 per cent stake dilution in SAIL within the next 10 days, despite the poor response to NTPCs follow-on offer.        
	We will send the follow-on proposal (of SAIL) to the cabinet within the next 10 days, steel secretary Atul Chaturvedi told reporters here.        
	Based on SAILs current share price, the proposal, which will also see the company raising 10 per cent fresh equity, is expected to fetch the government and the firm around Rs 9,000 crore each.         
	The government owns a little over 85 per cent in SAIL and is planning to sell 10 per cent of its holding in two phases. The offer is expected to hit the markets in the next financial year. The LIC holds 4.59 per cent of SAIL, while the rest is with the public.         
	The company may spend Rs 13,000 crore to expand capacity in 2010-11 compared with an estimated Rs 10,350 crore this year, chairman S.K. Roongta has said.        
	The steel major had reported Rs 1,676 crore in net profit for the third quarter ended December against Rs 843 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.        
	SAIL is in the process of expanding its annual production capacity to about 23 million tonnes by 2012 from 14 million tonnes now.        
	The government has lined up an aggressive divestment programme for the next financial year, including some follow-on offers, and hopes to raise nearly Rs 30,000 crore.        
	Follow-on offers in the queue include those of SAIL, MMTC and Hindustan Copper. Officials said the lukewarm response to the NTPC follow-on offer had made the government cautious. The NTPC float is expected to bring in Rs 8,300 crore. After the power major, Rural Electrification Corporation will enter the market on February 18.

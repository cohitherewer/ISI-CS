          R. SURYAMURTHY                
	New Delhi, March 14: ONGC is gearing up to invest in a new overseas asset after a gap of more than a year.        
	The Union cabinet is set to take a call on an investment in a recently acquired oil block in Venezuela.        
	A panel of secretaries had approved the investment proposal under the condition that the initial exposure of Indian firms should not exceed $2.181 billion.        
	ONGC Videsh  the overseas arm of ONGC  Indian Oil Corporation Limited and Oil India Limited along with Spains Repsol and Malaysias Petronas had in a consortium bagged a 40 per cent stake in Carabobo-1 block in Venezuelas Orinoco belt.        
	Orinoco is Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limiteds (ONGC) first overseas buy after the acquisition of Britains Imperial Energy two years back. ONGC had made abortive attempts for fields in Iraq and Algeria after Imperial; last week it suffered a reversal when the Russian government offered it some stakes in oil fields that were not to its liking.        
	The ONGC consortium was the only bidder for Orinoco. The empowered committee of secretaries had expressed surprise at as many as 40 firms opting out of bidding for Orinoco after paying a bid sum of $2 million. These include industry leaders such as British Petroleum, Chevron. Chinese National Petroleum Corporation, Gazprom, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Shell, Sumitomo and Total.         
	Industry officials said these companies had shifted focus to other blocks that were on offer.         
	The ONGC-led consortium will pay $1.05 billion to Venezuela as the signing amount and initially invest $9 billion to develop the block that can produce 400,000 barrels of oil per day. Total spending will be $19 billion over 25 years, the officials said.         
	The consortium will also give a $1.05-billion credit to Venezuelas state oil company  Petroleos De Venezuela Sa, which has a 60 per cent interest  and a standing guarantee for the loans taken by the Venezuelan entity for the project.        
	According to the officials, Petroleos De Venezuela does not have adequate financial strength to fork out equity and pay loans.        
	Sources said the panel had approved the participation of Indian firms in the block with a caveat that the financial exposure of the Indian consortium should not exceed $2.181 billion.        
	The panel also wants Petroleos De Venezuela to contribute its share of equity and debt. If it fails, a part of the project  the setting up of an upgrader plant  will be postponed.        
	OVL, Respol and Petronas will have an 11 per cent stake each in the company, which will develop the Carabobo-1 Norte and Carabobo-1 Centro blocks, while Indian Oil and Oil India will each hold 3.5 per cent.        
	The mixed company will build heavy oil production facilities, upgrading units and associated infrastructure. The upstream production units are expected to produce around 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) of extra heavy oil of which about 200,000 bpd will be turned into light crude in a facility to be located in the Soledad area in Anzoategui state, ONGC said after winning the block.        
	The officials said licence agreement for the block, which is likely to start production in three years, will be signed on March 25.         
	Plateau production will come within 1-2 years. The licence term will be for 25 years with potential for a 15-year extension.        
	Signature bonus is to be paid only by the foreign firms. So, the share of ONGC Videsh, Indian Oil and Oil India will be $472.5 million, or 45 per cent, of $1.05 billion. They will also contribute a similar amount to Petroleos De Venezuela as their share of credit.

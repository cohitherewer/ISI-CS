The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nine clock day dawns on bourses
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Nine clock day dawns on bourses
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Mumbai, Jan. 3: The stock markets will open for trading at 9 am on Monday after bourse authorities brushed aside the deep misgivings the stockbrokers have expressed over the new timings.         
	Stock brokers have slammed the move for a variety of reasons: long working hours with the attendant increase in stress levels, inadequate preparation for the transition, lack of effort to persuade banks to also open earlier to facilitate margin money transactions, and the failure to convince the broking community that the benefits will outweigh the initial pangs that brokers will have to suffer.         
	The markets will close as usual at 3:30 pm.         
	The Bombay Stock Exchange and its rival  the National Stock Exchange  were locked in a subtle game of one-upmanship in early December. First, the BSE decided unilaterally on December 15 to advance market opening by 10 minutes.         
	A day later, the NSE upped the ante and decided to open 55 minutes earlier at 9 am from December 18.         
	Marketmen were clearly unprepared for the new timings and forced the two bourses to defer the plan till January 4. In the interim, the brokers mounted a groundswell of pressure to push back the deadline further, but it didnt work this time.         
	Watch on volumes        
	Towards the end of last week, most of the market participants lost all hope of scuttling the move for a second time. But there is a deep sense of scepticism about the volume of business in the first hour of trading tomorrow.         
	Market observers aver that even though brokers are unlikely to boycott trading, the move will not lead to any commensurate increase in volumes.         
	Brokers have been representing that the timing for the real time gross settlement a fund transfer mechanism, which enables the movement of cash from one bank to another on a real-time basis  should also be extended.         
	Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS, who like many other brokers is not convinced about the benefits of the new timings, said, The way they (stock exchanges) went about the whole thing, clearly shows that they are not concerned about their stakeholders. One of the objectives of the revised timings is to capture some volumes of the Nifty trades on the Singapore stock exchange (SGX). Let us see if that indeed happens.         
	Kejriwal felt that it wouldnt be easy to capture some of the SGX business by merely opening for trading 55 minutes earlier. Trading restrictions in India are expected to deter investors who are keen to shift their trades to the local bourses.         
	For example, the starting margins payable here on Nifty futures contract is 15 per cent while it is only 1.5 per cent on the SGX. When there is so much of a price differential and the cost of operation in Singapore is cheaper, why should anybody shift their transactions to India just because our markets opens an hour early? Kejriwal asked.         
	Pros and cons        
	E.M.C. Palaniappan, president of the Association of National Exchanges of India, which had appealed last week to the stock exchanges to put off the plans to advance market timings, came out with a more guarded response.         
	I would not like to comment on the issue (of exchanges going ahead with their earlier decision.) But lets see how it works out.         
	An analyst from another brokerage, who did not wish to be identified, said the new timings would not lead to any significant increase in volumes.         
	However he added that the enhanced trading hours could benefit speculators or those indulging in intra-day trading.         
	Prakash Kulkarni, a retail investor who often dabbles in day trades, agreed with this view. He said he would have more time to square up his trading positions.         
	He added that the new hours were being introduced just before some key developments later this month. Infosys will kick off the third quarter earnings season on January 12, while the Reserve Bank of India is due to review its monetary policy on January 29.

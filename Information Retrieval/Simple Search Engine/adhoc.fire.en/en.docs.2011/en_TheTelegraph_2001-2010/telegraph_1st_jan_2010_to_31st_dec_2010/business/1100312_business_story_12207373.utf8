          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, March 11: Automotive component maker Bosch Ltd may declare a lock-out at its main plant in Bangalore, while the second factory on the outskirts of the city remained shut for the third day today following a breakdown of negotiations over workers salary.         
	Since the last wage settlement expired in December 2008, the management and the workers have held as many as 14 negotiations but have failed to reach a consensus.         
	At a conciliation meeting today, involving the Karnataka labour department, it was decided that the talks between the management and the workers should commence again tomorrow though the lockout would continue.         
	Bosch Ltd is part of Bosch Group, which makes auto components ranging from spark plugs to fuel injection systems in India through six companies with a total of 12 manufacturing sites.         
	The two Bangalore plants count car and truck makers such as Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra and Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors and Hyundai among its clients.         
	The lockout at the plant in Naganathapura, which has been shut since Monday night, has resulted in a loss of revenue of Rs 1 crore everyday, said senior vice-president Soumitra Bhattacharya.         
	A go-slow by workers at the main plant in central Bangalore was causing a loss of revenue of Rs 3 crore, besides hitting the firms exports.         
	Bosch registered a profit-after-tax of Rs 590.6 crore on net sales of Rs 4,749.8 crore in 2009.         
	Based on the events of tool down strikes and the situation, we have also been constrained to say that there is a possibility in the Bangalore unit of the company being constrained to consider a lockout, Bhattacharya said.         
	The Naganathapura plant employs 715 workers, while the main plant has a workforce of 2,400.

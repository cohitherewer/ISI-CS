          SOUNAK MITRA                               
	Calcutta, July 11: Tea companies with gardens in Assam are likely to miss their export target as they witnessed a huge drop in output during the last two months because of an attack of Helopeltis (the pest Helopeltis Thievora), a mosquito-type bug. Tea produced during the period may also not pass the quality test in the global markets because of the heavy use of pesticides.         
	Countries, especially those in Europe, had laid down strict guidelines regarding the residual content of chemicals in tea last year. There are instances of large consignments from Assam being rejected as they failed to meet the minimum residual limit of various chemicals, which are used to fight pests.         
	Following the development, several big companies, which export tea to foreign countries, have regulated the use of such chemicals.         
	Industry sources said the gardens, starting from Moran in Dibrugarh district to Doomdooma in Tinsukia district, had come under the worst-ever pest attack because of heavy rain in the past few months. This is probably the worst helopeltis attack in recent memory, a tea company official said.         
	Planters in upper regions say several gardens have not witnessed the second flush, considered the best in Assam. Tea produced during the second flush (May and June) have a strong and rich aroma.         
	According to sources, production from north India is estimated to fall by about 15 million kg in June. The Tea Board is yet to publish the June statistics.         
	We dont see any major change in July, an industry insider said.         
	Tea Board statistics show that the May production in north India fell 3 million kg to 47.4 million kg from 50.32 million kg mainly because of the fall in production in the Assam crop by 3.5 million kg. The drop in Assam was made up by the Dooars crop.

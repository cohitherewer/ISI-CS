The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Korean logic for bidder pick
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Korean logic for bidder pick
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 13: Mahindra amp; Mahindras leadership position in the Indian SUV market may have given the Mumbai company an edge over Calcuttas Ruia Group to become the preferred bidder for SsangYong.        
	Like the Mahindras, industry sources said, Ruias Raghav Industries had offered the debt-laden Korean SUV maker a package to wipe out its debt and infuse fresh cash to help revive it.        
	Neither M amp;M nor Raghav Industries had disclosed the bid details as they were bound by a confidentiality clause, though the Mahindras had said yesterday that it would make SsangYong debt-free.        
	Ruia had offered around $640 million in a mix of debt and equity, two people with knowledge of the bid said.        
	A Ruia Group spokesperson declined to comment.        
	SsangYong has a debt of around $640 million. Both M amp;M and Ruia are believed to have asked creditors for a cut in interest charge. Raghav Industries wanted the debt level to be brought down by 30 per cent to around $450 million from the existing level. It had also promised to put another $200 million in the company, especially to start an assembly line in India, the sources said. The details of the M amp;M offer are yet to be known.        
	A Korean court started the process of inducting a majority owner in SsangYong after the company filed for bankruptcy last year to seek protection from creditors.         
	The preferred bidder will get fresh equity in the SUV maker to make it a majority owner. It is learnt that Raghav Industries may have asked for around 80 per cent of the equity.        
	If both M amp;M and Ruia made similar offers to make SsangYong debt-free, it is likely that the court appointed advisers chose the Mumbai company because of its core competence in the sector. There is obviously also another possibility that M amp;M made a higher bid over the $640 million committed by Ruia, an industry observer said.         
	In case M amp;M fails to complete the transaction, Ruia will get a chance. However, such a possibility is unlikely as M amp;M is keen to wrap up the deal after losing the race for Jaguar amp; Land Rover to Tata Motors two years back.        
	M amp;M is Indias largest SUV maker, while Ruia is an original equipment manufacturer of the auto industry, supplying tyres from companies such as Falcon and Dunlop. Ruia also acquired two auto ancillary companies in Germany and the UK and a solid tyre company in Germany.        
	The SsangYong stock has reacted negatively to the choice of M amp;M as the preferred bidder. It was down 6.33 per cent today on the Korean Stock Exchange.        
	Chinas SAIC Motor Corp owns 10 per cent of SsangYong, while around 70 per cent is held by creditors, led by state-owned Korea Development Bank.

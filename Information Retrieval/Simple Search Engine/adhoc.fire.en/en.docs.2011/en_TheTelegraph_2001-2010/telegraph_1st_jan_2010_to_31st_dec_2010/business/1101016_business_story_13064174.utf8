                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Coal IPO cash at the cost of sensex
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Oct. 15: The sensex plummeted over 370 points today on profit-booking ahead of the Coal India float and amid apprehensions over the impact of a strengthening rupee on IT companies.         
	The negative close came on a day Infosys Technologies met analyst expectations by posting a 13.15 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 1,737 crore. The company has also raised its dollar guidance for this fiscal.        
	However, fears of an appreciating rupee impacting the margins of IT firms such as Infosys led to selling pressure in IT stocks.         
	Brokers said expectations from Infosys were also running high, and cautious comments from its senior management over the rupee impact led to the unwinding of the stock.         
	The rupee has appreciated more than 5 per cent year-to-date.         
	Besides this, investors were also booking profits to invest in the Coal India IPO, which will open for subscription on Monday.         
	As the IPO is attractively priced, we can see a huge response and investors were selling stocks today to subscribe to it, an analyst, who did not wish to be identified, said.         
	The benchmark index began on a positive note at 20518.50 against the last close of 20497.64 and rose to a high of 20578.45.        
	However, subsequent profit booking saw the sensex hit a low of 20090.18 before settling at 20125.05, a drop of 372.59 points, or 1.82 per cent.         
	The sensex has lost 560 points in two sessions, erasing the gains made earlier in the week.         
	The benchmark index had hit a 33-month high of 20687 on October 13.         
	The IT index, which ended lower by 3.25 per cent, was the biggest sectoral loser.         
	This can be partly attributed to stocks such as Infosys, which lost 3.39 per cent to close at Rs 3,076.15 after hitting a yearly high of Rs 3,249 earlier in the day.         
	Among other IT stocks, Wipro ended lower by 3.58 per cent at Rs 473.50, while Tata Consultancy Services settled at Rs 951, a drop of 3.52 per cent.         
	Investor concerns over a rising rupee were not misplaced as the domestic unit today rallied to breach the 44-mark against the dollar.         
	The rupee hit a 25-month high of 43.97 on huge inflows. It, however, closed stable at 44.11.

	New Delhi, Nov. 27 (PTI): German luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz today said it had appointed Peter T. Honegg as the head of the Indian operations from the first quarter of 2011, following the resignation of Wilfried Aulbur, who is at present the managing director and chief executive officer.        
	Peter T. Honegg will succeed Wilfried Aulbur as the new managing director and CEO of Mercedes-Benz India, the Indian subsidiary of the company said in a statement.        
	Honegg, who has been with Daimler AG since 1976, is at present the president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Malaysia.        
	Honegg has a rich experience of managing high growth markets and is expected to take up his new role in the first quarter of 2011, Mercedes-Benz India said.        
	Earlier in September, the company had announced the resignation of Aulbur.        
	Aulbur, who would complete five years as the India head of Mercedes-Benz by the end of 2010, is likely to move out of the automobile sector but remain in the country.        
	After staying (for) five years in India, he is in love with the country. He has, in fact, married Rekha Srinivasan  an Indian woman. He will most probably stay here forever, a source had said.        
	A German by birth, Aulbur did his doctoral and post-doctoral studies in physics in the US. He was with Mercedes-Benz India in the early 1980s for a short period before rejoining the company as India head in 2005.

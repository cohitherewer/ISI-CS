The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Win-win deal for Ambanis
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Win-win deal for Ambanis
          PIYA SINGH                                             
	Mumbai, May 23: The decision to call off the non-compete agreement inked between the countrys richest siblings in January 2006 will throw open several new investment opportunities for the Ambani brothers.         
	Elder brother Mukesh, however, seems better placed to take advantage of the move to dismantle this agreement that so far barred him from venturing into areas such as telecommunications, power, financial services, and media and entertainment. Many of these areas need large capital outlays.         
	That is exactly what his Reliance Industries Ltd is looking for  business opportunities of a scale that can absorb its $4.9-billion cash pile.         
	The group can raise additional resources from the sale of treasury stock and the massive cash flows that it is expected to generate from its gas business that was commissioned a year ago in the KG-D6 basin.         
	By cancelling the non-compete agreement, Mukesh can start bidding for coal-based mega power projects and plunge into the telecom business that he had to cede to brother Anil.         
	He can also foray into the financial services businesses by buying up a mutual fund or a financial services business that has synergies with his retail operations, said industry sources who declined to be named.         
	Banking is also turning out to be an area of interest for a number of industrial groups after the government announced in this years budget that the RBI would soon hand out more banking licences.         
	Under the old arrangement, banking had been earmarked as a preserve of Anil from the date on which the RBI initiates regulatory changes allowing industrial houses to establish banks.         
	Mukesh Ambani will soon have even more cash at his disposal. Besides the $5 billion cash on its books, the group will have an annual cash flow of $5 billion and can sell more treasury stock worth $7-$8 billion. So in one sense, it is a compulsion for RIL to look for mega projects and diversify its risks by venturing out of oil and gas, and petrochemicals, said Mumbai-based analyst S.P. Tulsian, who tracks the businesses of the brothers.         
	The scrapping of the non-compete agreement is significant as it will enable Mukesh to get into new areas quickly, said another industry source.         
	Target telecom        
	Market speculation suggests that one of the new areas that the Mukesh Ambani group can immediately target will be telecom.         
	Reports in the media have suggested that the Mukesh Ambani group and its associates have a 13.5 per cent indirect stake in Venugopal Dhoot-owned Datacom Solutions through an elaborate layered structure. RIL has denied this development so far.         
	The decision to scrap the pact will obviate the need for elaborate subterfuge and shadowy arrangements.         
	Mukesh Ambani will also be ideally poised to bid for the governments mega power projects. Anil Ambani has so far got three and cannot bid for another till one of the three is up and running, Tulsian said.         
	The government has awarded four mega power projects so far. While the Mundra project has gone to Tata Power, Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Power has bagged the Sasan, Krishnapatnam and Tilaiya projects.         
	While power projects may be a window available to Mukesh, the capital-intensive nature of power generation may appeal to the group that has been scouting for acquisitions overseas.         
	Recently, RIL through its subsidiary Reliance Marcellus got into a joint venture with US-based Atlas Energy to develop shale gas acreage in a transaction estimated at $1.7 billion. The deal followed a failed attempt to acquire bankrupt Dutch petrochemicals company Lyondell Basell despite upping its bid. At one stage, RIL was ready to pay $14.5 billion for Lyondell Basell.         
	Anil benefits too         
	For the Anil Ambani group, the decision to call off the non-compete arrangement, except in the case of gas-based power generation, highlights the younger Ambanis intentions to develop this business.         
	The statement released by both groups said, RIL has agreed not to enter into gas-based power generation business for the period up to March 31, 2022.        
	Anil Ambani has a one-point programme: he now has a bankable agreement to set up 10,000MW of gas-based power generation, said Tulsian.         
	The scrapping of the non-compete agreement will also offer a major relief to Anils Reliance Communications (R-Com). The right of first refusal that was held by the Mukesh Ambani group as far as divesting a stake in R-Com will no longer be valid. This will allow R-Com to bring on board a foreign investor, a transaction that has been attempted in the past with South Africas MTN.         
	The deal fell through as the Mukesh Ambani group was willing to exercise its claim on the right of first refusal in the telecom company.         
	That the telecom business is in a turmoil overseas and competitive pressures are damaging the bottlomlines of telecom companies in India is well known. R-Com is the only large company in its sector that does not have an overseas partner, said a Mumbai-based analyst.         
	Last week, Vodafone had announced a $3.3-billion impairment charge on the valuation of its Indian operations that it had acquired for $11 billion in 2006.         
	R-Com recently bid Rs 8,585 crore for 3G spectrum in 13 circles. The 3G rollout programme will entail heavy capital expenditure in the initial years.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Aug. 16: SKS Microfinance today listed at a premium and went on to close higher.         
	On the BSE, the scrip listed at Rs 1,036 per share, a gain of 5 per cent over the issue price of Rs 985 apiece. It hit a high of Rs 1,159.90 and ended at Rs 1,088.58, a premium of 10 per cent. On the NSE, it opened at Rs 1,040 and touched a peak of Rs 1,162 before settling at Rs 1,084.10.         
	SKS is the first microfinance company to get listed on the domestic bourses. Its initial public offering (IPO), which opened on July 28 and closed on August 2, was oversubscribed 13.6 times.         
	The IPO of 1.68 crore shares came at a price band of Rs 850-985 per share. Though there were concerns on the high valuation, brokerages such as Angel Broking had asked investors to subscribe to the issue.         
	The offering was subscribed 13.6 times, helping the company to raise Rs 1,650 crore. The firm had given a discount to retail investors. The portion reserved for high net worth individuals was subscribed 18 times, while those for qualified institutional buyers was subscribed 20 times and retail, 2.8 times.        
	The Hyderabad-based firm lends to groups of women from low-income households to create income generating assets.        
	The practice brings about credit discipline through mutual support and peer pressure to ensure that individual members are prudent in their financial affairs and are prompt in repaying loans.         
	According to Angel Broking analyst Vaibhav Agrawal, if an individual fails to repay the loan in time, it prevents other group members from borrowing.         
	Therefore, the group will either have to pay on behalf of a defaulting member or, in case of a willful default, use peer pressure to encourage the delinquent member to make timely payments.         
	The firm founded by Vikram Akula in 2003 has Infosyss founder N.R. Narayana Murthy on its board.

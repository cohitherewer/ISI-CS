The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rating blow to Bharti
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Rating blow to Bharti
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 9: Standard amp; Poors Ratings Services today lowered the rating of Bharti Airtel, a day after it completed the acquisition of Kuwait-based Zain Telecoms mobile operations in Africa, citing concerns over the large debt taken to fund the $1.7 billion deal.        
	S amp;P cut the long-term corporate credit rating on Bharti to BB+ from BBB-. The outlook is stable.         
	We lowered Bhartis rating to reflect our expectation that the companys leverage and cash-flow protection measures will deteriorate significantly following its largely debt-funded acquisition of Zain Africa BV (Zain Africa), based on an enterprise value of $10.7 billion, from Mobile Telecommunications Company K.S.C., Standard amp; Poors credit analyst Mehul Sukkawala said.        
	Sukkawala added that the Zain acquisition, coupled with the payment for 3G licence auction and the ongoing auction of the broadband wireless access spectrum, could significantly increase Bhartis debt.        
	S amp;P said the Zain Africa acquisition presented Bharti with higher country, political and convertibility risks, compared with India, which were associated with Zain Africas operations in countries such as Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. However, it added that this was partly offset by the telecom industrys greater stability and resistance to economic cycles and macroeconomic pressures relative to other industries in Africa, and Bhartis geographic diversification across Africa.        
	The acquisition provides Bharti with meaningful growth opportunities in Africa, which still has relatively low mobile phone penetration, and an opportunity to improve Zain Africas relatively lower EBITDA margins, Sukkawala observed.         
	He further noted that the combined entity could profit from economies of scale as Bhartis subscriber base would increase more than 30 per cent to over 170 million and its revenues would jump nearly 50 per cent to about $12 billion.

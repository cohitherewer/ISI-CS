	Hazira, Dec. 1: Essar Steel, which is expanding its capacity to 10 million tonnes, has laid out the road map for the next phase of growth. The company is looking to modernise its cold-rolling capacity and manufacture specialised steel for the automobile sector.        
	The Ruia group company plans to invest Rs 17,500 crore in the expansion scheme, which will raise the capacity of the integrated steel plant from 4.6 million tonnes at present.        
	This will raise the total investment in the Hazira complex to Rs 30,000 crore. The modernisation plan will be completed by March next year.         
	The company has already commissioned units that include a blast furnace with a capacity of 1.73 million tonnes, mega direct reduced iron (DRI) module with a capacity of 1.7 million tonnes and the first phase of the 5-million-tonne steel melt shop.         
	Essar Steel is funding its expansion and its greenfield projects through a debt equity ratio of 1.75:1 and the debt component largely comes from domestic banks.        
	Announcing details of the expansion plans to newspersons at its Hazira facility on Tuesday, Malay Mukherjee, CEO of Essar Steel, said the expansion would enable the company to concentrate on making specialised steel for the automobile sector. Mukherjee did not rule out the possibility of Essar Steel joining hands with a Japanese company in a technical tie-up to make specialised steel.        
	He said there was a huge potential for these products in the country as the size of the domestic automobile industry in terms of sales is likely to expand five times by 2020.        
	A senior official of the company here told The Telegraph that Essar Steel is looking to enter into the niche and super niche categories in the automobile space such as outer panels and other products that go into an automobile. There is strong demand for such products as close to 50 per cent used by the industry is imported.         
	The Essar Steel CEO said the company was looking to modernise its existing galvanising line in Hazira.

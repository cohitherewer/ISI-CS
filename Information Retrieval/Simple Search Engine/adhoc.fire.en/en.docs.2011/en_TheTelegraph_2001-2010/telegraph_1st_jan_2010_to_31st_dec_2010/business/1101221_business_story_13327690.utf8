	Calcutta, Dec. 20: Coca-Cola plans to unveil its medium-term investment plan for India next year.        
	The company, which owns popular brands such as Thums Up and Maaza, is likely to make an investment of $250 million (Rs 1,125 crore) or more over three to four years.        
	Atul Singh, president and CEO of Coca-Cola India, said the parent was working on the funding plan. It will be in 2011. But I cant give a specific number.         
	The parent firm has spent about $250 million since 2007. Given the companys strong growth, the investment is likely to be much higher.        
	India is a strategic country for Coca-Cola. It has given 37 quarters of continuous strong growth. We are driving innovation in many areas  new products, packaging, sourcing. Per capita consumption in India is lower than even Pakistan. So, there will be huge growth, Singh said.        
	The company launched seven products in 2010 both in the carbonated drink and juice categories. It launched Minute Maid in the 100 per cent fruit juice category during the Commonwealth Games. It is likely to be introduced in other markets in 2011.        
	The company, which has 56 bottling plants here (both direct and franchisee owned), is bigger than rival Pepsi in India. It earns 70 per cent of its revenues from sparkling beverages (non-alcoholic) and the rest from juice and water.        
	It plans to tie up with Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd to source orange pulp in India. We already source mango pulp from Jain Irrigation. A trial of Brazilian oranges is been done with them in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, with 6,000 samplings, Singh said.

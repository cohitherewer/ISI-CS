	New Delhi, March 24: Prices of petrol and diesel in 13 cities, including Calcutta, can go up marginally from April 1 after the Bharat Stage IV grade fuel is introduced.        
	The oil ministry is seeking the cabinets approval for the hike so that the cost of supplying the cleaner fuel does not add to the oil companies current losses of Rs 6 per litre on petrol and Rs 4.06 per litre on diesel.        
	Petrol prices may be up 41 paise a litre, while diesel will cost 26 paise more for a litre.         
	This (price hike) is not on the basis of (Rs 40,000 crore) capital expenditure (oil firms incurred in upgrading their facilities to produce cleaner fuel) but a requirement to bring domestic rates to international parity, petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said at an industry event.        
	The actual price hike needed to cover the cost would have been 3-4 times the proposed increase.        
	Oil marketing companies had increased petrol and diesel prices by Rs 2.71 and Rs 2.55 a litre, respectively, from February 27, following the increase in excise duty and restoration of the 5 per cent import levy on crude oil.        
	Under Bharat Stage IV regulations, oil firms will sell petrol and diesel with very low sulphur content in 13 major cities such as Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad from April 1, while Bharat Stage III grade fuel will be used in the rest of the country.        
	The introduction of the new fuel is aimed at reducing harmful emission of pollutants such as sulphur and benzene.

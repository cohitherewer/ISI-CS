	Mumbai, Aug. 25: Shares of Prakash Steelage Ltd  the stainless tubes and pipes maker which came out with its maiden flotation recently leapt almost 71 per cent on listing, yielding huge gains for stags.        
	Stags are speculators who apply for shares in a new issue, anticipating a sharp jump when the stock lists. If the hunch works, they make big bucks.        
	Investors had picked up the Prakash Steelage stock at an issue price of Rs 110.        
	On Wednesday, the stock opened at Rs 118.55 on the BSE and quickly surged to an intra-day high of Rs 201.90, prompting a massive selloff at an 83 per cent gain. The scrip closed at Rs 187.95, quoting at a premium of 70.8 per cent over the issue price. On the NSE, the share closed at Rs 184.90, a rise of over 68 per cent to the issue price.        
	The IPO of Prakash Steelage had opened for subscription on August 5, and it was offered in a price band of Rs 100 to Rs 110 per share.         
	Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, said the sharp appreciation in the scrip was witnessed during the last hour of trade. The closing price was on account of short-covering and speculative play and it does not reflect the companys fundamentals, he added.

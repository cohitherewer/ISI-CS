          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: Air India has cancelled a Rs 7.5-crore brand makeover deal with an Australian firm.         
	The national carrier may now look at Indian professionals for the makeover at a much lower cost, sources said.        
	The project with Australian firm Cato Purnell Partners has been cancelled. The decision was taken on Tuesday, an Air India spokesperson said. Sources said the Air India board had already approved the consultants fees, and the firm had not only started work but also submitted an initial report.         
	Though many senior officials of Air India question the high fee, they agree with Catos proposal to bring back the Centaur logo, which was replaced by the Flying Swan a few years ago.         
	The decision to cancel the deal came after civil aviation minister Praful Patel was asked about it in the Rajya Sabha yesterday.         
	Since National Aviation Company of India Ltd (Nacil) has been designated as the official carrier for the Commonwealth Games, Cato Purnell Partners had been appointed by Nacil to revitalise its brand identity, he said. The fees payable to Cato Purnell Partners will be around $1,612,750 plus taxes, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Profit vs cover
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Profit vs cover
        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay looks into the reasons that prompt insurers to push Ulips over conventional plans                                            
	When the Life Insurance Corporation of India launched its unit-linked endowment plan Profit Plus in 2007, 25-year-old Samik Roy knew it to be the right place to park his money.        
	After all, a life insurance plan saves tax and gives tax-free returns in addition to providing financial protection to the family in the case of death of the policyholder during the policy term. If it is a unit-linked insurance plan, the tax-free return just gets bigger, the LIC agent told Roy.        
	Roy bought the plan. With an annual income of Rs 5 lakh, he could not spend more than Rs 50,000 a year for premium. For an annual premium of Rs 50,000, Roy got a life cover of Rs 5 lakh for 20 years. Given the premium amount and his age, Rs 5 lakh was the maximum insurance that he could get under the plan.         
	Was Roy right in buying the unit-linked plan?         
	Certainly not. If something unfortunate happened to him soon, what his family would have got from the insurer was Roys one years salary income only. Would that have been a sufficient financial protection for his family?        
	Had Roy bought LICs Endowment Assurance Policy, his annual premium outgo would have been Rs 23,638 for the same Rs 5 lakh cover for 20 years. This single instance explains why the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) contended that Ulips are more of a collective investment scheme rather an insurance product.        
	In insurers interest        
	Interestingly, the cost of insurance (or the mortality charge) in an Ulip is less than half a per cent of the premium paid. This means 85 per cent of the charges deducted from your Ulip premium is used to pay commissions to agents, marketing expenses and generating surpluses for shareholders of the insurance company.        
	While shareholders of an insurance company can get only 10 per cent of the surplus generated under a traditional with-profit plan (policies that gives bonuses to policyholders), the entire surplus generated in Ulips become the shareholders profit.         
	Besides, promoters of a life insurance company require to set aside less capital for selling Ulips compared with conventional plans. Ulips are thus more capital efficient than traditional plans for an insurer.        
	When insurers started selling Ulips, it is not because policyholders had suddenly become more interested in market-linked investments and were demanding unit-linked products. Insurers devised the product in their own interest and started selling the product aggressively.         
	Commission matters        
	Supply creates its own demand. The countrys first unit-linked insurance plan offered by UTI didnt become much popular. Insurers say the product was developed on the basis of consumer demand. But the truth is that Ulips are more profitable for an insurance company than a traditional, non-market linked product.         
	When insurers would like agents to sell a product of their own liking, they would be ready to give them higher commissions than a traditional plan. Agents would sell plans that would fetch them a higher commission without giving any consideration to whether the policy suits an individual or not.        
	Withdrawal facility        
	Another feature that made Ulips more popular than traditional plans was the facility of partial withdrawals after the initial three years. Since withdrawals from life insurance plans are tax-exempt in the hands of the policyholder, it attracted investors who put their money in single-premium policies for five years, took the tax benefit on premium payment and after three years started withdrawing their investments without paying any tax thereon.         
	The life cover for the five years was an added advantage. Primarily, high income tax payers were the buyers of such policies.        
	What prompted the sale of single-premium Ulips was that the insurance cover in these plans used to be very low. It was 1.25 times the single premium till 2008. In March 2008, the insurance regulator further lowered the minimum insurance cover to 1.10 times for policies for more than 10 years.         
	Insurers, on the other hand, kept their charges, including agency commission, low for single-premium Ulips than in regular premium Ulips. Thus, the total cost in a single-premium Ulip is lower than in a regular premium policy. A lower cost translates into a higher return and that was the attraction for single-premium Ulips.        
	Things are going to change now. The insurance regulator has increased the lock-in period for Ulips to five years from three years with effect from July this year.         
	This means that if you buy a Ulip on or after July 1, 2010, you wont be able to withdraw your investment, even partially, before five years.         
	Ask the agent        
	Though people who have bought Ulips before July 1 wont be affected by this clause, the sale of single-premium Ulips will be largely affected. However, the new guidelines by the insurance regulator will be held up till the dispute with Sebi over the control of Ulips is amicably settled.         
	Till that time, as a prospective policyholder you can ask the agent to reveal the commission he/she gets from the insurer to sell a Ulip to you.         
	The insurance regulator has directed insurers to disclose their agency commission in the policy document. So far, policyholders were little bothered about how much commission the agent gets on selling a policy. This was because, the commission was embedded in the premium paid.         
	Now that a policy buyer will know whether the agent will get 40 per cent or 5 per cent commission from the premium he/she paid, policy buyers will become more inquisitive about the policy itself, the cost-benefit matrix in other policies and so on.

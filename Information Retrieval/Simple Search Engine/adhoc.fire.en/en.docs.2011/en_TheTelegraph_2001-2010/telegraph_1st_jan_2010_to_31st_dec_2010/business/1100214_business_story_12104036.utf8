The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI looks beyond inflation for growth
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RBI looks beyond inflation for growth
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RBI governor D. Subbarao in Mumbai on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 13: RBI governor D. Subbarao today said the central bank could not focus on inflation alone because of growth concerns and the apex bank was not backing away from moves towards full capital account convertibility and would rework its plans depending on global economic developments.        
	Subbarao was speaking on the sidelines of a panel discussion organised by the RBI.         
	At a time when rising food prices were creating worries that it might lead to a generalised inflation, Subbarao said that one lesson from the financial crisis was that pure inflation targeting would not work. Price stability, though necessary, was no guarantee against financial stability, he said.         
	The RBI governor said India did not explicitly focus on inflation, though price stability was clearly one of the overriding objectives because of the importance of growth.         
	Later in a separate session, he said the RBI was not going back on full capital account convertibility.         
	Are we backing down from the capital account convertibility road map? I believe we are not. We are still traversing but we will re-work it depending on global developments, he said.         
	The RBI governor said the central bank would use present tools to control capital till full capital account convertibility (CAC) was attained.         
	CAC refers to the freedom to convert local financial assets into foreign financial assets and vice versa at a market-determined rate of exchange.         
	At present, India has current account convertibility wherein foreign exchange is available for import or export of goods and services.         
	The country also has partial capital account convertibility with some monetary restrictions on acquiring assets overseas.        
	Though the central bank has relaxed exchange control rules on various occasions, it has moved cautiously with regard to fuller convertibility and recommendations made by the Tarapore Committee, in 2006.         
	The committee had then mooted a three-phased approach to make the rupee fully convertible. The RBI had on subsequent occasions, indicated that it was pushing back the deadline as it was in favour of a more gradual approach.         
	Subbarao also said the international monetary system was inadequate to prevent a major structural problem or global imbalances, which had to manifest in the form of some crisis or the other at some stage.

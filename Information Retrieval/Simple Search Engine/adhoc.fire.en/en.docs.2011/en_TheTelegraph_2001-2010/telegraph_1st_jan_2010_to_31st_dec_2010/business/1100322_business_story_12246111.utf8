The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | North Block   terms for export sops
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      North Block   terms for export sops
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Awaiting relief                                         
	New Delhi, March 21: Funds for additional export sops must come from what the finance ministry has given to the commerce ministry in the budget, meaning the latter may have to prune its expenditure elsewhere at a time exporters are just clawing themselves out of global recession.         
	Export growth has turned positive from November after 13 months of negative growth.        
	We have taken up the issue (export sops) with the finance ministry on the need to continue with interest subvention to chemicals, textiles, engineering and leather. The finance ministry is favourable to the extension of incentives to these sectors, if it is given from the budget allocation of the ministry, a senior commerce ministry official said.        
	The ministry plans to announce some sops for sectors such as garments, engineering and leather this week because they are not doing well overseas.        
	Concessional credit under the focus product and focus market schemes could be provided besides other sops, the official said. The ministry has been given an outlay of Rs 3,980 crore for 2010-11 in the budget against Rs 3,813 crore in the current fiscal.        
	The government has provided exporters with an interest subsidy (subvention) of 2 per cent, which was extended for one more year beyond March to handicrafts, carpets, handlooms and small and medium enterprises.        
	The pre-budget economic survey had suggested more stimulus for exports as the recovery in global markets was fragile.        
	The commerce ministry has identified chemicals, textiles, engineering and leather as those that have failed to pick up.         
	Exports of engineering goods during April-January have declined to $26.12 billion from $34.19 billion in the same period in the previous fiscal. Garment exports were down around 13 per cent in January over the year-ago period.        
	The interest subvention should be extended to textiles  including garments  leather, gems and jewellery, and marine as these segments still expect negative growth in 2009-2010. A few of them may have shown a positive growth but that too on a very low base, A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said        
	The economic advisory council to the Prime Minister has forecast a 12 per cent growth in exports at $88 billion in the second half of the current fiscal.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sebi bar on Pyramid Saimira promoter
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 23: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today barred P.S. Saminathan, the promoter of Pyramid Saimira Theatre Ltd (PSTL), from buying or selling shares for 10 years. He has also been barred from being a director in any listed company for 10 years and has been asked to make a public offer to buy shares of PSTL within three months.         
	Sebi has alleged that PSTL had inflated its profits and revenues through fictitious entries and disclosed them in its financial accounts for 2007-08.        
	The market regulator has issued a showcause notice to the company, Saminathan and his wife Uma.         
	PSTL is accused of allotting convertible warrants to Saminathan on a preferential basis and allotting equity shares to his wife upon conversion of such warrants without consideration towards the issue of warrants and allotment of shares.        
	Sebi alleged that the company did not co-operate with the investigation as it failed to produce various records required under the probe and did not maintain certain books of accounts.        
	In its order passed today, Sebi whole-time member M. Sahoo directed the stock exchanges to facilitate the valuation of shares for the public offer and compulsorily delist PSTL if the public shareholding fell below the minimum level.        
	Sebi also restrained Uma Saminathan from buying, selling or dealing in securities for five years and being a director of any listed company for a similar period.        
	Providing an instance of how the company misled the public, the market regulator said PSTL had disclosed to the exchanges in January last year that it had entered into agreements with 802 theatres as on June 30, 2008. However, of the 802 agreements, the company could show only 257 original agreements to the Sebi officials.        
	Meanwhile, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur (SBBJ), the largest associate bank of the SBI, has approached Sebi for approval of the banks Rs 800-crore rights issue.        
	Earlier this month, the banks board of directors had approved the draft letter of offer for raising equity capital up to Rs 800 crore through a rights issue.         
	The SBI now holds a 75 per cent stake in SBBJ.

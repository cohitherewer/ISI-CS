The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ABB bid signals takeover war over Chloride
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ABB bid signals takeover war over Chloride
                                          
	Zurich/London, June 8 (Reuters): Switzerlands ABB on Tuesday announced an all-cash deal to buy Britains Chloride Group for 860 million ($1.25 billion), possibly setting off a bidding war with spurned US suitor Emerson Electric Co.        
	The Swiss group, which sells power equipment to oil and gas companies, said it would offer 325 pence per share to Chloride, whose products protect against power shortages at Heathrows Terminal 5 and Arsenals Emirates soccer stadium. In India, Chloride holds 90 per cent stake in Pune-based UPS company DB Power Electronics.        
	Chloride in April rejected an offer for 723 million from Emerson, with big shareholders saying its European footprint and the industrys high barriers to entry meant it was worth significantly more.        
	Shares in Chloride surged 18 per cent to an all-time high of 340 pence, indicating that the market expected a counterbid. Emerson said it would make a statement on the ABB-Chloride deal later.        
	The bid from ABB is a surprise as it has no direct interest in these markets but does have extensive skills, products and market share in electrical power and automation, Ian Robertson, analyst at Seymour Pierce, said.        
	Robertson said Emerson could counter-offer as much as 373 pence apiece, based on its return targets for strategic deals and an estimated 20 million of cost savings.        
	However, Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Richard Frei said the deal might go through because Chlorides board had agreed to it, though rivals such as Schneider or Emerson could also bid.        
	Strategically, its certainly sensible (for ABB), Frei said. On the one hand it fits well into the product portfolio, on the other it fits well with the client base they have and opens new possibilities for gaining new clients.        
	(But) the price is very expensive  which probably has to do with the rejected bid by Emerson, he said.        
	The acquisition must be approved by Chlorides shareholders, the UK high court and regulators.        
	Robertson said the deal valued Chloride at about 25 times its estimated earnings for the year to March 2011, roughly double ABBs own price-earnings (PE) ratio for the year to December 2011. However, previous deals in the sector have been struck at as much as 30 times prospective earnings.        
	ABB had $7.1 billion in net cash at the end of the first quarter and had been expected to go on a buying spree.        
	ABB chief executive Joe Hogan said the deal was a growth acquisition and followed a year of discussions between ABB and Chloride.        
	Obviously, Emersons putting them in play here recently probably forced us to move faster than we would. But we had an interest in this marketplace and in Chloride specifically for a period of time, Hogan said.

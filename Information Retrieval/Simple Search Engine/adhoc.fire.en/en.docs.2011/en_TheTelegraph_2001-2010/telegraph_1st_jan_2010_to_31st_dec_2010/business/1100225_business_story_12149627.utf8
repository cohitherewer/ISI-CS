          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Indian Railways aims to generate a surplus of Rs 3,173.09 crore in 2010-11 on the back of strong economic growth and booming industrial production as the country comes out of slowdown.        
	The railways hopes that an increased freight and passenger traffic and a focus on non-core areas will help it to garner more revenues and generate the surplus.        
	The plan size has been kept at Rs 41,426 crore, which is the highest ever plan investment. It would be funded by gross budgetary support of Rs 15,875 crore, diesel cess of Rs 877 crore, internal resources of Rs 14,523 crore and extra budgetary resources of Rs 10,151 crore, including market borrowing through the IRFC (Indian Railway Finance Corporation Limited) of Rs 9,120 crore, Railway Board chairman S.S. Khurana told reporters.        
	He said the railways targets a freight loading of 944 million tonnes (mt) in 2010-11, which is up 54mt over the revised estimates of 2009-10. The passenger traffic is expected to grow 5.3 per cent for the same year.        
	Gross traffic receipts have been projected at Rs 94,765 crore with estimates of freight earnings and passenger earnings at Rs 62,489 crore and Rs 26,127 crore, respectively. Sundry other earnings have been placed at Rs 3,171 crore.        
	The provision for ordinary working expenses for 2010-11 has been kept at Rs 65,000 crore, which is Rs 500 crore lower than the revised estimates for the previous year.         
	Total working expenses will be Rs 87,100 crore after accounting for appropriation to depreciation reserve fund (Rs 7,600 crore) and pension fund (Rs 14,500 crore). Finally the net revenue is estimated to be Rs 9,782 crore.        
	After meeting the estimated dividend liability of Rs 6,609 crore, the projected excess is Rs 3,173 crore with the targeted operating ratio of 92.3 per cent. The excess is proposed to be appropriated to the development fund (Rs 2,800 crore) and capital fund (Rs 373 crore).        
	The white paper of the railways released in December had rejected the previous rail minister Lalu Prasads claims of a turnaround during his tenure as minister, saying the accounts were tweaked to show inflated surpluses.        
	A concept of cash surplus before dividend payments was introduced to make the numbers look good. If these presentation changes had not been done, the accumulated surplus of Rs 89,000 crore during the five-year period (from 2004-05 to 2008-09) would come down to Rs 39,500 crore, the report said.        
	Mamatas rail budget, however, came in for sharp criticism from the former financial commissioner of the railways, S Murli, who said, Freight target is marginal at a time when the economy is expected to growth at 8 per cent this fiscal and industrial growth is booming.        
	He said, The introduction of trains in non-viable routes had resulted in the loss of Rs 19,120.55 crore in 2009-10 and the burden had to be borne by freight traffic, which is already facing stiff competition from road.        
	The budget has come against the backdrop of the share of Indian Railways in the movement of goods, vis-a-vis truckers, falling from 24.07 per cent in 2001-02 to 20.89 per cent in 2008-09 and further to 19.32 per cent in the first 10 months of this fiscal.        
	Indian Railways runs the worlds second largest network under a single management: 64,099 route km to ferry 18.9 million passengers on 7,000 trains daily from 6,906 stations. It also runs 4,000 freight trains to carry 850 million tonnes of cargo.

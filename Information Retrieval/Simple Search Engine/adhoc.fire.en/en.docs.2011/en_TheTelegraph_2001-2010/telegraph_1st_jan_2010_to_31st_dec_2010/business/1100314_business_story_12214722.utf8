          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, March 13: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) will roll out a global sports utility vehicle in 2011 from its Chakan plant near Pune. M amp;M is investing Rs 5,000 crore in the plant having an installed capacity of 300,000 vehicles.        
	The Chakan plant, which was inaugurated today, is expected to strengthen M amp;Ms presence in the domestic automobile space. M amp;M now produces around 300,000 units. Production will double once the Chakan facility takes off.         
	Of the Rs 5,000 crore being invested, about half is equity and the rest is debt.        
	Pawan Goenka, president (automotive sector) of M amp;M, said the company had so far invested Rs 2,500 crore in the Chakan facility. Goenka said M amp;M was also planning to raise the plants capacity by another 250,000 units in the second phase. However, a final decision is yet to be taken.        
	Ashok Chavan, chief minister of Maharashtra, and Anand Mahindra, vice-chairman and managing director of the Mahindra group, were present at the inauguration.        
	Mahindra said the plant was completed in a short time as the unit was ready for production after work started in January 2008. The Rs 5,000-crore investment in a single facility is the highest by an automobile company in Maharashtra. The facility, spread over 700 acres, will see M amp;M producing various models under one roof.

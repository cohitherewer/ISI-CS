The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ambanis Lyondell hope fades

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Mumbai, March 2: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries may have to finally bow out of the race for LyondellBasell (LB), the Dutch petrochemicals giant.        
	International media reports said the board of LyondellBasell had rejected RILs latest offer of $14.5 billion, and a creditor group lead by US private equity firm Apollo Management founded by billionaire Leon Black might get a chance to pull the company out of bankruptcy with its reorganisation plan.         
	Reports also indicated that Apollo would merge LB with its Hexion Speciality Chemicals operation.        
	RIL declined to comment and Lyondell Basell was silent on whether Apollo Management was poised to take over the reins of the petrochemicals company.         
	A hearing is scheduled for March 8 on the Apollo-backed reorganisation plan at a US bankruptcy court in Manhattan that could potentially transfer the ownership of LB.         
	Reports indicated that the creditors of LyondellBasell were expecting a higher price for the company from RIL. So far, RIL has reportedly increased its bid for LB twice after it submitted an initial non-binding offer of $12 billion in November last year.         
	Shortly after RIL submitted its initial offer, it raised the bid price by $1.5 billion to $13.5 billion. A fortnight ago, it revised the second offer by another $1 billion.        
	A deal with Lyondell would have enhanced Reliances presence in major markets such as the United States and Europe and catapult it into the ranks of top global chemicals makers such as Saudi Arabias Sabic, Germanys BASF and Dow Chemical Company.        
	The market, however, reacted well to initial reports of RIL losing out in the race for LB. The RIL scrip closed 0.57 per cent higher at Rs 983.60 on Tuesday.         
	Goldman Sachs reportedly said that even though LB offered strategic merit for RIL, the investment bank believed that RIL was better off if the bid did not go through. If RIL continued to pursue LB, there was a danger that the company might potentially over pay for assets, it said.        
	RIL will still continue to pursue international acquisitions even if the LB deal falls through, said sources. With a potential war chest of over Rs 25,000 crore, the company has shown interest in Canadian oil sands company Value Creation Inc. It has made a $2 billion offer to buy the Calgary, Alberta-based firm.        
	Other possible targets include assets owned by US-based Valero Energy and Sunoco, energy assets belonging to ConocoPhillips and refineries in Europe that are up for sale.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sugar tastes sweet again
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sugar tastes sweet again
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pawar: Optimistic                                  
	New Delhi, March 18: Sugar prices have started falling in retail markets, and the government expects cane production this year to be higher than projected earlier.        
	Mill owners now want the government to reimpose duty on the import of raw sugar as their profitability is taking a hit. Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, however, has ruled out the possibility.        
	The government had scrapped customs duty on the import of both white and raw sugar, which attracted a 60 per cent levy, to contain prices.        
	Sugar output is now expected to cross 17 million tonnes for the current season (October-September) against an initial estimate of 14-15 million tonnes, Pawar said.        
	Prices have already dropped from Rs 48 a kg to Rs 35 a kg in the retail market.         
	India, the worlds second-largest producer and biggest consumer of sugar, produced 14.7 million tonnes of the sweetener in 2008-09 against a demand for 23 million tonnes. The supply shortage and a lower production estimate for the current year led to the spike in prices.        
	Pawar has been criticised for not being able to rein in prices, which rose as high as Rs 50 per kg.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had also admitted the governments failure to keep the price of the sweetener under check. If there is a failure of economic policy, it is with regard to sugar. We have not been able to find a practical and pragmatic way to deal with the cyclical behaviour of sugarcane production, Singh had said.        
	The output forecast improved as yields were expected to be higher in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.        
	An estimated opening stock of 4.4 million tonnes and around 5 million tonnes of imports have raised the supply projections to around 26 million tonnes, signalling a glut and softening of prices.        
	Prices have also started falling in the international market on reports of higher production. Sugar prices are now at $530 a tonne from the $790-800 level a few months back.        
	Pawar today also ruled out exporting surplus wheat and instead favoured increased allocation to families above the poverty line (APL).        
	There is no question of allowing wheat export. My ministry has proposed to allocate more wheat to the APL families, he said.

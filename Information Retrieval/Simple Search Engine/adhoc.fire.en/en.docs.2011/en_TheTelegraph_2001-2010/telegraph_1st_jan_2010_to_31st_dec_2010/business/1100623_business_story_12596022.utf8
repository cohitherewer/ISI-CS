          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Listing priorities                                   
	New Delhi, June 22: The panel of ministers on fuel is likely to consider a marginal hike in diesel prices and free market pricing of petrol within a band at its meeting on Friday.        
	Friday is the meeting of the eGoM (empowered group of ministers), petroleum minister Murli Deora said but declined to elaborate on the agenda before the panel.        
	This will be the second meeting of the eight-member panel, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, this month to consider freeing petrol and diesel prices from government control.        
	The first meeting was held on June 7. Railway minister Mamata Banerjee and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar had skipped the meet, leading to the postponement of a decision.        
	Fertiliser minister M.K. Alagiri of the DMK, who attended the last meeting, has also opposed a hike in prices. Sources said the Congresss allies were opposed to an increase in prices at a time inflation was in double digits and food inflation around 17 per cent.        
	Since the last meeting, Deora has met the UPA allies to build a consensus and briefed Prime Minster Manmohan Singh and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee on the allies stands. The allies do not want to be seen as part of a decision that can hurt the aam aadmi as their parties face state elections in the next 18 months.        
	The government is keen to proceed with the fuel pricing reform to improve the financial condition of state owned oil firms and reduce its subsidy burden.        
	Sources said there was less opposition to the free market pricing of petrol as it was considered to be a fuel used by the well-off. However any hike in the price of diesel, which is used in the transport sector, will have a much broader inflationary impact.        
	If petrol prices are aligned with current international rates, consumers will have to pay Rs 3.73 a litre more.         
	However, oil companies may not get a free run in determining prices. The government will intervene if the crude oil price surges above $100 a barrel and have the right to revise prices on a monthly or fortnightly basis.        
	In the absence of a consensus on freeing diesel prices, the oil ministry may push for a minimum Rs 2 per litre increase in rates, sources said.        
	Current domestic retail prices are said to be based on crude prices of close to $60 per barrel, while the current global rates are around $75 a barrel.        
	Deora has asked states to lower the sales tax on petrol and diesel to soften the impact of any price hike on consumers. A rise in international oil prices exerts an upward pressure on domestic prices of petroleum products, he wrote to states.        
	Sources said a Rs 25 per cylinder hike in domestic LPG was also on the cards, but the move could face stiff resistance from the allies.        
	Asked about the opposition to price hike by key allies, petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said: These are political decisions. I have nothing to say on this.        
	The state-owned oil firms are currently selling petrol at a loss of Rs 3.73 a litre, diesel at a loss of Rs 3.80 per litre; losses on account of kerosene are Rs 18.82 per litre, while they are Rs 261.90 per LPG cylinder.        
	The three oil firms IOC, BPCL and HPCL are losing over Rs 200 crore per day on selling fuel below imported cost. If the oil prices were kept unchanged, these oil companies estimated loss could touch Rs 90,000 crore for 2010.

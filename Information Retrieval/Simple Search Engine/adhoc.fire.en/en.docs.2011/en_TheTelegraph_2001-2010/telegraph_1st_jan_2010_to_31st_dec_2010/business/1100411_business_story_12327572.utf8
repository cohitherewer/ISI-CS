                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      3G bidders go slow on Day 2
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 10: The auction of third-generation spectrum moved into day two with restrained action from bidders in most circles.         
	While the all-India licence bid price for 22 circles increased 16 per cent over the base price of Rs 3,500 crore to Rs 4,089.61 crore, it was only a 4.3 per cent rise over yesterdays maximum price of Rs 3,919 crore.        
	At the maximum price reached today, the government will get revenues of Rs 12,600 crore from selling three to four slots of 3G airwaves in each circle. Add to this the price that state-run BSNL and MTNL will pay  they have to match the highest bids in each circle  and the total revenue earned can be Rs 17,000 crore.        
	In 17 circles, including Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai, three slots for 3G services are being auctioned, while in the rest of the circles, four slots are up for sale. The auction is expected to fetch the government over Rs 40,000 crore.        
	Category C circles, including Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Assam, Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir, continued to show low demand as most operators had sufficient second generation spectrum in these circles.         
	The bid price in these circles did not increase over yesterday as no new player put in bids. Even for metro and Category A circles such as Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Maharashtra and Gujarat the price rise was only 5 per cent.        
	Operators have adopted a slow and steady approach. It is a matter of crores and such business decisions are bound to take time, said department of telecom officials.

	Calcutta, June 23: Insurers plan to jack up their car insurance premium rates by 10-15 per cent in the next few months.         
	The rates for those having a more frequent claim history will go up more  around 20-25 per cent  according to a senior official of ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company.         
	Average motor insurance premium may go up 10 to 15 per cent in the next few months with the premium rates for bad risks (where claims have been made) increasing by a higher percentage, said Amarnath Ananthanarayan, chief executive officer, Bharti Axa General Insurance Company.        
	After insurers were given the freedom to fix their premium rates from January 2007, general insurers resorted to huge discounts to grow their businesses, particularly in motor and fire insurance.         
	Post-detariffing, car insurance premium fell as much as 70 per cent in some cases. Car insurance comprises more than 50 per cent of the total business of most insurers.        
	However, in a couple of years they realised that such huge discounts could no longer be sustained. Huge discounts made many portfolios unprofitable, said Ananthanarayan, adding that insurers were becoming selective about underwriting policies.        
	Bharti Axa General Insurance Company started operations in August 2008.         
	Now that we have the one-year data on car insurance claims, we are going to increase the premium for bad risks while the rate for good risks (where no claims are made) may remain at the current level or may come down a little, said Ananthanarayan.        
	A month ago, S. Sreenivasan, chief financial officer of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said, Some insurers have already started increasing their premium rates as they have now understood that such hefty discounts were suicidal.         
	Insurers are, instead, planning to woo customers with product innovations. They are coming out with plans offering accident cover for the driver and passengers.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Heir job
                                My uncle has bank fixed deposits and investments in NSC. Nominations for the deposit have been made in the name of family members. Each year, he was reporting the income from the deposits on accrual basis. My uncle died on August 17, 2008. In whose account will the interest accrued be reported for the period after his death? Can we continue to file tax till the maturity of the deposits?           Rajat Roychowdhury, Asansol
                    The filing of income tax return can be continued in the name of your uncle. However, it should be signed by his legal heir, which can be the wife or the son of the deceased. You should get all his sons, daughters and wife to sign a declaration, then authorise the mother or the eldest son as the heir. The interest should be shown as it was being shown earlier. If the assets has been passed on legally along with the period concerned, it can be shown in the hands of the heir or the nominee who gets the fixed deposit. The interest income will then be taxable in the hands of the heir.                                  Fill forms separately      I switched companies last year and, thus, have two Form 16. Please advice how to go about it.        Vijay Kumar, Calcutta
                    It does not matter how many employers you have changed last year. You will have to file each form individually. Filing of income tax returns is mandatory if your total income for the previous year has exceeded the exemption limit.                                   Status update      I am a married woman working as freelancer. Which income tax return form do I have to fill up? In my PAN card, I have my fathers name. Now some of my investments are before marriage and some are after marriage with my husband? Can I show both the investments?         Smita Khasnobis, Howrah
                    You have Income from Business amp; Profession. So, you should fill ITR-4 only if your annual income exceeds Rs 1.9 lakh. Even married women have to give fathers name. You can have your married name on the PAN card. For this, read https://tin.tin.nsdl.com/pan/correction. You can show all the investments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Air India U-turn on key appointment
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Air India U-turn on key appointment
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The Air India board today overturned the appointment of Pawan Arora as the chief operating officer of Air India Express, the low-cost arm of the national carrier.        
	Sources said Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra and government nominee Bharat Bhushan had strongly opposed the appointment.         
	Many within Air India had objected to the choice of Arora as they felt others in the airline were more capable. Aurora had worked for Jet, Paramount and Indigo but never as the head or even as deputy head of an airline. He was being offered an annual salary of Rs 1.9 crore.         
	Mitra and Bhushan also asked the management to review the appointment of Stefan Sukumar, who was hired as chief training officer of AI.        
	They, however, approved the appointment of former journalist Kamaljit Rattan as chief information officer and Gustav Baldauf as chief operating officer of Air India.        
	The coup of sorts was orchestrated by a powerful independent director and the government nominee. Two other independent directors  Air Chief Marshal (retired) Fali H Major and Anand Mahindra stayed away from the meeting. Industrialist Harsh Neotia had to leave early as he had some other pressing appointments, said sources.         
	The independent directors have been critical of Air Indias attempts to bring in outsiders.        
	Sources said the directors could have taken note of Air Indias ability to churn out very capable managers, which is evident from many its former officers holding top posts at private airlines. It, therefore, made sense to harness the managerial resources within the airline and utilise outsiders only selectively.        
	Earlier last month, the four independent directors  Mitra, Neotia, Mahindra and Major  had met civil aviation minister Praful Patel and officials in the Prime Ministers Office, which is monitoring the state-run airlines revival.         
	Reports suggested they had objected to the selection of Arora.         
	Lower losses        
	Air India has managed to trim its losses by 23 per cent to Rs 5,551 crore for 2009-2010 from Rs 7,381 crore a year ago.         
	The airline reduced its operating losses by 40 per cent to Rs 3,472 crore, but this may not be enough to bag the next tranche of equity of Rs 1,200 crore as the finance ministry had made the infusion contingent upon certain structural changes.         
	However, the airline made progress on some parameters  its revenue per passenger increased 12 per cent and passenger load factor rose 9 per cent to 64.8 per cent.        
	Airline officials said the results were muted because depreciation went up to Rs 1,390 crore from Rs 1,221 crore last year and interest and financing costs increased 46 per cent to Rs 769 crore. In truth, operational costs were cut 8 per cent to Rs 19,035 crore even though jet fuel prices kept going up.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 4: Telecom newbies Etisalat DB and S Tel may soon get government approval to increase the foreign holding in their Indian operations.        
	UAE-based Etisalat, which has about a 45 per cent stake in Etisalat DB, formerly Swan Telecom, has approached the government to increase its stake in the domestic entity by 5.27 per cent.        
	Bahrain Telecom (Batelco) wants to hike its shareholding in Chennais C. Sivasankaran-promoted S Tel by 6.3 per cent from 42.7 per cent.        
	The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), the nodal agency that approves major foreign investments, will discuss the proposals in its meeting on Friday.         
	Telecom companies in India can have foreign holding of up to 74 per cent with governments approval.         
	The home ministry and the revenue department will also need to clear the proposals. Both these departments have sought details on the source of the investments.        
	After the approval, Etisalat DB will have a foreign direct investment of 54.27 per cent. While Etisalat holds 44.73 per cent in its India entity, Delphi Investments owns another 4.27 per cent, totalling 49 per cent.        
	S Tels foreign holding after the approval will be 54.61 per cent  Mauritius-based Telecom Investments holds 5.6 per cent in the company in addition to Batelcos 42.7 per cent.        
	Both Etisalat DB and S Tel are under the government scanner because of security concerns that can have a bearing on the decision of the FIPB, said analysts. Etisalats operations in Pakistan are also a worry for the home ministry.        
	In March, the telecom department directed S Tel to stop its mobile services in Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa, citing security issues.        
	Recently, reports suggested that the Enforcement Directorate has registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against Etisalat DB.         
	The FIPB, in its Friday meeting, will also discuss Essar Groups plans to indirectly transfer part of its Indian holding in Vodafone Essar to its overseas investment company. Ruias-owned Essar Group has proposed to transfer its 49 per cent stake in Essar Telecom Holding to Mauritius-based Essar Telecom India.

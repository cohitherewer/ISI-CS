          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Money matters                                  
	Mumbai, March 30: Tata Motors has sold another 20 per cent stake in its mining and construction equipment subsidiary  Telco Construction Equipment Company Limited (Telcon)  to Hitachi Construction Machinery Co Ltd (Hitachi) for Rs 1,159 crore.         
	Telcon is a 60:40 joint venture company between Tata Motors and Hitachi.         
	After this transaction, Telcon will become a subsidiary of Hitachi, which will have a 60 per cent stake.         
	Analysts believe that Tata Motors decision to sell a stake in its subsidiary is another move by the countrys largest automobile company to pare its debt that stood at Rs 23,100 crore on December 31, 2009.         
	The companys stock price increased 2.25 per cent to close at Rs 756.30 on Tuesday. The transaction pegs the value of Telcon at nearly Rs 5,800 crore.         
	According to a company release, Standard Chartered Bank and AZB Partners acted as financial and legal advisers, respectively, in the deal.         
	Telcon makes equipment and offers services to the mining, infrastructure, construction and agriculture sectors. The company that was set up in 1999 after the construction equipment business unit of Tata Motors was hived off, inducted Hitachi as a partner in subsequent years.         
	In 2000 and thereafter 2005, Tata Motors divested its stake both times so that Telcon would have easier access to global technologies.         
	Telcon has manufacturing facilities at Jamshedpur, Dharwad and Kharagpur. It also has an overseas presence through two subsidiaries  Serviplem S.A and Comoplesa Lebrero S.A, in Spain.         
	In 2008-09, Telcon reported a gross turnover of Rs 2,130 crore and an after-tax profit of Rs 85 crore.         
	Hitachi, which makes hydraulic excavators, sees a significant market in India. This deal will enable it to establish a hub in the sub-continent.         
	New chief        
	Tata Motors informed the stock exchanges on Tuesday that the board of directors of the company had appointed Carl-Peter Forster as its managing director. He will now hold the twin responsibilities of group chief executive officer and managing director.

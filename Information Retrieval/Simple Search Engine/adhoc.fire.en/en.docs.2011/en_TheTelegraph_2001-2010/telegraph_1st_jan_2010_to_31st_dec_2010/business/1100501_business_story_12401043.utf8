The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court notice on Ulips
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Court notice on Ulips
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 30: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Centre, insurance regulator IRDA and 14 insurers on a petition by market watchdog Sebi seeking the transfer of cases relating to Ulips from various high courts to the apex court.        
	A bench, headed by Chief Justice-designate S.H. Kapadia, issued the notices and posted the matter for further hearing in July.         
	During a brief hearing today, when the petition filed by Sebi was mentioned by Attorney General G.E. Vahanvati, the bench questioned Sebis move to file the petition before the apex court. After all, Sebi is in Bombay, insurance companies are in Bombay, the LIC is in Bombay, Kapadia said.        
	Vahanvati, however, insisted that only the apex court could sort out the issue because the high courts could give conflicting judgments.        
	This is just regulatory bodies fighting. What has happened to your plans to have a super-regulator, the bench asked Vahanvati, the governments highest-ranking law officer.         
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had asked 14 insurance companies to stop advertising and raising money from investors through Ulips till they got a registration certificate from the market regulator.        
	Sebi had claimed that Ulips were a combination of investment and insurance. It said the investment component was in the nature of mutual funds, which could be offered only after obtaining its registration. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) had contested the power of Sebi to do so, sparking off a stand-off between the two regulators.         
	Sebi had then moved the Supreme Court seeking a clubbing of all petitions pending in different high courts.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 8: Bengals annual plan outlay for 2010-11 has been fixed at Rs 17,985 crore, an increase of about 27 per cent over last year.         
	The outlay for 2009-10 was Rs 14,150 crore.        
	This years plan includes an allocation of Rs 300 crore to develop the districts affected by Maoist attacks.        
	The substantial increase in plan allocation was finalised at a meeting between Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee here today.         
	We have discussed the issue (of Maoist violence), Bhattacharjee told reporters when asked about the surge in Maoist attacks in the state. There is no major change in the policy to fight Maoists, the chief minister added.        
	Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta said the central assistance in the annual plan would be Rs 4,070 crore.        
	The three Maoist-affected districts  west Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia  will get Rs 100 crore each.         
	According to Dasgupta, the terror unleashed by the Maoists has not affected investor confidence in the state.        
	The state has witnessed Rs 8,000-crore investments in 2009-10, which is double the sum invested in the previous fiscal. This shows the confidence of investors, he said.        
	In the meeting with the plan panel, Bhattacharjee said the states priority areas were a 4 per cent agricultural growth, investment in infrastructure, small and medium enterprises and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, among others.        
	Ahluwalia said the state should promote food processing, textile and light engineering industries.

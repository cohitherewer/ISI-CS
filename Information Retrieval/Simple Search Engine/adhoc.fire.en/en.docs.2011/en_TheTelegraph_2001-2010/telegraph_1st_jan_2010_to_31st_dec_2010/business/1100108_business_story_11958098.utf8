The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | 3G spectrum auction awaits clear signal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      3G spectrum auction awaits clear signal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Connection error                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 7: The sale of third-generation (3G) spectrum continues to be jinxed with the government still undecided on the payment schedule and the number of slots to be auctioned.         
	The government had planned to invite bid applications from Sunday. However, with the empowered group of ministers headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee unable to meet today, there is once again uncertainty over when the auction will start.        
	On December 21, after a meeting of an inter-ministerial panel, telecom minister A. Raja had said the government would auction four slots of spectrum in each circle (excluding the one reserved for BSNL/MTNL).         
	The panel also decided that companies would be required to pay a quarter of the bid amount this fiscal and the remaining when the spectrum was allotted in August.         
	The nine-member empowered group of ministers was supposed to take a final call on the payment schedule in todays meeting after the finance and telecom ministries failed to reach a consensus on the issue.        
	While the finance ministry has been insisting on full payment, the department of telecom wants firms to make part payment and clear the balance amount at the time of the allotment of spectrum.         
	Sources told The Telegraph that the group of ministers would also have discussed the number of slots to be put on sale.         
	At present, the DoT has sufficient 3G airwaves to accommodate three players in most circles, while in some zones it has spectrum for two.        
	The defence authorities have said it will vacate up to 5MHz of spectrum, equivalent to one slot, in July and a similar amount in August  a commitment that the DoT fears defence may not keep.         
	The DoT can issue a notice inviting applications only after all issues on 3G are cleared. The notice will provide details of the auction, including the availability of spectrum in each circle and the payment format and time frame.         
	The DoT plans to ask companies to submit applications by January 25.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Praveen P. Kadle in Calcutta on Tuesday.  A Telegraph picture                          
	Calcutta, Aug. 17: Tata Capital will hive off its infrastructure and project financing business into a wholly owned subsidiary before the end of this fiscal to avail itself of the relaxation in norms governing borrowings by infrastructure finance firms.         
	Besides the easier lending norms, individual taxpayers have been allowed to claim an additional deduction of Rs 20,000 for investment in long-term core bonds. The new company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Capital, managing director and CEO Praveen P. Kadle said.         
	According to Kadle, the new company will be able to access funds cheaply both in the overseas and domestic markets.         
	Tata Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, which is the core investment holding company of the Tata group, has disbursed Rs 4,000 crore for infrastructure project and equipment financing. The companys total advances, including its retail and commercial lending businesses, stood at Rs 12,000 crore at the end of March 31.        
	We have done better in the first quarter of this fiscal and expect to grow our total advances by another Rs 4,000 crore, Kadle said.         
	Tata Capital is planning to widen its retail lending portfolio by including education loan and loans against gold from October. The company plans to register with the RBI as a primary authorised dealer to offer money exchange services at hotels, airports.        
	We are also getting into rural lending through farm equipment financing. Tata Chemicals and Rallis have a wide rural distribution network, which we may leverage, Kadle said.

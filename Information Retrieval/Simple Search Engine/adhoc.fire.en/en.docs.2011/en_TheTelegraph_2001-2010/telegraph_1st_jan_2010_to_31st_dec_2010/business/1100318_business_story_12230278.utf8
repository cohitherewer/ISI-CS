  Transaction valued at Rs 1318cr          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, March 17: Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd (TTML) today sold its tower subsidiary 21st Century Infratel to Quippo-WTTIL for Rs 1,318 crore.        
	As part of the deal, all the 2,535 towers of 21st Century Infratel in Mumbai, Maharashtra and Goa will be acquired by Quippo-WTTIL.        
	TTML noted that the towers had been valued at Rs 52 lakh per unit.        
	Quippo-WTTIL was formed after the merger of Quippo Telecom Infrastructure with Tata Teleservices tower arm Wireless-TT Info Services Ltd last year.        
	TTML, which offers CDMA and GSM services to over 12 million customers in Maharashtra and Goa, wants to use the cash flow of more than Rs 900 crore to fund its investment and growth plans.        
	The transaction will provide Quippo-WTTIL a nationwide footprint and strengthen its presence in new geographies.         
	Sunil Kanoria, director of Quippo-WTTIL, said, The acquisition complements our tower portfolio in important markets while providing us a contiguous network nationally.        
	With 3G and WiMAX auctions to be conducted shortly and the resulting requirements for additional towers in these geographies, especially Mumbai, the transaction is very beneficial for us, Kanoria said.         
	Under the deal, 21st Century Infratel will also roll out around 4,000 towers over a period of five years in Mumbai, Maharashtra and Goa, taking the total count to over 6,000 in the three cities.         
	Post this acquisition, we will have an overall portfolio of over 38,000 towers by the end of March 2010 and the highest tenancy ratio of over two in the industry, said Arun Kapur, CEO of Quippo-WTTIL.        
	Tenancy ratio is the number of operators sharing the towers to the total number of sites present.         
	A tower sharing firm needs to have a 1.7 to 2 tenancy ratio to break even.        
	Quippo-WTTIL is an independent entity managing the tower infrastructure business with over 38,000 towers. The company plans to roll out 25,000-30,000 towers over the next two years. The cost of setting up a tower is about $66,000, or Rs 33 lakh.         
	In Quippo-WTTIL, Quippo Telecom holds 49 per cent, while Tata Teleservices owns the rest. However, Quippo Telecom controls the management.         
	Indus Towers, a joint venture of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular, owns about 96,000 towers. Reliance Communications, which has hived off its infrastructure arm, Reliance Infratel, has around 40,000 towers.

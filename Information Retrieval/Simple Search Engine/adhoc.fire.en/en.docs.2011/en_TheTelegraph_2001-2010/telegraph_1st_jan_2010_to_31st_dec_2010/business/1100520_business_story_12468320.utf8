	New Delhi, May 19: Bouyed by the success of the 3G auction, the finance ministry will press hard for the adoption of the same route for 2G spectrum sales as well.         
	The ministry believes auction is the best way to give out scarce resources as the process is transparent and fetches the best price for the government.         
	Besides, it ensures that there are no accusations of nepotism or scams, which have dogged the sales of 2G spectrum and allocation of coal and iron ore mines.         
	The bumper proceeds from 3G coupled with the earnings from PSU divestments are expected to bring down the fiscal deficit by 0.8 per cent in this fiscal from the target of 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product.        
	Earnings from selloffs, as with 3G, are expected to be much higher than targets.         
	Estimated earnings from share sales are Rs 50,000 crore against a target of Rs 40,000 crore. In 3G, the government is expected to earn more than Rs 67,000 crore against a target of Rs 35,000 crore. Over and above 3G, the government is likely to earn Rs 15,000 crore from the auction of broadband wireless spectrum.         
	In all, the government can earn up to Rs 130,000-135,000 crore, or nearly Rs 60,000 crore over budget estimates, just from spectrum auctions and divestments.         
	Analysts said the government might auction more than 20MHz of 2G spectrum either this year or the next.

                                I am a student. I want to invest Rs 60,000 in equity mutual fund. My investment time horizon is 10 years. Which type of investment will be better: an SIP of Rs 1,000 per month for five years or a lump sum investment of Rs 60,000?          M. Sen, Calcutta
                    Equity investment is always beneficial in the long run. Since your time horizon is 10 years, you can make significant gains by investing in an SIP in a midcap/small cap equity fund. Lump sum investments are always fraught with risks. In the case of SIPs, this volatility gets ironed out through cost averaging.                                   Land at a cost      I am a 65-year-old taxpayer. I inherited a plot of land and sold it for Rs 10 lakh in September this year.My father had purchased the land in 1950 for Rs 4,000 only. What will be my income tax liability? Do I have to pay any capital gains tax?        S.N. Bhattacharyya, Dum Dum
                    Yes, you have to pay the capital gains tax. The price at which your father had purchased the plot will be considered as the acquisition cost. You can add any cost incurred on improvement of the property to the cost of acquisition. The difference between the sale price and the acquisition cost is the capital gains. The capital gains tax will be 10 per cent without indexation and 20 per cent with indexation. However, since the period of holding is long enough, indexation will be more beneficial for you as it will lower the tax liability.                                  Form 15H not applicable      I have interest income from bank fixed deposits, Senior Citizen Saving Scheme and post office monthly income. My date of birth is February 10, 1945. My annual tax liability is approximately is Rs 3,000. Can I submit Form 15H to the bank and post office for non-deduction of tax at sources?        Krishnapada Das, Chinsurah
                    Form 15H is to be submitted for non deduction of TDS by those who do not have a taxable income. Since you already have a taxable income you are not entitled to non-deduction of tax on interest income by submitting Form 15H. However, you can claim a refund of TDS through filing of income tax return.

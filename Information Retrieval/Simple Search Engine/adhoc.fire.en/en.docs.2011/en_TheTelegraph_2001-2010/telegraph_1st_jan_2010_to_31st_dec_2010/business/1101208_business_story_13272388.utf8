The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Auction preferred for roads
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Auction preferred for roads
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: The finance ministry today suggested a transparent auction system for awarding road projects to private developers.         
	Appaled by the slow progress in road construction and having learnt lessons from spectrum sales of 2G and 3G, the ministry suggested the auction route in the mid-year review of the economy tabled in Parliament today.        
	There is a need to put into effect a transparent well-designed system of auction whereby private developers are made to properly compete with no involvement of the government, the report said.        
	The bidders have a greater manoeuvrability in a multi-round auction process as followed in the 3G spectrum sale, unlike the current policy of submitting one-time bids in tenders.        
	The ministry said during the first half of the current financial year only 691 km of roads have been completed against a target of 2,500 km for the year. Contracts and concessions for only 3,051 km have been awarded against the annual target of 8,724 km.        
	Expressing concern over the poor performance of contractors, the review presented in Parliament said some of the problems could be overcome if the private developers are made to properly compete with one another with no involvement of the government, this would lead to the contractors offering projects on most cost effective terms.        
	Everything here depends on the design of the auction system. If this is well-designed, the implementing agencies should be able to find developers who will take the projects with internal rates of returns as low as 12, 13 or 14 per cent, it said.        
	After facing flak on the 2G spectrum allocation in 2008, the government this year resorted to a transparent and hands-off auction system for the 3G radio waves allocations, bringing Rs 1.06 lakh crore to the exchequer against the projections of Rs 35,000 crore.        
	The report identified delays in land acquisition and forest clearances as major stumbling blocks in road construction.        
	The proposal to extend the auction method to other infrastructure sectors, including roads, was mooted by chief economic adviser Kaushik Basu.         
	He suggested that instead of awarding a contract on a toll or an annuity basis in a Build Own Transfer (BOT) system, an amalgam annuitised BOT (toll) method should be used.        
	If there are no bidders in this system it could be offered under an EPC (engineering procurement and construction) basis for execution by private developers.

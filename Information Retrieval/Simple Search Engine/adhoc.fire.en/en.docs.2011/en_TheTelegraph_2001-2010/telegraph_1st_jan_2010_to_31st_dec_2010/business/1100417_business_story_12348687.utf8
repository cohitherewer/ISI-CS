The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Goldman faces securities fraud charge
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Goldman faces securities fraud charge
          LOUISE STORY AMP; GRETCHEN MORGENSON                      Goldman Sachs headquarters in lower Manhattan, New York                          
	New York, April 16: Goldman Sachs, which emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crisis, was accused of securities fraud in a civil suit filed on Friday by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which claimed the bank created and sold a mortgage investment that was secretly devised to fail.         
	The move marks the first time that regulators have taken action against a Wall Street deal that helped investors capitalise on the collapse of the housing market. Goldman itself profited by betting against the very mortgage investments that it sold to its customers.         
	The suit also named Fabrice Tourre, a vice-president at Goldman who helped create and sell the investment.         
	Goldman called the SEC accusations completely unfounded in law and fact and said the firm would vigorously contest them and defend the firm and its reputation.        
	The instrument in the SEC case, called Abacus 2007-AC1, was one of 25 deals that Goldman created so the bank and select clients could bet against the housing market. Those deals protected Goldman from losses when the mortgage market disintegrated and later yielded profits for the bank.         
	As the Abacus deals plunged in value, Goldman and certain hedge funds made money on their negative bets, while the Goldman clients who bought the $10.9 billion in investments lost billions of dollars.         
	According to the complaint, Goldman created Abacus 2007-AC1 in February 2007, at the request of John A. Paulson, a prominent hedge fund manager who earned an estimated $3.7 billion in 2007 by correctly wagering that the housing bubble would burst.         
	Goldman let Paulson select mortgage bonds that he wanted to bet against  the ones he believed were most likely to lose value  and packaged those bonds into Abacus 2007-AC1, according to the SEC complaint. Goldman then sold the Abacus deal to investors like foreign banks, pension funds, insurance companies and other hedge funds.         
	But the deck was stacked against the Abacus investors, the complaint contends, because the investment was filled with bonds chosen by Paulson as likely to default. Goldman told investors in Abacus marketing materials reviewed by The Times that the bonds would be chosen by an independent manager.         
	Paulson is not being named in the lawsuit.         
	In recent months, Goldman has repeatedly defended its actions in the mortgage market, including its own bets against it. In a letter published last week in Goldmans annual report, the bank rebutted criticism that it had created, and sold to its clients, mortgage-linked securities that it had little confidence in.         
	We did not know the future of the residential housing market in the first half of 2007 anymore than we can predict the future of markets today, Goldman wrote. We did not know whether the value of the instruments we sold would increase or decrease.         
	The letter continued: Although Goldman Sachs held various positions in residential mortgage-related products in 2007, our short positions were not a bet against our clients. Instead, the trades were used to hedge other trading positions, the bank said.

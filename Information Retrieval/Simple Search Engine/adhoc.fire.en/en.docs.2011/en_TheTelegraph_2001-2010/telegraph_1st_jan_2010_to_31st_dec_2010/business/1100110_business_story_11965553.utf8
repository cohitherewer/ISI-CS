                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      NTPC gets ready for public offer

	New Delhi, Jan. 9: NTPC Ltd, the countrys largest power producer, is likely to file a draft prospectus with market regulator Sebi on Monday for its follow-on public offer, which is expected to open early next month.        
	Two other state-owned power firms  the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd  are also expected to follow NTPC within this fiscal, finance ministry sources said.        
	Public offer from mineral giant NMDC Ltd is also on the cards before the end of this fiscal.        
	According to officials close to the development, the UPA government intends to speed up the divestment programme in view of widening fiscal deficit which leaves very little resources to fund the governments social welfare schemes.        
	The draft red herring prospectus from NTPC is likely to be filed on Monday and expected to be cleared through the fast-track route for speedy clearance so it could hit markets by the first week of February, an official said.        
	These four firms may raise around Rs 30,000 crore from the market.        
	The selloff proceeds will help the government to bring down its fiscal deficit, which is estimated at Rs 4,00,996 crore, by 0.5 per cent.         
	The selloff money will be spent on social sector programmes.        
	Divestment in Steel Authority of India Ltd will take place in two phases in the next fiscal.         
	Coal India and BNSL will also hit the market in 2010-11. It is, however, not clear how much the government hopes to raise by selling stakes in these three PSUs.

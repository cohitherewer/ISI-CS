          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 3: The follow-on public offer of state-run NTPC Ltd was subscribed 77 per cent on the opening day, with active support from domestic financial institutions, led by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).        
	The issue got bids for over 31.9 crore shares against 41.22 crore equities on offer.        
	According to investment bankers, the portion reserved for qualified institutional buyers was oversubscribed, with the LIC bidding for a little more than 2 crore shares at Rs 209 apiece.        
	The power firms offer is being modelled on the French auction route. Institutional investors will have to submit their bids at a rate above the floor price. The higher the bid, the higher will be the allocation of shares.        
	Non-institutional buyers and retail investors will subscribe at the floor price of Rs 201 apiece.         
	Analysts, however, have divergent views on the follow-on NTPC offer. A few feel that investors should subscribe to the offer as infrastructure will be a key sector when the growth rate picks up.         
	However, others feel the offer price of Rs 201 per share is high, and investors may get the shares from the secondary market at a lower price.        
	I believe investors should subscribe to the issue. Its a great opportunity to enter into a growth stock, says Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS.        
	The government is divesting a 5 per cent stake in NTPC, which is 41.22 crore shares. Of the issue, 6.12 crore shares are reserved for non-institutional investors and 14.28 crore for retail investors.        
	The issue will close on February 5.         
	This is the first divestment in this calendar year. After the offer, the governments holding in the power utility will fall to 84.5 per cent.

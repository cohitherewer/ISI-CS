                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      NTPCs Bangla project takes shape

	New Delhi, April 25: The modalities for NTPCs participation in the 1,300 mega watt (mw) coal-based power plant in Bangladesh will be worked out soon, a top official of the Indian power PSU said.        
	NTPC will set up the facility in a joint venture with Bangladesh Power Development Board.         
	Our team had recently visited Bangladesh and identified Chalna, a port town in the southwestern part of the country. Technical teams from NTPC and Bangaldesh Power Development Board are studying the feasibility and other issues, R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director of NTPC, told The Telegraph.        
	Details regarding the equity pattern are being worked out and it is likely that NTPC will get the management control besides a 49 per cent stake in the project.        
	On the time frame for finalising the details, Sharma said, Various studies are being carried out. Something concrete could emerge in the next couple of months and the joint venture agreement will be signed. Sources said the facility would be set up at an estimated cost of Rs 5,000 crore.        
	According to the sources, NTPC has suggested to the Bangladesh Power Development Board to engage local consultants for the feasibility study on the socio-environmental and ecological impacts of the plant.        
	It has also suggested that a consultant should work out the coal transportation plan. The proposed facility will operate on imported coal.        
	In January, a delegation from Bangladesh had invited NTPC, Power Grid Corporation and Bhel to set up power plants.        
	According to the initial plan, the power from the plant will be transmitted to India through a network to be developed by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.        
	Bangladesh and India have signed a memorandum of understanding on the exchange of power when Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had come to India in January.         
	The South Asian country is trying to attract foreign investments in a string of major energy infrastructure projects aimed at narrowing its energy deficit. Only around 47 per cent of Bangladeshs population have access to electricity. It is offering 15-year tax breaks, sovereign guarantees on payments and other incentives to attract up to $10 billion over the next seven years.        
	At present, Bangladesh has power generation capacity of 5,000mw, of which 83 per cent are gas-based. The demand is projected to rise to about 10,000mw and 14,000mw by 2015 and 2020, respectively.

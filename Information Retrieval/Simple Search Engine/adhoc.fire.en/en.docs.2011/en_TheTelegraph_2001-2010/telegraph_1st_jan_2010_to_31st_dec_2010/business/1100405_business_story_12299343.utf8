        Products guaranteeing highest NAV are a mix of high charges and not necessarily high returns, says Dhruva Raj Chatterji                                            
	No matter how skillful you are, you cant invent a product advantage that doesnt exist. And if you do, and its just a gimmick, its going to fall apart anyway               
	Recently, there have been several advertisements of products guaranteeing the highest net asset value (NAV) to investors. Such declarations are a relief to the layman who neither understands the intricacies of the stock market nor has the time to buy low and sell high. The concept of protecting against a downtide amidst market volatility is quite interesting. However, the devil lies in the detail. Some of the important aspects of any investment product are the expected returns, investment horizon, expenses and of course, your risk profile.         
	Let us see how most of these plans work.        
	Timing the returns         
	The stock markets in India have been delivering superb returns since 2004, except for the crash in 2008. Investors have become wary of the volatility and are increasingly looking at products offering capital protection. As a result, the strategies of option-based portfolio insurance and constant proportion portfolio insurance have gained importance.         
	The highest NAV guarantee plan is based on the constant proportion portfolio insurance model. According to this model, the fund will invest in fixed-income type securities to maintain a certain minimum unit value.         
	When the fund value exceeds this floor value, the surplus is placed with stocks. With constant rebalancing of the portfolio, the aim of the fund manager is to not let the unit value fall below the base.         
	Similarly, the proceeds in such plans will be dynamically invested in equity, fixed-income and money market instruments. However, there is no specific asset allocation that the fund manager has to adhere to, unlike a mutual fund or a unit-linked insurance policy (Ulip).         
	Since plans promising the highest NAV are new, there is no historical data to evaluate the performance of the funds. A fund manager may follow a conservative approach and allocate your fund in money market and fixed-income instruments to ensure that you get the highest NAV without much trouble.         
	At the beginning, the NAV is 10 and lets say the fund has invested in equity. Suppose the stock market rises and the NAV goes up to 12. As the fund has already gained 20 per cent, the fund manager has to maintain this NAV at least for the next 6-8 years. Then, the fund will be reshuffled into fixed-income securities to ensure that the NAV of 12 is maintained. Thus, even though the fund manager may fluctuate from equity to fixed income or money market, the returns may not be comparable to an equity diversified fund or a Ulip.         
	No easy exit         
	Insurance is ideally a long-term investment expected to offer protection to a policyholders family in an event of untimely death or disability. A life policy is typically designed for 15-25 years. In the absence of the policyholders income, the major as well as minor expenses of the family should be compensated through the insurance cover. But the insurance component in highest NAV guarantee plans works merely as a supplementary portion to the entire plan as these provide limited cover and most of them offer guarantee on maturity after a period of 7-10 years.         
	Secondly, the plan terminates after the grace period when you stop paying your premiums. The exit from the plan or partial withdrawals is possible only after three-five years. Also, for partial withdrawals or surrenders, which attract an exit charge of 0-20 per cent, this guarantee is not applicable. Thus, these plans do not offer immediate liquidity.         
	No free lunches         
	Now, consider the actual investible part. These plans have five types of charges for premium allocation, mortality, policy administration, fund management and highest NAV guarantee.        
	The units are calculated after deduction of the premium allocation charge. The balance from the premium received goes as an investment into the fund. The mortality, policy administration charges and fund management charges are deducted every year from the fund. There is a fund management fee plus a charge to ascertain that you get the highest NAV that will be deducted from your fund units.         
	Besides the premium allocation charge, you will end up paying from your fund approximately 2.50 per cent per annum. Later, the premium allocation charges may come down but other charges would stay.         
	Let us take this example. Suppose a person aged 35 pays a premium of Rs 10,000 every year through an intermediary into the plan. The maximum sum assured will be just Rs 300,000 (30 times of the annual premium) and the annual mortality charge will be approximately Rs 500. See the table to understand the return under Case I (assuming minimum charges applicable), Case II (assuming maximum charges applicable) and Case III (assuming moderate charges).         
	Even though the fund NAV will rise by 50 per cent, the returns at the end of the period will be lower than that in a monthly income scheme (annualised return of 8 per cent for six years) and a monthly income plan (annualised return of 9.715 per cent over five years). Despite the highest NAV assurance and a 20 per cent increase in NAV, after deducting all the charges, you are actually negative on your investment.         
	In fact, your fund value (net of all charges) should exceed almost 25 per cent in the first year itself to get your capital back from the fund.         
	Only if the fund NAV was to double, will the performance better monthly income schemes, even if not better than equity/balanced mutual funds or Ulips.         
	These products guaranteeing the highest NAV may not necessarily provide the highest returns, rather they come with high charges. The product may assure you the highest value but the fund manager is restricted in terms of investment decisions and may not be able to optimise the returns from the fund.

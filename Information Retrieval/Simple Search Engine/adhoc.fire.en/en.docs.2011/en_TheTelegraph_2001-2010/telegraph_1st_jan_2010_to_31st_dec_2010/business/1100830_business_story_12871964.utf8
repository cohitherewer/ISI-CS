	New Delhi, Aug. 29: Bank lending is expected to grow 20-25 per cent this year on account of the governments increased focus on infrastructure, higher capital needs of companies and strong retail demand.         
	In its first-quarter review, the RBI had projected a 20 per cent growth in corporate and retail loans in 2010-11. Bankers, however, expect the loan growth to be as high as 25 per cent this year with a good monsoon pushing up demand in agricultural and retail lending.         
	We expect a 20 per cent compounded annual growth rate in credit over 2010-12, driven by robust GDP, increased government thrust on infrastructure, higher working capital demand by corporate houses and strong retail demand, particularly in the mortgage and auto segments that comprise over 70 per cent of retail credit, said Siddharth Teli, banking analyst at Religare Capital Markets.        
	Private banks and some of their PSU counterparts have hiked their prime lending rates by 25-50 basis points after the RBIs July policy, taking the benchmark prime lending rate  the rate at which they lend money to their best borrowers  to the 12-13.5 per cent range.         
	Despite the hike, bankers are confident that demand for credit will continue to rise.        
	The State Bank of India (SBI)  the countrys largest lender  sees most of the growth coming from the retail segment, including home and auto loans. The SBIs retail loan book is growing at 20-21 per cent year-on-year, and the bank is confident of demand picking up in the upcoming festival season.         
	On August 16, the PSU bank hiked its lending rates by up to 0.50 per cent on its PLR loans.        
	Firms confident         
	Bankers said the growth in economic recovery prompted many companies to pursue their expansion plans, thereby pushing up demand for loans.         
	Companies have started adding to their capacities and we are seeing demand from the infrastructure sector, especially in areas such as construction contracts, auto and textiles, said a PSU bank official.         
	Bank lending to corporate houses and individuals saw a 20.56 per cent year-on-year growth at Rs 33,17,583 crore in the fortnight ended August 13, 2010.         
	According to the RBI, this is 100-basis-point higher than the growth registered in the previous fortnight ended July 30, 2010.

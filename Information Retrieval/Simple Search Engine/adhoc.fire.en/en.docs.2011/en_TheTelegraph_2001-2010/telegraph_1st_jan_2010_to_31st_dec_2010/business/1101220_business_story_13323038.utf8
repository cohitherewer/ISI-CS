The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Producers want to export more sugar
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Producers want to export more sugar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Price pressure                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 19: Sugar producers want the government to allow more quantity of the sweetener to be exported as output this year is likely to be higher than the demand and can lead to the softening of prices.         
	The Centre had on Wednesday allowed the sector to export 500,000 tonnes of sugar under the open general licence route. The decision comes at a time production is estimated to be anywhere between 24.5 million tonnes (mt) and 25.5mt this year. Besides, there is over 50 lakh tonnes that have been carried forward from last year.         
	According to agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, the excess stock will amount to 80 lakh tonnes. These factors may bring down domestic prices of sugar this year.         
	However, international prices that hit a 30-year high early last month have been ruling firm on concerns of tight supply as lower output is expected from Brazil  the worlds largest producer.        
	Therefore, the decision to permit exports is seen as a positive for the industry as mills can take advantage of the higher prices prevailing overseas. However, the industry expects the government to allow more quantities to be exported.        
	The decision to allow exports of 5 lakh tonnes is good news. But it will not make much of an impact on the industry. The government should allow more exports once it reviews the policy again in January, said a senior official from a leading sugar firm.         
	He said domestic output this year was estimated to be over 25.5mt and the demand was projected to be around 23mt. Sugar prices (ex-factory) are ruling at around Rs 28 per kg and are expected to remain stable given the production trends.        
	Lifting of the export restrictions saw sugar stocks posting good gains on the stock exchanges on Thursday. Opinions are, however, divided on whether these counters will continue to witness buying.

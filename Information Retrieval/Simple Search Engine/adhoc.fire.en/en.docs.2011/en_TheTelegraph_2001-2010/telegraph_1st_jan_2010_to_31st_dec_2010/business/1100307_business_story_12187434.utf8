                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sebi tweaks derivatives trade rule
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 6: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has decided to allow physical delivery in the equity derivatives segment. At present, derivative contracts are cash-settled on the expiry of contracts.        
	However, Sebi doesnt plan to push through this plan in haste.        
	The Sebi board cleared the plan at a meeting here today and the regulator would now discuss the issue with the stock exchanges.         
	An appropriate mechanism will then be put in place for physical delivery in the derivatives segment. An equity derivative is a financial instrument that derives value from its underlying instrument, usually stocks.        
	Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave told reporters that the market regulator has not set a timeline for the implementation of the plan.         
	Derivatives trading began in the Indian markets in 2000 and had become a huge success, underscored by the fact that the trading volumes in this segment are three or four times greater than that in the cash market. Since its introduction and successful implementation, there have been demands to bring in physical settlement. With the stock lending and borrowing scheme in place, many have felt that a physical delivery could now be introduced.        
	There has been a demand for this (physical delivery in equity derivatives) for some time now and the board felt that there was some substance in this, Bhave said.        
	The Sebi chairman parried queries on whether the introduction of physical delivery in equity derivatives could lead to lower speculation.        
	It is a very good decision. This has been a demand made for a long time. It will make the market more interesting and price discovery will become more efficient, Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS said.         
	At the board meeting today, the market regulator also decided that qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) will now have to bring in 100 per cent of the application money as margin along with the application for securities in public issues. At present, these investors can bring in 10 per cent of the application money as margin.        
	According to Sebi, this condition will provide a level-playing field to all investors subscribing to shares in an offering. This will be effective from May 1.        
	Bhave said this decision should be seen in the context of the market regulators move to reduce the time gap between the closure of a public issue and listing of its shares. The effort is to see that the gap is reduced to one week by the end of this calendar year, he added.        
	The board also decided that the reservation for employees in public/rights issues would be available to employees of subsidiaries and material associates of the issuer whose financial statements are consolidated in the issuers balance sheet.        
	Ulip issue        
	Sebi is studying the reply given by a few life insurance companies with regard to the notice sent to them on the Ulip issue. We are considering the reply to the notice that has been received, Bhave said.        
	A few life insurers such as Max New York Life, Bharti AXA Life, Bajaj Allianz and HDFC Standard Life have sent their replies.        
	The regulator had issued a show-cause to a host of life insurers asking them for an explanation as to why they had not taken its permission before launching Ulips.         
	Whenever we issue a notice to anybody we consider what is their reply. Whatever action we will take would be made public, Bhave said.

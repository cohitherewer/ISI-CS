	Calcutta, Oct. 29: Uco Bank today reported a 42 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 119.19 crore for the quarter ended September 30.         
	The performance is in sharp contrast to the other two city-based PSU banks  Allahabad Bank and the United Bank of India  which have clocked a profit growth of 21 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively. Our profit growth is muted because we made large provisioning for bad loans, said Arun Kaul, chairman of Uco Bank, which has been struggling with a high incidence of non-performing assets .        
	He said fresh slippage into non-performing assets (NPAs) during the first six months of the fiscal was Rs 1,096 crore.         
	During July-September alone, Rs 678-crore of loans turned bad. In the preceding quarter, the amount of NPAs stood at Rs 418 crore.

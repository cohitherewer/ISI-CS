The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | 3G auction invite in a week
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      3G auction invite in a week
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Raja: Raring to go                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: Telecom minister A. Raja will send out invitations to the bidders of third-generation (3G) spectrum in a week.        
	However, the process cannot be completed within this fiscal, disrupting the governments plan to plug the fiscal deficit  pegged at a 16-year high of 6.8 per cent of the gross domestic product  through spectrum sale proceeds.        
	The finance ministry had earmarked Rs 30,000-35,000 crore as revenue from the auction. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had given clear directions to the department of telecom to complete the auction by the end of February.         
	The notice inviting applications will be released this week. Then it would take 40-45 days for the auction to begin, Raja said today. He, however, was unable to assess the revenue the government would raise.         
	Analysts expect each telecom firm to spend up to $1.5 billion to get a pan-India licence, while building the high-speed wireless network will cost billions of dollars more.        
	3G mobile phone service allow users to surf the Internet or download content, including music and video, at a much faster speed than the current 2G (second-generation) service.         
	I dont think it really matters if (the auction happens) this year or the next, cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar had said earlier. I think they will take a decision based on how the government will maximise its revenue.        
	The government had earlier decided to auction four slots, in addition to the one already allotted to state-run BSNL and MTNL. It has set Rs 3,500 crore as the base price for each slot.         
	3G services were scheduled to be launched in 2007, but problems in the vacation of spectrum by the defence forces and the fixing of bid prices caused repeated delays. This is hurting the telecom sector as high-end services could have arrested the fall in revenues and profits faced by the operators.         
	The government has also deferred mobile number portability, which allows users to change operators while retaining their numbers, by two months to the end of May because of security reason.                                                         
	The service was initially slated for launch on December 31, 2009, and the date was later pushed back to March 31.

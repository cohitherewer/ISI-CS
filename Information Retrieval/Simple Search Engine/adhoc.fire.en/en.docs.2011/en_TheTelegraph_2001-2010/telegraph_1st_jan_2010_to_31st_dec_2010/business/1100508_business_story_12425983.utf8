          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Deora: Reason to cheer                                  
	New Delhi, May 7: The government was the real winner in todays court verdict on the gas case. It has the right to fix the price of gas and decide who gets the natural resource and for how long  meaning the Centre will have the freedom to provide concessions to state-owned units such as NTPC.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora exulted that the (ruling upholds) that the gas belongs to the people of India and the government has the right to decide on the pricing.        
	Additional solicitor-general Mohan Parasaran, said, The court has not taken into account the quantum or tenure of the gas. They (Ambani brothers) have to re-negotiate, depending on the policies of the government.         
	The government has fixed the price of gas sold from RIL-run KG basin at $4.2 per mBtu for around 35 buyers. The gas utilisation policy also states that priority will be given to power and fertiliser firms. Plants that have been set up and are ready to use the gas will get preference.        
	Power ministry officials said the court ruling indicated that the government had the freedom to tweak the rates for PSU entities.         
	If NTPC is seen as an arm of the government, the government can charge a discounted price and get away with this by arguing that it had the right as the owner, officials said.         
	Parasaran also said, NTPC is a public sector undertaking. It is an arm of the government, adding that the group of ministers on gas pricing was competent to take decisions on the issue.         
	Power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said the verdict would not have a bearing on NTPC. This decision does not go against NTPC that had held an international bidding under which RIL had to supply gas at a price accepted by NTPC.         
	Petroleum ministry officials, however, cautioned that if NTPC, which is a listed firm with a majority government stake, was seen as a separate corporate entity, the Centre would not be allowed to discriminate and set lower prices.        
	Todays verdict also gives Deora a shot in the arm. The minister told reporters, I welcome the verdict. No matter what campaign one ran against the government, the nation is supreme.        
	Deora had been targeted by the Anil Ambani group, which accused the petroleum ministry of trying to bail out RIL from its obligation under the Ambani family pact to supply 28 mmscmd of gas to RNRL at a price of $2.34 per mBtu.

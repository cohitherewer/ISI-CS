The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bata tweaks township pact to cut risks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bata tweaks township pact to cut risks
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Sinha: Reaping gains                                  
	Calcutta, April 29: Bata is going to get an upfront payment of Rs 100 crore for the township project being developed on the factory land at Batanagar in South 24 Parganas. In doing so, the shoe major will lower its risk from exposure to the real estate business.        
	The company has tweaked the joint venture agreement with Calcutta Metropolitan Group (CMG) for the project to ensure the upfront sum and 640,000 sq feet of constructed space free of cost.         
	Bata chairman P.M. Sinha said it was a great deal for the shareholders.        
	We received a very significant part of the Rs 100 crore yesterday. The rest will come within a few months, Sinha told The Telegraph.        
	The new deal will ensure that Bata does not have to wait till the township is completed to gain from the venture.        
	We wont have to wait for 4-5 years for the apartments to be sold, Sinha added.        
	For the time being, Bata will retain legal title over the land and shares in the joint venture company, Riverbank Developers Pvt Ltd. However, it will sell its shares at a future date but this will not be linked to the Rs 100-crore upfront payment. Bata will have the land right over the basic infrastructure such as roads. Part of the free-of-cost space will be used to rehabilitate the workers of the shoe factory at Batanagar.        
	Sumit Dabriwala, managing director of CMG, said he planned to hand over the free-of-cost space in the next 60 days. I am happy with the sales. We have sold close to 70 per cent of the first phase where about 600 units are being built. Apartments will be handed over from December 2011, he said.        
	Riverbank Developers is building a hotel, a school and a 500-bed multi-speciality hospital on the 237-acre plot.        
	Net rises        
	Bata Indias net profit grew 38.72 per cent to Rs 14.33 crore in the first quarter ended March 31 from Rs 10.33 crore in the year-ago period.

	Calcutta, July 15: Cultural integration is the key to the success of any global merger and acquisition, industry leaders said today.        
	An M amp;A deal will fail unless you integrate people and processes because otherwise you will not get any synergy benefit, Hemant Nerurkar, managing director of Tata Steel, said at the 10th Sir Jehangir Ghandy Memorial Panel Discussion and Lecture on the challenges of global acquisitions organised by the Calcutta Management Association.         
	R. Mukundan, managing director of Tata Chemicals, Abhik Mitra, managing director of TNT, Koushik Chatterjee, group CFO of Tata Steel, and Kalpataru Tripathy, partner of law firm Amarchand Mangaldas, were the other speakers.        
	According to a study, 70 per cent of the global M amp;A deals do not succeed because of assimilation issues. Nerurkar said it was important to engage with the existing management, people and the local community.        
	The Tata group has always followed this strategy, demonstrated during the acquisition of Corus and Jaguar Land Rover, he added. Mukundan shared his experience in Tata Chemicals, which had bought three firms in the UK, the US and Kenya. He stressed the need to take the workers and the management of the acquired firm into confidence. You need to choose the right man to run business, he said.        
	There will be a short-term pain to derive long-term gain. You must have faith in the strategy you have chosen, Abhik Mitra said.         
	Koushik Chatterjee supported Mitra. You should not be surprised by surprises, he said, while elaborating how difficult it was to do cross-border deals in a controlled economy such as India. Joydeep Datta Gupta, executive director of Deloitte amp; Touche and the moderator of the discussion, stressed the importance of appropriate IT infrastructure.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RIL upbeat on refining
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           ROBUST growth                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 31: Reliance Industries  which announced its best quarterly performance in close to three years  expects refining and petrochemical margins to rise next year.         
	On Saturday, the countrys biggest private company reported a 27.8 per cent increase in net profit for the second quarter ended September 30 at Rs 4,303 crore.         
	In a media call on Sunday, Reliance Industries chief financial officer Alok Agarwal said, 2009 was a terrible year for refining. 2010 has seen a significant improvement and I am optimistic that the margins should improve from here on.         
	It was a record quarter for the company driven by volume and price growth with a utilisation of 109 per cent, especially in comparison with global refineries which are still around 80 per cent, said Agarwal.         
	Shale gas plans        
	RIL plans to focus on consolidating and scaling up its shale gas operations in the US through its three joint ventures. We are in no hurry to forge more such partnerships at this point, said Agarwal.         
	The company expects to spend around $4-$4.5 billion on shale gas assets by 2014, added Agarwal, who expects the companys shale gas reserves in the US to yield as much gas as KG-D6 in India.        
	The three joint ventures for shale gas in the US hold 11 trillion cubic feet of reserves, equivalent to the KG-D6 block, said Agarwal. RIL has invested $3.4 billion in its three joint ventures that handle shale gas assets.        
	The company, which recently raised $1.5 billion through an issue of dollar-denominated bonds, is likely to borrow more to fund its shale gas operations. A US subsidiary of the company may borrow for this investment, added Agarwal.         
	The CFO, however, declined to indicate by when the company would reach an output of 80mmscmd at KG-D6. Reliance is conducting reservoir studies at present, he said.         
	4G rollout        
	Agarwal was reluctant to spell out a timeline for the launch of its 4G broadband wireless service for which it won spectrum licences in 22 circles through an auction held in May. We got the spectrum around three months ago and are in the process of putting together a business plan and forming partnerships for the rollout, he said.         
	We expect significant value from broadband over the medium termWe are not there yet.

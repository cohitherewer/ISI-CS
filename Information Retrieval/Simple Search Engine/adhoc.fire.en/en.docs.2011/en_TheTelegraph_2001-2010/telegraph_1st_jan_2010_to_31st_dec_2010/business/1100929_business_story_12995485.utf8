The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BlackBerry maker offers iPad rival

          IAN AUSTEN                          Michael Lazaridis in San Francisco on Monday. (Reuters)                                  
	Ottawa, Sept. 28: Research In Motion (RIM), the Canadian maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, introduced its first tablet computer on Monday at a developers conference in San Francisco. But in a return to its roots, the company said the new device, the BlackBerry PlayBook, would be aimed mainly at business users.         
	After popularising wireless email, RIM has ceded much of its leadership in the smartphone market to Apple and phones based on Googles Android operating system.         
	The introduction of a tablet computer will not end criticism from some analysts that RIM is now playing catch-up with Apple. But in a bid to distinguish the PlayBook from Apples iPad, Michael Lazaridis, RIMs co-chief executive, said the new tablet contained several features requested by corporate information technology departments.         
	In an address to conference attendees, Lazaridis called the PlayBook the worlds first professional tablet and emphasised that it was fully compatible with the special servers that companies and governments now used to control and monitor employees BlackBerry devices.         
	While the company offered some specifics about the new device, it left many questions unanswered, most notably the tablets price. The company was also vague about its release date, indicating only that it would be available early next year.         
	Among the PlayBooks novel features are outlets that allow it to display material on computer monitors or television sets, but Lazaridis made no effort to use them during his presentation. As animations showing the devices features appeared above him on a giant screen, he did little more with the PlayBook in his hand than switch it on.         
	Its a very real product, said Charles S. Golvin, principal analyst with Forrester Research. But its very much a work in progress.         
	Perhaps responding to criticisms that the operating system for RIMs phone is outdated, the PlayBook will use a new operating system developed by QNX Software Systems, a company RIM acquired from Harman International earlier this year.         
	The new device can also display Web pages created using Adobes Flash software, a feature not found in the iPad. To underscore that point, Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen appeared on stage with Lazaridis.         
	While RIMs phones and tablet will have incompatible operating systems, Golvin expects that outside software application developers will work around that issue by using Flash, as well as standard Web page protocols.

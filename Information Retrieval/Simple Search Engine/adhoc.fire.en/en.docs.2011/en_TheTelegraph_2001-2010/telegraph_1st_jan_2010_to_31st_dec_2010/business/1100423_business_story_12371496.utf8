                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      M amp;M bid to jack up Logan sales
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          SPEEDING AHEAD                                   
	Mumbai, April 22: Mahindra Renault Pvt Ltd today slashed the price of the Logan by Rs 27000-80000 across the product range in an attempt to crank up sales of the mid-size sedan.        
	The Logan price cut  which will make it the cheapest petrol-driven car in its category  comes at a time rivals have started raising prices.        
	The price reduction comes less than a week after the joint venture announced a restructuring plan under which M amp;M would buy out the French car makers 49 per cent stake.        
	At that time, M amp;M had said it would refresh and carry out other modifications in the Logan and take other measures to boost its sales, which had tumbled to around 350 units per month.        
	The company said the price of the Logan had been reduced by Rs 27000-80000 for its Bharat Stage III variant and to the tune of Rs 24,000 to Rs 65,000 for the BS IV version.         
	The revised prices will be effective from April 26. The company expects sales of the Logan to pick up subsequently.        
	Rajesh Jejurikar, chief executive of M amp;Ms automotive division, said the competitive pricing and the other measures that would soon follow would provide the right momentum to the Logan.        
	He said the Logan 1.51 DLX Diesel would now be available at a price of Rs 5.65 lakh compared with its earlier price of Rs 6.45 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). Similarly, the 1.5 DLE model will be priced at Rs 5.35 lakh, down from a little over Rs 6 lakh.         
	At this price, the Logan will be the best priced sedan in the C segment (more than four metres long), Jejurikar said.        
	He said the petrol version of the Logan 1.4 GLX would be priced at Rs 4.86 lakh (Rs 5.13 lakh). Here, we will be cheaper than all the fully loaded petrol cars in the C segment, Jejurikar added.        
	Asked to explain how the company was trimming prices when input costs were rising, Jejurikar said the car makers cost structure was expected to come down. It also hoped to gain benefits from the rupees appreciation against the euro.        
	Jejurikar did not divulge the sales targets for the Logan after the price cut. He, however, expressed optimism that the sales of the car would now start picking up.

	New Delhi, Oct. 27: Norwegian telecom operator Telenor is expecting to make lower losses this year in India, backed by improved revenues and subscriber additions.        
	Telenor  which owns 67 per cent in Indias Uninor, with the remaining stake held by domestic real estate player Unitech  started operations in 2009.        
	Telenor expects Uninor to contribute a lower loss on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of around Norwegian krone (NOK) 4.5 billion (Rs 3,375 crore) in 2010, a 10 per cent fall from its previous outlook of NOK 5 billion (Rs 3,750 crore) losses.        
	For the third quarter of 2010 (ending September), EBITDA loss from Uninor was NOK 1,115 million (Rs 836 crore) versus a loss of NOK 1,132 million (Rs 849 crore) in the second quarter of 2010.        
	The company had informed investors last year that its Indian arm would suffer a loss of Rs 15,500 crore during the initial years, while adding that it expected to be profitable within three years.        
	Third-quarter revenues of Uninor more than doubled to NOK 214 million (Rs 160.5 crore) from NOK 103 million (Rs 77.25 crore) in the second quarter of this year.        
	Average revenues per user also showed an 8 per cent increase over the last quarter.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 22: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has entered into a joint venture with Russian petrochemical company SIBUR to make butyl rubber in the country.        
	With an initial capacity of 100,000 tonnes that will be set up at RILs refining and petrochemicals facility in Jamnagar, butyl rubber will be used to make tyres for the automobile sector.         
	The estimated investment in the project is $450 million and the manufacturing unit for butyl rubber is likely to be commissioned by 2013. RIL will have a majority stake in the joint venture. This is a significant step towards RILs commitment to service Indias growing automotive sector by bringing in complex technologies, available only with a few firms globally, RIL executive director N. R. Meswani said.        
	The setting up of domestic manufacturing of butyl rubber will fulfil a long-standing demand of the Indian tyre and rubber industry and this investment is part of RILs vision of emerging as a significant global player in the synthetic rubber business, he said.         
	Initially, the plant will produce regular butyl rubber and will thereafter make specialities. While SIBUR will provide its proprietary technology for butyl rubber polymerisation and finishing, RIL will supply monomers and provide the infrastructure for the plant.         
	The joint venture agreement was signed during Russian president Dmitry Medvedevs visit to India.         
	On the joint venture, SIBURs president Dmitry Konov said, SIBUR has unique technologies for the production of synthetic rubber, which in partnership with RIL will cater to the needs of the Indian tyre industry with high quality raw material.

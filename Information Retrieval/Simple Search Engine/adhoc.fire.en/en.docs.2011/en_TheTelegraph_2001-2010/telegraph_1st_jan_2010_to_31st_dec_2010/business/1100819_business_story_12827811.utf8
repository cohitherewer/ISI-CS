          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: US-based Blackstone has picked up a 12 per cent stake in Moser Baer Projects Pvt Ltd for $300 million, the private equity firms biggest investment in India.        
	In June 2007, Blackstone bought a majority stake in BPO company Intelenet for $200 million. In August 2007, it invested $150 million in Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Construction Company.        
	The investment will be used by Moser Baer to fund its power projects. The company has set a capacity target of 5,000MW by 2016, comprising 4,000MW thermal, 500MW solar and 500MW hydroelectric power.        
	We are happy to have found a partner in Blackstone, who shares our zeal and vision, Ratul Puri, director of Moser Baer Projects, said.        
	Moser Baer Projects has been founded by Deepak Puri and Ratul Puri, who are the promoters of Moser Baer India Ltd.        
	Akhil Gupta, chairman and managing director of Blackstone Advisors India Pvt Ltd, said he was bullish on power with demand exceeding supply for another 10 years.        
	India now has a power generation capacity of 155,859MW.         
	It is likely to miss the plan target of adding 78,000MW by 2012 as it has produced 21,000MW during the first three years of the current plan (2007-12) and plans to add 40,000MW over the next two years.        
	After the announcement by Blackstone, shares of Moser Baer India rose 6.6 per cent to close at Rs 66.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	During intra-day trading, the stock rose about 11 per cent to touch a months high of Rs 69.15 on the BSE.        
	Cash course        
	Blackstone plans to double its investment to $2-3 billion in India over the next five years.        
	We are looking at two dominant themes: infrastructure, which includes ports, power and roads, and domestic consumption such as media and retail, Gupta said.         
	Since 2005, Blackstone has invested $1.25 billion.         
	Gupta said the private equity firm might invest up to $1 billion in power alone.

	New Delhi, Jan. 30: NTPC Ltd plans to import coal directly, starting next fiscal.        
	We plan to import 15-16 million tonnes of coal directly from next year, R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director of NTPC, told The Telegraph.        
	The government had nominated state-run MMTC to import 12.5mt coal on behalf of NTPC last year.         
	The tender, reissued at the end of August, faced delays and affected production at some NTPC units.        
	NTPCs total coal requirement during 2009-10 is estimated at 150 million tonnes.         
	The power producer is also close to striking a coal block deal in Mozambique or Indonesia to secure its coal supplies.        
	Earnings boost        
	NTPC is targeting at least Rs 2,400 crore by selling power in the open market in the next few years. It is creating 2,000mw of fresh capacity, including two units of 500mw each at Farakka and Korba.         
	These two units will generate at least 8 billion units of power. Even if we sell the power at Rs 1.5 per unit, we earn a revenue of Rs 1,200 crore. Another Rs 1,200 crore will come when the additional 1,000mw of merchant power generation is set up, NTPC director (commercial) Inderjit Kapoor said today on the sideline of the companys upcoming FPO roadshow in Calcutta.

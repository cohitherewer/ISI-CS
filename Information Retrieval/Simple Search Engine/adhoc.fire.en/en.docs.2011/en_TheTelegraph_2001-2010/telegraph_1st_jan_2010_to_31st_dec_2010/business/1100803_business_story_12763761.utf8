The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Adani nears Aussie coal deal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Adani nears Aussie coal deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RESERVE BOOST                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 2: Adani Enterprises is close to buying coal mining rights in Australia from Linc Energy for over $900 million. The deal with the Australian company is likely to take place over the next few days.        
	After the news of the proposed deal, Adanis shares gained nearly 5 per cent on the bourses. On the BSE, the scrip closed at Rs 609.70, a gain of Rs 27.60, or 4.74 per cent, over the previous close.        
	Though officials from Adani Enterprises were not available for comment, it is learnt that the coal block is located in Queensland.        
	Adani owns coal reserves of over 2 billion tonnes. It is the largest importer of coal for state power utilities.         
	The deal with Linc will also help the Indian firm to meet its own demand for coal required for its ambitious plans in power.         
	Linc Energy has been looking to sell some of its non-core coal assets. Earlier, there were reports in The Australian and The Sydney Morning Herald that a deal between the two companies would be signed on August 3. This could not be verified.        
	Linc Energy remains in negotiations with a number of parties for the sale of its non-core Queensland coal tenements. We confirm that Adani Enterprises is one of those parties. These negotiations remain commercial in confidence and, while very well advanced, no concluded contract terms have been agreed with any party as at the time of this announcement, the company said in a statement today.        
	Adani may partly fund the acquisition through the money from a recent qualified institutional placement.         
	Adani raised Rs 4,000 crore, though the initial plan was to mop up a little less than Rs 3,000 crore. The issue got a good response, receiving applications of Rs 5,500 crore.         
	Citigroup, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS, IDFC Capital, Enam Securities, ICICI Securities and Kotak Mahindra Capital had managed the issue and the offer was priced at about Rs 536.15 per share.        
	Adani Enterprises is present in coal mining and trading, power generation, oil and gas exploration and city gas distribution.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      S amp;P outlook seal on fiscal measures
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 18: Standard amp; Poors has raised its outlook on India to stable from negative, leading to a recovery in the stock and government bond markets. Analysts said the revision augured well for the fund-raising efforts of banks and corporate houses.         
	The global rating agency has turned optimistic on the countrys fiscal position and growth, but it gave a warning on inflation.         
	While raising the outlook, S amp;P has kept the long- and short-term sovereign ratings same at BBB- and A-3, respectively.         
	The agency said it would be difficult for India to get a ratings upgrade, given the present level of high government debts and deficit.        
	However, the government has shown a commitment to reduce its deficit, and the fiscal situation could now improve, prompting the agency to improve its outlook. Besides, the economy will remain on a strong growth path.        
	S amp;P said that the ratings could be raised, if the government continued to reduce the public sectors deficits materially.         
	However, there could be pressure on ratings if the government continues its loose fiscal policy or if restrictive monetary, financial and economic policies lower medium-term growth prospects.        
	We expect Indias GDP growth to be 8 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011, which is higher than many other countries and exceeds our previous expectation, said S amp;Ps credit analyst Takahira Ogawa. The global rating agency added that it viewed Indias external position as resilient.        
	However, Ogawa said the recent high inflation rate could also derail the stable macroeconomic and interest rate environments. Food inflation is ruling high, though for the week ended March 6 it fell 1.51 points to 16.80 per cent.         
	Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at the Bank of Baroda, said the rating is also a positive signal for international investors. Further, it augurs well for banks and corporate houses since it will help them in their capital raising efforts. They will get better returns.         
	Though the S amp;P announcement came towards the fag end of market hours, it resulted in the sensex ending 29.18 points higher at 17519.26. Elsewhere, at the government securities market, the revision led to a rally in bond prices.

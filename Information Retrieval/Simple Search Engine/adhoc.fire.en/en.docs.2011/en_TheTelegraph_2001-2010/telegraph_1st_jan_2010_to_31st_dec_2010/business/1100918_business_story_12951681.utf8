	New Delhi, Sept. 17: India will voice its opposition to US tendencies towards protectionism at the upcoming G20 meeting, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said here today.   
	The G20 needs to coordinate policies in a manner that should ensure sustainable and balanced growth, Mukherjee said at a conference on G20 issues organised by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.   
	He said the G20 member countries should work together to ensure financial stability and make international trade more open and transparent.   
	The immediate spheres of such co-ordination (between G20 member countries) are macroeconomic policies and exit strategies, pace of regulatory reforms to ensure financial stability without affecting prospects of growth, keeping international trade open and avoiding protectionism, he said.   
	The fifth summit of G20 will be held in South Korea on November 11 and 12.   
	Finance ministers from the Group of 20 countries will meet next month to outline the agenda for the meeting of the head of states.   
	Mukherjee said India would lobby with other countries to raise the increasing tendencies towards protectionism in some countries, especially in the US.   
	Referring to the global economic crisis, the minister said a co-ordinated effort should be made to overcome the crisis as no country was insulated from it.   
	He said the crisis was turning out to be broader and deeper than expected.   
	The US has recently announced a series of measures to curb IT outsourcing, which should boost the demand for local products. Earlier this month, Ohio said it would forbid outsourcing by government departments.   
	The US has also increased visa fees by $2,000 to $2,250 in certain categories.   
	Indias $50-billion IT industry, which earns the majority of its revenues from American companies, feels the measures will hit its bottomline.  
	The fee hike is expected to cost IT outsourcing firms such as TCS, Infosys Technologies, Wipro and Mahindra Satyam, around $200 million annually.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 9: The Indian government is in talks with various stakeholders over the possibility of opening up multi-brand retail to foreign investment, commerce minister Anand Sharma said today.         
	India has not yet decided on allowing foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail, Sharma said.        
	The government has a positive mindset on bringing policy changes to allow FDI in multi-brand retail though the matter requires a broad-based political and social consensus. Around 50 million jobs in the small and medium sector will be at stake if the government allows FDI in multi-brand retail.         
	Earlier this month, Mike Duke, global chief executive officer of the worlds largest retailer, Wal-Mart, said discussions with government officials had been very positive and he was optimistic on India opening up retail FDI.         
	India allows 100 per cent FDI in cash-and-carry operation and 51 per cent in single-brand retail.

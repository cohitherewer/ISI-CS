The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Liquidity crunch worries RBI
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Liquidity crunch worries RBI
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Gokarn: Under pressure                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 13: RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn today said liquidity deficit in the country had gone well beyond the comfortable level of Rs 50,000 crore and the apex bank was taking steps to ease the pressure.        
	During the last few weeks the liquidity deficit has gone well beyond what we consider a positive liquidity deficit position of ... around Rs 50,000 crore. We are now clearly above that, Gokarn told a CII-organised CFO summit here today.        
	The RBIs policy statement on November 2 had tried to explain a comfortable liquidity band, which is plus or minus 1 per cent of the net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), Gokarn said.        
	The economy has been experiencing a liquidity shortfall because of a spurt in festive demand coupled with an over Rs 20,000-crore absorption on account of the recent share sale offer of CIL and PowerGrid.        
	We moved to a deficit liquidity situation in end May or early June. But in the last few weeks it has gone beyond what we think is a normal or a positive liquidity deficit, Gokarn said.        
	Gokarn also ruled out intervention in the foreign exchange market, saying the capital inflows had not turned volatile or lumpy, and that the economy needed them to finance the large current account deficit.        
	We need these capital flows to finance the widening current account deficit and to ensure that we have enough capital to meet our import needs, Gokarn said.        
	On the industrial growth numbers for September, which suggest a sharp deceleration, he said it was a matter of concern but the signal was not negative when seen in the context of other indicators of industrial performance.        
	On Friday, data showed the index of industrial production (IIP) slipping to 4.4 per cent in September from 8.2 per cent in September last year. This figure was below the consensus estimate of 6.4 per cent.         
	Gokarn said one must look at IIP in the broad context of decelerating of growth globally. The global recovery that has followed the financial crisis first saw a sharp growth, which then plateaued.        
	The IIP numbers suggest a deceleration, Gokarn said. Does this deceleration reflect a slowdown in investment activities? If that is so, is it reflecting the cost of funding or weaker expectations of future growth or a combination of the two? All of this is a matter of concern, he said.

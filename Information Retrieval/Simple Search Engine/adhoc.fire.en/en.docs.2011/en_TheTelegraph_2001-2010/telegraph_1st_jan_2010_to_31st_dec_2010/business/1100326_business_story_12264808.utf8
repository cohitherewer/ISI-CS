The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Winter crops douse food fire   Surge seen in overall price index
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Winter crops douse food fire     Surge seen in overall price index
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	New Delhi, March 25: Food prices fell for the third consecutive week, with the arrival of winter crops easing the pressure on supplies.         
	Food inflation softened marginally to 16.22 per cent for the week ended March 13 from 16.30 per cent in the previous week as the pace of price rise of potatoes slowed, and vegetables such as onions became cheaper.        
	The fuel price index rose 12.68 per cent during the week. Fuel prices were hiked as the government restored the customs duty on crude and raised the excise duty on petrol and diesel.        
	The 0.08 percentage point fall in food prices, however, is unlikely to prevent the overall inflation from vaulting to double digits in March from 9.89 per cent in February as the high food and fuel prices have started spilling over to non-food items.        
	Food inflation is likely to soften in the coming months, but fuel and manufacturing inflation can pick up. I expect overall inflation to be around 11 per cent in March, HDFC Bank economist Jyotinder Kaur said.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee,too, had said food inflation might spread to non-food items.        
	During the week, potato prices rose by just 5.68 per cent, while onion prices slipped 6.64 per cent.        
	However, pulses became dearer by 31.68 per cent. Prices of wheat shot up by 15.09 per cent, cereals by 10.64 per cent and rice by 7.42 per cent. Prices of vegetables rose 5.12 per cent, while fruits and milk cost 11.06 per cent and 15.31 per cent more, respectively.        
	Although recent high inflation figures can be attributed to a low base effect, a weak monsoon also led to the surge in food prices.        
	Growing concern over inflation along with rising confidence in the resilience of the economic recovery had compelled the Reserve Bank of India to increase the overnight lending and borrowing rates last week.        
	With prices set to rise, the RBI is likely to make borrowings costlier and take measures to draw more money out of the system in its April 20 policy.        
	To tame inflation, the RBI could hike repo, reverse repo and CRR (cash reserve ratio) by 25 basis points each in April, Kaur said.        
	The RBI raised key short term lending and borrowing (repo and reverse repo) rates by 25 basis points each to 5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively, to check inflation from spreading to non-food items.        
	The central bank will continue its exit from a monetary stimulus policy to check high inflation and ensure sustainable growth, RBI governor D. Subbarao has said.

          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, May 19: Telecom operators will need to raise between Rs 337 crore and Rs 12,300 crore to pay for the high-speed third generation (3G) spectrum won through an online auction.        
	The auction, which ended today, will see the seven winning players pay a total of Rs 50,987 crore to the government as spectrum price within the next 10 days.         
	Bharti will pay Rs 12,295.46 crore for 13 circles, Vodafone will shell out Rs 11,617.86 crore for nine circles, and R-Com is expected to pay Rs 8,585.04 crore for 13 circles.        
	Aircel, which also won 13 circles (in cluding Tier II and Tier III cities), will pay Rs 6,499.46 crore, Idea will have to fork out Rs 5,768.59 crore for 11 circles, Tata Tele Rs 5,864.29 crore for nine circles and STel Rs 337.67 crore for three circles.         
	While the payout for spectrum may create a significant strain on the companies resources, mobile operators said they were willing to take on additional debt or dilution of stake for assets that would provide long term returns.        
	Bharti Airtel might have to leverage up to 31 per cent of this years revenues, while Idea Cellular could end up shelling out 46.3 per cent of its revenues in 2009-10. Reliance will have to pay around 38.6 per cent of its current years revenues.        
	The private operators said the total cost of 3G for them would come to Rs 85,000 crore, under the assumption that they would have to invest Rs 5,000 crore each in rollouts.        
	Most operators said they had tied up the funds required for the upfront payment as well as the rollouts.        
	Tata Teleservices, for instance, has received board approval to raise more than Rs 8,500 crore for the 3G auction. Banking sources said Bharti was going to raise over Rs 7,500 crore though a combination of domestic debt and external commercial borrowings (ECBs).        
	The government had recently increased the cap on ECBs to $40 billion from $35 billion for 2010-11. It has also permitted telecom companies to raise short-term loans from the domestic market, which can be refinanced with ECBs in 12 months to enable them to quickly tie up funds.        
	For the operators it is a large sum of money that has to be paid out. We have to see how these services are priced and received by the subscribers and how it will impact their profitability, said Sudipto Basu, a telecom analyst.        
	With the price for a pan-India presence touching Rs 16,751 crore, the payout could have been higher. However, all operators selected a few strategically important circles to bid aggressively leaving out the other circles.         
	There are nearly half a billion mobile phone subscribers in the country.         
	However, there is limited scope for operators to deliver high speed voice and data services.

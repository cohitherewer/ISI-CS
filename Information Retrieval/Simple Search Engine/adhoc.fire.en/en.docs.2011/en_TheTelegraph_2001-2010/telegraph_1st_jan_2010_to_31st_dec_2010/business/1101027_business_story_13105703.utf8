The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | In-house answer to cashless chaos

          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                           Fresh dose                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 26: Spooked by the dispute over cashless health policies, insurers are moving away from third party administrators (TPAs) and setting up in-house cells to control and monitor claims and costs in a better way.         
	Future Generali India Insurance today launched Future Generali Health (FGH)  an in-house cell for servicing health insurance clients.         
	All health insurance policies issued from November 1 will be serviced directly through FGH, which will gradually replace the TPAs, said R. Deshpande, head (health insurance), Future Generali India Insurance Company.        
	Our experience with TPAs was not good. Health is a growing line of business and we want to increase our market share in this segment, chief executive officer K.G. Krishnamoorthy Rao said.         
	To begin with, FGH will enter into pacts with 1,000 hospitals on tariffs and treatment costs. A direct interaction with policyholders and hospitals will help quick appraisals of claims and payments to hospitals, Deshpande said.         
	In August, four PSU insurers  National Insurance Company, United India Insurance Company, New India Assurance and Oriental Insurance Company  had decided to set up a TPA of their own and gradually do away with outsourcing.        
	We have received 24 expressions of interest from domestic and foreign players interested in picking up a stake in our TPA joint venture, said M. Ramadoss, chairman of New India Assurance.        
	Among private insurers, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company had been managing cashless facility for three years through an in-house cell called Health Administration Team.         
	Last year, ICICI Lombard set up a captive unit to handle claims. Though it still retains ties with some TPAs, it is gradually shifting its business to ICICI Lombard Health Care. While outsourcing is an efficient model, insurers have not been able to control claim expenditure, an official of ICICI Lombard said.        
	The countrys first standalone health insurance firm, Star Health and Allied Insurance Company, has started with a no TPA model.         
	Max Bupa Health Insurance has also done away with TPAs. The company maintains that payment delays by TPAs to hospitals lead to overcharging by the latter.         
	Insurers who are moving away from outsourcing cashless claim management are taking stringent measures to ensure that hospitals dont overcharge.         
	The aim is to bring down the high claim ratio, provide better services and get a control over costs, Deshpande said.         
	Third party administrators, however, feel insurers are snapping ties with TPAs because they want to build their own brands.

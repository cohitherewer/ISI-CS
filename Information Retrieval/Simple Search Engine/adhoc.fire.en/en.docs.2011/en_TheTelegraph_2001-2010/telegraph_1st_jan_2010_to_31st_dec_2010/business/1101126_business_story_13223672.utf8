          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kapil Sibal in Haryana on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: Mobile users in Calcutta will be able to switch service providers without changing their numbers from January, when number portability is available across the country.         
	Mobile number portability (MNP) will be rolled out across India on January 20, 2011, telecom minister Kapil Sibal told reporters while launching number portability in Haryana.        
	While customers can change from GSM to CDMA, portability will be allowed only within a circle for now.        
	There could be some introductory tariff plans for customers changing service providers. High-speed value-added services such as video calls can also be used to lure new customers. Operators could also waive porting charges as an incentive, said an executive of a top operator.        
	Rajat Mukarji, chief corporate affairs officer at Idea Cellular, said the company would consider waiving porting charges and would take a competitive reaction depending on how other players respond.        
	Analysts said porting could marginally reduce tariffs in areas where competition was low such as international roaming and value-added services.        
	Porting process        
	For porting, a subscriber has to send an SMS  PORT Mobile Number  from the number he wishes to be ported, to 1900.        
	The subscriber will receive a unique porting code through an SMS from his current service provider, which has to be quoted in the application form.        
	Porting has to be completed within seven working days. The telecom regulator has fixed a ceiling of Rs 19 as the porting charge, which the new service provider can collect from a subscriber.         
	Post-paid subscribers will have to ensure their last bill has been paid, while for a pre-paid subscriber, any balance amount left will not be carried forward when the number is transferred.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, April 23: Reliance Industries, the countrys largest listed company, disappointed the Street by posting a 30 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 4,710 crore in the quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 3,627 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Analysts expected that gas production at the KG-D6 Basin that commenced last April would boost net profit to over Rs 5,100 crore in the fourth quarter.         
	A lower-than-expected refining margin, however, gouged out the gains from gas production.        
	Turnover for the fourth quarter of 2009-10 stood at Rs 60,267 crore, an increase of 125 per cent over the year-ago figure of Rs 26,793 crore. Numbers for the fourth quarter of 2008-09 have been restated to give effect to the amalgamation of Reliance Petroleum with the company.         
	The company  whose business interests span refining, petrochemicals, oil and gas exploration and retail  saw its turnover surge past Rs 2,00,000 crore for the 2009-10 fiscal, an increase of 37 per cent over the last year. It reported full-year net profits of Rs 16,236 crore, up 6.1 per cent over last years Rs 15, 309 crore.        
	We have completed a transformational year at Reliance, said chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani.         
	We continue to seek growth opportunities within India and globally to accelerate further value creation.        
	Gross refining margins were at $7.5/bbl for the quarter ended March 31 and at $6.6/bbl for the full year. Analysts expected gross refining margins for the quarter to touch $9/bbl on the back of economic recovery.         
	Gas production from KG-D6 has been ramped up to 60 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in nine months after the commencement of gas production from 16 wells.         
	The company has submitted a development plan to the directorate general of hydrocarbons after a series of new discoveries in the southern and deeper areas of the KG D6 block, said the company statement.         
	During the year, RIL through its subsidiary Reliance Marcellus signed a definitive agreement to get into a joint venture with US-based Atlas Energy to develop shale gas acreage in a transaction estimated at $1.7 billion.         
	The statement highlighted RILs performance in the petrochemicals business. The year  was one of the best periods for petrochemicals segment with earning before interest and tax (EBIT) of Rs 8,581 crore on a revenue of Rs 55,251 crore.         
	The EBIT margins were higher because of a base effect of lower revenues, lower depreciation and weakening of the rupee.        
	The company increased its presence in retail and currently operates over 1,000 stores across segments spread over 4.4 million square feet in more than 85 cities.         
	Cash position        
	RIL has cash and cash equivalents of Rs 21,874 crore. The companys stock price that rose for two days prior to the results closed at Rs 1,087 on Friday, an increase of 1.1 per cent over the previous day.

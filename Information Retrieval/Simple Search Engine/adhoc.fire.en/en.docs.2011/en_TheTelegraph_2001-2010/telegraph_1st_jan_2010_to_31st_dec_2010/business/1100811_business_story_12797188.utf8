                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fillip for MCX-SX
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Aug. 10: Bombay High Court today asked the Securities and Exchange Board of India to decide by September 30 on the application filed by MCX Stock Exchange Ltd (MCX-SX) for permission to trade in equities and other instruments.        
	MCX-SX had dragged the market regulator to court last month over delay in permission to launch trading in equities, equity derivatives, interest rate futures, mutual funds and debt instruments.         
	MCX-SX had alleged that the delay occurred despite the promoters bringing down their stakes to 5 per cent each to comply with regulations necessary to launch equity and equity derivatives trading.         
	At present, MCX-SX trades only in currency derivatives. In April, it had sought Sebis permission to expand its operations.         
	The matter came up for hearing in Bombay High Court today. The division bench of Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari has given the market regulator time till September 30 within which it will have to take a decision.         
	The bench also directed Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL) and MCX  the promoters of MCX-SX  to pass within 10 days resolutions declaring they would not go beyond limits prescribed under the MIMPS regulations.         
	The Manner of Increasing and Maintaining Public Shareholding in Recognised Stock Exchanges, Regulations 2006, or MIMPS, deals with the stake that promoters and other entities should have in a stock exchange. Therefore, within 10 days, both the promoters of MCX-SX have to pass resolutions that their shareholding will not cross the 5-per-cent mark.         
	Initially, FTIL and MCX had 51 per cent and 49 per cent stakes, respectively, in MCX-SX. This was brought down to 37 per cent and around 34 per cent in phases last year.         
	In April, both the promoters brought their aggregate stake down to 10 per cent after a capital restructuring programme.

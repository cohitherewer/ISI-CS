The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil ministry presses for price freedom
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Oil ministry presses for price freedom
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Wait amp; Watch                                  
	New Delhi, April 4: The government can take a final call on freeing petrol and diesel prices this month, based on the recommendations of the Kirit Parikh committee.        
	We want the government to accept the Parikh committees recommendation on petrol and diesel and implement it as the budget has not made enough provision for the revenue losses oil companies are suffering, a petroleum ministry official said.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had provided for Rs 3,108 crore towards LPG and kerosene subsidies in the budget, while state-owned oil marketing companies are expected to make a loss of Rs 79,670 crore for selling fuels below cost.         
	However, the official said the government could intervene if global crude price surged as in July 2008 when it touched $147 per barrel.        
	According to the Parikh panels suggestions, the subsidy burden of the government can be maintained at a bearable level if free market pricing of petrol and diesel is allowed along with periodic increases in the prices of cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene.        
	The committee recommended freeing of petrol and diesel prices and increasing kerosene and LPG prices by Rs 6 a litre and Rs 100 per cylinder, respectively, with immediate effect.        
	Analysts said the time was right for the government to implement the recommendations as the arrival of the winter crop would bring down inflation, while the rise in global crude price was marginal.         
	The recommendations should be implemented with long-term objectives, professor N. R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy said.        
	 A finance ministry official said the government did not intend to increase the subsidy on LPG and kerosene as it could widen the fiscal deficit.        
	However, the panels suggestions could face political opposition. The excise duty announced in the budget proposal for petroleum products prompted UPA allies  the Trinamool Congress and DMK  to join ranks with the Opposition in demanding its rollback.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New prescription to settle mediclaim
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      New prescription to settle mediclaim
          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                                            
	Calcutta, Aug. 24: Four PSU general insurance firms  National Insurance Company, United Insurance Company, New India Assurance and Oriental Insurance Company  have decided to set up an entity to administer and manage claims in a better way, following the dispute over cashless mediclaim facility.         
	The new company is expected to start operations next June.        
	A week ago, General Insurers (Public Sector) Association of India (Gipsa)  the voluntary co-ordinating body for the four general insurers  had invited proposals to select a joint venture partner to set up a third party administrator (TPA) to manage health insurance claims. The partner will be offered up to a 26 per cent equity stake in the new company, Gipsa CEO A.K. Singhal said. The company will be formed with a capital base of Rs 200 crore.        
	Though there are 21 non-life insurance firms in the domestic market, the four PSU insurers account for 60 per cent of the market share in the health business.         
	In the non-life insurance business, health is the second largest segment after motor with an annual premium collection of Rs 8,305 crore (in 2009-10). The collection is expected to double in the next five years, growing at an annual compounded rate of 25 per cent.        
	Health insurance is a loss- making business, particularly for the PSU insurers because of a high claim ratio. The average claim ratio is more than 100 per cent, which means that insurers pay more than Rs 100 as claim against every Rs 100 they receive as premium.        
	We are hopeful that the new company will redefine the TPA services in the country, said a senior official of New India Assurance Company.        
	However, no official confirmation could be obtained on whether the PSU insurers would retain their existing TPA tie-ups after the formation of their own company.         
	The new firm will provide all health insurance-related services, including claim settlements to Gipsa member companies. It will also provide TPA services to other insurers, the official said.        
	Many private sector non-life insurers such as Bajaj Allianz and ICICI Lombard have already done away with their existing TPA network and manage claims themselves.         
	The joint venture partner will be selected on strict parameters and it could be a foreign or domestic firm, he said.         
	The selection criterion as laid down in the proposal for the expression of interest (EoI) states that the applicant should have a minimum five years experience in health insurance services, including claim management.         
	The company must have handled at least five lakh claim settlements in the last three years preceding the date of submission of the EoI and the applicant or its parent firm should have a net worth of at least Rs 250 crore, the proposal said.         
	Besides, the partner cannot sell or transfer its stake in the company before seven years.        
	According to the proposal, 50-75 per cent of the health insurance premium of Gipsa member firms will be transferred to the joint venture by the third year of its operation and 75-100 per cent by the fifth year.

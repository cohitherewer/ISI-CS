	New Delhi, April 5: Further talks with Asean on the opening up of trade in services are expected soon.        
	The second round of negotiations is going to begin soon, commerce minister Anand Sharma said on the sidelines of an Assocham seminar here. The free trade talks with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) will also cover investment.        
	Last month, senior officials from India and Asean had met in Bali. The two sides are hoping to conclude the negotiations by August.        
	India and some key Asean members such as Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand have already begun free trade in goods from January.        
	Service is of key interest to India as it contributes over 55 per cent to its gross domestic product.         
	The sector is also important for export earnings. The country wants to expand trade with Asean in services such as banking, insurance, health, accountancy, architecture and engineering.        
	Both sides are also discussing to recognise each others educational degrees. The two sides aim to increase their $44-billion trade to $50 billion by the end of 2010.        
	The Asean countries are Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.        
	FDI in banks        
	Sharma today said there were no plans to tweak the FDI policy for the sake of banks.         
	As of now, the policy which is there is doing very well, said Sharma. Last year, the government had stipulated that a company majority owned or controlled by foreigners would be considered as a foreign company.         
	The entire investments made by the company in any other entity will be treated as foreign holding irrespective of the stakes held by Indian shareholders.        
	Following the rules announced in February last year, seven Indian private banks, including ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, became foreign entities as the majority shareholding lay with overseas investors, though the banks were controlled by Indians.         
	There were demands to change the policy for banks. Sharmas comments, however, imply that a rule change is unlikely.

	Mumbai, June 4: Hindalco Industries has posted an eight-fold increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 3,925 crore in 2009-10 against Rs 483.9 crore in the previous year.         
	Profit during the year jumped because of accounting adjustments. The company said profit before depreciation, interest and tax (PBDIT) soared to a record level of Rs 10,069 crore from Rs 3,661 crore in 2008-09.         
	This includes $578 million of unrealised gains consisting of $504 million reversal of previously recognised losses upon settlement of derivatives and $74 million of unrealised gains relating to mark to market adjustments on metals and currency derivatives at Novelis, said a media release.         
	Consolidated net sales declined 7.9 per cent to Rs 60,722.1 crore from Rs 65,963 crore in 2008-09. Consolidated revenues were lower at Rs 60,772 crore mainly due to lower aluminium prices and softness in the companys end markets in the first half of the year, especially for Novelis.         
	Novelis, a US-based aluminium maker that the company acquired in 2007 for $6 billion, saw net sales for the 2009-10 fiscal fall 15 per cent to $8.7 billion from $10.2 billion in the previous year.         
	Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for Novelis were $754 million, a 55 per cent rise from adjusted EBITDA of $486 million for the same period a year ago as the company focused on cost cutting and restructuring.

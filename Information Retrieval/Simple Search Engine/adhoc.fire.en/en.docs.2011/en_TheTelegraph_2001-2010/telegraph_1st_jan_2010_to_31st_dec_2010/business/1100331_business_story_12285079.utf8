	Calcutta, March 30: Riga Sugar Company is targeting a turnover of Rs 100 crore in 2009-2010 (October-September).        
	We expect the turnover to be about Rs 150 crore in 2010-11 as we will increase our production by 60 per cent, .P. Dhanuka, chairman and managing director of Riga Sugar, said here today.        
	Riga Sugar, which has a crushing capacity of 75,000 tonnes annually, has crushed 20,000 tonnes of sugarcane in the current year.         
	The company has posted Rs 80 crore turnover in the last financial year.         
	It had earlier undertaken an expansion-cum-diversification programme at Sitamarhi in Bihar, raising capacity to 5,000 tonnes crushed per day (tcd) from 3,500 tcd.         
	Dhanuka said the company also planned to ramp up its power generation capacity by 25MW from the present 8MW at its co-generation power plant.         
	Going by the thumb rule we will be investing around Rs 100 crore for this expansion. Installation will be done in 2012-13, he added. The company is yet to finalise the funding pattern of the project.         
	Meanwhile, the Indian Sugar Mills Association today demanded the reimposition of import duty on sugar to maintain adequate availability and price stability.        
	Dhanuka, who is the associations committee member and former president, said that production in the coming season would be adequate and it was estimated that during 2010-11 sugar availability would be around 299 lakh tonne.         
	Imports would be a modest 20 lakh tonne, while production would be at 240 lakh tonnes.

	BK Birla group-owned Jayshree Tea amp; Industries will acquire Bihar-based sugar company MP Chini Industries for Rs 112.50 crore. The acquisition will be funded through a mix of internal accruals and debt.

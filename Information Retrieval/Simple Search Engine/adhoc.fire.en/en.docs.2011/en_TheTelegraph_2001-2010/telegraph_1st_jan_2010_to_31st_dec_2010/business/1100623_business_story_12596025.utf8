The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ambanis discuss pact with Deora
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ambanis discuss pact with Deora
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anil: Urgent task                                  
	New Delhi, June 22: The Ambanis have begun consultations with the petroleum ministry to finalise a gas deal, with a Supreme Court deadline for a new pact round the corner.        
	Anil Ambani and RIL executive director P.M.S. Prasad today separately met petroleum minister Murli Deora.        
	The apex court had given both sides six weeks to renegotiate and another eight weeks to finalise a new gas sales agreement according to the rules set by the government, including an approved price of $4.2 per million British thermal unit.         
	On May 7, the court had ruled that the government was the legal owner of the gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin and had the authority to allocate gas and decide its prices.        
	Ambani and Prasad refused to take questions from reporters after their meetings with Deora. Oil secretary S. Sundareshan was present.        
	Deora said, I have nothing to speak on this (meeting). I have known (Anil) for many years and he just came to see me, nothing more.        
	Officials in the ministry said gas allocations would be done strictly in line with the approved policy and subject to availability. The gas utilisation policy, they said, does not provide for reservation of the fuel for anyone and allocation of the fuel to new plants, including those of Anils, will be considered when they are ready to start operations.

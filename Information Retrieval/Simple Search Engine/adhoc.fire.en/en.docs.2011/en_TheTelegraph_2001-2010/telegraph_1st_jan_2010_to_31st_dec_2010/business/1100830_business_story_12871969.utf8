The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Funds spanner in highway ambition

          SEETHA                                        Montek Singh Ahluwalia,   Deputy chairman of  Planning Commission       
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: The funds available for the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2012-17) will determine the pace of development of the countrys road programme.         
	We have said that we cant set long-term targets without looking at the resource position for the Twelfth Plan, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia told The Telegraph.         
	The plan panel is also concerned about how the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will fund its ambitious road programme. We are working on what is a sustainable financing plan for the NHAI, Ahluwalia said.        
	Of late, there has been tension between the Planning Commission and the ministry of road transport and highways, with the latter alleging lack of support from the plan panel in meeting its target of 20 km of roads per day.        
	Ahluwalia said the resource requirement for the 20-km-a-day plan depended on the period over which the target was to be achieved. If there are resource constraints because of demands from other priority sectors, the target will have to be restructured.        
	For 2010-11, the Planning Commission and the ministry have agreed on giving out contracts for 9,000 km of roads, a step up from 1,300 km two years earlier and 3,300 km in 2009-10. Setting more ambitious targets will depend on the resources in the Twelfth Plan, Ahluwalia said.         
	He said the problem of financing was worsened by annuity-based schemes.         
	The traditional engineering, procurement and construction method involved an upfront payment by the government to the contractor.         
	Under the annuity-based scheme, the private player meets the construction cost as well as the expenditure on annual maintenance and recovers the investment in installments spread over 15 years from the government after the construction is completed, which can take two to three years from the time the project is approved.         
	The unique thing is that we are entering into contracts that lead to expenditure four years down the road and do not show up in the next three budgets, Ahluwalia said. Given all the contracts that have been agreed to, this adds up to a very big payment.        
	The NHAI, which will have to make the payment, can borrow the money but the issue is whether it can do so on its own or it will need government guarantee, he said.         
	We are very clear that they should indicate to us whats the money they can raise on their own strength and if that is plausible we can give a go-ahead. But my guess is that the very high targets that they have in mind are going to be feasible if the NHAI gets government guarantee.         
	That, he concedes, cannot be decided by the Planning Commission as it is the prerogative of the finance ministry. My understanding is that the finance ministry is not in favour of giving government guarantees.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Guidelines for MF distributors
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Guidelines for MF distributors
                            
	Mumbai, May 3 (PTI): Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave today said the market watchdog would soon come out with a new set of guidelines for mutual fund distributors.        
	Guidelines for mutual fund distributors are on the anvil. We are looking at how to address the question of MF distributors because they are very large in number, Bhave told reporters on the sidelines of the launch of phase II of Indian Banks ASBA (application supported by blocked amount) scheme here today.        
	Last August, Sebi banned fund houses from charging investors entry loads, which was used to remunerate distributors.        
	We require a little more thinking on our part before we come out with guidelines, Bhave added.        
	On the Ulip issue, Bhave said, We have to wait for what the judiciary decides. We are talking with Irda over the issue.        
	Bhave said the ASBA facility had already brought down refund-related investor complaints. About 20 per cent of investors use ASBA now.

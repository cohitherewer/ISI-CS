                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cairn panel to vet deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Gammell: Expert opinion                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 15: Cairn India Ltd has formed a two-member committee that will look into the open offer made by the Vedanta group to the minority shareholders of the oil exploration company.        
	The two members on the panel are Omkar Goswami and Edward Story, non-executive independent directors on Cairn Indias board. While Goswami is a corporate governance expert, Story is an oil industry veteran who heads the LSE-listed SOCO International.         
	Cairn Energy chairman Bill Gammell told reporters here today that the panel would look into the interests of minority shareholders, who have slammed the Rs 50 disparity in the buyout price for the shares owned by the Dublin-based parent and the open offer price.        
	Last month, Vedanta group had announced that it would acquire 51-60 per cent of Cairn India for a consideration of $8.5 billion to $9.6 billion in cash.        
	Under the terms of the deal, Sesa Goa  an Anil Agarwal group company  plans to make an open offer to acquire 20 per cent of Cairn India from its minority shareholders.        
	Vedanta had offered to buy the Cairn Energy shares in its local outfit at a price of Rs 405 per share, which included a non-compete fee of Rs 50 per share.        
	However, the open offer price to minority shareholders was capped at Rs 355 per share. Capital market regulator Sebi has still to clear the open offer price.        
	Gammell hinted that minority shareholders of the company could air their views on the differential pricing with this panel. However, the Cairn India chief said it was for Vedanta to decide on the open offer price.        
	Even though Cairn India shareholders are miffed by the lowball price, company law experts say the Anil Agarwal firm isnt short changing minority shareholders since the Sebi rules allow 20 per cent of the share price to be paid as a non-compete fee. In this case, the non-compete fee works to only 14 per cent of the offer price.        
	Earlier, addressing shareholders at the Cairn India AGM, Gammell said the Mangala oilfield in Rajasthan had the potential to produce 150,000 barrels of oil per day, up from 125,000 barrels per day at present.

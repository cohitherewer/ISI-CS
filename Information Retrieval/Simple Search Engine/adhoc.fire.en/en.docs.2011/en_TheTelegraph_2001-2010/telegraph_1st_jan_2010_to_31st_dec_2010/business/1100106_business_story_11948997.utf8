          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with industrialists in New Delhi on Tuesday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: Industry captains today lobbied for the continuation of the fiscal stimulus packages at their pre-budget meeting with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and his team.        
	They argued that the revitalisers, given a year ago to protect industry from a global slump, were necessary to sustain growth which had just started picking up.         
	Though India has rebounded from recession, the industrialists said the performance had been uneven, with growth higher in sectors such as automobiles that had benefited from the stimulus. At the same time, many segments have not done well.         
	The economy grew at a healthy rate of 7.9 per cent in the second quarter (July-September), fuelling apprehensions about a possible withdrawal of the benefits. Many believe the government will try to contain the fiscal deficit, which is targeted to rise to a massive Rs 4,00,000 crore, or 6.8 per cent of GDP, by the end of this fiscal.         
	Ficci president Harsh Pati Singhania said the government should continue with the sops to sustain the growth impulses in the economy. It should also avoid any tightening of the monetary policy to contain food inflation.        
	If the policy-makers adopted a tough posture it would derail the growth process and adversely impact the industrial sector.        
	Besides, Singhania said, while announcements are made, real investment activity is still not there to the extent desired.        
	Tata group chairman Ratan Tata also spoke for stimulus. Obviously, I have great self interest in saying it should not be (withdrawn) because buoyancy in the market, which is somewhat a barometer also of the economy, has been stimulated greatly with the incentives that have been given, he said at the auto expo.        
	Certainly, I would not be a party to say they (the stimulus packages) should be withdrawn, Tata added.        
	Assocham president Swati Piramal said the government should stick to the packages in the next fiscal and then withdraw them gradually.        
	She said, Withdrawal of stimulus could be counter-productive to recovery.        
	Fiscal deficit is not only the governments headache but it also affects Indian industry and one way out to contain it could be through an expeditious divestment process, Piramal said.        
	Mukherjee had earlier said the sops would not be withdrawn before the budget. However, some policy-makers want them to be withdrawn for sectors that have rebounded.        
	The proposed direct tax code also figured in todays meeting. Industry captains specifically objected to the minimum alternate tax on gross assets instead of book profit. At present, companies pay 15 per cent MAT on book profits.         
	Besides the presidents of industry associations, industrialists present at the meeting included Anand Mahindra of the Mahindra group, Venugopal Dhoot of Videocon and Tulsi Tanti of Suzlon Energy.        
	As part of a customary exercise to elicit the views of different interest groups on the budget, the finance minister will also be meeting economists, agriculturists, consumer activists and trade unions.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, meanwhile, will meet Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and other members tomorrow to take stock of the economy and discuss steps to check food prices.        
	Ministry post        
	Tamil Nadu cadre IAS officer R. Gopalan has joined the finance ministry as secretary, financial services.        
	Gopalan, a 1976 batch officer, was earlier special secretary, ministry of commerce and industry.

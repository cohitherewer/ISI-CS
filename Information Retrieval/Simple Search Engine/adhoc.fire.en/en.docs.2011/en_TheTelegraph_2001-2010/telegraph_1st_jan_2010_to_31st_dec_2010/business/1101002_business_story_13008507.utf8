The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | L amp;T close to Satyam exit
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      L amp;T close to Satyam exit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: Engineering major Larsen amp; Toubro has sold more than half of its stake in Mahindra Satyam, fuelling speculation of an exit.        
	On Wednesday, Mahindra Satyam came out with restated numbers after an exhaustive audit dating back to 2002.        
	L amp;T, which lost the race for scam-hit Satyam to the Mahindras in early 2009, has reduced its stake by 2.42 per cent in the IT company.        
	In a regulatory disclosure today, Satyam said L amp;T had sold 2.84 crore shares in the open market, earning Rs 294 crore. It now holds 2.16 per cent in Satyam.        
	L amp;T trimmed its stake in small tranches between September 15 and September 28. The results were announced on September 29.        
	Satyam ended a two-year suspense over its financial health on Wednesday when it announced a loss of Rs 125 crore for the period ended 2009-10, recovering from a huge loss of over Rs 8,000 crore in the previous fiscal.        
	The Satyam stock had tanked nearly 10 per cent since the company announced its results.         
	The scrip recovered Rs 1.10, or 1.22 per cent, to close at Rs 91.20 on the BSE today.        
	L amp;T sources said the engineering company would ultimately exit Satyam since it was no longer a strategic investment.        
	The timing will depend on the stock price. L amp;Ts average cost of acquisition was Rs 81 a share. It sold stocks in the current tranches at an average price of Rs 103.5, gaining around 27 per cent in less than two years.        
	L amp;T had built a stake in Satyam with the hope of acquiring the company after the fraud by erstwhile promoter B. Ramalinga Raju came out in the open.        
	L amp;Ts stake in Satyam had reached a peak of 12.04 per cent before it was forced to enter into competitive bidding where the Mahindras were the winner.         
	The Mahindras had bid for Rs 58 a share for Satyams 31 per cent stake on sale; L amp;T offered Rs 49 apiece.                                
	put to bid by a board appointed by the Centre beating L amp;T which offered Rs 49 a share.        
	Since then the engineering major has been paring stake in tranches in Satyam.        
	After Raju admitted the fraud in January 2009, the Centre pulled up its socks to help the IT firm.

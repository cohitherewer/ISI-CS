The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | HSBC go-slow on retail
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      HSBC go-slow on retail
                              Kidwai: Strategy tweak                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 25 (PTI): HSBC India will go slow on retail and credit card businesses as it wants to focus on global banking, investment banking, wealth management, insurance and mortgages.        
	We will not chase retail customers till we turn around our loss-making retail lending and credit card businesses. We hope to do so by the end of the year, HSBC India Group general manager and country head Naina Lal Kidwai said.        
	Last month, HSBC had clinched a deal to acquire the retail and commercial banking businesses of the Royal Bank of Scotland in India. RBSs 31 branches along with 1.1 million customers were expected to give HSBC greater exposure to the Indian market.        
	HSBC wont go after customers to sell our retail banking or credit card products as that will impact the quality of our services, besides increasing our risk portfolio, Kidwai said.        
	On whether the bank was planning to exit the credit card business, she said, There is no such plan as weve a customer base of 1.5 million even today. The RBS acquisition was the third major deal for HSBC in India. Explaining the reason for this go-slow approach, she said, Our rapid expansion in the past has led to the growth of some riskier assets and we dont want to grow that way.        
	New MD        
	HSBC has appointed Chetan Patni as the managing director, head of execution and sales trading, in India. Patni will be jointly responsible for HSBCs Indian equities business with Haresh Shivdasani, managing director, head of equities. He will report to Rakesh Patel, MD, head of equity sales and trading, Asia-Pacific.

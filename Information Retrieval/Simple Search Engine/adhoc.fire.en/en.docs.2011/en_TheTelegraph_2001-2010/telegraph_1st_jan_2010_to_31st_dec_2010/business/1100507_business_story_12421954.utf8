The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Greece fears fell US stocks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Greece fears fell US stocks
          CHRISTINE HAUSER                               
	New York, May 6: The market decline today turned into a freefall, with major indices tumbling more than 8 per cent in afternoon trading before recovering some of the losses. The euro declined more than 2 per cent.         
	In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.8 per cent, or 996 points. The Standard amp; Poors 500-stock index was down 90 points, or 7.73 per cent, and the Nasdaq was down 175 points, or 7.2 per cent.         
	Investors took in the latest reports in the United States on jobless filings, retail sales and productivity, and then turned their attention to Europe and the concerns that Greeces debt problems might spread.         
	The uncertainty pushed the euro to its lowest level in 14 months at $1.25 to the dollar. The dollars rise sent prices of commodities lower. Crude oil fell 6.7 per cent to $74.58 per barrel.         
	Europes debt worries continued to play out, both on the streets and in legislative chambers.         
	Greek lawmakers late Thursday approved a crucial austerity bill needed to tap into a $141.9-billion aid package from the 15 other countries that use the euro and the International Monetary Fund.         
	German lawmakers were expected to vote on Friday on Berlins 22.4-billion-euro share of the bailout package.         
	The Greek government needs $11.6 billion by May 19 to cover debt payments. But a resolution of its problems is considered only a temporary fix  similar issues are looming for Spain and Portugal. Both had their debt ratings downgraded in recent days.         
	I think it is the same thing that has been influencing the markets in the past two weeks or more, the situation in Europe, said Bruce Bittles, the chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird amp; Company, said. There is a lot of fear entering the market, people are taking protective action.         
	In London, the FTSE 100 was down 1.5 per cent, the DAX in Frankfurt dropped 0.84 per cent while the CAC-40 in Paris dropped 2.2 per cent.         
	All the rallies to this point have flunked, Bittles said. So that eventually causes people that had loaded up on the rallies to come out. I just think this is a situation where fear is building and mounting and people are selling.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 26: The Bengal Assembly today passed the West Bengal Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill (FRBM), 2010, which will be sent to the governor for his assent.        
	It has been felt necessary to frame the FRBM legislation to get the benefits of the Centres debt consolidation and debt relief scheme, Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta said. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has recommended that the facility of debt consolidation and relief be extended to loans from the National Small Savings Funds (NSSF) on the condition that the state enacts the FRBM legislation. According to him, Bengal has been the largest borrower from the NSSF.         
	We decided to enact the legislation ensuring prudence in fiscal management by eliminating revenue and fiscal deficits, he said. After the implementation of the FRBM act, the state government will have to reduce the revenue deficit to zero and fiscal deficit to 3 per cent by March 31, 2014.         
	It is estimated that by March 31, 2011, our revenue deficit will be 3.47 per cent of the state GDP and fiscal deficit will be 4.71 per cent, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt coffer awaits a telecom treat

          JAYATI GHOSE                           Upward curve                                  
	New Delhi, March 1: The government is likely to earn over Rs 60,000 crore as revenue from the telecom sector in 2010-11, a 20 per cent increase from its budget estimates, because of the sale of 3G spectrum and an increased fee for spectrum use.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had estimated a revenue mop-up from telecom for fiscal 2010-11 at Rs 49,799.55 crore.         
	The auction of high-speed third-generation (3G) services is set to garner at least Rs 35,000 crore, while spectrum charges and annual licence fees will bring in an additional 22,000 crore, said telecom ministry officials.         
	Last week, after the budget, the department of telecom hiked spectrum charges for second generation (2G) service providers by over 50 per cent, which will bring in Rs 4,000 crore to the government kitty.         
	Telecom service providers pay between 2 per cent and 6 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) to the government as spectrum charge, over and above the spectrum auction price and the applicable licence fee. The spectrum charge depends on the amount of spectrum each operator has in each of the circles. The new charges vary between 3 per cent and 8 per cent, depending upon the amount of spectrum.         
	According to the new rule, the DoT said a GSM operator holding spectrum up to 4.4MHz would be paying 3 per cent of AGR against 2 per cent now, while a CDMA operator with spectrum up to 5MHz would have to pay 3 per cent of AGR against 2 per cent paid currently.         
	Operators now pay around Rs 2,800 crore a year towards spectrum charges. The figure could go up to around Rs 6,000 crore under the new slabs.         
	DoT officials said mobile operators offering only 3G services would be liable to pay a flat 3 per cent of AGR. In case of mobile phone service providers offering 2G services and looking to offer 3G, there would be no additional charge as they would already be paying a higher levy after the hike in spectrum-linked fees.         
	Analysts expect a pan-India 3G licence to cost Rs 4,630-6,945 crore for operators, while rolling out the high- speed network can cost billions of dollars more.         
	The 3G auction is set to start from April 9, 2010.

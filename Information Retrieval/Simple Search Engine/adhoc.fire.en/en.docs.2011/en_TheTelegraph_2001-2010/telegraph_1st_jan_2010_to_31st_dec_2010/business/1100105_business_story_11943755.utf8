          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 4: JSW Energy sparkled on listing today, dispelling some of the edginess that had crept into the market for new issues last year.        
	On its first day of listing, the power producer closed at Rs 100.75 on the BSE, a slight gain over its offer price of Rs 100 per share.         
	The scrip had opened at Rs 102 and surged to a high of Rs 106.40 before investors scooped out some of the gains. It dipped below its issue price at one time but clawed back at the close.        
	Investors in the new issues of power companies have been ruing their investments. JSW Energys good showing on debut did not rub off on its peers. For instance, NHPC ended at Rs 35.30, still adrift from its issue price of Rs 36 per share. Adani Power closed at Rs 99.10, still a wee bit short of its issue price of Rs 100 per share.        
	JSW Energy has an operational capacity of 995MW and is planning to establish projects with a capacity of 2,655 MW. The company has 7,740MW projects in an early stage of development.        
	Brokerages like Angel Broking are optimistic about over the companys prospects.         
	A major portion of JSW Energys upcoming capacities is expected to be operational by 2010-11 thereby providing near-term visibilityThus, a robust portfolio and near-term Revenue visibility is a major positive for the company, the brokerage said in a recent note.        
	Proceeds from the Rs 2700 crore IPO will be used to increase generation capacity to 11,390 MW by 2015 and finance other mining and transmission projects.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rocklands snubs Jindals
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Rocklands snubs Jindals
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 3: Australian coking coal company Rocklands Richfield has terminated takeover talks with Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL).        
	The Aussie firm informed its shareholders that the Jindal offer was not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.         
	The development follows a set of tough terms that Naveen Jindals company had placed before Rocklands last week. The conditions included certain rights in the firm based on JSPLs shareholding.        
	Market observers had said it was improbable that the Rocklands management would accept the terms.        
	For instance, Jindal had demanded the Chinese operations of the firm be handed over to the Indian company when its shareholding touched 19.9 per cent.        
	The two metallurgical coke plants in China are the biggest assets of Rocklands, besides some coking coal exploration blocks in Australia.        
	It is unlikely that Rocklands will relinquish control for only 19.9 per cent, market observers said.         
	Moreover, why would the management give preference shares to Jindal at a lower price than what the Indian company was ready to pay? they asked.        
	JSPL wanted a preference allotment at Aus$0.42 per share, while it agreed to buy all outstanding shares of Rocklands at Aus$0.56 per share.        
	The coal and coke producers shares plummeted 25 per cent today to a seven-month low after the news broke.        
	JSPL began courting the Aussie company, which is majority owned by Chinese entrepreneur Benny Wu, after buying a stake from him at Aus$0.42 per share. The Rocklands stock today traded at Aus$0.22.        
	About four weeks ago, its shares had jumped to Aus$0.45 as Jindal and a rival Chinese group, Meijin, were competing to buy the company.        
	JSPL holds a 13.6 per cent stake in the coal company. It had demanded a board berth on the strength of this stake.        
	In a statement, Wu said talking to Jindal was no longer in shareholders interests. RCI (Rocklands) is disappointed that the negotiations with Jindal have not resulted in RCI being in a position where it is able to submit to its shareholders a formal takeover proposal.        
	There was no mention of the competing Chinese offer in the statement.        
	Incidentally, the Indian company had cut its stake in Rocklands during the December-January period, raising questions about its intention.        
	Last week, it confirmed its interest in Rocklands but also laid down tough terms that many believed were beyond negotiation.         
	Industry observers said Jindal Steel moved with extreme caution even as it was eager to secure coking coal for its domestic steel business.         
	JSPL is believed to be looking at other targets in Australia.

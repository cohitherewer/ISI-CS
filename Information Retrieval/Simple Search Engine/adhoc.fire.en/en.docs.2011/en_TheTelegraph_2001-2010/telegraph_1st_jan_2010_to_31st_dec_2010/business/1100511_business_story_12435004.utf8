	Mumbai, May 10: The stocks of both Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Power ended in the green today, but Reliance Natural Resources (RNRL) continued to remain under pressure.         
	On the BSE today, Reliance Infrastructure rose nearly 8.50 per cent, or Rs 83.15, to close at Rs 1,062.85. The RPower scrip rose 6.28 per cent to finish at Rs 148.90.         
	It was a relief rally in these two counters. One has to see whether it is sustained. However, this will depend entirely on news flow relating to negotiations between the two groups (Ambani brothers) and the Dadri power project, an analyst with a leading brokerage said.         
	However, the RNRL scrip fell nearly 5 per cent to Rs 50.15. Market experts said the near-term outlook of the stock was not positive as there were apprehensions that it might turn into a shell company as a result of the Supreme Court verdict.

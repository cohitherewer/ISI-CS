          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Chawla: Dispelling doubts                          
	Mumbai, March 26: Finance secretary Ashok Chawla today said only a few banks and financial institutions would be permitted to float infrastructure bonds laced with tax benefits, clearing up a confusion created by an earlier announcement that seemed to indicate that private companies would be able to jump on to the gravy train.        
	Money raised from infrastructure bonds will be used to fund large highway and power projects. In the Budget for 2010-11, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had announced tax breaks for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds of up to Rs 20,000. Investment in these bonds were kept outside the ambit of the Rs 1 lakh ceiling on tax deductions that individual taxpayers can claim on a variety of investment instruments.        
	At an infrastructure summit recently, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said that the Centre was planning to increase the investment target in infrastructure sector to more than $1 trillion in the 12th Five Year Plan from $500 billion in the 11th Plan. The finance minister, who was present on that occasion, had added that private entities would be allowed to float infrastructure bonds.        
	Clarifying Mukherjees statement, Ashok Chawla, who was in the city to attend the meeting of the high level coordination committee on financial markets, said infrastructure bonds could only be issued by certain banks and financial institutions and not by private companies.         
	He added that banks or financial institutions could issue such bonds for raising money for lending to the infrastructure sector both from the private and public sector.        
	There is a some amount of misunderstanding... What is being proposed is there will be financial entities or banks that will be authorised to issue bonds for raising money for lending for infrastructure activity, Chawla said.        
	Money raised by the banks through infrastructure bonds will be lent to both private and public entities, Chawla said.        
	Earlier, Reserve Bank of India governor Duvvuri Subbarao chaired the meeting of the high level coordination committee.         
	Others who attended the meeting included R. Gopalan, secretary in the department of financial services; Kaushik Basu, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry, Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave, J. Hari Narayan, chairman of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA); and G.C. Chaturvedi, chairman of the PFRDA.                                 
	The meeting deliberated on issues relating to the development of the corporate debt market, the budget announcements on Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) and the financial sector legislative reforms commission (FSLRC), the report of the committee on investor awareness and protection and other inter-regulatory matters.

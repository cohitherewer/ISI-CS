The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Board seal on R-Com stake sale 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Board seal on R-Com stake sale 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, June 6: The board of Reliance Communications (R-Com) has cleared plans to sell a 26 per cent stake in the Rs 21,496-crore telecom company to a strategic partner at an appropriate premium to the stocks market value.         
	The board has also permitted the management of the Anil Ambani-run company to examine and pursue other appropriate strategic combination/consolidation opportunities.         
	The company announced the boards approval through a press release issued on Sunday, but it wasnt immediately clear when the directors had met. No meeting of the board had been scheduled over the weekend.         
	The open-ended approval from the board comes even as Anil Ambani heads on Monday to Johannesburg where he is expected to meet top officials of MTN, South Africas leading telecom player with whom he had initiated talks on a possible merger in May 2008.         
	Last Wednesday, R-Com had informed the stock exchanges that it had received proposals from international telecom players evincing an interest in picking up a strategic stake in the company.         
	R-Com is the only private telecom player that doesnt have a strategic foreign partner.         
	The need for one has grown acute after R-Com bid Rs 8,585 crore for 3G licences in 13 circles at a recent auction.         
	The talks with MTN had foundered the last time after elder brother Mukesh had scuppered the deal by threatening to invoke a first right of refusal on any stake sale that was enshrined in a non-compete agreement between the brothers. The two warring brothers signalled a truce late last month.        
	 The R-Com stock has been riding high since the truce and closed at Rs 168.55 on the National Stock Exchange last Friday. The stock has run up over 38 per cent since it hit this years low of Rs 131.50 on May 21.         
	Two suitors         
	In the past week, speculation has centred on two suitors  Abu Dhabi-based Etisalat Emirates Telecommunications Corp and Johannesburg-based MTN.         
	The open-ended approval from the board to explore both options  a straight stake sale at a premium valuation as well as a strategic combination/consolidation  helps confirm the identities of the two suitors.         
	Any deal with Etisalat  which many consider to be the stronger contender  will involve a straight stake sale.         
	Etisalat already has a 26 per cent stake in Etisalat DB Telecom (formerly Swan Telecom), a relative newbie in the telecom world.         
	 It may have to sell its stake in Etisalat DB Telecom since the rules do not allow any entity to hold more than 10 per cent in a second telecom company operating in the same circle.         
	Anil Ambani and his associates hold 67.58 per cent in Reliance Communications and a 26 per cent stake sale will still leave him in full control of the company.         
	A deal with MTN, however, poses greater challenges.         
	The South African telecom entity remains committed to the principles of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)  a programme launched by the South African government to redress the inequalities of apartheid by giving previously disadvantaged groups a say in the running of companies with critical stake allotment.         
	When Anil had first opened negotiations with MTN in May 2008, he had planned to offer close to 50 per cent in R-Com in return for a 35 per cent stake in MTN, which would ensure his indirect control over the Indian entity.         
	But once Mukesh invoked the proviso in the non-compete agreement, he had planned to offer no more than 24 per cent of his stake in R-Com. He had also tried to put together a group of private equity investors who would together pick up a 34.9 per cent stake in MTN in order to comply with the BEE provisions there.         
	The deal this time may be complicated by the fact that the two telecom companies have grown substantially in the past two years and will be looking to drive hard bargains in any share swap deal.

	Choosing a partner can be as challenging in politics as in private life. But going it alone is sometimes a better proposition than getting into uncertain partnerships. The Congress has to make up its mind soon about how it will fight the coming assembly elections in Bihar. It has two options  to look for partners and to go it alone. Given the state of its decline in Bihar, an alliance with other secular parties appears to be the more tempting option. At least two major parties in Bihar  Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal and Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party  should be the Congresss willing partners. After all, these two parties are partners of the United Progressive Alliance at the national level. Two factors could help an alliance between the Congress and these two parties against the ruling combine of the Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party. It could help avoid a split in secular votes and also appeal to a larger number of caste and community groups than the Congress can attract on its own. The most compelling argument for an alliance, of course, is that the Congress is organizationally too weak in Bihar to be able to defeat the JD (U)-BJP combine on its own.        
	However, only a bold and independent push can change things for the Congress in Bihar. Rahul Gandhi seems to think so and he may well be right in his judgment. In Bihar, the big question for the partys prospects in the coming polls is not whether it can get a few more seats, thanks to Mr Prasad or Mr Paswan, but whether it can have a political rebirth in one of the biggest states in India. It must be a matter of great discomfort for the party that it now has just 10 members in the 423-seat legislature in Bihar. The Congress faced a similar dilemma in Uttar Pradesh on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections in 2009. It had to choose between allying with Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party and going it alone. Mr Gandhi chose the latter course rather than accept a humiliatingly small number of seats offered by Mr Yadav. His boldness paid off  the Congress surprised both its opponents and most of its own leaders by winning 12 more seats than in 2004. Bihar and UP have similarities in caste and Muslim vote banks. True, what worked in UP in mid-2009 may not work in Bihar towards the end of 2010. But the Congresss revival in Bihar and UP is crucial to the partys fortunes in national politics.

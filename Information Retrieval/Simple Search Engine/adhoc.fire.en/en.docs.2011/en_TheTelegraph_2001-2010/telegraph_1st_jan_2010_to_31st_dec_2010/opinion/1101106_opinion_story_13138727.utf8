	A choir of 86 boys singing in four-part harmony must make a wonderful sound, provided the harmonies are well brought out and the intonation is perfect. Together with the sheer number, there must also be discipline, excellent choreography and poise. Although capable of singing a capella, accompaniment on the piano or other instruments adds colour and quality to the singing.        
	All these were there most of the time on October 31 at St Pauls Cathedral when the choir of St Pauls School, Darjeeling, performed to a large and appreciative audience.        
	The choirs discipline was in evidence as they walked in and took their places in silence. They began with Antonio Vivaldis Gloria. One cannot imagine why the introduction and accompaniment were played on the ancient cathedral grand when a perfectly good Steinway was hired for the occasion. It was difficult to pick out the internal choral harmonies above the cacophony of the old ladys jangled overtones. The earnest little sopranos of Classes IV and V in the front row were not always strong enough to soar with the rise of the music. Perhaps Csar Francks Panis Angelicus and Mozarts Ave Verum would have been more glorious had they been placed later in the programme, having given the young voices time to warm up.         
	One of the noticeable features of the choir was their ability to sing a beautiful pianissimo with articulate clarity. However, they seemed to venture into crescendos with a reluctantly tentative control that rarely reached a powerful enough forte to express the contrast.        
	Raghav Pradhans solo in Josh Thompsons The Sinner and the Song was emotionally sensitive, as was Jigme Tenzings rendering of Close Every Door from the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat. The soloists, Norbu Dorji, Jigme T. Bhutia and Sameer Sherpa, all from the tenor and bass sections, sang with youthful commitment. The Holy City  heard inevitably at most end-of-year recitals, but welcome nevertheless  was sung by the choir-master, Sudeep Pande. His vocal range and tone were, as always, good to hear.        
	The programme could have been more judiciously distributed, with the difficult and serious baroque and classical works towards the end, when the voices are sufficiently warmed-up and the singers confidence reaches its peak. There should have been more sopranos and altos and fewer tenors, perhaps, and definitely a strong no to antiquated calypsos, even in the Belafonte style, which may have been fun for a different sort of occasion.        
	The closing Abide with Me and God Be with You were sublime. The accompanists, Ehsanul Haque on the piano, Gautam Lepcha playing the violin and Alan Rai, are to be complimented for their involvement and musicianship.

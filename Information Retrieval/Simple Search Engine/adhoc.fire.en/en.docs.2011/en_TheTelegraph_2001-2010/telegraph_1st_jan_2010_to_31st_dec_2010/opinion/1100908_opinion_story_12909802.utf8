	Q: My daughter, a government servant, died after 14 years of service, leaving behind a stepson and a stepdaughter (children from her husbands first marriage) aged 22 and 24 respectively. Her husband, whose first wife is alive, died fours years ago. Who will be the legal heir to her dues from the government?        
	Anjali Sen, Calcutta        
	A: Since your widowed daughter expired childless, the heirs of her husband (which, in her case, would include her stepchildren and mother-in-law) will inherit her self-acquired assets as per the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.        
	Q:The super-built area of my flat is given as 1374.57 square feet. There are six pillars in my flat and the space taken by these has been included in the super-built area. Is the promoter justified in doing this?        
	Swapan Kumar Ray, Calcutta        
	A: The six pillars are part of the built-up area of your flat. Hence the promoter is justified in including them in the super-built area.         
	Q: My wife and I are the joint owners of our house. Being employed, she took the home loan in her name and is paying the EMIs. Can she transfer or gift her share of the property to our son without my consent? If yes, how can I prevent it?        
	Henry Mondal, Howrah, West Bengal        
	A: Your wife, being the joint owner of the flat, can gift her share to your son even without your consent. However, if she decides to transfer it to a third party or a stranger, you can stop her from doing so by taking recourse to the law.        
	Q: My wife and I live in a flat that is in my name. We have only one married daughter. I have not made any will. Could our daughter face any problems inheriting the flat after both of us pass away? If yes, what remedial step should I take?        
	Tamalkanti Banerjee, Calcutta        
	A: If you expire before your wife, the legal heirs to your flat will be your wife and daughter who will inherit equal shares in it. If you want your wife to inherit your property after your death and your daughter to inherit it after your wifes demise, then you should make a will. Otherwise there is no need to do so since your daughter will automatically inherit the entire property as she is your sole heir.

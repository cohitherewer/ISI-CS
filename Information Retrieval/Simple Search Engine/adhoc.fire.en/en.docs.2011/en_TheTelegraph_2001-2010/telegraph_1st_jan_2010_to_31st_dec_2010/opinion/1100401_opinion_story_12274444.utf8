	Naked truth                  
	Sir  The news report, Husain cases to stay (March 27), prompted me to share my views on M.F. Husains exile and his controversial art. The Supreme Court bench, headed by the Chief Justice of India, refused to quash the criminal cases against Husain, turning down a public interest litigation filed by Bhim Singh, the chief of Panthers Party and a former member of parliament. Nevertheless, the apex court opined that Husain is a world-class citizen and could live anywhere with dignity. But it also asserted that the cases against the artist are individual complaints that cannot be overlooked.          
	It must be noted that Husain has gone on exile to escape the warrants as well as the violent protests against him. If he has the right to express himself freely through his paintings, his critics also have a right to express their anger at Husain for hurting religious sentiments.           
	Husain has painted several Hindu goddesses in the nude. By doing so, he has hurt the national pride of Indians. This should be considered a matter of grave concern by every Indian, irrespective of caste, creed or religion. One of Husains paintings depicts four world leaders, including a decapitated Mahatma Gandhi and a naked Hitler.           
	Husain had reportedly stated in an interview that he drew the German dictator in the nude to humiliate him. On the other hand, while describing his paintings of Hindu deities, Husain has said that nudity in art depicts purity. These two conflicting statements expose Husains duplicity.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  After accepting Qatars offer of citizenship, M.F. Husain said that Indian politicians, artists and intellectuals had not protested when right wing outfits had targeted him (Sensitive blackmail, March 5). Their silence, he alleged, coupled with the virulent protests, forced him to leave India for another country. This is rather strange, as many eminent artists and intellectuals have supported and justified Husains objectionable paintings in the name of freedom of expression. The violence faced by Husain was no different from the threats faced by Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasreen. This kind of aggression cannot be justified, but one can also not blame Husains opponents for taking recourse to law. By not returning to India, Husain has shown disrespect towards the country and its judicial system. Thus, it will not be right for Husain to pin the blame on India for his present plight.          
	Incidentally, a cartoon published recently in a Delhi newspaper depicted a fully-veiled figure in black. The accompanying caption read, Qatar Mata by M.F. Husain. The cartoon was a reminder that Husain is unlikely to exercise his freedom of expression in a manner that may cause discomfort to the people of Qatar.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Rat race          
	Sir  The chief minister of West Bengal deserves praise for having forced his government to grant Presidency College the status of a unitary university (CM beats Mamata to Presidency, March 20). However, it is a fact that the bill has been passed hastily. Reservations have been expressed about the said bill that clearly aims at keeping the institution under the control of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The recruitment of mediocre faculty members recommended by the party is likely to continue. It seems that the dream of restoring Presidency to its former glory will remain unfulfilled. Hence, the bill should have been examined more closely.          
	Now that the bill has been passed, the least the chief minister can do is appoint deserving members of the colleges alumni association to the standing committee, and keep his party out of the administrative processes of the newly-formed university. Acclaimed alumni members alone can return the college to its former stature. One hopes that the chief ministers efforts will not go in vain, and that Presidency University will not become just another university controlled by the CPI(M).                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Bodhisattwa Gupta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The Presidency University bill, which was passed in the assembly at lightning speed, has created a landmark. This is not an isolated incident: the Left Front often hastens to get things done in order to turn the wind in its favour. It had shown the same urgency in helping the people of Basanti Colony that got burnt this year. In fact, Mamata Banerjee had promised to take up the issue of rehabilitation of the survivors, forcing the government to act on time.           
	At the moment, the fear of Opposition is making the government take up noble causes to display its benevolence. It is hoped that this race between the ruling party and the Opposition will benefit the people of West Bengal in the end.                    
	Yours faithfully,

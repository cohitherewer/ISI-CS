	Magnanimity in victory and graciousness in defeat: these are perhaps values of a bygone era treated with contempt by Indian politicians. It is entirely possible that many of them are ignorant of these values. The celebrations of the Trinamul Congress after its convincing win in the civic polls have been lacking in shrillness but they have not been informed by magnanimity either. But more strange has been the reaction of the entrenched Left, especially the senior members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), to the defeat they have suffered. There is first the eerie and cold silence of the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. His patrician aloofness, had it not been a mask for petulance, would suggest that he sees himself as being above the hurly-burly of electoral victories and setbacks. The only problem with such an impression is that he was not silent when he scored a famous victory in the assembly polls of 2005. Apart from that, the poll results are a verdict on his party  its modes of functioning and its attitude to power and governance. He cannot pretend otherwise.        
	Another response to the results has been articulated by the party officialdom. This tries to defuse the enormity of the defeat suffered by the CPI(M) and its partners. It does so by pointing out that this was an election to municipal bodies and that the politically conscious electorate of Bengal... treats every election on the basis of its objective. In other words, these were elections to local bodies and the results cannot be read as indicative of anything bigger. This argument conveniently overlooks two things. First, in this election civic issues were conspicuous by their absence. Both the Left and the Trinamul Congress ran their campaigns on the assumption that this election was a dress rehearsal for the bigger battle to control Writers Building in 2011. Second, the same politically conscious people of Bengal rejected the Left in no uncertain terms during the Lok Sabha polls last year. Some time before that, in the panchayat polls, the Left had also fared badly. At every level of the polity, the voters have shown that they want to do away with the Left and that they want an alternative in place. That alternative in most parts of the state is represented by the Trinamul Congress.        
	It can be nobodys argument that after more than 30 years in power, it will be easy for the Left and its partners to accept the reality of defeat. Yet the defeat is undeniable and the shadow of losing power and office looms large over the very existence of the CPI(M) and the other Left parties in West Bengal. There seems to be no preparation for this nor is their any introspection over past mistakes. The CPI(M) seems too eager to clutch at every statistical straw and to cling to power. Neither of these will counter what is now an irreversible trend. Denial is as dangerous a cover for defeat as arrogance is for power.

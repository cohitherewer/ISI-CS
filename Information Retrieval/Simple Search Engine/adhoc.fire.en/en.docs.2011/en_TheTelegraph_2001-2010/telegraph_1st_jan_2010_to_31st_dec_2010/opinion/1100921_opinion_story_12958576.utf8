The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Strange hymns and Bollywood dances
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STRANGE HYMNS AND BOLLYWOOD DANCES                                  PARADIGM SHIFT      Toto customs are being slowly transformed, with some help from the government                                                  
	The Totos are polyglots. They speak the Toto language among themselves, Nepali or Meche while interacting with their neighbours in Totopara, and Bengali outside the village. The schools in Totopara have Bengali as their medium of instruction, and this proved to be a major difficulty for Rita Toto when she was pursuing her studies. She had to read, and write her exams in a language that she spoke occasionally. She hopes to be a teacher in Totopara in future, because, she feels, as a Toto she will be better suited than a Bengali to the task of educating the village children.         
	While the Toto language may not be on its way to extinction, it certainly is threatened. In the absence of a script, it uses the Bengali alphabet. But the strangest feature of the language is the fact that the version used in the old songs and hymns is completely different from the one spoken by modern Totos. So much so that the Totos do not understand a word of the hymns chanted by priests during ceremonies, and even more strangely, neither do the priests themselves. Some say that the mantras are in Dzonkha, the national language of Bhutan, and point to the Totos place of origin. The hymns constitute an oral tradition handed down the generations, and since most of the elderly priests today are unlettered, there is the fear of the language dying with its present practitioners.        
	Young men like Bakul and Satyajit Toto compose songs in the spoken Toto language that are sung alongside the traditional ones during weddings and festivals. The Totos make a distinction between their ancient songs and the modern ones, which will perhaps replace the former eventually. If the chants are changing, so are the dance forms. The state information and cultural affairs department reportedly did not find the original Toto dances attractive enough since they did not involve the use of instruments. So a new fashionable dance form was created for the Totos in consultation with the officers of culture, and it is this dance that is performed in government-sponsored cultural fests throughout West Bengal.        
	Jhuma Toto (picture), the elder daughter of Bhakta Toto, is in her late teens. If her younger sister, Sanchita, has earned distinction by passing the Higher Secondary examination in the first division this year, Jhuma has excelled as a dancer. She leads the dance troupe from her locality. Yet she didnt have the faintest idea of the Toto dances even a few years back. Ironically, it was in Calcutta that Jhuma got to know the elderly Toto women who were giving dance lessons, and mastered the art.         
	The dances are performed in traditional dresses, which, again, have been decided upon and distributed by the department of culture. Jhuma showed me her dress, which comprised a simple white bodice with a coloured apron, and a white head scarf. The modern dancers wear no jewellery though necklaces made of silver coins might have been a part of the original regalia.        
	Jhuma says that the dancers today match steps to the tunes of Bollywood or Nepali songs during weddings, even during the village festivals. Unlike her father, she doesnt seem to think that the ancient is the repository of all values. She has good company in the officers of the cultural affairs department who are all ready to present the Totos as just adequately primitive for the modern palate.

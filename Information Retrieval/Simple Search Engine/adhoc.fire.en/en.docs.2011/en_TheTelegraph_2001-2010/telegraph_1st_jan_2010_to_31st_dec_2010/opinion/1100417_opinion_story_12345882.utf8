The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An evening marked by grace and elegance
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AN EVENING MARKED BY GRACE AND ELEGANCE                                  DANCE - Sharmila Basu Thakur                                                  
	Sudha Art Centre presented an evening of classical dance featuring the young students of the institution at Gyan Manch on April 12. Under the guidance of Ramaprasad Chattopadhyay, a senior Kathak dancer, the event provided a perfect opportunity for the young and enthusiastic dancers to present their talents.         
	The evening began with prarambha  based on teentaal  where the dancers proved their mettle. The performers then presented various items under this particular genre. Anasuya Mukherjee, Priyanka Saha and Subhankar Pillai proved that they have acquired a proper understanding of this art form. This presentation was followed by performances based on jhap taal in which Ujjaini Chatterjee, Poushali Mukherjee and Diksha Roy performed credibly. Amrita Banerjee, Ranita Roy, Ria Mondol, Moitree Sinha, Soumita Roychowdhury, Ranita Das, Konkona Ganguly, Subhasree Chatterjee and Chinmoy Das were the other dancers who performed that evening.         
	It is the responsibility of a teacher to see that his wards are imaginative and capable of innovation. What was inspiring to see was Chattopadhyays earnest effort and dedication that have helped sustain the students interest in classical dance.         
	The second half of the evening commenced with a solo recital by Bhaswati Mishra (picture). Mishra possesses effortless grace, and her restrained approach added a special dimension to her performance. Dressed in traditional attire, Mishra was rhythmic in her presentation of ginti and tihai. Her neat movements and nimble footwork were evident when she performed tora, tukra, paran and other elements in the Kathak repertoire. Mishras exquisite laris were a treat to watch. Sajan mero chhor gaye, a thumri by Sobha Gurtu, was chosen for abhinaya where the dancer portrayed the feelings of a birahini nayika.         
	Mishra was accompanied by Biplab Bhattacharya on the tabla. The other accompanists of the evening were Pratip Banerjee (vocals), Sandip Neogi (sitar), Jayanta Bhattacharya (sarod), Pratik Mukherjee (tabla) and Ramaprasad Chattopadhyay (bol parhant).

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPECIAL FOCUS                                                    
	There seems to be something very comforting in the idea of the president of the United States of America and the prime minister of India meeting one to one to discuss problems. Such a meeting serves to reiterate the special relationship that India has come to enjoy vis--vis the US. One hates to raise a dissonant note regarding what is obviously a budding relationship, but it needs to be pointed out that when Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh met very recently in Washington DC, they discussed terrorism and its shadow over India and South Asia. In other words, they spoke about Pakistan and the threat that emanates from there towards India. This points to the fact that the relationship between India and the US, however special it might be, has acquired a very narrow focus. There exists a context for this but there is a need to break out of this straitjacket if the relationship between the two countries is going to be endowed with a global, as distinct from a regional, significance. There is a fear that the narrow focus may not be entirely context-induced. It might be a result of Mr Obamas attempts to break away from the way his predecessor viewed India, the latters relationship with the US, and Indias position in global affairs.        
	One justified apprehension is that meetings like the one Mr Obama and Mr Singh had fuel the feel-good factor on the Indian side but mark no substantive advance. It is by no means clear what the US president wants to do in Pakistan and in what state he wants to leave Afghanistan before the promised pull-out of US troops from there. Under the circumstances, the word, special, in the special relationship deserves to be put within inverted commas. There is no denying that a great deal of bonhomie exists between Mr Obama and Mr Singh but these personal equations cannot overcome history and political compulsions arising out of ground realities. India, for very valid reasons, cannot ignore the problems posed by violence and instability in Pakistan, especially as both these are driven by Islamic fundamentalism. India can run to no one else save the US to articulate its fears and grievances. The US, however sympathetic it might be towards India, cannot completely abandon Pakistan. Indo-US relations would thus appear to be caught in a pincer. Top-level meetings are necessary, but they should only be viewed through the cold and cynical prism of reality.

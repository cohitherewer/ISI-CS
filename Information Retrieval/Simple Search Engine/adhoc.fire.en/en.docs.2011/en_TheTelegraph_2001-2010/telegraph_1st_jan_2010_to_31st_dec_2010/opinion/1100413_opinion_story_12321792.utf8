                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BRINGING DEMOCRACY TO A MARGINALIZED PEOPLE                              The solution to the Maoist insurgency may lie in making the extremists participate in the democratic process, writes Shyamal Datta.                        Down with guns				                                       
	It was in February 2010 that the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, declared that the government of India was not averse to talking to the Maoists if they abjured violence and came forward for talks without attaching any ifs and buts. Sometime later, the home ministry informed through the press the fax number on which the proposal for talks could be communicated. Perhaps in response to that, the politburo member and military commander of the Maoists, Koteshwar Rao, alias Kishanji, reportedly served a 72-hour ultimatum to the government to start the talks or face intensified assaults targeting cities and towns. This was on March 6. Earlier, he had charged the government with carrying out operations in violation of the ceasefire that the Maoists had reportedly declared on February 23.        
	Kishanji failed to appreciate the fact that no government worth its salt would react to an ultimatum laced with threats of retaliation. No self-respecting government would buckle under pressure and agree to enter into a dialogue with a group that prefers to talk through the barrel of the gun. The government of India could discern that the offer of talks was just a ploy to divert attention and slow down the intensity of the ongoing military operations against the Maoists. It was also intended to create doubt in the minds of the security forces about the logic of continuing with the military campaign if talks were indeed an integral part of the blueprint.        
	To the analysts, both the ceasefire and the call for talks are nothing but publicity stunts. The Maoists are desperate to buy time to regroup and reorganize themselves in the aftermath of the killing of Lalmohan Tudu, the leader of the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities, and the arrests of Telugu Deepak and some others who are allegedly involved in the murder of a police officer in the tribal belt.        
	What has followed the suo motu offer of talks is the listing of Maoist demands. These are as follows: recasting of the development model based on the Paschimanchal Unnayan Parishad; empowering adivasis by imparting skills and aptitude so as to enable them to avail themselves of jobs offered under the reservation quota; setting up of an autonomous council managed by the adivasis to spearhead welfare activities in the tribal region; greater transparency and accountability in the functioning of the panchayats, and so on.        
	The offer for talks and the listed demands reflect the doubts in the minds of Maoist leaders about the sustainability of an armed struggle. Hence the need to explore the option of an honourable exit as part of their strategy. To understand the actual intent of the Maoists designs and plans in the larger context, it will be instructive for the government to carry out a reasoned analysis and a nuanced debate within the intelligence, civil, law- enforcement and security agencies. No set patterns exist for starting negotiations with an organization that believes in the cult of violence as an instrument to overthrow a constitutionally-elected government. It is not very easy to precisely determine the conditions before agreeing to talks. These vary with situations and are, in turn, influenced by the historical background, geographical terrain and ideological content of the movement. Talks are generally preceded by informal, behind- the-scene parleys, popularly known as the Track Two initiatives, with those who represent the leadership of the organization willing to talk. The idea is to assess the ability of the outfit to meet the demands without derailing the talks through the threat of violence against the government.              
	In most cases, the cessation of violence paves the way for the engagement process because it creates a measure of trust in the minds of both the government and the people. It also indicates the willingness and commitment of the outfit to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In the event of any breach, it becomes easier for the government to rally the peoples support behind sanctions that it may impose on the outfit for violating the terms and conditions. No negotiation can commence without strong indications from the organization that it is serious about ending its armed struggle.        
	A slew of demands before talks makes this kind of a strategy weak and flawed. As a result, irrevocable concessions in advance cannot be entertained. It is for the government to ascertain in advance the ties that exist between those responsible for violence and those willing to negotiate. Only negotiating with the latter is not considered the best option. Therefore, it must be ensured that those linked to extremist violence are brought into the loop of talks. The objective should be to strengthen those willing to come to the bargaining table and weaken those reluctant to walk the talk. The mechanism helps in enlarging the space for dialogue and to ensure that the engagement makes tangible progress. Talks that are held without preconditions help create a climate of trust, which ensures that the engagement is productive.        
	Negotiations cannot legitimize violence. On the contrary, it must add legitimacy to all that is necessary to promote peace and consolidate the system. The key objective is not simply to end violence but also to minimize the risks of destabilising the system. In this regard, it will be necessary to find out what type of ideology one has to deal with and what is the level of commitment the ideology evokes among the activists. If the ideology is such that it brooks limited rationalization, then adjustment and accommodation of competing demands become difficult. An engagement with this kind of an ideology tends to encounter frequent road blocks because the leadership of the outfit suffers from a denial syndrome, and does not accept that the struggle has reached a point beyond which there can be no advancement of its goal. Consequently, other alternatives have to be explored through peaceful means.        
	What is of relevance is the level of internal cohesion within the extremist outfit. The more tightly knit the organization, the higher are the chances of confronting tough ideological and operational questions from the leadership. Delays in the final settlement are as likely. In such a situation, what the government needs to ensure is that the political-minded members of the organization have considerable influence in their favour and that the leadership is able to enlist overwhelming support from the rank and file for the settlement to work on the ground.                    
	While granting primary concessions, what must be ensured is that all major parties are involved. The extremists should also participate on the basis of a democratic mandate so that concessions become an extension of the politys will. The ultimate solution will lie in making the extremists participate in a multi-party process and gain exposure to democratic practices.They will then be forced to subject their political programme under the scrutiny of public judgment during elections and will have to interact and engage with their opponents, build coalitions and strike compromise. A time will come when a broader consensus will emerge. An outcome from such an inclusive process is viewed as the most legitimate. It also helps in compelling those in opposition to join the process.        
	What assures the people in the end is an agreement that leaves no room for the recurrence of violence and clinches issues such as the fate of extremist leaders, amnesty and surrender of weapons. For the viability of the settlement, it is imperative that public expectations and the competing interests of the extremist organization, government and the Opposition are properly managed and leveraged. What the government needs is to make it clear that a commitment to democratic principles is the price that the extremists will have to pay. The extremist organization should also be ready to swap the bullet for the ballot box. The leadership should have sufficient influence, farsightedness and statesman-like qualities to motivate the rank and file into going along with the strategy of shunning the path of violence and joining the political process to improve the lot of the people through democratic and peaceful means.        
	The prospect of armed encounters making way for meaningful engagement appears bleak in the near future. The Maoists have not done anything worthwhile to foster a climate for talks. On the contrary, they have remained defiant and stepped up violence, targeting the railways, security forces as well as members of political parties. The bandh programme, observed in as many as three states apart from West Bengal, has turned violent on several occasions.              
	Given the situation, the threats held out by the Maoists to strike in cities and urban centres underscore the need to heighten vigil and undertake urgent deployment of resources to stay a few steps ahead of the Maoists and to neutralize their dastardly plans. The state of West Bengal cannot afford to have a repeat of the days of ruthless urban guerrilla action of yesteryear.         
	Meanwhile, as far as the restoration of the writ of the government in the liberated areas is concerned, a lot will depend on the reinforcement of the perception that the negotiation represents a unique historical opportunity to generate valuable momentum in the quest of resolutions to difficult problems.

	Terror, Crime and Punishment: Order and Disorder in Early Colonial Bengal 1800-1860 
  By Ranjan Chakrabarti, Readers Service, Rs 595                
	Most Bengali children a generation ago would grow up reading or hearing real-life stories of famous dacoits. Even today, Calcutta has place names associated with such characters. But how did the British rulers, the society of the time and above all, the criminals themselves see crime and punishment?        
	This book offers an interesting history of crime, law and justice in 19th-century Bengal from below. As such, it is a departure from an earlier tradition of scholarship that looked at crime as illegal behaviour and the criminal justice system as part of the institution-building process that went hand in hand with state formation.        
	Chakrabarti treats crime as a social phenomenon that was inextricably linked to the dislocation of the old society and economy brought about by colonial rule. The rule of law, therefore, was more a matter of the rulers law than an institution serving the general good of society. The notions of crime and criminality in the period discussed in this book have the wider context of the new imperatives in the formative period of British colonial administration.         
	For a long time during the East India Companys reign, the rule of law meant the rule of the lathi. Landlords would not only define crime and criminality and but also dispense whatever they considered justice. It was not a system that the company invented; it was part of the ancien rgime everywhere.        
	The colonial rulers attitude to crime and justice in the Bengal countryside until the second half of the 19th century was a far cry from what it was in Britain. Prior to the extension of the Criminal Tribes Act to Bengal in 1876, the magistrates and the police in Bengal enjoyed powers to brand any person or group of persons as bad characters.         
	Chakrabarti recounts the familiar story of how a criminal justice system was sought to be introduced with the enactment of Cornwalliss regulations of 1793, which led to the restructuring of police establishments throughout Bengal. The larger context of this new look at crime and justice was the new rule of property, which Cornwallis introduced through the Permanent Settlement.         
	Little changed, however, on the ground. The books major strength lies in its attempt to capture details of the ground reality. The chapter entitled Dacoity, Affray and Violence in the Interior has captivating accounts of the colonial administrations encounter with the world of crime far from the insulated world of Fort William.         
	The story comes alive with authentic historical accounts of confessions by dacoits and other criminals as well as the experiences of British magistrates and Indian darogas in dealing with crime in the countryside.         
	This chapter, together with the next, Anatomy of Violence, actually goes beyond the story of crime and criminals. Chakrabarti does particularly well to capture the tensions of a changing agrarian society through its confused attempts to come to terms with an alien rulers new dispensation. The new rules of the game, still ill-defined and clumsily administered, become handy for settling social and economic scores over land and other kinds of property. The zamindar-bandit and the planter-bandit connections were one part of the story; the other part was how the propertied classes abused the new notions of crime and criminal justice in order to defraud and punish the lower classes.                    ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The adventures of a reader
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE ADVENTURES OF A READER                                  THIS ABOVE ALL: Khushwant Singh                          Upside down                                        
	Till a few months ago, all I knew about the Ansals was bazaar gossip published in newspapers  that is, they were filthy rich, perhaps the biggest owners of real estate in the capital and in Gurgaon, including shopping plazas, malls, blocks of flats, factories and above all the Uphaar Cinema, which caught fire, killing scores of people. Its proprietor, Sushil Ansal, had to pay a heavy penalty for allowing the tragedy to occur. It was only after the family made a handsome monthly donation to Rita Devis free mobile clinic that I got to read Kusum Ansals travelogue, Discovering Latin America. I discovered I had missed something; she was informative and most readable.        
	I found out more about her. She did her MA from the Aligarh Muslim University and holds a doctorate in Hindi Literature from the Punjab University, Chandigarh. She writes in English, Hindi and Punjabi  novels, short stories and poetry. She has won many literary awards. Her latest, Beyond Silence, is a work of fiction which delves into the lives of Indians who have been living in South Africa for four generations. It starts in Chandigarh. The heroine is a Punjabi girl who has qualified as an architect. She falls in love with a South African-born Indian. They get engaged in Chandigarh, marry in Delhi and consummate their marriage in Johannesburg and make their home in Durban. Thereafter, it is the lives of South African Indians: it is fictionalized reality. All she has to do is avoid over-writing and her penchant for clichs to make her mark in the world of Indian writing.                
	A perplexed prince                
	The latest issue of Private Eye, which comes out of London, has an article, A Passage to India (after E.M. Forsters novel), on Prince Charles and his wifes visit to India to inaugurate the Commonwealth Games with his Queen Mothers message. I found it hilarious and would like to share it with my readers. It reads:        
	The Indian sun blazed down from a cloudless sky as Charless stretch rickshaw swept down Viceroy Street, now renamed Manmohan Singh Avenue, scattering the sacred cows and the scores of street beggars queueing up outside the Star Of Bucks Coffee House.        
	Charles, with Camilla by his side, was delighted by the colourful scene. How amazingly India had changed since the days when Diana had posed for that sulky photograph in front of the Taj Mahal.        
	The new India was alive and brimming with hope for the future, as indeed was Charles himself.        
	Here he was about to step to the centre of the world stage to open these games in place of his mother. Billions of eyes would be on him as he delivered what would be the most important speech he had ever made.        
	As his rickshaw skilfully navigated its way past the flooded potholes, and ragged street salesmen offering him free broadband connections for only 300 rupees a month  Very good, very fast, Sahib Charles read through the draft of the speech on which he had been labouring for months.        
	There were the headings of his great message to the world  Climate change  greatest challenge to mankind  it really is appalling global warming  even more appalling  environmental catastrophe  need for wind farms and organic yoghurt  not appalling at all....        
	Within only an hour or two now his big moment would at least have arrived.        
	Where is everybody? asked Charles, as he and Camilla walked into the vast Shilpa Shetty Stadium, gazing down on the rows and rows of empty seats below him.        
	Test match today, Sahib, explained a deferential Indian official. Very important game, Australia v. India.         
	We all have a lot of money on whats going to happen in the third over after lunch.        
	But Charles scarcely heard this. So when am I on? he asked expectantly. Its quite a short speech, and shouldnt take more than three hours.        
	The turbaned functionary smiled enigmatically, as he gestured for Charles and his consort to sit in their place of honour on the official dais, which a number of workmen were still hastily constructing.        
	As they sat down, on two wobbly chairs, a great throng of Indian dignitaries arrived to take their seats around them and the colourful opening ceremony began. Charles could hardly wait.                
	From hearts to spades                
	Marriage is like a deck of cards. In the beginning all you need are 2 hearts and 2 diamonds. But in the end, youll wish you had a club and a spade!

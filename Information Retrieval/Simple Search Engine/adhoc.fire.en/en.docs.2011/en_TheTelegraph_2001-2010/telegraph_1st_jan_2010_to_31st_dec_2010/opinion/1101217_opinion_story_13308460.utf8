	Death of a mansion      
	The goat, the sofa and Mr Swami (Hachette, Rs 250) by R. Chandrasekar is supposedly a mischievous attempt to expose human pretence. Swami, IAS officer and joint-secretary in the PMO, is man Friday to the nations prime minister who seems to be more interested in scotch, late mornings and titillating Hindi film songs than in running the nation. Given the prime ministers predilections, it is left to the resourceful Swami to bail the government and the country out of frequent crises, including the one involving the Pakistani premier who suddenly decides to attend a cricket series in India. The plot is decidedly contrived and the authors witticism is as mediocre as his prose.                        
	The premier murder league (Penguin, Rs 150) by Geeta Sundar is a whodunnit that brings together murder and cricket. The Union sports minister is found dead, and when two investigators  DCP Ravi and ACP Rahul  decide to put their heads together to solve the crime, the death trail leads them to a series of other grisly killings. Slowly, they unravel an evil plan to eliminate righteous individuals who come in the way of the creation of a lucrative league of Twenty20 cricket that can turn the sporting body into the most prosperous cricket board in the world. Expectedly, the players are just a pawn in this lethal game. The paper-thin plot and Sundars unimaginative style make this book thoroughly unappealing.                                  
	The house with five courtyards (Penguin, Rs 299) has been translated by Masooma Ali from Govind Mishras original work in Hindi. The book spans across three generations of a joint family living in Benaras and traces the factors that lead to its disintegration. A sprawling mansion shelters a large, happy family, which is held together by Badi Amma, an ingenious and strong-willed matriarch. Guests are put up warmly, and members of the household display a distinctive secular character by celebrating Eid as well as Sankranti with equal fervour. However, after the eldest brother  an immensely successful lawyer  decides to chuck his flourishing legal practice to join the nationalist movement, and Badi Amma starts losing her hold over the family, fissures appear in age-old bonds and the family struggles to make ends meet. Mishras book depicts the societal transition from idealism to a materialistic way of life in a satisfactory manner.

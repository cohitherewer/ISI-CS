	How resilient are the cities of the world? In Bonn, the meeting of the World Council of Mayors on Climate Change concluded in Resilient Cities 2010, their first world congress, that without the active participation of cities in combating climate change, containing global warming would be likely to fail. For 17 years, the ICLEI, a non-governmental organization, and others, have been emphasizing the importance of local-level participation in the fight for a sustainable environment. This was at the core of the recent Bonn declaration. The earliest meeting of municipal leaders was in New York in 1993, around which time the Cities for Climate Protection campaign was born. But so far its reach had been mainly limited to the West; in this first world congress, the mayors of Howrah and Chennai were among the delegates from all over the world.        
	This development is of enormous importance. While national leaders squabble about the responsibility and practice of their countries, a certain heightening of awareness regarding climate change has indisputably taken place everywhere. If an assault is added from the level of cities and local governments, the movement to do something meaningful about global warming may receive a stimulus. Cities consume over two-thirds of the worlds energy and account for more than 70 per cent of its carbon dioxide emissions. Paradoxically, just as they are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, for example, through flooding, or increased heat from traps created by buildings, paved spaces and vehicles, they are also best placed to address the problems. They have access to knowledge hubs and expertise, a certain amount of autonomy, and can be enabled by the funds specially meant for cities to begin a reversal. The ways that come immediately to mind are increasing energy-efficiency in buildings, outdoor lighting, transport, advanced waste management, rainwater harvesting, and accessing clean energy from large-scale suppliers. Powerful campaigns for citizens awareness, including competitions for best practices, could be of great help, although an aid-oriented approach would be necessary for the cities poor. All this is possible; but at the end of it all, what is needed is a full understanding of the scale and nature of the problem and an unswerving political will to carry things through.

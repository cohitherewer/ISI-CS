	Has Latin America seen the future and come to believe it works? For nothing else explains the astonishing turn-around in the political ambience in that part of the world. Even a couple of decades ago, Cuba was considered an unfortunate happenstance by the United States of Americas administration. A bunch of wild conspirators had somehow managed to usurp power there, taking advantage of the absent-mindedness of the vigilantes on behalf of democracy. The island-country, reckoned as a little spot of shame, was kept in quarantine. The rest of Latin America, self-appointed shapers of global destiny ensconced in Washington DC felt confident, was solidly for freedom; the generals installed by the Pentagon in the different countries were to see to that. The Organisation of American States, the loose confederation of Latin American countries habituated to the overlordship of the US, treated Cuba as a pariah.        
	The past 20 years or thereabouts have seen a total reversal in the circumstances. It is no longer an isolated story of a small bunch of conspirators imposing an authoritarian regime on a hapless people taken unawares. In an almost orderly sequence, country after Latin American country  Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador  have voted Left in free elections contested by a multiplicity of parties. Candidates representing the Left have won the popular mandate. Among the major South American countries, only Salvador Allendes Chile still appears to be ambivalent, but it is unlikely to take long before it too makes up its mind. In both Venezuela and Brazil, the mandate for the Left has been repeated for a number of terms. The Organisation of American States is a transformed institution; Fidel Castro is no longer referred to as that scoundrel of a rabble-rouser; he is now a father figure, widely revered and respectfully listened to.        
	Equally revealing is the content of the socio-economic programme initiated by the new administrations in the countries that have voted Left. The public sector has come to occupy the central space in the development discourse, the clout of big business has ebbed; the transnational corporations have no longer any say on who will be named finance or foreign trade minister, just as the Pentagon can no longer pick the countrys army chief. Land reforms constitute an important part of the government agenda, along with purposively larger allocations for health, education and social welfare, with a corresponding de-emphasis on outlays for defence and security. Trade unions, peasant bodies and civil society organizations are regularly called in for counsel and advice on matters of national interest.        
	Underlying all this is, of course, the remarkable shift in the popular mood, and this despite the press continuing to be heavily controlled by industrial tycoons. The media have not relented in their battle against the wild radicals who, in their view, have temporarily managed to sway the minds of a majority of citizens against the ancient regime. The television and newspaper barons have been egging on disgruntled sections of the armed forces to rise in revolt and turn back the Left tide. There have been a number of attempts to effect a coup. Each such attempt has failed because of the massive mobilization of protest by the general public and trade union bodies.        
	The old-time generals are thus experiencing a culture shock; their profession is gone. Apart from the sea change in the domestic agenda, in international relations, too, a pronounced effort is on to rekindle the burnt-out dream of asserting the collective voice of the poorer world. The new breed of Latin American leaders is keen to raise the level of their interaction with the nations in Asia and Africa. In the non-aligned movement, once put together by the likes of Nehru, Soekarno, Nasser and Tito, the Latin American presence was nearly non-existent; most of South America was in that phase ruled by the hegemony of military dictators who took their cue from Washington DC. While veterans of the old non-aligned movement, such as India, have grown relatively quiet, it is moral pressure from the Latin American countries which is now a major factor contributing to the increasing assertion of the ethos of the South in international fora against the overbearingness of the Western powers, never mind whether the issue is environment or intellectual property rights. The role reversal could not be more stunning.        
	The US would be hard put to complain; the great shift that has taken place is a sequel to multiple exercises in free choice. General disenchantment with the claustrophobic presence of the army within the portals of power had of course been simmering for a long while. But the courage to turn openly against the generals is the outcome of the awakening of a simple awareness: once people form a common front and unitedly man the barricade of resistance, the hegemony of the army could be got rid of and the US would not be able to do anything about it. True, the Cuban precedent was there to inspire the masses; another equally significant factor, though, was the developing discontent among the junior ranks of the defence forces, many with humble rural roots. While they were paid extremely low wages, a much greater reason for their growing anger against the army czars was the ruthless nature of persecution and exploitation in the countryside of which their left-behind families were victims.        
	Something else is worth mentioning. The corporate bosses from the US and their comprador agents had, for over a century, set up a manipulative system which denied the Latin Americans a just price for their produce. The sustained campaign by social scientists such as Raul Prebisch gradually laid bare how European and North American big business, in league with local agents, had turned the terms of trade against South American countries which mostly exported primary commodities. Add to all this the luridly glaring disparity in income and wealth in the industrial and commercial sectors, and the season for a qualitative change knocked at the door.        
	The different angers joined up, bit by bit. And if Cuba inspired Nicaragua and Venezuela, Venezuela in turn was a source of courage for Bolivia. Brazil soon followed suit; then the time was ripe for Ecuador. The electoral system is not uniform in these countries: some adhere to the first-past-the-post system while others have some version or other of proportional representation. It did not matter though; people assessed the relative merits of the contesting parties and opted for the Left. A different Latin America emerged as a reality.        
	A nota bene is called for. An ethnic symbiosis of portentous significance has strengthened the ongoing transformation. The comprador shadow enveloping the Latin American sky was often coloured by an explicit tinge of racial hauteur. Most of the compradors were descendants of the conquistadors and intensely Eurocentric in their attitude and demeanour. In contrast, the mass upsurge which has dislodged the military-comprador hegemony has an extraordinary multi-ethnic composition. There is solid representation of descendants of the original inhabitants of the continent, who have extended their comradely hands to Afro-Americans, the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the indentured labourers imported from Africa in the course of the preceding centuries. The construction of the troika has been rendered complete by the entry of working classes of vigorous white stock. The process of intermingling of blood is culminating in a convergence of attitude and thought.              
	Such a pity, India with its excited talk of Forbes billionaires in its midst could not care less for these fascinating developments in contemporary Latin America, just as it has little time for the seething resentment in the underbelly of West Asia. The worlds supposedly largest democracy is at this moment much too wrapped up in the pride which elevation of its status as the closest strategic ally of the worlds mightiest power instils. In the language courses in the different universities of the country, the French and German classes are crowded, Spanish and Arabic are poor also-rans. This is frightening myopia, for the second half of the present century, many will take a wager, will be dominated by South America and West Asia.

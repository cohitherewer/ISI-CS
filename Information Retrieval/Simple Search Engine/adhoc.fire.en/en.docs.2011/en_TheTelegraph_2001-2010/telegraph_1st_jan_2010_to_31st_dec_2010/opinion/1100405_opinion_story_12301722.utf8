                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CROSSED WIRES                                                    
	That Good Friday was comparatively sombre on Park Street is an indication that Stephen Court will not be easily forgotten. But that painful memory would be most meaningful if it could finally induce a change in Calcuttas approach to fire-safety. What the tragedy made clear is that people have to help themselves as a first step. The investigations and analyses of the problems of old buildings being undertaken by the media have revealed a number of areas in which the residents could act. They could locate the most vulnerable spots in the building and try to see how those can be improved, maybe with the help of electricians and other experts, keep safety equipment at hand, look after the maintenance of the building, or repair broken-down fire-escape stairs. These would help somewhat, even if they cost money. Some problems would be intractable, of course, such as a wooden staircase as the only way of escaping the building, but a high awareness is some part of the battle won.        
	And it is ultimately the citizens who would have to compel the fire services minister and the department he heads to be accountable. The authorities cannot be allowed to remain indifferent to the fact that only 1,640 firefighters and operators have been functioning in a department that needs 4,540 personnel. On top of that, essential firefighting and safety equipment has not been bought although there is no dearth of money for it. Far from modernizing the service, the minister is not even interested in providing the men with means of communication. They try to get in touch with one another in an emergency on their own mobile phones, which do not always work. In any case, emergency strategies cannot be coordinated over mobile phones. Recently, some firemen got trapped when trying to put out a fire in a colony. They could not get through to their colleagues. By the time they were found some were critically injured. Nothing has so far moved the fire minister to action, but maybe pressure from citizens, generously applied, will dent his love of rest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | stadium as symbol
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STADIUM AS SYMBOL                                                          
	An important sporting event, like the Olympic Games or the Commonwealth Games, is an opportunity for the host country to make a statement for itself. One significant way to do this is through the design of the main stadium where the games are going to be held. In very recent times, China led the way by erecting a stadium that has already acquired the status of an iconic building. The Birds Nest stadium, where the 2008 Olympics were held, is justifiably considered one of the marvels of modern architecture. It stands apart from the city and conveys to the viewer a radically new image. It becomes a symbol and a metaphor for something more profound than sports. In a secular world, it inspires awe in the same way as icons of Jesus Christ evoked awe and reverence in the Byzantine world. The Birds Nest excites wonder. There are other contemporary buildings that have been hailed as iconic by historians of architecture. The first building to be thus described was the little church in Ronchamp which bore the signature of Le Corbusier. Frank Gehrys new Guggenheim Museum Bilbao has also earned for itself the accolade of being iconic. China thus used the Olympic Games to create for itself and the world a building  marvellously conceived and designed by Herzog and de Meuron  which has become part of its glorious architectural heritage.        
	India, when it decided to host the Commonwealth Games for 2010, had a chance to give itself a new stadium that could bid to be considered iconic. Following China, it could have opened a bidding process for internationally acclaimed architects and then chosen the best to give the nation a new symbol. Those responsible for organizing the Commonwealth Games chose to refurbish existing structures. Not only was an opportunity missed but a mindset was also revealed. It is a mindset that prefers the public works department to international designers and architects. In this regard India has regressed. When Jawaharlal Nehru decided that India needed a new city to be the capital of Punjab, he did not leave its conception and design in the hands of government engineers. He went for the worlds best. Chandigarh thus became one of Le Corbusiers signature creations. Nehru had a vision for India that was both artistic and modern.        
	The comparison between India and China has become the pet theme of those who are called developmental economists. Figures of gross domestic product and trade are bandied around to demonstrate the state of the race between the two Asian giants. But the matter is not one that can be discussed at the level of dry-as-dust statistics concerning the economies of the two countries. It is also a matter of the vision that the leadership of the two countries want to present regarding their countries to the world and to their own citizens. In this context, India is a very poor second. The story of Chinas stadium and Indias stadium says it all.

	Q: In 2007 I purchased a flat which was under construction. In 2008, the promoter asked me to take possession of it. I did not do so because the building had no electricity at the time. But now that there is regular electricity in the building, I want to take possession. But the promoter is asking for maintenance charges from 2008. Am I liable to pay it? He has also failed to provide the completion and occupancy certificates. Can I have the flat registered without them?        
	S. Roy, Calcutta        
	A: It was illegal on the part of your promoter to ask you to take possession of a flat in a building which was unfit for occupation as it was without electricity. Hence, he cannot claim maintenance charges from you during that period. Yes, you can get your flat registered without the completion and occupancy certificates but these documents are very important for determining the tax related to the building, mutation, etc.        
	Q: My cousin and I jointly own a plot of land and a two-storeyed house on it. We have been living there with our families for the past 10 years. Now I would like to make a registered partition deed. But my cousin is reluctant to execute it. What are my legal options?        
	N. Laxminarayana, Titagarh, Calcutta        
	A: You have no option left but to send a legal notice declaring your intention to partition the property and then file a suit for partition before the court with the appropriate jurisdiction.         
	Q: My wife applied for the mutation of her flat in 2006. Till now we have not heard from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. We gathered that the legal department has raised an objection because of the absence of an oral gift. We would like to know whether the registration of the oral gift under the Muslim Personal Law is compulsory for mutation?        
	Safique Alam, Calcutta        
	A: Though Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, provides that it is mandatory that a gift of immovable property be effected by a registered instrument, this provision is not applicable to oral gifts covered by the Muslim Personal Law. If the formalities for effecting an oral gift prescribed in the Muslim Personal law are complied with, the gift is valid for all purposes, even if the same has not been registered.

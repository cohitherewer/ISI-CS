                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPIRITED, CONTROLLED AND IMAGINATIVE                                  VISUAL ARTS: Rita Datta                                                  
	For somebody who did not go to art school, Uma Roychowdhury has pretty nimble fingers when it comes to modelling. Particularly the modelling of faces which she showed along with her other works at the Academy of Fine Arts recently. Its only once in a long while that you come across self-taught artists holding shows. However, they are usually seen to prefer drawing and painting to sculpture, which calls for greater technical support. Not to be daunted, Roychowdhury made up for this lack by training under Roman Krasaitzki in Germany when she lived there for some time and she still goes back to her mentor for short stints. That was how she picked up the basics of handling the different types of material she works with. Like clay, fibreglass and bronze.        
	Its a measure of her confidence that she has chosen figuration over abstraction. After all, the latter can, sometimes, be a cover for inept craft. Roychowdhury, however, takes on subjects with a spirited sense of engagement. And that bronze, rather than fibreglass is, clearly, her medium is indicated by the control she has acquired in it when presenting realistic depictions of form.        
	Her show, called Journey and Beyond, takes glimpses at the passing vignettes that life brings before her imagination. It is an imagination moulded by her exposure to Western art. Hence, a work in fibreglass titled A Journey Begins suggests the beginning of life not only in its egg-shaped boulder but also by importing the First Man from Michelangelos The Creation of Adam: you see the male figure in its lethargic pose sitting atop the egg. In another work, Reflexion, she quotes from Leonardo da Vinci: the Vitruvian Man is inserted between two masks while the expressions of the masks attempt to capture different emotional registers.        
	What is also noticeable is a concern for women who may be seen as victims, as in the high-decibel Trauma. Another bronze, Mukti, with the mute head of a woman attached to a knocker from which hangs a padlock, is unambiguous in its tone of protest, and in Bandhan O Mukti she is treated as a symbol of the struggle to break free of the shackles traditional society imposes on her.        
	But the work that holds the eye is Charulata, more of a tribute to the Satyajit Ray reinvention than to the Tagore original in Nashtaneer. With a pair of opera glasses resting on her hand to predicate the lonely cloister that is her home, and the hint of a benign smile on her lips, shes resigned to being an aloof, amused observer rather than a participant.

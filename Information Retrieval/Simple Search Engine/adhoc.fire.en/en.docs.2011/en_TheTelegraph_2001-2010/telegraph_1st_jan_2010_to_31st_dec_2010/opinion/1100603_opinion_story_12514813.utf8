	It may be impractically optimistic to rely on common sense. The Indian Constitution does so, but that merely gives people fancy ideas. Confident of constitutional support, people go to court instead of keeping their fancy ideas to themselves. The latest example is the group of vaidyas who appealed to the Supreme Court upon not being allowed to practise either by the government or the Delhi High Court because they had no valid certificates. These vaidyas have degrees or diplomas from the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan Prayag, Allahabad, that is not recognized by the Medical Council of India, and is not a university or educational institution, but a registered society not recognized in Uttar Pradesh after 1967. But the vaidyas went to court armed with their confidence in Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution that gives the freedom to practise any profession or carry out any trade, occupation or business. This is more than a little alarming, because it offers up the ordinary, not-so-well-off Indian to the mercies of individuals who are not only untrained but also carriers of tradition with a firm belief in their right to practise.        
	The Supreme Court has dismissed this petition in no uncertain terms. It has said that the right conferred by the provision is not an absolute one. Had it been so, India would have been overrun with doctors and lawyers without degrees out to make a fast buck by exploiting poor, unlettered people. But the logic prohibiting the vaidyas practice has its own problems when applied to a country like India. The vaidyas may not have any of the degrees required by the Central Medical Council Act, which makes their situation fairly open-and-shut, but that is not the case with the diploma-holding rural health practitioners that West Bengal has been threatening to release on its poor. By legitimizing inadequate study, the state is evading responsibility for its failure to induce doctors into villages. How safe are the villagers in the hands of these practitioners?

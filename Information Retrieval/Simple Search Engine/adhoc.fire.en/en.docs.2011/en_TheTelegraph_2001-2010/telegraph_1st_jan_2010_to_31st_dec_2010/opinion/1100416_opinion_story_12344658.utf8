	Off the hook                  
	Sir  The Supreme Court recently ruled that the Central Bureau of Investigation has the power to decide whether the Bihar state government should be allowed to appeal against Lalu Prasads acquittal in an assets case (Appeal leeway for CBI, bad news for states, April 2). This ruling was made despite the fact that Upen Biswas, a former CBI director who had investigated the charges of disproportionate assets, recently asserted that there was a water-tight case against Prasad, the erstwhile chief minister of Bihar, and an ally of the current United Progressive Alliance government.          
	On purely technical grounds, the apex court dismissed the Bihar governments appeal against Prasads acquittal, which had been put before the Patna High Court. The state government does not have the authority to file such appeals, the Supreme Court ruled. By doing so, it has effectively given a legal burial to the corruption case against Prasad and his wife, Rabri Devi. Had the matter been pursued while Biswas still held his post, Prasad would undoubtedly have been convicted. But then, one cannot forget that Prasad is a powerful politician.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In India, the term disproportionate assets is, at best, vaguely defined. Lalu Prasad seems unscathed by allegations of possessing disproportionate assets. The Patna High Court accepted the appeal against his acquittal but he was let off the hook by the apex court. There have been multiple charges against him over the years, yet he remains in the good books of the Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi. The CBI is notorious for targeting people to suit the agenda of the party in power at the Centre rather than nabbing actual culprits. It is discomfiting to know that the Supreme Court has let Prasad get away with corruption. Time and again, the Indian system of justice has been revealed to be a sham. It took a very long time, for instance, to take action against the former chief justice of the Karnataka High Court, P.D. Dinakaran. The Indian judiciary is filled with many like him.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Hungry for knowledge          
	Sir  With the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, the UPA government has fulfilled a cherished dream (Right to school but halfway, April 1). There are, however, gaps in envisaging the implementation of this act. For one, there are no clear-cut guidelines for the formation of an implementing agency that would identify children who need to be brought under the purview of schools. The act also requires both central and state governments to set up schools in every neighbourhood within three years, even though thousands of posts for primary school teachers lie vacant. Moreover, after receiving elementary education, there is no guarantee of higher studies or employment opportunities for the students. It seems that this new law will serve the purpose of literacy rather than of education. The government is yet to chalk out a roadmap for children after they complete primary education.          
	Under the new act, parents can seek legal redressal through a local authority if their children are denied the right to education. But for the thousands who fight starvation every day, it is unlikely that education will be a priority. For the poorest of the poor, a larger number of children means more breadwinners. If a child is employed in a motor garage at the age of six, by the time he is 14, he will be a skilled worker. Such children will not come forward to enroll themselves for the free and compulsory education as envisaged in the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act. Their parents will also not encourage them.          
	To make the law effective, it should be made mandatory that all below-the-poverty-line ration card-holders send their children to school, or else forfeit their claims under the BPL quota. The government will also have to ensure food, shelter and clothing for all street children, before setting up voluntary organizations for giving them education and vocational training.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan                     
	Sir  After six years in power, our prime minister has woken up to the need for primary education for all. The intentions behind the new act are commendable but its success will depend on a lot of other factors. In all probability, the act will result in more money being diverted to corrupt channels. Since Independence, substantial amounts have been allocated by the government towards education but such efforts have been frustrated by rampant corruption. Most plans for opening schools remain on paper. Teachers seem to be under no compulsion to take classes.          
	The other side of the story is equally pathetic. Even if there are schools in a locality, there are no students because the children are busy earning a livelihood. We have laws against child labour but they seem to be largely theoretical. If the children of poor families do not work, they cannot survive. For them the first need is food. A large section of Indias massive population does not even get one meal a day. For such people, it is meaningless to talk of education.          
	Successive governments have tried and failed to ensure food for all. Over the years, various welfare schemes have been launched. Had Indias population truly benefited from all these schemes, by now everyone would have been assured of at least two meals a day, proper housing, basic healthcare facilities and a minimum level of literacy. Unfortunately, this has not happened. Only politicians and their supporters have lined their pockets with the money meant for such schemes. This is evident in the exorbitant assets they seem to possess.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

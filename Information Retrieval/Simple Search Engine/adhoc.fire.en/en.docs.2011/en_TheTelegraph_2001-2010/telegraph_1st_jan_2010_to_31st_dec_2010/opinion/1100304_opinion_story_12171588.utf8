	Unlike in India, policemen arent a protected species in China. At the beginning of the Chinese New Year, one senior cop was sentenced to life, three others lost their jobs. The life sentence was given to the deputy police chief of Chongqing, the provincial capital that has been making news because of the crackdown against crime there, which began last year. Of the almost 1,200 arrested, already, about 800 have been prosecuted, including 52 officials, 10 of them top-ranking.        
	The officer who was sentenced to life is the first senior policeman to be convicted. Four others, including his boss, await trial. The officer was found guilty of taking millions of yuan as bribes to protect gangs which ran nightclubs, and of having millions in unexplained assets, collected in the 11 long years that he had been deputy police chief. These nightclubs, popular among the city police top brass, had casinos and prostitutes on their premises, and were run with the help of musclemen.        
	The 47-year-old officer sobbed as the sentence was read out. Though he agreed with the charge of taking bribes, he insisted that the prosecutors had wrongly calculated the amount. Part of the money was in the form of gifts, he said, because no favours had been asked for it.        
	However, the officer did not agree that he had protected gangs, putting forth an ingenious defence. He had not raided the clubs because he didnt want to abuse his power as his predecessors had done during such investigations. So, he had decided no action should be taken until a complaint was lodged against the clubs.        
	Citizens of Chongqing, who have been following these trials avidly, werent moved by his grief. As a police chief, he knew the law and violated it, so he should face a harsher penalty, said a student. Till now, two gangsters have been sentenced to death in the current drive.                
	Swift action        
	In another province, three senior officers had to go after the custodial death of a village youth picked up on suspicion of theft. As always, the police tried to pass off the death, which occurred after three days in detention, as an accident. Their explanation was truly bizarre  they said the 28-year-old died after drinking a glass of hot water into which some cold medicine had been added. But his family was shocked by the bruise marks on his body, which could only have been caused by prolonged torture. They filmed the body, and the footage was shown on TV, in a programme where the family was also interviewed.        
	The police could not explain the bruises. Eight days after the death, the local police chief was told to resign, while his deputy and another officer in charge of criminal investigations were sacked pending further punishment. Four others involved in the detainees interrogation were put under investigation.        
	This is the first custodial death this year. Ironically, the day the detainee died, the government issued guidelines on the management of detention centres, aimed at safeguarding detainees rights, especially against corporal punishment and maltreatment. The guidelines must be implemented by next year. Significantly, a draft amendment tabled last year in the State Compensation Law, is yet to become law. The amendment sought to expand the scope of compensation by the State to include custodial deaths and failure to prevent them. It was tabled after a custodial death was initially passed off by the police as having occurred during a game of hide and seek.        
	There is a barbarism and darkness about these cases, wrote one Chinese newspaper. The problem is that citizens faced with police and other legal authority, usually find themselves in a position of [having] inferior rights. Yet, in totalitarian China, citizens do see their powerful tormentors swiftly and severely punished, a rarity in democratic India.

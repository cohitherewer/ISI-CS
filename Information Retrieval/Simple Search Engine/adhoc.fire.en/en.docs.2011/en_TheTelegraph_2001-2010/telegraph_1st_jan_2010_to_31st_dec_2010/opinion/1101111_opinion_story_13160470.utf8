	Distorted pronunciations can be hard to take, especially if these are tied up with regional and linguistic identities. By passing the Orissa (alteration of name) bill, the Lok Sabha has replaced the name Orissa with Odisha. In the same way, the language will henceforth be Odia instead of Oriya. The Biju Janata Dal government had been urging the change on the Centre for a while, so as to bring the names closer to the way they are pronounced in the language and literature of the state. The assembly passed the change in August last year, while the passing of the bill in Parliament heralds the change that also has to be made in the text of the Constitution. The situation now, from the point of view of the state government, is doubtless pleasing. But ensuring that a name is pronounced exactly in the same way in two wildly different languages is never a simple matter. In this case, for example, there was a strong argument in favour of Odisa  or even Odissa  from a large section of native speakers, for the sh sound does not exist in the language. If righting distorted pronunciation is a major aim of the change then the new name falls a little short of the mark.        
	Changing names of places  streets, centres, institutions, cities, states  has become a political preoccupation in India in recent times, perhaps as a symptom of assertive nationhood or regionalism, and certainly as a symptom of political parties longing to be loved. Some future historian may see this as a sign of the times, a forceful attempt to erase older, less proud, eras, even though the change may cause initial inconvenience not only within the country but outside as well. The same historian may acknowledge that the time and money expended on making a simple change of name  imagine the number of alterations from just signboards to directories  is an index of the passion with which the people desire it.

	Greater common good                  
	Sir  In the article, The sacred cow (Aug 25), Prabhat Patnaik analyses the issue of investment meant for growth from a new perspective. As he says, the British introduced the railways in India to open up the Indian market to foreign goods. Yet the railways later became lifeline of the country. The development of infrastructure is the sine qua non of economic progress. It can be seen from history that even if the expansion of infrastructure, such as roads, ports or bridges, is initially in the interest of the commercial classes rather than that of the common people, the majority are benefited by it later.          
	In many cases, the socio-economic character of areas whose infrastructure has received a boost changes. Poverty and backwardness usually get reduced in these regions. Lenin wanted every part of the erstwhile Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to have electricity in order to put socialism on a firm ground there. Communist China built highways and other communication facilities to provide access to remote areas. These attempts also served broader social interests as employment and productivity increased in these nations.          
	Economic resources should be used to develop education, healthcare or the public distribution system that will ensure social welfare. Unless people are educated, they cannot add value to the work force, and the country cannot prosper. We should strike a proper balance among various types of investment depending on needs and priorities. There is no reason why expressways should be considered useless. Marx obviously could not see the beneficial aspects of building expressways since in his days capitalism was synonymous only with narrow imperialist designs and profit maximization. Corporate social responsibility was something Marx had not heard of.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Prabhat Patnaik thinks that investments in infrastructure will always benefit some people more than others. Hence expenditure on infrastructure that does not serve the common cause must be curbed, according to Patnaik. So should we not let expressways be constructed lest people with cars travel faster? Should we have potholed roads, people riding on the top of rickety buses, and motor vehicles sharing space with cattle instead? If people like Patnaik are to have their way, society would never change. Just one look at West Bengal, where ideas similar to Patnaiks have been taken too seriously for a long time, will prove the ill effects of his arguments.          
	Instead of quoting Marx to prove that development of expressways is useless for the bulk of the population, Patnaik should have a look at actually existing expressways. The Pune-Mumbai expressway, for instance, facilitates not only the movement of cars, but also of buses and trucks. Buses from Mumbai to the interiors of rural Maharashtra take this route, thus cutting down travelling time by at least two hours. The expressway has helped farmers have better access to the Mumbai market. Of course, some have benefited more than others, but that is an inevitable part of the bargain.           
	Investment in core infrastructure like roads, water supply or electricity always benefits society. The mismanagement and corruption that mark the Indian administration do make such investment difficult. But it is necessary nonetheless.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Debraj Chakrabarti, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  Prabhat Patnaik is right when he says that investment in every kind of infrastructure may not always be in social interest. In my village, there is a sizeable population belonging to the scheduled castes. The community lives in the outskirts of the village. It has been 40 years since my village was electrified. In all these years, these people have remained literally in the dark. Recently, electricity poles are being installed in their area under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyut Yojana. It remains to be seen whether electricity will light up their homes now.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The colonial powers introduced the railways in India to serve their own interests, but the railways proved to be a boon for all. Much later, when the operating system of the railways was being computerized, we were all afraid of losing our jobs. The process took time but ultimately the changes proved to be beneficial. Every industry needs new technology, which might seem a luxury at the outset, but will serve the interests of society in the long run.          
	Yours faithfully,

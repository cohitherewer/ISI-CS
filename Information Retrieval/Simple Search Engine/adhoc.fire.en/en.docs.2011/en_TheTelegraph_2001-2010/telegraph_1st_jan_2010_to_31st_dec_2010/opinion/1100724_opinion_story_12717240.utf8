The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In different garb
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN DIFFERENT GARB                          - The peoples politician and the power of dressing					 					      Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                                                      
	No one could have accused Mamata Banerjee of dressing down last Wednesday like the legendary cartoon of a dinner-jacketed Deshapriya Jatindra Mohan Sengupta demanding the obligatory khadi dhoti-kurta ensemble above the caption, Bearer, meeting ka kapra lao! On the contrary, she dressed up as befits New Delhis anointed for the chief ministership.         
	Surprisingly, our peoples politician is acutely sensitive to sartorial messages. Its meeting ka kapra round the clock for her, but Wednesday was a gala occasion when Centre and public had to be assured that no refugee colony frump would rule the Writers roost. She once draped a burqa to offer namaz at the start of Ramazan though its another matter whether Muslims (25 per cent of West Bengals population), who suffered most at Nandigram, found the gesture by a woman and a Hindu to boot acceptable. There was also that famous strip of red rag to signify a supposedly close encounter with death at the hands of her enemies.         
	She is also quick with sartorial jibes. One doesnt become a gentleman only by sporting a dhoti! she snorted in the Indian Chamber of Commerce only two months before Jyoti Basu stepped down, and the captains of business and industry who filled the hall knew enough Bengali to understand the barb and giggle, if a trifle uneasily. They were torn then between the Left Front to which they were heavily committed and Trinamuls rising star, and in view of the outcome of the following years now or never (Mamatas phrase) election, were wise to be guarded. Now, with even professional goondas reportedly abandoning the Communist Party (Marxist) for the Communist Party (Mamata), there is less need for circumspection. Magnates and mastans follow the rising star.              
	So does the Centre. It has raised no question of even moral responsibility for a series of deadly railway mishaps in unprecedented quick succession. True, one minister cannot be blamed for the shocking deterioration over the years of spares, maintenance, training and discipline that reflects the low priority given to public facilities used mostly by the poor. But some show of concern would have been in order instead of tortuous conspiracy theories that insult the victims. Yet, Congress luminaries rushed to her defence and fully supported Wednesdays rally. Didi must be laughing in her sari end at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees further discomfiture at the Union governments insistence on todays tripartite talks on Darjeeling. They will boost the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha at the Left Fronts expense with what ultimate cost to West Bengals geography no one can tell.         
	It took that tough Marxist with a beguilingly pleasing manner, Nirupam Sen, to acknowledge that West Bengal is poised uneasily on the cusp of change. But despite Wednesdays massive crowds, one misses the expectant exuberance that swept Calcutta in March 1967 when the United Front ended 15 years of Congress rule. Irrespective of political commitment, there was then a sense of Wordsworths Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,/ But to be young was very heaven. The wave didnt begin or end in Bengal. Other states also exploded into novel experiments, political stalwarts lay felled by the roadside. George Fernandes became George the Giant-killer after defeating S.K. Patil; an unknown cyclist called J.M. Biswas vanquished Atulya Ghosh. Whatever happened to Biswas? One hopes he was spared Georges pitiable fate. The hope that the United Front kindled soon petered out in vicious squabbles but there was no political retreat: 1967 ushered in the era of coalition governments.        
	West Bengal experienced another catharsis 10 years later. India had survived the trauma of the Emergency; West Bengal emerged unscathed from Dharma Viras mischief. Basu sounded a reasonable man then, intent on building on what he had inherited. No one could have foretold that the gruesome Sain murder had already set the trend for Marxist brutality or that the Left Front would destroy almost every institution of State. Bhattacharjee came too late and faced too much opposition from the cadres to redeem the original promise. Madam Mamatas actions at Nandigram and Singur crushed all prospect of a revival under Left Front rule.        
	The fear now is that she may have crushed all prospect of a revival anyway. Mamata Banerjee has been a spoiler all along, never a creator except in mobilizing people and bestowing fancy names on trains and stations. Her rumbustious speeches have voiced many genuine public grievances but rarely indicated solutions or given any hint of a vision beyond populist posturing. Some may see a golden lining in her efforts to recruit as many retired bureaucrats as will heed her pleas, presumably calculating that their administrative experience will lend gravitas to her motley crew of dissidents, malcontents, rebels, ideologues and opportunists. Some may welcome enlisting Sam Pitroda as a sign of pragmatism. But what precisely is Pitrodas expertise? It seems rather a tall order to expect one man, however gifted, to preside over the next phase of railway expansion and also turn Calcutta into London whose streets, Didi seems endearingly to believe with Dick Whittington, are paved with gold.        
	It would be nice to hope that Banerjees silence on any other objectives is explained by Talleyrands dictum that speech was given to man to conceal his thoughts. Lee Kuan Yew was dismayed when, visiting India before the 1996 elections, he found Lal Krishna Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee denouncing Narasimha Raos reforms. Oh God! he told me, This is back to Square One again. Its going to be one step forward, one step back! Advani knew Lee had got him wrong. But as he explained afterwards, he thought it wiser not to commit himself publicly to liberalization while the Bharatiya Janata Party was debating the merits of swadeshi versus multinationals. Nor could he admit, even to himself, that Indias Opposition must oppose, irrespective of merit or logic.        
	Oh yes, Didi speaks now of development, not destruction. But even she must know you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs. Agriculture must lose some land if an industrialized West Bengal is to generate jobs for its unemployed. Objecting to industry would be, as Sen told the assembly, like cutting the branch of the tree on which they are sitting. Its a pity that did not occur earlier to the Left Front. Its a pity it suborned education and politicized the police and administration during 30 years in power. Its all very well for Didi to urge bureaucrats not to sign files when asked to: they have got into the habit of signing files only when ordered to! As for her promise that there will be no vendetta, nationally, the civil service has not recovered from the Janata governments witch- hunting.              
	All this is still hypothetical. New Delhis blessings notwithstanding, Trinamuls ascent may not be so easy. The Left Fronts setbacks are mainly in urban areas. The Marxist bastions are in the countryside where party cadres, backed by peasant beneficiaries of land reform, will fight tooth and nail not to be dislodged. West Bengal can expect many more Nandigrams with the Marxists opposing industrialization  and, indeed, every Trinamul venture  to pay Didi back in her own coin. As that Indian Chamber meeting where all the moneybags who paid court to Basu bowed to Mamata Banerjee showed, Trinamul is just as vulnerable as the Marxists to the blandishments of traders.         
	After last Wednesdays chic appearance, she must be pondering what apparel will best combine concern for the Maoists with administrative ambition at Lalgarh on August 9. Bhattacharjees crumpled dhoti doesnt stand a chance. But whatever Mamata wears, Basu was not wrong in telling her she is only repeating what the communists did in the Fifties and Sixties. Its plus a change, plus cest la mme chose, the more things change the more they are the same. Fashion sense distinguishes this CPI(M) from the other one.

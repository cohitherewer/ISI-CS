                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNEVEN APPEAL                                  VISUAL ARTS: Rita Datta                                                  
	Put it down to nave expectation if you will. But the mismatch between the promise of seeing eminent artists from South India that Gallery Nakshatra (on Outram Street) held out in the invitation and the rather arbitrary and uneven pick it presented would shrink the spirit of many an eager visitor. Whether or not all the artists can be called eminent may be a matter of perception; but all are certainly not from South India. What, for example, are those born and living in cities like Mumbai or Delhi doing in this company? So much for regional identity.        
	As for eminence. Well yes, Laxma Goud, Vaikuntam, J.S.M. Mani and a few other known names are indeed there. But there are also those the viewer may not be familiar with and would like to have information on. However, nothing beyond their names and the medium and size of their work is available. Not even the titles. Nor which South Indian state each belongs to. Obviously, therefore, neither a catalogue nor a list has been prepared. The persistent viewer has no option but to fall back on the invitation card where 20 names are mentioned.         
	But hold it. Of the 20 names printed, two seem to be missing from the show: S. Nataraj and Srinivas (which one, by the way?). However, there is an explanation of sorts offered: their frames and glass were damaged. Okay, but where, the viewer may wonder, would the works of two more artists be displayed, since all the wall space and part of the floor is taken up already?                  
	Yet, some of it would be worth a look, which you could take till July 14. The works of J.M.S. Mani, for example. Those familiar with his art will recognize his lean, earthy folk of Badami, nut-brown and refreshingly rustic, in the two charcoal drawings and an acrylic on view here. The tensile, whiplash charcoal lines ripple across the surface of the canvases with impetuous brio to evoke a woman with a rooster and a turbaned man. Variations in density  of the lines and the shadings  lend elusive body to the sketchy, understated form. The throbbing welter of paint, surging about a figure in the third work, imports an infectious vitality. Another high-profile artist, Vaikuntam, presents his usual mix of sturdy people and strident colours. However, both these artists seek to delight rather than disturb. You may well ask whether their preference for settled grooves isnt costing them the adventure of new terrain.        
	Goud, on the other hand, isnt quite so predictable. Particularly because, having extended his oeuvre with sculpture, he presents another creative self to art-lovers. Interestingly, though, his signature style doesnt change radically. Viewers can compare his print on the wall here with the bronze head on display (top, right); a second sculpture in the show has been carted off by a buyer. But both bronzes have that wide-eyed fixedness of stare seen on goddesses, along with an impressive array of accoutrements, textured and designed, around the heads.                  
	Younger artists like Shrikant Kohle and Pradeep Puthoor stimulate your interest. Kohles monochrome oil is cinematic in its intimate naturalism depicting what, an internet search reveals, he calls the Life Corner. The private niche of the sensitive individual, that is. Lit by a bulb that wraps receding spaces beyond its beam in gentle shadows, it weaves an atmosphere of persuasive contraries: external reality and movement symbolized by a staircase and the still core of the artists inner self. Puthoor, on the other hand, is engaged in a quest for buoyant, wryly playful forms that could bring Arshile Gorky and Klee to mind (bottom).        
	In Kahini Arte Merchant you sense the romantics pensive pause in reality as fantasy beckons in a work thats somewhat self-consciously poetic. But her craft deserves a more inventive treatment. And if theres a disarming simplicity in Narendranath and Nandini Goud, it is Ganesh Pasupuletis capricious colloquialism that catches the eye (top, left).        
	And then there is the lozengy prettiness of Sachin Jaltare and Bala Bhakta Raju. These two artists show just the kind of pleasing, self-indulgent pictures that seem custom-made to adorn walls as obligatory decor. And finally, Ramesh Gorjalas use of traditional imagery (Hanuman and the Ramayan) and style (illustrations of sacred manuscripts), could be quite endearing if it didnt confuse Indianness with exotica overkill. Which the late Arnawaz Vasudev, a possible inspiration, didnt. Shamshad Husain and Harshavardhan are also to be seen along with the works of artists like D.L.N. Reddy and others.

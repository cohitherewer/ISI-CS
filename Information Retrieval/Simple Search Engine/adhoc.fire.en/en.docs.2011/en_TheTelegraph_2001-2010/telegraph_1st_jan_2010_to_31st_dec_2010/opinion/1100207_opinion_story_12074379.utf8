	 This must have been an invitation that caught the AICC gen-sec, Digvijay Singh, by surprise. Anant Kumar, a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, has invited Diggy Raja to the partys national council meet in Indore. But it isnt as if the two squabbling national parties are about to bury their differences. Kumar invited Singh after hearing the Congressman allege that the Indore jamboree would involve five-star meals, air conditioned tents and every comfort that money can buy. Stung by Singhs barb, Kumar retorted that Singh was welcome to savour the food to check whether it was of five-star quality. Meanwhile, keeping in mind Nitin Gadkaris strict instructions to strip the event of excesses, nearly 5,000 BJP leaders are expected to stay in sprawling tents in Indore. However, what may cause Singhs face to break into a I-told-you-so smile is that the presidential tent will be adorned with a private dining room, plasma TV, an office for the secretariat staff as well as a plush toilet. LK Advani will be allowed to use a golf cart to commute, although other leaders will have to cycle around the 100-acre campus. In 1996, when the party had held a similar do in Bhopal, Singh, who was chief minister at the time, had treated the BJP leaders to a lavish spread comprising Ratlami bhindi, paneer mircha, tinda katran, handi made of dry fruits and sweet dishes such as mawa bati and kesaria laddoo. Given the simple menu that is on offer in Indore, it wont be a surprise if Singh gives Kumars invitation a miss.                
	 You can keep a good man down, but never a politician. ND Tiwari has floated the Nirantar Vikas Samiti, an apolitical outfit, in Uttarakhand. While the former CM managed to rope in some local Congressmen to the platform, he was surprised to find that no woman leader was willing to join it. Tiwari is said to have found this strange. But few will share his view, given what is alleged to have taken place in Hyderabad.                            
	 Amitabh Bachchan was Indias angry young man in the 1970s. These days, Jaya seems to be as annoyed, and for very good reasons. The Samajwadi Party is in turmoil and her dear brother, Amar Singh, is staring at political sanyas. Little wonder then that the lady is being accused of losing her cool during interviews and speaking roughly to her aides . One wonders what Jaya does after ordering people to leave her alone. Perhaps she spends her time praying that she is spared the fate that has befallen her once-powerful brother.                            
	 Here is something funny to cool things down a bit. There is a joke that is doing the rounds in the capitals corridors of power about how and why Yoganand Shastri, the Delhi assembly Speaker, is losing his eyesight. Apparently, Shastri has stopped meeting people. The grapevine has it that he spends most of his time sleeping in his office. Visitors who call on him are told not to disturb the poor man. The doctors have advised rest, and also administered medicines to improve his failing sight. After hearing this repeatedly, Shastris detractors came up with their own jocular version. They have been heard joking that Shastris eyes came under strain ever since he set his sights on the chief ministers chair. For months, he has been staring at the hot seat without even blinking, and all that staring has damaged his eyes. Shastris eyes may be ailing but his ears are not, and he is unlikely to find anything funny about this particular joke.                            
	 Change is in the air, not just in West Bengal but also in the AICC headquarters at 24 Akbar Road. Nameplates are being shuffled on the premises, perhaps indicating the first hints of a reshuffle. Room number 9, which still bears the nameplate of Veerappa Moily, has now been allotted to Mani Shankar Aiyar. Moily has seldom stepped into this room since becoming the law minister. As for Aiyar, he lost the last elections, but has now been rehabilitated. But not everyone will be happy with the changes. Take, for instance, the case of Tom Vadakkan, the longest surviving secretary of the AICC. Vadakkan, who had been occupying Moilys room to brief the press contingent, has been asked by Motilal Vora to vacate the space with immediate effect. Vadakkan is now on the lookout for a new place from where he can hold his durbars for the newshounds.

	 Can there be anything conceivably common between the frail Arjun Singh and the brawny Akshay Kumar? The answer is, strangely, in the affirmative  Hamburg. The politician and the actor are both fond of the water therapy treatment of a particular wellness centre based in this German city. The now-out-of-work Arjun underwent hydrotherapy a few months back and returned a changed man. He looked fit and fine, but only for a while. His gubernatorial hopes were dashed soon after, forcing the veteran to take up his walking stick again. Meanwhile, Akshay travelled to Germany to undergo similar treatment. The actor, who is known to be a fitness freak, considers hydrotherapy most beneficial as it does not put any stress on his bones. During his stay, Akshay planned to learn some new exercises to stay in shape and strengthen the various parts of his toned body. The water therapy, his fans would be hoping, will ensure that he doesnt have to hold a walking stick, ever.

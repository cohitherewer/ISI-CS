The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Played with precision and elegance
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PLAYED WITH PRECISION AND ELEGANCE                                  MUSIC: Fauzia Marikar                                                  
	One goes to an unveiling ceremony of a restored painting with certain expectations. Speeches, entertainment, cameras, the usual media coverage  these were all there on July 4 at St Johns Church. And yet, the atmosphere was charged with something above all this. A feeling of goodwill and dedication, love and commitment.        
	Reimar Volker, the director of the Goethe Institut in Calcutta, outlined the programme of the institutes culture and development initiative, which has set out on the mission of restoring specific heritage artifacts in the city.        
	The occasion was the ceremonial unveiling of a painting by the German neo-classical artist, Johann Zoffany, entitled The Last Supper, which has been restored under the professional supervision of Renate Kant by young conservators of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage.        
	Enhancing the ceremonies was a programme of instrumental music by members of the Calcutta Chamber Orchestra and the Kolkata Music Academy Chamber Orchestra. The speeches were interspersed with musical offerings, beginning with the Church Sonata No. 4 by Mozart. This simple, short work was played with precision and elegance by members of the KMA.        
	The fanfare for strings, specially conceived by Matthias Emmerling and scored by the KMA, was a fitting introduction for the unveiling of the fully restored painting, spectacularly revealed in all its colourful glory.        
	The quartet composed of members of the CCO played two movements from the Quartet in E Flat Major op. 1 No. 2 by Joseph Haydn  allegro molto and minuet. The KMA Octet then played the allegro from the Divertimento No. 1 in D by Mozart and the last musical offering was the minuet from the string concerto in C, an early work by Beethoven.        
	Not only has the Goethe Institut addressed the restoration of heritage artifacts in the city but it has also been restoring some valuable church pipe organs, and recently, inspired by Reimar Volker, embarked on a course of educational modules to improve the teaching skills of young musicians. The value of this project was evident from the quality of playing of the CCO Quartet and the KMA.        
	Abraham Majumdar, intrepid conductor and founder of the KMA, has been one of the most inspired and dedicated teachers of the violin and strings. The octet played with almost flawless intonation, excellent coordination and a fine awareness of phrasing, with Majumdar himself playing a not too humble role at the viola desk.

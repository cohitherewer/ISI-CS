	The American government is doing all that it can to silence the WikiLeaks organization, including starving it of funds by getting PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard to freeze its accounts. But has it also persuaded the Swedes to accuse Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and chief whistle-blower, of raping two women in order to shut him up?        
	It is possible that a man might be a dedicated campaigner for truth and justice by day, and a serial rapist by night. So what are the odds that the accusations against Assange in Sweden were brought in good faith and without American influence? There are no actual charges against Assange. The accusations against him were first made last summer, and Assange voluntarily remained in Sweden until the investigation was closed. He claims that the file has now been re-opened for political reasons, and refuses to go back to Sweden for further questions, although he offered to be interviewed at the Swedish embassy in London. So he has been sent to jail in Britain.        
	This came as a surprise to him, since people who are resisting extradition normally get bail in Britain. Unless an appeal succeeds, he will be in jail for at least three weeks, and perhaps for months, while his case makes its way through the courts. Yet the allegations against him  even if true  would not normally lead to a rape charge in Britain or in most other jurisdictions.        
	The definition of rape in Sweden is no longer restricted to coercion, but includes any infringement of another persons sexual integrity. Accusations of rape have consequently increased four-fold in the past 20 years, and Sweden now has the highest per capita rate of reported rapes in Europe. But does anybody really believe that there are more rapists in Sweden than anywhere else?        
	According to a Swedish police leak and an interview given by one of the two Swedish women who brought the accusations, Assange was the house-guest last August of Anna Ardin, an academic and an official with the Social Democratic Party. She had organized various lectures for him around the country and they had consensual sex on the day they met.                
	Flimsy evidence        
	On the following day, she hosted a party for Assange at her home, and still seemed quite happy about his presence in Sweden. At lunch that same day, Assange met another woman, Sofia Wilen. A few days later, they travelled to her home where they too had consensual sex. The following morning, she claims, he had sex with her again while she was still asleep and this time he did not use a condom. Only after the two women discovered that he had slept with both of them did they go to the police.        
	Assange enjoys his rock-star status and the access to women that it brings, and it has made him arrogant. However, although a file was opened after the two womens complaints, Swedens chief prosecutor refused to lay charges against him. He then left Sweden.        
	So far, no hidden American hand. But another, more junior Swedish prosecutor re-opened the file on Assange last month and demanded his extradition. The man who asked the prosecutor to do that is Claes Borgstrom, the two womens new lawyer. Borgstrom denies any US ties. He was gender equality minister in the former Social Democratic Party-led government until he returned to the law in 2008. Neither are Anna Ardin and Sofia Wilen likely to lend themselves to an American sting operation.         
	What we have here, therefore, is a man who assumes too much, and two wronged women, but probably not enough evidence for the law in most countries to treat his actions as rape. Even in Sweden it probably wouldnt, and its unlikely that Assange would be in jail now if he had just gone back to Sweden and answered more questions. Not that the British judges decision to imprison him was sensible, or even defensible.

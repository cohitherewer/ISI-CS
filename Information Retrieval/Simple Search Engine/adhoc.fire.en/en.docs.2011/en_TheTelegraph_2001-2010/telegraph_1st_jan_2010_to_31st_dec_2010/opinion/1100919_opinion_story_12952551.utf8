The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Worse than any other
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WORSE THAN ANY OTHER                                                          
	A provoking character in a play by George Bernard Shaw said that he hated poverty and slavery worse than any other crime whatsoever. It is not necessary to invoke the context to appreciate the view of poverty as a crime. When the West Bengal police, after long years of indifference and a few years of sporadic action, claim that West Bengal has lost 2,500 teenage girls to trafficking in one year, it is both an indictment of their callousness and an exposure of the breadth and depth of poverty in the state. The figure is shocking enough to obscure the fact that pre-teens are not being counted. A recent report estimates that trafficking in minor girls has become a billion-dollar industry in the country. In Mumbai, which is one of the biggest markets  a port of departure as well  a fair-skinned girl of around eight will fetch $2,500 and a darker child $2000. How can organized crime on this scale manage to remain invisible?         
	It helps enormously that women are of such little value in India. That may explain why, in spite of being repeatedly alerted, the government and police of West Bengal remained apathetic. If it is about women, it is not a crime. Urged by the Centre, anti-trafficking cells under the criminal investigation department were formed by the state in 2007. These have claimed rescues once in a while, rare drops in an ocean. At destination points such as Delhi, the numbers of girls trafficked from West Bengal are slowly overtaking those from Andhra Pradesh, which once accounted for far more.         
	An administration and a law and order machinery that have been blind and deaf for years may need help to comprehend the fact that the crime has a sinister intimacy: it begins at home. Poverty can induce parents to sell off their girls to pretend marriages or yield to promises of city jobs, teenage brides can be turned out of in-laws homes or sold, the girls themselves can seek escape from abuse. An unconditional return after rescue can be as traumatic. Rescued, the girls are often married off again, or rendered invisible in some way. They themselves may reject the narrowness of their old lives. Countering the crime needs a properly planned infrastructure with specially trained personnel; it is useless to boast of newer police cells and crores of funds from the Centre.        
	It is not merely sex trafficking that should be of concern. If the police had been alert about implementing the laws against child labour, or forced labour through debt bondage, or kidnapping for training into beggary, they would also have been fighting against trafficking. Boys are trafficked too, some for sexual purposes, more for domestic and industrial labour. The police have talked of 2,500 female teenagers. Have they been looking after the rest of the states children?

	Before memory fades... an autobiography By Fali S. Nariman, Hay House, Rs 599        
	Fali S. Narimans book is a highly readable personal account of one of our leading lawyers and his fascinating personality. It recounts his eventful career, and, in an occasional sombre tone, mentions that being in the spotlight attracts its share of censure too. However, one wishes that the different parts of the book were better connected.         
	Nariman began his career in Bombay after securing his degree from the Government Law College. He remembers with fondness the two years he spent there and his three part-time lecturers who were all practising lawyers at the Bombay Bar  Y.V. Chandrachud, Nani Palkhivala and Jal Vimadalal. Nariman joined the Bombay Bar in 1950, and, after practising law at the Bombay High Court for 22 years, moved to Delhi on being appointed additional solicitor general in 1972. Prior to his move to Delhi, Nariman had made his mark as junior counsel in the famous Golaknath case, which raised important questions about the nature of the Constitution and the extent to which it can be legitimately amended. What made the Golaknath case interesting was an ambiguity at the heart of the Constitution and Chief Justice Subba Rao, who presided over the case, delivered a landmark judgment.         
	Nariman describes his decision to resign as the additional solicitor general during the Emergency as the most important turning point of his career. A year later, he was appointed a member of the International Commission of Jurists. Subsequently, he became chairman of its executive committee.         
	Nariman discusses at length his association with the Bhopal gas tragedy, in particular his role as the defence lawyer for the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide Corporation. The company was asked to pay the Union of India 3,500 million rupees as interim compensation initially. This order was challenged and the compensation reduced to 2,500 million rupees. Union Carbide Corporation agreed to pay, without admitting liability, the agreed sum of 6,150 million rupees towards the final settlement of all claims and this was accepted by the Union of India. The settlement was later challenged by some NGOs and the court upheld the validity and correctness of the civil settlement. However, the settlement regarding the dropping of all criminal charges and the judgments of the various courts led to considerable dissatisfaction in civil society.         
	Nariman has held several important positions, and served a full-term in the Rajya Sabha that he recalls as being enjoyable. In addition, the reader is offered glimpses of personalities of considerable importance whom Nariman got to know well.         
	Of the several anecdotes about his boyhood and college life, two stand out. The first is a vivid portrayal of the 21-day ordeal he and his parents underwent to reach the Indo-Burma border following the Japanese bombing of Rangoon. The family survived on biscuits and narrowly escaped the hooves of an elephant before reaching its destination  Delhi.        
	The other incident is a colourful exchange between the author and his French teacher, Reverend Father Fell, in St Xaviers College. On one occasion, Nariman had stared blankly at his teacher when he was asked to explain the meaning of the word, apprendre. Father Fell asked his flummoxed pupil which school he had gone to, to which Nariman replied with great pride, Bishop Cotton School, Simla. Father Fell then wryly asked, Simla! But man, why did you have to go so far to learn so little?

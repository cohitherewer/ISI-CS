	Bad education                  
	Sir  It is unfortunate that a grass mermaid was mutilated in a university campus, which is supposed to be a seat of learning (Burp! Morality goes grazing, Nov 26). In spite of active campaigning, patriarchal stereotypes of women continue to exist in India. Recently, a village panchayat in Lucknow imposed a ban on girls using mobile phones in order to prevent them from eloping. Indian feminists have been trying their best to eradicate such evils. Yet atrocities on women continue.          
	It is surprising that a womens association, backed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), found the presence of breasts to be offensive in a grass figure. This is an example of the blind acceptance of male ideology by women. Their destruction of the work of art proves, in a perverse sense, what Simone de Beauvoir believed: One is not born a woman, one becomes one. Going by their logic, one may conclude that the works of Kalidas, Shakespeare, Browning and others, where female beauty is celebrated, deserve to be banned, and that monuments on which female forms are carved or painted should be demolished.          
	Yours faithfully,         Saptarshi Mallick, Bansberia, Hooghly            
	Sir  A beautiful grass figure of a mermaid was brutally destroyed to satisfy the whims of a group of politically-driven women. A work of art, created and maintained with care for years, should not have met such a horrible end. Voices have often been raised against statues of women considered to be vulgar or obscene. Such outcries go against the tradition of tolerance in India. The Ajanta-Ellora caves and the Kamasutra, for instance, celebrate female beauty. The government should be strict in dealing with such vandalism.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I read with disbelief the report of the mutilation of a grass yakshi at a university campus. I was more surprised to learn that the registrar had ordered the action. Why, after 18 years, was the yakshi subjected to such treatment? Was there any evidence that it was affecting academic performance? Will the perpetrators do the same to a sculpture of Venus? And what are the staff going to do about the rest of the nation that is densely polluted with provocative pictures and advertisements?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Different perspectives          
	Sir  In his article, On not being a tree (Oct 26), Aveek Sen reflects on the photographs of Graciela Iturbide that speak to the mind and on another kind of photographs by Raghu Rai that have an OK, got it effect. So, Sen dismisses the great master of street photography, a genre for which he does not seem to have much love, in half a sentence.          
	Street photography is not so much about abstract or didactic thinking. It has everything to do with the way you see things. To quote Sophie Howarth, one of the authors of the recently published book, Street Photography Now, I think the good street photographers are masters of observation without interpretation  holding a mirror up to our public behaviour  but not in judging. In our faddish and fashion-led world, boxed in by the need for critical grounding and artists statements, photographers are rediscovering the allure of street photography in such icons as Lee Friedlander, Saul Leiter, Garry Winogrand and Robert Frank, whose works date back to the 1960s and 1970s. Both Iturbide and Rai are great image-makers in their respective areas and any comparison between them is hardly positive criticism.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  As the nation grapples with a string of scandals (2G spectrum, Commonwealth Games, Adarsh Housing Society), Goa is not lagging behind, with details of the alleged special economic zone land scam coming to light. The role of the former chief minister, Pratapsing Rane, and that of others, in this multi-crore scam must come under the scanner. However, an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation may not reveal much unless monitored by the judiciary. Only a judicial probe headed by a high court judge will meet the ends of justice. In any event, like A. Raja, Ashok Chavan or Suresh Kalmadi, Rane, too, should quit as Speaker of the Goa assembly until the truth comes out.          
	Yours faithfully,        Aires Rodrigues, Ribandar, Goa

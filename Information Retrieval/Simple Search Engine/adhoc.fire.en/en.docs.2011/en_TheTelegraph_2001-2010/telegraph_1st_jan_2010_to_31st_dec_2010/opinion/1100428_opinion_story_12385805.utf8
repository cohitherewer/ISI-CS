	The brief stopover of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, at New Delhi en route Bhutan was necessitated as much by the strategic concerns of his administration as those of India. The Karzai government has had India as one of its most steadfast friends, whose support becomes crucial at a time when Afghanistan is about to make one of its most significant and controversial attempts to bring peace to the country in the form of the reconciliation process with the Taliban. Since its declaration at the London conference, Mr Karzais proposed policy has drawn mixed responses from his Western allies. Over the past month, a greater scepticism has seeped into the Wests discourse on this issue, forcing Mr Karzai to postpone the reconciliation drive, which was about to start with a national meet on the matter that was cancelled at the last moment. India, on its part, has consistently pointed out the pitfalls of negotiating with the Taliban and accommodating them in the government. Given their links and cross-border associations, the Taliban in power would not only give Pakistan greater leverage in the internal governance of the country but also keep the region perpetually destabilized. This is a fact, borne out by experience, which India has tried its best to impress upon both the president of Afghanistan and the international community at each of the international fora it has attended since the policy was made public. It reiterated its stand in the prime ministers brief meeting with Mr Karzai in New Delhi before the two nations face their common neighbour  Pakistan  at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation meet in Thimpu.        
	India, of course, also pledged its commitment to the rebuilding and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, and elicited an expected response from Mr Karzai in the form of the promise of greater security for Indian workers. It is not that Mr Karzai had been expecting to hear anything different from India. But a month ahead of the much-publicized assembling of the loya jirga in Afghanistan, Mr Karzai needed to convince his neighbours as much as himself that the peace initiative remains in the hands of Afghans. For India, this meeting, as also the Saarc meet, is part of a continuous effort to convince neighbours that regional security is a joint project.

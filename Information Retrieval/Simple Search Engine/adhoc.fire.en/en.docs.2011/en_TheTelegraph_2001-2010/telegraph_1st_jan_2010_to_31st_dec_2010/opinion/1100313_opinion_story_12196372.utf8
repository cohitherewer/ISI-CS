                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPORTS AND THE NATION                          - In spite of newspaper convention, sports and politics do mix					 					      Politics and play - Ramachandra Guha                        A scene from Invictus				                                                         
	The newspaper rsquo;s front page conventionally deals with politics and economics; the last page, with lighter subjects such as sport. This division reflects two views, or prejudices, or assumptions; that readers like to begin with issues of import, and that sport and politics do not or should not mix. Fortunately, a quick flip of the paper allows those who prefer play to power to read the back page first. Less happily, there are times when matters of sport do also become matters of serious politics, as most recently in the opposition by a group of bigots to Shah Rukh Khan rsquo;s remarks concerning the exclusion of Pakistani players from the Indian Premier League.
    
	 This division between sport and politics reaches beyond the fleeting world of the newspaper (where todays edition becomes tomorrows shopping bag) to the more permanent and enduring world of books. Thus, biographies of prime ministers and presidents very rarely speak to their subjects interests outside politics. Meanwhile, books on sport tend to detach sporting triumph and failure from the social context in which they operate.  
	Last month, in Chennai airport, I picked up a book, John Carlins Playing the Enemy, which deals with the interpenetration of sport and politics in modern South Africa. Last week, in Bangalore, I saw Invictus, a film inspired by this book, produced by Clint Eastwood and starring (among others) Morgan Freeman. The film is barely watchable, but the book is the work of a skilled and very sensitive writer. Its subject is the 1995 Rugby World Cup, which featured an unlikely winner  the hosts, South Africa  and a still more unlikely reconciliation between radical blacks and conservative whites.        
	In apartheid South Africa, rugby was the game of the Afrikaner elite. Tough, rough, and sometimes brutal, it appealed to a ruling race schooled in war and proud of its masculinity. The English-speaking whites barely tolerated rugby (preferring the more genteel game of cricket), whereas the black majority hated it. They saw rugby, rightly, as a symbol of white domination and a bulwark of the exclusivist and anti-human policies of the apartheid State. In the 1960s and 1970s, whenever the South African rugby team (known as the Springboks) played a visiting side, it was the foreigners whom black Africans supported.        
	It was against this background that Nelson Mandela was freed in 1991, after 27 years in prison. Mandela himself preferred boxing to any other sport, yet he quickly saw that the Rugby World Cup could help heal the wounds between the races. In 1994, Mandela became the first democratically elected president of South Africa. Soon afterwards, he befriended the apolitical Springbok captain, Franois Pienaar, and persuaded him to act as a fellow ambassador of racial harmony. In the months before the World Cup, he met the players several times, and impressed upon them their historic mission. On the day of the final, which featured the hosts against the tournament favourites, New Zealand, Mandela appeared at the stadium dressed not in presidential regalia but in a green Springbok jersey. Inspired by their leader, the South Africans played out of their skins to win the championship.        
	Playing the Enemy tells this uplifting tale through the personal biographies of Mandela and Pienaar, of course, but also of a particularly reactionary Afrikaner general (who came to admire his black president), and a black militant from the townships, who grew up hating rugby but ended an enthusiastic supporter of the Springboks. The story has passion, emotion, drama, and (most importantly) a happy ending. One can see why it was made into a Hollywood movie.        
	Altogether darker and less cheering is another sporting story from South Africa, this told in Christopher Nicholsons Papwa Sewgolum: From Pariah to Legend. Sewsunker (Papwa) Sewgolum was an Indian South African who in boyhood acquired a fascination for the very white and very upper-class game of golf. Self-taught, he played with a unique grip  right hand above left  and practised with clubs made out of branches he had hacked and re-shaped himself. After winning a string of Indians-only tournaments, he acquired a white patron, who sent him to play in Europe. He repaid the trust by winning the Dutch Open in 1959 and 1960. These victories came despite a serious handicap  the unavailability, in the Continent, of food a Hindu could eat with relish. Papwa did not like pork and beef, and in general preferred vegetable curries to meat. On tour abroad he thus lived mostly on biscuits and bananas.        
	Sewgolums biographer writes that bananas, the ancient fruit of mankind, were used in past times by seafarers for their nutritional value and to stop diarrhoea. Papwa was not aware of this history; nor did he know that he was inaugurating a now near-ubiquitous trend. Nicholson thus remarks that little did Papwa realise that his choice of food would become the preferred solid of many sports fanatics. That is to say, behind the image of Roger Federer having a bite of a banana at Wimbledon lies the now forgotten figure of an obscure and impecunious brown golfer.                    
	After Sewgolum won the Natal Open in 1963 and 1965, the South African government decided that there could be no more mixed tournaments in the country. In 1967, Sewgolum was, however, allowed to tour India. He came sixth in an international tournament in Calcutta, his game affected by the heat. Still, his game was impressive enough for the Royal Calcutta Golf Club to offer him a job as the clubs professional. Papwa was tempted, but finally refused, because his wife did not want to move to a new country, and because he was himself scared that his own inability to read or write would be exposed in the conduct of his professional duties.        
	Sewgolum died as he was raised, in poverty and obscurity. It is befitting that the person who has now recorded his story is a white judge in post-apartheid South Africa. Since the tale is marked as much by tragedy as by heroism, it is not likely to be made into a film. But it is a powerful reminder of the truth that, despite the conventions of the daily newspaper, sport and politics do often mix, sometimes to less than salutary effect.       ramachandraguha@yahoo.in

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | let there be light
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LET THERE BE LIGHT                                                          
	No one  not even the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  quite imagined that the departure of the Tatas from Singur would be a blessing in disguise for the hapless people of West Bengal. There might be a few surprised, or even horrified, eyebrows raised at this statement, especially as it is being made by The Telegraph, an ardent champion of industrialization in West Bengal. But consider the situation where the Singur plant is in full operation, and so are all the industrial projects that Mr Bhattacharjee had dreamt about, given the shortage of electricity. The people of West Bengal, who are already suffering four to five hours of outages, would have had to endure even more hours without power if there had been a substantial industrial demand for electricity. The power situation is terrible without any industrial demand; the mind shudders to think what would have happened if the chief ministers wish list had been met. Mr Bhattacharjee obviously went around wooing industrialists without the faintest clue about the prevailing power situation and the condition of infrastructure.        
	The shadow of the dark days and nights of the 1980s is already looming over the state. Power cuts are back and there is the threat that restrictions will be imposed in the evenings on air-conditioners. Who knows, maybe, the people of West Bengal might even be asked to switch off their television sets in the evening to save on electricity! The conclusion is apparent that during his tenure as chief minister, Mr Bhattacharjee has taken no major steps to increase the capacity for the generation of electricity. Every time the state faces a crisis in power, what ensues is a blame game  shortage of coal, inadequate number of rakes for the transport of coal and so on. It has become evident that all these are nothing more than ruses to hide gross incompetence. Mr Bhattacharjees attitude to the problem of electricity is manifest in the fact that for years on end he assigned the important portfolio to a man who was terminally ill, and therefore incapable of discharging his duties as a minister. He was kept on, there are reasons to suspect, to placate powerful political lobbies. The state is paying the price of the chief ministers myopia and absence of political will.        
	For this plight, the chief minister must bear the responsibility. His dislike for the phrase notwithstanding, the buck does stop with him. Nobody else can claim responsibility for the chief ministers short-sightedness. To all investors, it has now become clear that Mr Bhattacharjee was inviting them to West Bengal under false pretences. If there had been industries  as the chief minister dreamt  they would have been starved of power, or the ordinary people would have faced even greater shortages of electricity that would have been diverted to industries. Mr Bhattacharjee should have the courage to own responsibility and, following P. Chidambarams example, offer to step down. Such rectitude is probably difficult to find in the darkness.

	Thinking of miniature painting, the following words by Ghalib come to mind: If one does not see an ocean in a drop and the universe in a particle/ Then one sees with the eyes of a child and not of an experienced person. Miniature painting, in its present avatar, scarcely survives in the traditional form it once used to be, illustrating books, embellishing royal firmans, and even love poems or billets-doux. After the partition, this difficult art was established as an academic programme at the National College of Arts in Lahore, Pakistan, and over time, miniature painting was reinvented as a vehicle of modernity.        
	In Search of the Exquisite at the Ganges Art Gallery (till August 5) brings together a collection of contemporary miniature art by eight artists from Pakistan. Although the participants broadly follow the conventions associated with this genre, using wasli (paper that is specially made for miniature painting) and fine brushes, they create a new visual language that is far removed from the fusty, old colonial and nationalist iconography. Appropriating the miniature form, these artists draw unabashedly on a repertory of globalized images and motifs.        
	Amna Hashmi finds inspiration in Japanese manga, although her compositions are devoid of its standard pert appeal. If anything, these concise but intricate compositions are shrouded in a patina of sadness. Ayesha Jatoi uses unusual material as well. Heart-shaped stickers with bright red roses embossed on them are ubiquitous in her work. Alluding to the kitschy truck art that can be seen in the subcontinent, Jatois stark paintings, with rows of stickers against a monochromatic background, also resemble echt Pop Art, in the manner of Warhol, or stand simply as puzzling abstractions.        
	Farah Jabeens Shehr-e-zat series, named after the storyteller in the Arabian Nights, harks back to a more authentic style of miniature painting. Jabeen captures the solitary lady of the romance in vivid detail, framing her within concentric circles surrounded by calligraphic designs and motifs. The series gains in complexity as the central figure of the woman fades into a whirlpool of patterns and colours, as if into a cosmic churning. In Shoaib Mahmoods series, with the sadly pedestrian title, Dialogue with Tradition, one notices another striking vanishing act. Spectral figures of royalty, dressed in full regalia, seem to disappear into, or emerge out of, a wall  the boundary between the perishing present and the pervasive past becomes indistinct.        
	Waseem Ahmed and Hajrah Yousaf Khan re-imagine moments from the dastans. Sexual love, a recurring theme in the miniature tradition, attains a new meaning in Khans juxtaposition of phallic and womb-like shapes. The figure of Krishna, frolicking with a sexily-clad modern-day gopi, lends a seductive charm to Ahmeds work (picture). The viewer is tempted to speculate on the little dramas that unfold in these mysteriously erotic stories in paint.        
	Ahsan Jamals Bakra series, although executed with great dexterity, is rather sedate in the end, while the nude angels by Hiba Schahbaz, creatures of limpid beauty, are depicted on a not-so-miniature scale.

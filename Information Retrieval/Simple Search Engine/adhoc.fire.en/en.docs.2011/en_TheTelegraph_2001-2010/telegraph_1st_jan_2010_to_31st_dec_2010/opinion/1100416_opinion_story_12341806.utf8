	A spectre is haunting the Indian book trade  the spectre of rising costs and declining profits. Increased overhead and book-production costs have led to higher prices and reduced volume sales that have cut into the already slender margins of a book. As the shadow lengthens, how does the future shape up and what are the prospects for authors of new books?        
	The immediate consequence of the squeeze is already apparent: a severe cutback in publishing programmes across the board. Books that lie on the periphery of core requirements of the market are out. In cold practical terms, the not-so-well-known authors are axed, or if they have to be considered at all, they would have to pay for the costs of production as well as the handling costs. Just how much this amounts to would depend on various factors, such as the number of copies to be printed, whether it would be hardback or paperback and so on. But you can be sure that it would be an itemized breakdown of expenses that would cover the entire cost of production plus overheads determined by the publisher alone.        
	Thats not all. The authors royalties would also be reduced to a mere 5 per cent of the sales price, despite the fact that the author has borne the entire cost of production. Look at it any way, it is going to be a lot more difficult for new authors to be published in the future. Even well-known authors will not find ready takers for their books. Publishers have realized that celebrity culture doesnt last too long, and therefore they have to derive maximum benefits in the shortest period possible. So, soon after the launch  paid for by the celebrity or his sponsors  the spin-offs from publication would have to be implemented.         
	But cutbacks in publishing programmes and authors contributions to the costs of production arent enough to bail out publishers and distributors from the financial crunch they have dug themselves in. They have to come up with their own austerity measures to keep going even at a minimal pace. But this isnt going to be easy because of the fixed overhead costs for establishments that are no longer affordable. One way out, as some leading publishers have done, is to surrender their earlier premises in prime locations and move into the suburbs because with improved communications and internet facilities it doesnt really matter where you are located. But these relocations are suitable only for editorial functions or warehousing; they wont do for sales and marketing that have to be located in the commercial districts, preferably in the town centres for more efficient servicing of orders.         
	So, whats to be done? There is clearly no quick fix to a problem that has been building up for years. Publishing programmes can be slimmed down but establishment costs cannot be wished away. The only solution is long-term: tighter publishing programmes based on needs that are carefully assessed by market trends and a severe control on expenses. Above all, no vanity publishing to satisfy the bloated egos of celebrities.

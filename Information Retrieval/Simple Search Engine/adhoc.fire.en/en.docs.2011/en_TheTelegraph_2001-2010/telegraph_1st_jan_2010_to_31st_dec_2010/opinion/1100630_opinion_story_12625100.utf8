	So far, there has been no Tamil conference that has failed in Tamil Nadu, although it may have had varying results  for the language, for its speakers, or for its political patrons. Hence, it should be no great surprise that the recently concluded World Classical Tamil Conference in Coimbatore has been declared a thundering success. It has led to the creation of a Rs 100 crore corpus fund for the research and development of the language and given a major boost to Tamil computing, besides tickling public memory in the right places in an effort to rekindle the fierce language pride that had once changed the face of politics in independent India. However, it is unlikely that the conference would have as easily lent claim to success had it not achieved the targets of its organizer  the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government. Much like its predecessors, the Coimbatore conference has been the perfect showcase for the might of the ruling government, particularly of the leadership of the DMK patriarch, M. Karunanidhi. But it is also from the conferences single-minded focus on the promotion of the larger-than-life image of Mr Karunanidhi that problems arise. The chief minister has seized for himself the role of the ultimate benefactor of the Tamil language and the leader of the Tamil people. It is now the responsibility of his government to hold language conferences every five years and uphold the antiquity of the Tamil language by pushing for its inclusion as an official language of India. Mr Karunanidhis selfless promotion of classical Tamil does not stop at that. He wants Tamil to be the language in the law courts and to reserve government jobs for Tamil speakers.        
	Mr Karunanidhis push for Tamil as an official language is grounded in his belief that Tamil, as the first mother tongue in the world, is superior to both English and Hindi. The argument necessarily relegates other languages to a more inferior status. This is linguistic chauvinism in its most dangerous matrix. It may revert back to the Dravidar Kazhagams earlier cry of Tamil Nadu for Tamils. The imposition of the Tamil syllabi and the job reservation plan are indications of that. The rehashing of the old formula may do the DMK good, but it is unlikely to be healthy for either Tamil or its speakers in the state.

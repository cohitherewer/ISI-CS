	Life would have been so much easier if only money could buy happiness and harmony. Sadly, the real world is far too complex; even the noblest intentions may not succeed here. Which is why the Centres directive to the states to provide monetary aid to those who opt for inter-caste marriages appears a bit soft-headed. (Half of the expenses will be borne by the Centres ministry of social justice and empowerment.) The ostensible reason behind this scheme is laudable: to realize the vision of a casteless society. However, utopian ideas are not best served by gross materialism. In India, the lure of money can drive people a long way, and a marriage of convenience often turns out to be the shortest route to prosperity. So, one wonders what the government of Goa has in mind when it offers Rs 1 lakh to couples marrying outside their caste. (The amount varies arbitrarily for the other states, with West Bengal giving a paltry Rs 2,000.) What good can the State bring, in this case, apart from encouraging half-hearted alliances? Can it foster conjugal peace, eradicate domestic violence or abolish dowry? Far from it, the gift of money actually starts looking like another form of appeasement, no less sinister than dowry, that is effectively aimed at bribing people into behaving like enlightened human beings.        
	Inter-caste marriage often invites fierce retribution. Honour killing, social ostracization, humiliation and blackmail are some of its bleakest consequences. While financial aid may help distressed couples fend for themselves, it is not going to protect them from the ire of disapproval. The most responsible, as well as honourable, course of action for the State would be to focus on the spread of education  the key to that casteless wonderland it dreams of. At present, the Centres aspiration for a barrier-free India is deeply mired in self-interest. Which explains why the Centre is yet to finalize similar incentives for inter-faith marriages. That step, as an official said tactfully, can be quite controversial.

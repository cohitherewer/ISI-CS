                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BURDEN OF CONSCIENCE                          - It is not easy to do the right thing when serving a system        Ashok Mitra                                                  
	Ancient questions do not go away. Assuming that each individual is either born with a conscience or develops one, is it always possible for him or her to act according to it? For instance, can economists working within the government system  or, for that matter, civil servants in general  afford to follow the dictates of their conscience?        
	A recently published book of memoirs, Windows of Opportunity: Memoirs of an Economic Adviser (Orient BlackSwan), authored by perhaps the seniormost economist in the country still around, K.S. Krishnaswamy, re-stirs these questions. Krishnaswamy was fated to spend most of his professional career perambulating between the Reserve Bank of India in Bombay and the Planning Commission in New Delhi. He has seen many seasons and witnessed many vicissitudes in the framing of official economic policy. A particular attraction of his memoirs is that it reveals, for the first time, the goings-on that preceded the devaluation of the rupee in 1966.         
	In the late spring of that year, Indira Gandhi had just taken over as prime minister after vanquishing Morarji Desai in a free vote in the Congress Parliamentary Party. Although she had been a minister in Lal Bahadur Shastris cabinet and had a tenure earlier as president of the Congress, she was still very much a babe in the woods in administrative matters. She nonetheless had her prejudices and preferences. Among her ministers, she shunned the oldies and was attracted towards C. Subramanian, the agriculture minister, and Asoka Mehta, whom her father had inducted into the party and to whom he had offered the position of deputy chairman in the Planning Commission. Besides, she had a cluster of senior bureaucrats, consisting mostly of weather-beaten members of the Indian civil service, to advise her. They were suave and spoke a lingo Indira Gandhi, given her span of days in London and Oxford, found comfortable.              
	The finance minister she inherited was a Calcutta barrister who, while a perfect gentleman, was without the slightest inkling of how the countrys economic and financial processes worked. Both the prime minister and the civil servants took him for granted and kept him out of discussion on issues concerning the state of the economy. The conflict with China and, on top of it, the war with Pakistan had set at disarray as much the nations fiscal balance as its external accounts. Defence imports had quadrupled in the course of a couple of years. Crop failure had led to soaring food prices. Rampant domestic inflation was having an adverse impact on the countrys exports, mostly made up of primary products, too. Foreign exchange reserves were eroding fast. To add to the worry of the ministry of finance, the Planning Commission had its Plan frame, and was pressing for generous allocation of foreign exchange to cover developmental imports.        
	It was a difficult situation confronting the novice of a prime minister. She was perplexed. She, however, had a mind of her own and could make it up quickly. Since she trusted Subramanian and Mehta and had regard for the smart talking ICS set, she decided to pin her faith on this narrow group. The civil servants had their particular biases. The colonial hangover died hard; they tended to be an easy-going lot preferring the line of least resistance, and were somewhat in awe of such formidable international financial institutions dominated by the Western countries as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Indias economy was in bad shape: the country was in desperate search for short- and long-term capital. IMF-World Bank officials breathed down the neck of the government of India. They had a standard prescription for all underdeveloped countries experiencing balance of payments difficulties: devaluation of the domestic currency along with relaxation of government controls. If New Delhi too accepted this prescription, India, they hinted, would see the end of her problems, exports would rise, imports shrink and short- and long-term capital begin to flow from IMF-World Bank sources.        
	Civil servants convinced Mehta and Subramanian, who helped them convince Indira Gandhi, that there was no alternative to abiding by the wishes of the Washington twins. Before rendering this advice to the prime minister, the civil service oligarchs did not consider it necessary to get in touch with the countrys economists, not even on an informal basis. The Planning Commission as a body too was left out of the discussions. Only Mehta, the deputy chairman of the commission, was in the know, but he was perhaps warned not to discuss the matter with the commissions two principal economists, Krishnaswamy and Pitambar Pant.        
	The sequence developed quickly. Krishnaswamy mentions an evening session at the prime ministers residence where he was summoned. He was, however, kept waiting outside while the prime minister was closeted with Subramanian and Mehta, her principal secretary, the top brass of the ministry of finance (minus the finance minister) and the governor of the RBI. At the end of an hour or thereabouts, he was called in and was asked to explain the foreign exchange requirements for the Plan. An economic adviser from the ministry of finance was asked to make a similar statement on the BoP position. All was seemingly rather bland, and the meeting was adjourned.        
	Within a couple of days, Mehta called in Krishnaswamy and informed him that, as a follow up of the meeting at the prime ministers house, a delegation was to go to Washington to discuss the countrys balance of payments and cognate problems with the two Bretton Woods institutions. The delegation, Mehta added, would be led by him and he would like Krishnaswamy to be part of it. Two officials of the ministry of finance would accompany them.        
	The delegation reached Palam airport late one May night to catch the plane for the United States of America. While they were all waiting in the lounge for the embarkation call, the economic affairs secretary in the ministry of finance drew Krishnaswamy aside and broke the news: the decision had been taken at the meeting in the prime ministers house to devalue the rupee pursuant to IMF-World Bank demand and the real purpose of the delegation was to work out the details. The occasion would, of course, also be utilized to extract from the IMF and the World Bank specific commitments on the assistance they would offer as quid pro quo for the devaluation. Krishnaswamy was stunned. Here is the relevant passage from his book: This was shocking news to me. I resented having been left out of discussions on this vital matter and told Govindan Nair [the economic affairs secretary] so; and, before we left, I told Asoka Mehta that there was little point in accepting such conditional assistance. Such a move would have serious economic and political repercussions... I made it clear to him that I was not in favour of any change in the exchange value of the rupee and also that he should not ask me to go with him since he did not have full confidence in me on such a major question of policy. All that he said was that I should not leave at that late stage in the interest of the Government and the need for secrecy. Perhaps I should have had the courage to walk out at that point, even if it meant returning to the RBI. Since the governor of the RBI was also a party to the decision at the Prime Ministers meeting, exiting at that stage would have probably meant quitting the RBI as well. I just did not have the courage to say so be it, a decision which has shamed me no end.              
	The devaluation  by as much as a staggering 36.5 per cent  did not click. Exports failed to rise, there was no perceptible shrinkage in imports, the rise in the rupee value of imports further fuelled domestic inflation which had already been accentuated because of drought for the second successive year. The magnitude of assistance actually flowing from the World Bank and the IMF was much less than what was hinted earlier. Amid widespread public discontent, the Congress barely squeaked through the Lok Sabha elections in early 1967.        
	Indira Gandhi realized she had been taken for a ride by the smart alecs in the ministry of finance. From that point on, she developed a pathological distrust of the bureaucratic hegemony in that ministry. Subramanian lost the election and ceased to be a minister, while Mehta was soon dispatched to political wilderness. The civil servants who had advised devaluation went from one cushy job to another. They have now all passed on and there is no way of knowing whether they suffered from any pangs of conscience. Only Krishnaswamy continues to rue the day his courage failed to come up to the expectation of his conscience.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dazzled by the jewel in the crown of Asia
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DAZZLED BY THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF ASIA                              While communist China continues to grow from strength to strength, communist West Bengal remains woefully inadequate, writes Shyamal Datta                        Hubei province, China, December 8, 2010				                                       
	Travelling in China for the first time was a unique experience. By chance, the visit coincided with the celebrations of the 61st Chinese National Day. Beijing looked like a bride bedecked in all its splendour. The 50-km stretch of four-lane road, leading up to the Tiananmen Square, with high-rise buildings on either side competing with one another in grandeur, and the neverending stream of traffic flowing in hushed silence, provided a marked contrast to familiar Calcutta. The roadside gardens and rockeries presented a paradise on earth with colourful flowers blossoming spectacularly, adding an electrifying touch to the surroundings. Not a speck of dust on the streets. Maintenance staff of various agencies are untiringly engaged round the clock to clean areas under their charge. Sincerity and discipline are writ large on their faces.        
	The massive Tiananmen Square dazzled with traditional Chinese hanging lights, fishing nets, rows of red national flags and large video screens projecting 24x7 a glimpse of Chinas rich cultural heritage. Thousands of tourists greeted the festive spirit with awe and wonder. The extensive use of technology for regulation and security kept the cops behind the bamboo curtain. The contrast with Calcutta, a state capital under the communist regime for over three decades, was truly stark. It was the difference between the Haves and Have-nots, order and chaos, governance and non-governance. The City of Joy looked woefully inadequate in every way.        
	China and West Bengal started their respective political experiments around the same time. Chinas tryst with capitalism commenced under the dynamic leadership of Deng Xiaoping from 1977-78, while the Bengal communists tryst with parliamentary democracy began in 1977 after they captured power, contesting the assembly election in alliance with their Left allies. What happened thereafter was there for us to see during our brief stay in China. China has developed into a fast-growing economy in the world, mesmerizing visitors, while the West Bengal has languished socially and economically, giving rise to an acute sense of melancholy and depression.        
	Over the years, China has been mature enough to realize that no State can achieve the goal it sets for itself without a work culture that believes in delivering promises and honouring commitments. China has also chosen to integrate into the global system and its multilateral economic and financial institutions, the rules of which provide it with protection and legitimacy. Today, China is said to be the jewel in the crown of Asia. The one-point programme that China pursues with tenacity and passion is development and growth. It puts down with a heavy hand all that slows down the process. Projects are completed without time and cost overruns. We, in West Bengal, are stuck in the quagmire of inefficiency and incompetence. West Bengal has divided itself into we and they camps and is yet to come to terms with the imperative to clear the mess that prevails all over.        
	China is conscious that over 70 per cent of its 1.3 billion population, which is in the rural areas, is yet to enjoy the fruits of modernization. To make the latter happen, the State has to transfer people from the countryside to the cities, where there is social instability, tension and conflict. The State reportedly plans to move 300 million people to the cities by 2020. It has embarked upon a huge project to provide infrastructure for houses, schools, hospitals, airports, roads, bridges, flyovers, power plants, water supply, transport and markets to build cities as good as New York every four years for the next 14 years. This was highlighted by the speed with which rows of high-rise residential complexes are coming up on either side of the highway in Suzhou, an upcoming satellite township of Shanghai, known as the Venice of the East, with its canals meandering through the city.              
	Although during the years of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) one of the two jade Buddha statues that is in Buddha Temple in Shanghai had to be covered with the red flag to avoid the wrath of the communist revolutionaries, China today has more than 100 million believers, following Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and other religions. This has induced a measure of understanding among the various religions. No wonder, many young Chinese these days solemnize their marriage in the Christian way after getting married according to traditional rites and customs. A touch of beautiful pagoda architecture was noticed in one of the mosques in Kunming. The harmony imparted a unique look to it. Incidentally, Muslims in China are not allowed to have more than one wife.        
	The one-child policy that China has pursued for more than 30 years has brought about a negative growth rate in its population. Thus, it has established that what is good for the individual as well as for society. The policy has acted as a catalyst to greater economic development. People appreciate that the population policy has made a major contribution in the zooming of the per capita gross domestic product income from $92 in 1960 to $3,267 in 2008. It has also registered a favourable impact on other social parameters such as life expectancy (73 years), literacy (95 per cent), infant mortality, poverty alleviation, employment and so on.        
	An unfortunate incident made us experience the quality of Chinas health infrastructure. A member of our group had got hurt at the Great Wall and had to be taken to a hospital in Beijing. It was pleasing to see a hospital so well-maintained. Chinese hospitals have exclusive arrangements for international patients. It took hardly 15 minutes to register the name of the patient, make the payment, take her to a doctor and get an x-ray done. The patient was released after examination and prescription of medicines in another 15 minutes. The staff and the doctor demonstrated quality service, dedication and compassion.        
	Before our sightseeing began, the guides in all the places offered words of caution about the peddlers, the quality of the items on sale, their prices, and the light-fingered gentry. In Shanghai, we were warned against losing our way in the crowd. So we carried a small route map so that in the event of language problem, we could get back to the hotel showing the map. Notwithstanding the warnings, some peddlers did succeed in palming off fake currencies to some of our friends during monetary transactions. Our guide was visibly upset.        
	Earlier, on arrival at the Kunming airport, one of our friends had to grease the palm of a tout operating inside the airport premises when the spelling of the name of his wife on the e-ticket did not match with that on the passport. He had to pay $200 and 100 yuan to neutralize the threat of denial to fly by the same flight. China is known for its massive bargaining power, contributed by the economic muscle it has developed over the years to advance its global diplomatic agenda. We also learnt during our stay how to bargain hard with peddlers and shops in tourist spots.        
	China is conscious of its shortcomings. It accepts that iniquities and social injustices are glaring. One noticed sprinkling of beggars in places in Beijing, Kunming, Xian and Shanghai. The Communist Party of China, which works like a giant corporation, takes pride in the fact that its rational decisions have helped lift millions out of poverty. The CPC wants its people to show greater understanding of their culture. The tourism department organizes excellent dance and music recitals depicting the cultural life and traditions prevalent during the different dynasties. The one that we witnessed was of the Tang dynasty. The performance dazzled us with its hypnotic spell.        
	While celebrating Confuciuss birthday in the last week of September, China demonstrated, in a veiled manner, that it has its own values, which stress on social harmony and moral rectitude. In keeping with this, the Chinese model envisages that people should obey the government, the State should control all assets, and that the interests of individuals are subordinate to those of local development. China does not accept that so-called universal forces like science, the rule of law, human rights, freedom, democracy, and so on are the monopoly of any particular culture or region.        
	It was a pity that we could catch only a glimpse of the Chinese countryside while travelling by train and car down to the outskirts of the cities. In those fleeting moments, we saw single or double-storeyed concrete houses, paved roads, irrigation facilities, and electricity in the rural areas. The double cropping agricultural operations left hardly any land fallow while the crops looked healthy and prosperous. Farmers supplement their income with other business activities during the tourist season. One such farmer was seen pushing old and disabled tourists in wheelchairs at the site of the Terracotta Warriors in Xian. He earns at least 500 yuan, equivalent to Rs 3,500, per day. The women in the countryside provided a guided tour to thousands of tourists, taking them around in golf carts through the sprawling rock garden in Kunming.              
	China has come to accept that it is glorious to become rich. Thirty years ago, there was no billionaire in China. On September 29, as many as 50 super-rich Chinese showed up at the contributory dinner in Beijing where Bill Gates and Warren Buffett were also present to raise funds for a philanthropic cause. During the autumn holidays, Chinese cities wore a deserted look, with thousands going off on vacation to different parts of the country and abroad. Our flight in Shanghai did not get clearance to take off for nearly two hours because of heavy congestion of air traffic on October 1. In 2009, 42.1 million Chinese travelled abroad, and this year, the number is expected to increase by nearly 30 per cent. The favourite destinations are the United States of America, Singapore, Japan and Taiwan. Of the 55 million foreigners visiting China every year, an overwhelming majority are from the US and other parts of the West.              
	Beijing and Shanghai are quite different from each other. One is the seat of power, the other the commercial capital of the country. Shanghai is more beautiful and buoyant. It is much more cosmopolitan and Westernized than Beijing. The city has the presence of all the corporate giants of the world. The mood of urban Chinese youth was aptly brought out in Shanghai by an entrepreneur in the tourism sector. Pointing at the black BMW with cute flower arrangements on its bonnet and the bridegroom sitting on the rear seat, she said that the youth prefer to drive in a BMW to their wedding. The BMW has thus come to stand for Be My Wife. For commoners, however, BMW stands for Bus, Metro and Walk.        
	It is the fifth generation of Chinese leaders  urbane, young and professionals  who are expected to be installed at the helm of affairs in 2012. They are not the product of the Peoples Revolution. Therefore, they are likely to continue monopolizing power while promoting capitalism disguised as socialism with Chinese characteristics. By present indications, they will be averse to sweeping political reforms, either internal or external, notwithstanding international pressure being brought to bear on China for the release of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo, from detention. The leaders are not likely to risk upsetting the stability and continuity achieved over the years.        
	China has emerged too big, too important and too dynamic to be rattled. Only a major turmoil could create imbalance in the process of modernization that has gathered momentum under the tight control of the CPC. Chinas economic transformation and international standing have made it a major stakeholder in world stability. It would spare no effort while dealing with dissent, big or small, in order to ensure growth and stability. Although China believes that economic prosperity must lead to military superiority, the means that it might prefer to use could be demographic and corporate.

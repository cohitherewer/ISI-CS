                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BURNING REALITY                                                    
	It might have once been the city of palaces, but Calcutta now is certainly the city of fires. Yet, West Bengal is a rare state that boasts a fire services minister. He has been there throughout the various fires that have destroyed lives, crores of rupees worth of assets and property, and structures recalling past times that could have been preserved and reused for their strange, outmoded beauty. It has happened again, at a Strand Road warehouse, and no one need be surprised that this is the second time it caught fire. But this time, its beautiful roof has caved in, while the Calcutta Port Trust, the transport companies that rent the warehouse, the fire services ministry and anyone else who could be held responsible have busied themselves in blaming everyone else. Apparently, the warehouse was packed with inflammable commodities, often perched dangerously on wooden planks where a patchwork job was done after the last fire. All this is not as impossible as it seems.        
	For one, it is not part of the culture of Calcutta, or of the government of the state, to recognize, think about and preserve whatever remains of the citys history. An unimportant but allied fact is that the city and its rulers are constitutionally incapable of identifying beauty. There is occasional talk of something exotic called heritage, possibly because everyone else seems to be talking about it, and even sporadic mention of the need to preserve the magnificent warehouses on Strand Road. But that would mean too much work, with the additional risk of having to be firm. Heritage may be ignored, of course, but apparently so can fire safety. It is far more important to keep everybody happy, as in the case of heritage, than to crack down on those who violate or ignore safety measures for buildings and material. Inspection, monitoring and penalizing mean too much work again, with the real threat of becoming unpopular. Besides, the more offenders there are, the greater the gain through pacification. A lot of people have reason to fiddle while the city burns.

	Q: In the property tax bills, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) mentions that outstanding dues, if any, will be intimated separately. While applying for a no objection certificate recently, I was told that the KMC records show tax due for the period 1990-92. Unfortunately the receipts for the period are not traceable. Is there no time limit for the KMC to claim old dues? Since the KMC did not send any reminder, can it charge penalty and interest?        
	Saroj Kumar Mukherjee, Calcutta                
	A: As per Section 217 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1980, in case of any default in the payment of taxes, if the tax specified in the bill has not been paid within 30 days from the presentation of the bill, or in some exceptional cases within the due date, the municipal commissioner may serve a notice to the defaulter for payment of taxes and a notice fee of Rs 25 along with penalty charges. The amount due by way of penalty or taxes shall be recovered as arrears under the said act.        
	Notwithstanding the provisions contained in the act, in actual practice it is seen that the tax payers are often imposed with the onus of proving that the taxes have been paid. Hence it is important to preserve all the tax receipts. In cases such as yours the penalty and interest, if any, should be waived by the KMC.              
	Q:We have been paying instalments to the builder of our apartment block since we booked our flats in 2007. The builder holds a power of attorney to develop/promote/sell the property. Till now most of the purchasers have paid 90 to 95 per cent of the price. We are yet to get possession of the flats because of incomplete construction. The construction was to be completed and possession handed over in December, 2008. What should we do to get possession of the flats at the earliest?        
	Ashim Varma, Calcutta                
	A: Without wasting any more time send your builder a legal notice to comply with the terms set out in your agreement for sale. If his response is in the negative or evasive, you could file a complaint with the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum or consumer court against the builder for specific performance of the agreement of sale and also claim compensation for deficiency of services in accordance with the provisions envisaged in the Consumer Protection Act.

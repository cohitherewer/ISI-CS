                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FOE OF FREEDOM                                                    
	Communists are congenitally against freedom of the press and against the free flow of information. They believe that information should be monitored by the party and the State and the press should serve the cause upheld by those who are in power. When communists were in power in the erstwhile Soviet Union, the regime systematically suppressed reports of State-sponsored terror. Any form of dissent was quelled by death, torture and exile. Even today, freedom of speech and of the press do not exist in China. It should not, therefore, come as a surprise that goons and cadre owing allegiance to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) launched an assault on journalists and broke the arm of a reporter belonging to this newspaper. There is, however, an element of surprise and shock because the CPI(M), whatever be its secret dreams, does not operate in a totalitarian regime. It functions within a democracy and it is through the democratic process that the CPI(M) has come to power in West Bengal. Yet, in extremis the CPI(M) does not believe in democracy. The CPI(M) only pays lip service to democracy when it is convenient for it to do so.        
	This is by no means the first time that CPI(M) cadre have intimidated and beaten up journalists. It has happened before  in recent memory during the outbreak of violence in Nandigram. It is possible to detect a pattern when supporters and followers of the CPI(M) take up arms against journalists, with or without the explicit permission of the party leadership. Whenever members of the media have worked to expose the CPI(M)s stockpiling of arms and the partys systematic use of terror against its rivals, the cadre have been let loose on reporters, photographers and television crew. Whenever the CPI(M) is shown up to be violating democratic norms and the laws of the country  two things it does quite often as the evidence from West Bengal shows  it turns against the media, thus compounding one transgression with another.        
	The CPI(M)s fundamental lack of commitment to democracy is revealed by the fact that it builds up its own arsenal despite participating in the institutions of democracy and the rule of law. Its leadership is not averse to inciting violence  witness Brinda Karats advising the party cadre to use Dum Dum dawai. In its faith in violence, the CPI(M) is perhaps no different from the Maoists. But the CPI(M)s problem is that, unlike the Maoists, it has chosen the electoral path to power and thus has sworn allegiance to the Constitution. It can be rest assured that every time it wavers from the Constitution, every time it resorts to terror, the Indian media will expose it. The CPI(M)s battle against freedom is doomed to fail.

	Wasted energy                  
	Sir  Students of Presidency College are aware of the violence that rocks the campus during union elections, disrupting academic life and blighting the reputation of this great institution (Obscene gesture sparks Presidency clash, Feb 21). These clashes go on to show the superficiality of student politics. The elections at Presidency are mainly issue-based. Intimidation of voters is a common phenomenon, and most students vote on the basis of their personal equations with the candidates.          
	Violence during union polls suits students factions belonging to either side just fine. While one of the groups takes pride in its ability to scare, the other tries to reap political advantage. In all this, the welfare of the students and the college is forgotten. If student politics could really usher in change, as it promises to, the higher education scenario in the country, especially in West Bengal, would not have been so gloomy.          
	Yours faithfully,         Gaurav Churiwala Garg, Calcutta            
	Sir  The recent violence in the Presidency College campus is a matter of shame. A college, where education should be the primary goal of the students, has become a hub of political unrest. It is strange that todays youth take so much interest in petty politics. Why do they never speak against the undue importance attached to such politics? Why do they engage in meaningless squabbles instead of spending time on more significant things? Perhaps they do so in the hope that loyalty to a party may secure them a good job. What these young people do not see, however, is that they are likely to be dumped by the party as soon as its purpose is served. So it is best to avoid getting into politics to retain ones peace of mind.          
	Politics is meant for the people but now it is used by a handful of men to exploit others. Colleges need capable teachers more than politics or unions. However, educational institutions have been politicized for a long time, especially in West Bengal. The number of sycophants has increased in these institutions, and good teachers have become fewer. Students are harassed by the teachers, the staff and the unions. In a college, the principal should have full control over the goings-on, and politics should be strictly abolished. However, since the party leading the government of West Bengal is only interested in instigating people to violent acts, can one really expect peace and harmony?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Small mercy          
	Sir  I feel Tiger Woods should be forgiven for cheating on his wife, since he is now seriously repenting his mistakes and asking for help to rebuild his shattered life (Tiger talks, tail between his legs, Feb 20). Woods is only human, and one should not be too harsh on him. Moreover, he would not have had himself admitted to a sex rehabilitation centre were he not serious about making amends. His wife, family, friends and his fans should give him a chance to reform himself, more so as he is a gifted player.          
	It seems that he waited for three months before expressing regret because he wanted to substantiate his apology with a real effort to change. It is also laudable that he accepted full responsibility for his disloyalty, and did not try to shift the blame on his mistresses.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Some mothers are strict disciplinarians, while others are more tolerant. Tiger Woodss mother, for instance, seems to have forgiven him too easily for his immoral acts. It may be nave to believe that Woodss apology was sincere: it looked more like a publicity stunt. Woods admitted his infidelity, apologized, and talked of family values only after his misdemeanours started affecting his finances. In the circumstances, the only sane voice is that of his wife, Elin Nordegren, who emphasized that the apology must be matched by a change in his behaviour.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

                
	Sir  Indians may believe that infidelity is not taken seriously in the West, but the strong reaction to Tiger Woodss unfaithfulness has proved that idea wrong. Even after Woods apologized publicly, his family and his fans do not seem to have forgiven him entirely. This incident proves that the widely held belief that Indian society is one of the most conservative is a myth.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Erratum          
	In Sunanda K. Datta-Rays piece, Towards a better world (Feb 20), it is said that Jolly Mohan Kaul worked for Indian Oil. He actually worked for Indian Oxygen. The error is regretted.          
	 The Editor

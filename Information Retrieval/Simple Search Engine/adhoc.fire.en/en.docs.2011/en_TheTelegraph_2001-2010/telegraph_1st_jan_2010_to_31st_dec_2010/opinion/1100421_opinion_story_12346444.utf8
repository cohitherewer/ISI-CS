	Stark difference                  
	Sir  The editorial, Vanished vision (April 15), was both pragmatic and thought-provoking. The quota system is a potential instrument to woo voters. From the reservations for the backward classes in institutions of higher education, cries for sub-quotas for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes within the seats reserved for women in Parliament, to quotas for minorities in jobs  all these demands are politically motivated. That is why B.R. Ambedkar believed that quotas should be discontinued after a certain point of time.          
	Even after having the quota system in place for years, there arent an adequate number of SC or ST candidates in the government services  the West Bengal School Service Commission has been unable to fill hundreds of vacancies due to the non-availability of suitable candidates belonging to the reserved category.          
	At a Depressed Classes Conference in 1930, Ambedkar had said, We must shape our course ourselves and by ourselves.... Political power cannot be a panacea for the ills of the Depressed Classes. Government agencies, human rights activists and social reformers should keep this in mind while working for the people. Continuation of the quota system will give rise to an imbalance in society, resulting in its fragmentation.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is a pity that Babasaheb Ambedkars vision has failed. This is evident from the fact that India still doles out quotas for Dalits and other impoverished classes. As pointed out by the editorial, Vanished vision, the quota system has become a political tool, and caste identity a political asset to be used forever. Ambedkar received his education in England under the patronage of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad. After that, he did not require any other favours. He went on to become one of the chief architects of the Indian Constitution.          
	The editorial is right in saying that Indians have gone in precisely the opposite direction. Indian citizens are often critical of reservations, but they forget that, at times, it is the people who support the same provision. This contradiction weakens the spirit behind the principle of reservations. Quotas are necessary for the socio-economically weaker sections, but the system should not be politicized so as to preserve Ambedkars vision.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly

                
	Above the law          
	Sir  Khap panchayats have existed since ancient times. Back then, they were respected because their judgement not only instilled a sense of discipline in the people and made them law-abiding, but they also resolved contentious issues amicably. But things have changed. Todays khap panchayats issue fatwa-like statements and take the law in their hands. Recently, they supported the murder of two youngsters, Manoj and Babli, who had married despite belonging to the same gotra or sub-caste. Even in the 21st century, the members of khap panchayats believe that they are living in medieval times. It is because of such a mindset that they condemned the ruling of the Karnal court, which gave death sentences to the five murderers of Manoj and Babli, who were victims of honour killings (Death for honour killings, March 31).          
	The khap panchayat has also issued an ultimatum to the government to amend the Hindu Marriage Act. Shockingly, even some educated people are among those who support such barbaric diktats. If the khap panchayats should judge everything, then why have courts, and of what significance is the Constitution of India?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  At the sarv khap mahapanchayat, which was held at Kurukshetra recently, some leaders openly declared that if the Hindu Marriage Act was not amended to ban unions within the same gotra, many more honour killings might take place. This shows that some people think that the law of the land does not apply to them. Their open defiance of the civil code and support for those who murdered Manoj and Babli are outrageous. It is frightening that the khap-inspired mindset will stop at nothing to punish couples who dare to challenge the conventional notions of honour.          
	Time and again, these panchayats have violated individuals rights and have passed edicts that infringe on a persons freedom of choice. The diktats of the members of khap panchayats are blots on our society. The Supreme Court must take immediate steps to abolish this system. Violence in the name of preserving family and community honour indicates a barbaric mentality that should be strongly condemned in a democratic and pluralistic society.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Exclusive growth                  
	Sir  The new tax-sharing formula, as recommended by the 13th Finance Commission, is shocking. According to this scheme, the poor states stand to lose, while the richer ones gain. It is obvious that the FC has merely gone by the growth rates of each of the states while determining their share of taxes. Can such a skewed method be considered a part of the governments much-hyped inclusive growth policy? A fair tax-sharing formula should keep the poverty level of each state in mind, rather than just the growth rate.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Tough road          
	Sir  The Russian prime ministers visit, just after that of the Afghanistan president, Hamid Karzai, may be a coincidence, but it is extremely significant in its message to combat terrorism. Karzai has expressed concern over the increasing terror activities in the subcontinent, and has promised support to, what he called, Afghanistans close friend, India (Karzai warns against Indo-Pak proxy war, March 12). But he refrained from uttering anything harsh against brother Pakistan.          
	Vladimir Putin too, in his meeting with Manmohan Singh, seemed anxious about terror threats from Afghanistan. He showed interest in efforts towards a reconstructed Afghanistan. The agreement on this matter between Russia and India will surely strengthen the relationship between the two countries. At the same time, for the sake of peace in the subcontinent, and for better Indo-Russia relations, India needs to be sterner in its dealings with Pakistan. It must force Pakistan to crack down on its terror outfits. Diplomacy demands that India be transparent in its intent to fight terror.          
	However, neither Karzais visit to India, nor Singhs visit to Saudi Arabia is likely to put the desired pressure on Pakistan. Whether Putins visit will compel Pakistan to stop cross-border terrorism is something that only time will tell.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Heavy charges          
	Sir  For senior citizens like me, who depend on inelastic incomes, a mediclaim policy is an absolute necessity. Many insurance companies are not keen on renewing policies in due time. Most of us renew them on our own before the expiry date as we would rather not be without a mediclaim  the last hope in case of unexpected medical expenses. The odds are already stacked against the elderly as far as the cost of the policies is concerned  the older you are, the higher the premium.          
	Over and above this premium, the finance minister, in his wisdom, has proposed to slap on a hefty service tax. This would not have been a problem if the tax were in lieu of a real service to policyholders. Since that is not the case, it is unfair to punish hapless citizens who are already groaning under the weight of uncontrolled price rise.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sad story    
	Sir  The judgment in favour of the mother who strangled her newborn girlchild reveals the plight of Indian women (Killer mom sympathy, March 14). Ever since Independence, there have been legislations, as well as committees and NGOs, working for the uplift of women. But have we even partially been successful in bringing about change? In the absence of education, social security and equal economic opportunities, no quota in Parliament will help women.          
	Yours faithfully,

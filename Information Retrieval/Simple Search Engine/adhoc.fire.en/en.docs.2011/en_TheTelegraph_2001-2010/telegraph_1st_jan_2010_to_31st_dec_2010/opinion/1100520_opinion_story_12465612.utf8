                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SWIRLING FROM SORROW TO JOY                                  The cuckoos call no longer means springtime for a Calcutta that can only wait for the late kalbaisakhi and fight the heat with dreams of colder climes                           Blown away                                  
	Nature is hell-bent on restoring order among its constituents, which hardly ever remain stable. The process of regaining stability often appears in the form of natural hazards. Kalbaisakhi, as experienced in Bengal, is one such natural hazard. It is so called because it is supposed to bring death and destruction around the month of Baisakh.        
	The alternating cold and warm period create high and low pressure respectively over the Indian subcontinent. As a consequence, the direction of seasonal winds changes when one of the wind systems is pushed away by the other. This pushing would not have been hazardous. But the problem starts with the presence of water vapour in large quantities in one of the two types of wind. A particle of water can be seen as a huge storehouse of heat energy.        
	The two wind systems, when they come face to face with each other, become aware of the energy imbalance between them. Here nature gets a chance to perform its favourite function  that is, to bring back order by facilitating an energy exchange between these two types of winds. Occlusion sets up a cyclonic movement whereby the two wind systems mix with one another until the energy between them gets equalized. This is a common feature of all cyclonic weather.        
	Kalbaisakhi is just one type of land-based cyclone, which has an impact over a small area. The more pervasive influences come from the sea-based cyclones, which commonly occur during the monsoon season  such as the cyclone Aila that occurred a couple of years ago. A similar disturbance, named Laila, looms large over Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.        
	The attributes of kalbaisakhi are strikingly different from those of the cyclones during the monsoon period. A kalbaisakhi occurs before the rainy season sets in. Its most noticeable feature is that it is a land-based tornado, caused by a small channel of rotating wind. The monsoon cyclones, on the other hand, originate over the sea, and have huge bases of rotating wind. The vortices of both types of cyclones travel away from their places of origin. But this movement is faster in the case of the kalbaisakhi, which often has a tendency to jump and gallop in its path, landing at fairly distant locations from its point of origin. The high speed of this rotating wind causes the moisture in it to freeze into hailstones. This rarely happens with the monsoon cyclones. Kalbaisakhis never occur before midday or after midnight, whereas the monsoon cyclones can occur at any hour.        
	Ocean-based cyclones are prevalent over different parts of the earth. But kalbaisakhis specifically occur at the mouth of the Ganga in eastern India. The Gangas several tributaries near Patna and further downstream supply water vapour to the warm winds as the land starts heating up after winter ends. The Chhotanagpur Plateau, by this time, has become very dry, and cannot supply moisture to the local air column. The warm air over Chhotanagpur is fairly dry, whereas that over the Gangetic swamps is full of water vapour, and hence, literally loaded with heat energy. Time is now ripe for the heat exchange to take place. The turbulence created during the process results in harsh storms and showers giving rise to a wide, if not curious, range of consequences  from a feeling of sorrow that accompanies the death and destruction to that of joy at the prospect of relief from the heat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Borrowed words                   
	Sir  The Telegraph sought to portray the chief minister of West Bengal as haughty and the Trinamul Congress chief as kind-hearted by cleverly publishing a letter written by an anonymous 11-year-old school girl , who pleaded with the honourable lady to suspend her meeting at the Metro Channel (Maam, please dont block roads today. Let me also buy a Christmas cake, Dec 23). But alas, The Telegraphs efforts have gone in vain. I found Mamata Banerjee to be equally haughty and angry on television recently. I am not a supporter of any political party. I was born in Calcutta and had seen what the city was like during my student days in the 1950s. I spent my professional life outside West Bengal and witnessed the progress made by the southern states. I love Calcutta and feel despondent about the fact that our best students have had to shift to Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Pune to make a living.          
	Bengals leaders do not talk to one another and pretend as if they know what is best for the state. But I, along with many others who genuinely love our state, would like to see its former glory restored. Unfortunately, I do not see that happening in my lifetime, as neither the Communist Party of India (Marxist) nor the TMC possesses the ability to achieve this.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Dhruba Basu, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I agree that an important location like Esplanade should not be used for rallies. But I cannot accept the fact that the open letter was written by an 11-year old girl. As the elections draw near, political parties are gearing up to inconvenience the city using every means at their disposal  violence as well as obnoxious forms of protest. Sadly, this is true of every political party. Unfortunately, instead of improving things in Calcutta, the citys public representatives have come together to destroy it. Calcutta is perhaps the only city where politics is given considerable importance. Be it Christmas or Durga Puja, if a party decides to hold a rally in the Metro Channel, no amount of pleading will make it change its decision. The best way to celebrate a victory is not through violence or slander, but through constructive work. One hopes that this festive season will see the dawn of reason in our politicians. Hopefully, the city will be spared of cheap and gory political gimmicks, and will witness some development instead.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Amrita Mallik, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is really painful that the media did not even spare a letter written by a young girl and used it for a political purpose. Children should be taught to follow an ideal statesman and not a political leader who lies and badmouths opponents. A child has the right to enjoy not only Christmas Day, but also every other day of the year. Obstacles that block a childs growth and happiness should be condemned. But a student should not be allowed to express views that are not hers. The media should refrain from influencing the minds of students.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly               
	Sir  The open letter purportedly written by a young girl requesting Mamata Banerjee to put off her plans of a rally so as to enable people to shop for Christmas was heart rending. In a way, the letter epitomizes the anguish and disgust that are entrenched in the peoples mind about political parties, which seem to indulge in senseless activities in defiance of public sentiment. As expected, the little girls fervent appeal failed to move Mamata Banerjee, whose rally disrupted normal activities in the city. This clearly shows that politicians are now cut off from the ground reality and are unable to feel the pulse of those they claim to represent. It is a pity that the people of Bengal have to suffer such behaviour from their elected representatives. All this makes one wonder whether these leaders are actually embracing autocracy in the name of upholding democracy.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta              
	Slide down          
	Sir  The decision by the governing council of the Indian Premier League to place Sourav Ganguly in the third category for the forthcoming auctions is humiliating. The whole exercise seems to be shorn of logic. Else, how can one explain the inclusion of Yuvraj Singh in the top tier, even though he is no longer a first choice for the Indian Test or one-day side? Brand Dhoni, unsurprisingly, has been placed in the most lucrative category. But Ganguly, despite being a successful Twenty20 batsman in the last two years, has been clubbed along the likes of Dravid, Kumble and Laxman. Yusuf Pathan and Suresh Raina, who are yet to prove themselves consistently, have been given much more than they deserve. Is it really too much to demand a little more respect for Ganguly?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Pujarini Banerjee, Calcutta

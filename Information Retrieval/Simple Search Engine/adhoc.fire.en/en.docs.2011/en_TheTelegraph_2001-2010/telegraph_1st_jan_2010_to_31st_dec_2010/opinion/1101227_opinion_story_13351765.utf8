	The National Crime Records Bureau may be indirectly saying something perceptive about men who live in West Bengal. According to its 2008 statistics, West Bengal has the highest number of battered wives. The rate of domestic violence against women in the state is the highest in the country. The man in Bengal seems bravest at home; he is too shy to demonstrate his muscle outside. He also values his public image as the well-bred gentleman. In dowry-related deaths, West Bengal comes fifth. That is not too bad either, considering that the husband in such cases often gets the help of his family. The recent law against domestic violence requires protection officers to ensure that women are not hurt in the home. According to surveys conducted by 21 voluntary organizations in seven districts, West Bengal does have one officer per district. This is pitifully inadequate, given the scale of wife torture. But the solutions the organizations have suggested are worth looking at.        
	Instead of a smattering of protection officers, they have suggested, local panels should look into domestic violence  in each ward perhaps, or under the relevant panchayat. In an ideal world, this would be meaningful. But a social and cultural environment that breeds cruelty towards girls and women can hardly generate panels that would address domestic violence impartially. Besides, the intense politicization of society has totally undermined the social and familial space. Panchayats often punish women who have been molested or even raped, while letting the offender go scot-free, or with just a fine. Their members come from the same families that insult and demean their women. Such local bodies, therefore, are unlikely to stem violence in the home. The need for a change of mindset is urgent, but that is dependent on factors such as universal education, cultural exposure, economic opportunities and so on. Before that happens, the government must be persuaded to take the predicament of women in the state seriously. That may be the most difficult.

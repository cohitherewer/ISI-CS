	The message of John Maynard Keynes, that in a downturn countries should run fiscal deficits and central banks should ensure that the deficits are financed at low interest, is received wisdom now; it has been the basis of anticyclical policies pursued by Western governments since Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. But governments consistent policies have not reassured the markets enough. As one crisis followed another, markets refused to believe that it was the last one. This fear has underlain the fact that, despite stimulus packages, Western economies have grown less than they are capable of, and have experienced serious and growing unemployment. With so much happening in so many countries, it is difficult to make sense of it all together; the flourishing community of economic commentators has not made it any easier. A practitioners word is more valuable than a commentators; amongst practitioners, there is hardly one with a reputation to match George Soross. What he said during a recent visit to Berlin deserves a serious hearing.        
	The point he made was that when West European countries created a common currency and a central bank, they omitted to create a common treasury. They, therefore, gave an implicit guarantee to their fellow member governments that their fiscal deficits would be financed and their national debts repaid. But there was no name attached to the guarantor. That is where the trouble has arisen. After the Greek crisis, the governments created a stabilization fund of 750 billion euros  a third of it from the International Monetary Fund and the rest from members of the European Union. But that has meant that failed and vulnerable countries have guaranteed their own debt; the market does not quite trust that guarantee. It sees through the veil; behind it, there is only one country, Germany, which is large and solid enough to honour the guarantee. And the market has become nervous because the German government has created doubts about its willingness to shoulder the burden of the EU. The resulting uncertainty has forced down the euro against the dollar. That has improved the European, especially the German, balance of payments, but it has done nothing to reduce the burden of national debts.        
	Germany has made it clear to its fellow member countries that it will not go on rescuing them and that they must take steps to repay their national debts if the market considers them excessive. They are still to do so. But if they do, it will reduce aggregate demand in those countries and raise their unemployment rates even further; that is the way to a real depression. This is one more instance of the policy dilemma that countries face when they undertake Keynesian reflation: when should they withdraw the stimulus and start repaying their loans? A single government may work out some solution with difficulty; but for a community of governments, a common answer is impossible to reach.

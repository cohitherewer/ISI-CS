	Little hope                  
	Sir  It was very thoughtful of Mamata Banerjee to recommend free rail travel for cancer patients. However, they are already entitled to a considerable discount on train tickets. But availing of these discounts is a formidable task. As an attendant to a cancer patient, I have visited several booking centres in Calcutta with the prescribed form from the hospital, duly filled, stamped and signed by the doctor, only to be rejected by the clerk on flimsy grounds. Given the present attitude of officials, obtaining a free ticket promises to be a hopeless exercise.          
	Yours faithfully,        Monila De, Kalimpong
        
	Under a cloud          
	Sir  S.L. Raos analysis of generation of power from one of the sources of renewable energy  solar power  was interesting (Straight from the sun, March 22). Both thermal and photovoltaic technologies, which are used in the generation of electricity from solar energy, are costly. However, a lot of space is required to implement both these techniques. Moreover, in each case, power generation will not remain constant in all seasons and at all places  production will be higher in regions where there are more sunny days in a year. Therefore, solar power cannot be used as the only source of energy in any country for a constant supply of power. It must be supplemented with other forms of energy.           
	Rao rightly states that, given the heavy costs, the inclusion of solar energy on the national grid in India is not a feasible option as of now. There are many remote localities in the country that cannot be connected using the existing networks. If solar power is to be taken to those areas, it will have to be done through isolated solar units, in which case the locals will have to be trained for the maintenance and upkeep of those units. A look at the global figures will show that Indias progress in creating electricity from solar energy has boon slow. This is on account of the high costs involved.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Harsh reality          
	 Sir  The increasing number of unemployed youth in Calcutta is a matter of shame for the state government. No significant effort has yet been made to bridge the gap between academic learning and vocational training. Therefore, students with masters degrees remain jobless unless they can arrange for funds to finance professional courses. Private companies, taking advantage of this desperate situation, exploit these people by offering meagre salaries for long hours of work. Government jobs are hard to come by. I have nothing against MNCs, but I have seen people lose jobs unexpectedly. Since the government is doing little to generate jobs, many people have no option but to queue for posts that come with little or no security.            
	Yours faithfully,

	Quick end          
	Sir  The Indian Premier League has proved to be the best in show business. The league has also killed the spirit of sportsmanship. Cricket is now played all the year round. So much so that it has become a boring affair. The sport is also given so much importance that Indians are losing interest in other games. Talented sportsmen, other than cricketers, are thus seldom written about.          
	The IPL should be blamed for ruining the future of other games. It has also started at a time when board examinations are taking place. One hopes it ends quickly, and perhaps once for all.           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TAKE A NEW PLEDGE                                  BONAFIDE: Malvika Singh                              
	India seems to have got itself into a mess. Every single institution is either corrupt and moribund or completely out of sync with the changed times. Stuck in their comfortable time warps, the men and women who control our delivery mechanisms and operating systems have compelled this energetic and young nation to mark time and, in many cases, to dilute the very substance that generates growth and progress to facilitate meaningful international partnerships that could bring hope and dignity to the millions who are living in a dismal condition.         
	Governments in India, through the decades, have successfully alienated half the population by sheer neglect and exploitation of its patience and goodwill. The fact that the ruling class is not ashamed of what it has inflicted upon this civilization after Independence makes one shudder in amazement.         
	The bureaucracy has become rogue, and the elected political class, instead of whipping the administrators into shape by demanding that they perform with integrity, has condoned and encouraged the corrupt and unethical processes that govern India. Upright manners and appropriate attitudes towards the citizen have ceased to be the hallmark of the Indian Civil Service. The standards that this service has set leave much to be desired.         
	We, the subjects of the State, are left with neither any models of integrity and of public service nor any heroes to look up to. We have been forcibly reduced to internalizing our shame as we grapple with the degradation of our polity, our space and, therefore, ourselves.        
	Our educated and experienced leaders have consistently perpetuated the worst kind of horrors to suppress the people. This has been done consciously to garner votes from vote banks in a desperate bid to remain in power. The leaders have operated like feudal lords of the Dark Ages, using the superficial garb of democracy as a veil for their petty potentate behaviour.                
	Pure rage        
	The media have managed to reveal some of the despicable truths. Seeing our leaders lie and then run for cover behind GoMs that deliberate on how to enhance the status quo can only generate anger. That anger will lie concealed for some time. Then it will erupt and no arms and ammunition of the State will be able to quell it. India needs a new messiah and not merely a rate of growth that accentuates the divide. Both have to happen simultaneously for Indians to benefit. This requires real debate, discourse, meetings and plans. The intellectual laziness we have been witnessing for some time now can only fuel the anger. Glib talk no longer assuages the frustration and the sense of being exploited. India needs to be led by political passion and commitment. We need another, modern-day Gandhi.         
	My generation has seen the best of Independent India, and it is a tragedy that we will leave behind a country that has been brutalized by the few who were privileged to be on top of the pile. Our natural environment has been mutilated; our pluralistic culture, with its rich and vital strengths and many layers, has been allowed to rot; our material and man-made heritage is in an appalling condition across the vast subcontinent, neglected by those mandated to protect it and create the infrastructure for a civil society.         
	On the occasion of Diwali, the government of India and of all the states should come together on a national platform  Doordarshan  and pledge to begin the process of cleansing. Alas, no one at the helm will admit the guilt. No one will take the bull by its horns. And India waits with suppressed anger.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IDENTITY CRISIS AT 125                                                          
	A political formation, which, at its inception, was reviled as a body representing a minuscule minority grew to become a political party with a huge mass following. This, in short, is the history of the Congress Party over the last 125 years. The size of the Congress is its obvious strength; it is also, and not so obviously, its weakness. The Congress grew in size in the 1920s under the leadership of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who transformed its organization by linking locality, province and nation. The Congress ceased to be a body of Western-educated Indians (and a few like-minded Britons) who met once a year at the end of December and became a powerful political organization that was at the forefront of Indias freedom from British rule. Many were called under the Congress umbrella, irrespective of their caste, class and creed. It was this coming together of large sections of the Indian population that made the Congress a unique and potent political force. Its character began to change as freedom and transfer of power beckoned, and the Congress began to stand forth as the representative of the independent Indian nation-state. This claim was fortified by its strong commitment to democracy and secularism.        
	Since Independence, barring a few years, the Congress has been the party in office. It can no longer take this position for granted. Its appeal to the Dalits and the Muslims has been eroded by the rise of other political parties in both north and south India. Its standing as a national party has been challenged by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Its espousal of socialism has been diluted by the coming of the era of economic reforms that was inaugurated in 1991, when a Congress government was in power. Its pride that it was a party of self-sacrificing, honest people now lies in tatters. The growth of the party and the lure of the loaves and fishes of office have denuded the Congress of its idealism and direction.        
	While the government that the Congress leads promotes economic reforms and chases 10 per cent growth in gross domestic product, the Congress scrambles to retain its identity as a party of the poor. There is a separation, after a long time in the history of the Congress, between the party and the government. This is healthy for democracy but it does not add to clarity in policy formulation. In its 125th year, the Congress looks, and perhaps also feels, a trifle jaded. A revival of its flagging spirits and a renewal of its identity kit demand more than rhetoric and platitudes. The Congress desperately needs new ideas. The mind has gone out of the Congress: the residue is self-interest. Can the Congress live up to what the nation expects? Or will it become just a party with a remarkable history? The answers will determine Indias future.

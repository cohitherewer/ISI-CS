                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FILTHY LUCRE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Shashi Tharoor has been removed from the council of ministers because of the strong perception that he was indulging in unwarranted commercial activities using his official position to ease the entre and procedures for friends and family. There should be a similar exercise, conducted with the same kind of rigour, to oust others in the cabinet and in the council who have, for years, indulged in inappropriate activities that have conveniently been ignored for the political purpose of keeping the coalition intact. Now that the prime minister has set an example of hanging one of his own, he should begin the cleaning process and the rest, however heavyweight they may be, should be put through the same procedure. It would be wonderful to witness the beginning of the end of abject hypocrisy in the party politics of the Congress that has plagued India for decades.        
	That corruption is condoned at the highest level of governance is a given here. This has been responsible for the suffocating corruption at every level of Indian society affecting us in some shape or form. It has wormed its way into the fabric of this civilization. The political and administrative classes have grown fat on dirty lucre and have spent the better part of their working hours accumulating wealth for themselves. India has, in the process, been misgoverned, and led into an anarchy, both political and societal.        
	The much-touted economic growth and rising percentages have happened because Indians have forced themselves out of this administrative stranglehold, and have found ways and means of generating wealth despite the horrors of the government and its bizarre colonial rules. With infrastructure not keeping pace with growth and aspiration, chaos has ensued.                 
	Future saviours        
	The people of India have surpassed the government in every way. The people represent entrepreneurship and innovation, while the administration represents corruption and ineptitude, non-delivery of goods, and faulty processes.        
	For an outsider watching this rather unreal scene that unfolds every passing day, it is becoming clear that no leader in power wants to rock the boat and overhaul the prevailing system. The comfort of being in power and holding positions, with free homes and endless free services, seems to lull the best of individuals into a stupor that smacks of lethargy, unacceptable to a citizenry that expects service from its elected representatives.        
	The Naxalite problem is a stark example of the failure to deliver the basics. The prime minister needs to address the exploited and brutalized people and tender some reassurance to them. He is a man outside the traditional political framework of rapacious politicians, and, therefore, stands a better chance of being trusted. Why does he not take the bull by its horns? Why are issues pertaining to relations with Pakistan and the United States of America taking precedence over internal, volatile realities? Surely, the foreign minister, if selected sensibly, could have done what the prime minister spends his valuable time doing?         
	The time seems right to have a cabinet overhaul. If the same people have to sit on those exalted chairs, sports should go to Sharad Pawar and agriculture to Manohar Gill for a start. Salman Khurshid would make an effective foreign minister and S.M. Krishna could retire gracefully. The younger, serious politicians, who are excited about the challenges and about the future, will not venture into cabinet or the council because it will make them redundant in the larger national scheme. The archaic and failed mechanisms of governance, the scheming mindset of politicians and their appalling attitude towards their colleagues, leave much to be desired. Maybe those who remain on the ground, working to build their political parties, will be the saviours of this great nation.

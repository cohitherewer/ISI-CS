	Like everybody else, authors hate to be ignored. Who can blame them? Anyone who has worked for a year or more to put together 100,000 saleable words that would persuade unknown persons to pay good money expects at least an acknowledgment of the job done. Of course, publishers and literary agents go some way in assuaging the ego of the authors but that isnt the same thing as a review in a national newspaper or journal.        
	Some questions arise here. Do reviews help the sales of books? Do publishers fix the reviewers, in a tacit understanding with newspapers and journals? Is it the review or the reviewer who ultimately convinces the reading public of the worth of books?        
	There are many reasons why reviews are hard to come by, starting from the fact that every year there is an increase in the number of titles competing for attention. So the literary editor plucks out the titles from the slush pile of books that are topical or fashionable. Scholarly books that are often spun out of doctoral theses are quickly discarded. As a matter of fact, most national newspapers have a list of subjects to be avoided.         
	No set of proscriptions is good for all times, but the editor knows whats in and whats out. Subjects linked to news  such as a current war or an expos of corruption in the establishment  move up the line, as do books that tackle the fundamentals of human existence. (God is in fashion these days.) Where does that leave the novel and countless other books that have no clearly identifiable market? In a very weak position, is the answer.        
	Because of increasing competition, publishers do fix reviewers, especially for big books in which they have invested heavily. There are a number of ways in which fixing is done, but the most obvious method is through launch parties and the authors active participation in the promotion of the book.         
	It must be said that there are a number of booklovers who digest reviews with a heavy dose of cynicism. Often critics themselves are authors who are wary of saying anything that might invite criticism when they next publish a book. So they take the easy way out by not saying anything that might be construed as criticism. But the conscientious reader can see through the guise and not take the review seriously.        
	So, is it the review or the reviewer who matters? For the publisher who is interested in the sales of his book, the reviewer who does not shy away from real criticism does much to influence the buying habits of readers. Faint praise is so much wind, and the reader knows it.

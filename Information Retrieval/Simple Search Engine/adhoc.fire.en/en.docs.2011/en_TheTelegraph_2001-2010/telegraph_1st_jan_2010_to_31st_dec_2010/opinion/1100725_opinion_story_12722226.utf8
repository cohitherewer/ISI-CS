                              Above criticism        
	 At 125, the Congress is not getting any younger. Yes, there has been infusion of new blood, but that has done nothing to stop the expected memory loss. For example, the party now can hardly recall the principles that governed its relations with the government for so long. Today, the government is no longer the tactful and young daughter-in-law and the party, the benevolent and elderly mother-in-law they once were. Now the former calls the shots in the form of Sonia Gandhis National Advisory Council, which has pushed the party to the sidelines. Key issues are hardly ever discussed in the Congress Working Committee or the AICC general body. It is the NAC that steers policies. The 125-year-old party also seems to have forgotten the place it once accorded to constructive criticism. Half a century ago, Atulya Ghosh could air unhindered the Bengal party units views  at odds with those of the core leadership  on Dhanbads separation from Bengal during the 1956 reorganization of states. Today, even a hint of criticism of P. Chidambarams Maoist policy is enough to invoke a gag order on office-bearers in the party. Getting batty as well?                            
	 The Commonwealth Games is taking its toll, and not merely on peoples nerves and ministers energies. It is doing strange things to our memories as well. Suresh Kalmadi, the Indian Olympic Association chief, is said to be so obsessed with the games that he has forgotten that his job also has to do with the improvement of sports in the country. When someone asked him at a recent meeting why he was not talking about players preparations and merely focusing on the construction work, Kalmadi is believed to have remarked, Yes, yes. We must get a couple of medals, so that we can bid for the Olympics.                            
	 No matter how much the minister of external affairs, SM Krishna, may be wishing to bury the memory of the Islamabad fiasco, its ghost seems to be by his side forever. Within his own party, there is now speculation whether Anand Sharma, the Union minister for trade and commerce, would have performed better than Krishna in front of SM Qureshis bluster. Some people seem to be thinking of Shashi Tharoor. They believe that Tharoor would not only have given Qureshi a taste of his own medicine, but also used a language that would have left Qureshi unsure of whether he ought to laugh or cry.                            
	 The Indian Womens Press Corps witnessed the mother of all ideological battles recently. The spat had to do with whether it should extend an invitation to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief, Mohan Bhagwat. In the last 15 years, the IWPC has played host to many leaders, including PMs and CMs, as well as artists, authors and others, but never did it witness such a tussle. The executive body of the countrys most prominent womens media organization in the capital saw a section of the ladies rooting for an interaction with Bhagwat while the leftist-activist kind dug their heels and opposed the meeting on the ground that the RSSs credentials were not secular. Finally, the lobby favouring an open-door policy won the day. Bhagwat may now walk into 5 Windsor Place any time.                             
	 The two main Left parties that jointly called the Bharat bandh competed fiercely to take credit for the move. The CPI leaders had reached the spot well before the scheduled chakka jam at ITO in Delhi. When the CPI(M)s Brinda Karat reached the place, she saw that the CPIs AB Bardhan and D Raja had managed to steal the show. When it was time to court arrest, the CPI leaders boarded a DTC bus. The CPI(M) leaders and supporters stayed back and waited for another bus. Later, a CPI(M) leader was seen shouting at a police officer, asking him why his comrades were taken to two different police stations while the CPI leaders were all sent to one police station.                            
	 The southern film industry is famous not only for its glitzy stars, their fanatical fans and huge posters but also for razor-sharp dialogues. Here is one: in Rajnikanths latest Tamil film, the hero apparently threatens: I will hit you so hard that even Google will not be able to find you.                        
	 The ace film director, Prakash Jha, is a man of his word. When his superhit film, Rajneeti, was being shot in Bhopal, some of the local artists had predicted that it would be a grand success. Jha, who had overheard the remark, had promised them a lavish party if they were proved right. Last week, Jha was constantly on the phone, personally inviting many of these soothsayers. The word is that a big bash will be organized, to be attended by the top stars of the film world as a mark of celebration.      
	Meanwhile, Katrina Kaif, whose performance in Rajneeti was appreciated by the audience, is reported to be particularly excited about visiting Bhopal again. It was during her two-month stay in the city that she struck a friendship with colleagues Arjun Rampal and Ranbir Kapoor. Katrina calls them Bho-pals.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNSEEMLY IRE                                                    
	The contention between the judiciary and the executive on what to do with rotting foodgrains has got increasingly strident. It began with an order passed by the Supreme Court on a PIL petition filed by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties. It asked the government to distribute foodgrains free to the poor. The minister of agriculture chose a meeting of his party in Mumbai to reject the Supreme Courts direction, citing the Rs 66,000 crore subsidy the government was giving on the public distribution system. He seemed to think that the government could not spend more. He also blamed the state governments; according to him, they took away the foodgrains they needed for distribution in the Antyodaya scheme, which they got at Rs 2 a kilogram, but did not take grains for other rationing schemes for which they had to pay more. The Supreme Court sent Sharad Pawar a message  that its direction to give the poor foodgrains free was an order, not a suggestion. The agriculture minister rushed to Parliament and assured it that he would carry out the Supreme Courts order. But then, Somnath Chatterjee piped up to say that the Supreme Court had exceeded its jurisdiction; buoyed by his expert opinion, the prime minister told the Supreme Court to keep out of policymaking. And buoyed by Mr Pawars expert opinion, he also said that free distribution was not practical.         
	The prime ministers exasperation is understandable. But there is something more here than the judiciary overreaching itself. Rotting foodgrains are a graphic picture to pin on a government, and its chief cannot be comfortable with it. He also obviously thinks that the governments case has not been understood by the judges. But since the entire debate is being conducted in public, he has the choice of putting his case to the public. And if he takes the time to do that, he may find that he does not have a case.         
	The government is already giving foodgrains to those whom it chooses at throwaway prices; to give it at zero price requires no greater effort. He surely cannot take the cost argument seriously. The government runs enormous fiscal deficits, and has disregarded all rules to limit them; surely it is within his power to spend some more thousand crore on foodgrain subsidy. And his agriculture minister has said that the state governments take all the grain they are offered at prices of Rs 2 a kilo, but baulk at paying more. So all the government has to do is to offer all the grain free to them. What holds the prime minister back?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | time to reform
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME TO REFORM                                                    
	Few communists, in China and elsewhere, now care to read Liu Shaoqis How To Be a Good Communist. But some communist parties periodically undertake rectification programmes for their members. A similar exercise currently under way in the Communist Party of India (Marxist) shows how futile and irrelevant it can be. What goes on in these campaigns are no more than morality checks on party members. An erring member may be expelled from the party or even hounded to death, as seems to be the case with W.R. Varadarajan, the CPI(M)s central committee member. His death has now forced some leaders of the party to raise questions about the rectification programme. But the reactions so far suggest that they are asking wrong and inconsequential questions. Any political party expects its leaders and members to follow some basic norms of public life. That a public person should not indulge in corrupt or immoral practices has nothing to do with any political ideology. A serious introspection by a party has to involve bigger issues of policy and organizational functioning.        
	For the CPI(M), a worthwhile rectification drive should involve questions about some basic tenets of the organization as well as some old practices. It is time, for instance, the party asked itself if leaders not elected by the people should continue to hold party posts, including that of the general secretary. A communist party that chooses to work within the norms of parliamentary democracy cannot have a cabalistic approach to its own organization. This is an important issue because leaders without a popular mandate play crucial roles in deciding policies or strategies for governments run by the party. The punishment that apparently drove Varadarajan to his death should also raise questions about the charade of democratic centralism in communist parties. It is an open secret that this particular tool is used only to stifle dissenting voices within the party and is thus brazenly undemocratic, just as the party elections are stage-managed affairs. Such fundamental issues, and not moral or other aberrations of members in their private lives, should be the focus of any self-correction drive by the CPI(M). Not rectification, but a genuine reform is what the party needs. But then, the CPI(M) is so averse to changing its own ways that it would rather perish than reform itself.

	Another Independence Day has gone by, but unfortunately, more and more Indians are less and less independent as they struggle to live a life of dignity and purpose in an environment that has been reduced to administrative loot and corrupt practices. The rule of law has been used against the honest, as the crooked get protection and are eventually allowed to run free. Exploitation by the few continues unabated, and there is no apparent sense of guilt or urgency to implement correctives. Tainted men and women walk the talk with brazen confidence, reducing all morality to nothingness. A new generation is being nurtured on these unacceptable ethics that have destroyed civil society in this great land that is Bharat.        
	In this morass, anonymity equals survival because mediocrity is celebrated and ignominy honoured. Lobbyists, middlemen, touts and suchlike have access to the powerful. Right and wrong have merged, nothing is sacrosanct, not even individual faiths. Tolerance has become a distant mirage. Personal agendas, laced with greed but covered in a fabric called growth, have begun to override the law. Points of reference that are sane and powerful can be counted on the fingers of one hand.        
	We have permitted the few, the ruling class, to disable a great civilization. Why do we need forthcoming events to deliver roads, electricity, clean cities, metros and other modes of transport? Surely, the job of municipalities is to ensure that cities and towns have the basic infrastructure well-oiled and functioning. We have seen, over the decades, how municipalities have neglected towns and cities forcing them to become cesspools. Loot, at the cost of the tax-payer, has been the norm with no checks whatsoever. The ruling class has been unwilling to bell the cat and restructure the corrupt delivery system.                
	Ugly truth        
	The political and administrative classes ride through the muck with sirens clearing their path, often with tinted windows to keep out the ugly truth. They live in areas where the municipal establishment is instructed to keep the streets clean and repaired, ensure uninterrupted supply of water and electricity, and more. This is what happens when an empire is ebbing and is about to end. History is replete with examples. Has India reached that critical point? Are we heading towards a balkanization of states? Is this loss of control pointing to a new political narrative?        
	Kashmir, a valley that was on the mend, has erupted in a demand for azadi. The demand is fast becoming a peoples movement, which it wasnt earlier. What we call the Maoist/ Naxal movement is a peoples movement against the establishment that has ignored their basic demands. Tribals and poor people have been exploited for decades. Serious initiatives are required with true commitment to deliver them.         
	In Punjab, the demand for a different kind of freedom is rearing its head with Bhindranwale stickers slapped on taxis that ferry Sikhs visiting home from different parts of the world. Many states are asserting themselves, demanding autonomy, but often the indicators of such assertions are overlooked. Restructuring an emerging nation state requires thought and debate, but no leader seems to be driven by that challenge. The administration of India 2010 is in denial.         
	In a strange way, the states that are progressive as well as economically on the move do not want to be bogged down by an overpowering Centre that relentlessly operates on an archaic mix of colonial and Stalinist premises built on redundant fundamentals. Like oil and water, the two do not meet. At times like this, dictatorial measures are brought into play by unimaginative rulers in an effort to silence public opinion and stay on in the gaddi.

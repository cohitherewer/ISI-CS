	What makes the leadership change in Brazil a talking point is that its predictability did not occlude a change of tremendous historical and sociological importance. It is perhaps an accident that the successor of Brazils most popular president, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, is a woman. Yet, few will disagree that the election of Dilma Rousseff to the post has its own significance for the democracy of a nation that saw its first woman member of parliament almost 60 years ago and has seen a much lower proportion of women in political positions in comparison to other Latin American countries. As expected, Ms Rousseff has begun by promising gender equality. But she knows that her countrys expectations from her are not restricted to that. As the hand-picked successor of Lula, she is supposed to continue with her predecessors centrist policies, preferably under his direction. It is this single-minded objective of the nation that has got this Workers Party candidate 56 per cent of the run-off vote and sealed the fate of her opponent, Jose Serra of the Social Democratic Party.        
	With an overwhelming majority in both the senate and the chamber of deputies, which is also a legacy of Lula, it is unlikely that Ms Rousseff will have much of a problem pushing through the tried and tested policies of her predecessor. But she has her own challenges to live up to. She has to work out how best to balance her intentions of increasing State control over banking, energy and oil with the right amount of encouragement to private enterprise. She has to combat what she sees as a currency war and find ways to shore up the fall in the export of manufactured goods that will have an important bearing on the livelihood and living standards of her nation. All this would also demand a certain degree of efficiency in her dealings with the far Left and the conservative Protestant lobby that supported her, and with Brazils powerful neighbours such as the United States of America and Brazils favourite trade partner, China. Although a technocrat of some repute, Ms Rousseff has no political expertise. She has promised to knock on the doors of Lula for advice. But she ought to restrain herself. It is only by taking her own decisions that Ms Rousseff would help herself and her country to step out of the shadows of a leader whose time has passed.

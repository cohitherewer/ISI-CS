Bhaskar Dutta                                                          
	The G20 leaders have just concluded their summit meeting in Toronto. The meeting came at a time when controversies about appropriate global economic policies have surfaced all over again. On one side of the Atlantic, the Eurozone countries and the United Kingdom have been preaching the virtues of fiscal austerity measures. Indeed, several of them, including Germany, Spain and the UK have either started or will soon start practising what they preach. On the other side of the Atlantic, the Americans have been proclaiming that the time is not right to cut back on government spending since the global economy is still to recover from the recent worldwide recession. Economists, who as a breed seldom seem to agree on important issues, are equally divided. So, both points of view can claim the support of experts.        
	Not surprisingly, the final communiqu represents a compromise between these extreme positions, with a small victory for the Europeans. The world leaders have agreed to cut budget deficits by half over the next three years. As a concession to the Americans, the communiqu also declared that we are committed to taking concerted actions to sustain the recovery, create jobs. But, clearly, the clock has turned full circle from meetings in 2008 and 2009, when the overriding emphasis was on how to coordinate increased government spending in order to stimulate the global economy.              
	The Eurozone and the UK are perhaps apprehensive that their economies would soon face problems similar to those which almost resulted in a collapse of the Greek economy. For instance, the Spanish economy has failed to recover from the recession. This has meant a sharp fall in government revenues, resulting in a steep increase in public debt. Fears that it would not be able to raise sufficient funds to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure forced the government to launch rather draconian reductions in expenditure, including severe cuts in bureaucrats salaries.        
	But even stronger economies have been struck by the austerity bug. Take, for example, the German economy, which seemed to be well on the path of economic recovery. However, the German government was very active in pursuing expansionary policies during the latter half of 2008 and throughout 2009 in order to mitigate the global slowdown resulting from the financial crisis. The Germans also paid the lions share of the mammoth European Financial Stability Facility, which was set up to bail out the Greek economy. Not surprisingly, what was quite a healthy budgetary position in 2008 has turned into a pretty bad one today  there is now a deficit of five per cent of the gross domestic product.        
	The German government has now decided to pledge as much as 80 billion euros in tax increases and spending cuts next year so as to save roughly 0.5 per cent of the GDP. Of course, the German austerity drive pales into insignificance compared to what George Osborne, the new UK chancellor of the exchequer, has planned for the UK economy in his first budget.        
	Osborne and all other proponents of the austerity drive claim that no nation can afford to live beyond its means in the long run. They assert that countries economies are not dramatically different from that of individual households. The latter can bridge a temporary gap between expenditure and incomes by borrowing. But loans must ultimately be paid back and so household budgets must be balanced over the long run. One difference between sovereign governments and households is that the former can float their own bonds or debt instruments. But even governments cannot afford to borrow year after year, because they would find it increasingly difficult to get buyers for their debt instruments.        
	There is more than a grain of truth in this argument. After all, sovereign debt defaults take place  the recent history of Argentina illustrates this clearly. So there is no reason to doubt that when public debt piles up and becomes unmanageably large, prudence dictates that the government cut back on expenditure. Of course, the reasons for rolling back the stimulus packages must be overriding. It is important to emphasize this caveat because it is possible that Osbornes decision to slash spending was also heavily influenced by his economic philosophy  that even in the best of times, the size of the public sector should be as small as possible.        
	The real debate must be not about the necessity of pursuing prudent budgetary policies, but about the timing of initiating contractionary fiscal policies. Many economists feel that it is too premature to reverse the stimulus packages that were implemented a couple of years ago. They point out that the Europeans need to remember the experience of 1937, when the American attempt to balance budgets pushed the American economy back into severe recession  just at the point when it seemed to be climbing out of the depression.              
	On both sides of the Atlantic, the major economies have just started to record positive rates of growth. But the process of recovery has just started. Unemployment levels remain high, many of the people who have been unemployed for some time have quite naturally run through their savings. So, governments must ensure that jobs are created as soon as possible, and provide adequate safety nets in the form of welfare payments until people are absorbed into gainful employment. This is worth emphasizing because most reductions in government expenditure also have painful consequences since they typically involve large cuts in social welfare schemes.         
	Unfortunately, these economies are still very precariously balanced on the brink of a precipice  even a slight fall in aggregate demand may push them back into the throes of a fresh period of depression. However, if all the major countries start cutting back on expenditure, then it seems almost inevitable that there will be a very large fall in global aggregate demand. This may push some of the weaker economies, such as the UK, back into the negative growth regime.        
	Moreover, such a scenario will also tend to be self-defeating. For instance, the UK budget estimates assume that the private sector will expand sufficiently rapidly to more than compensate for the reduction in the size of the public sector. This optimism is partly based on the assumption that private sector growth will be spurred through a rapid rise in export demand. But why should there be an increased demand for British goods if all other countries are downsizing? Perhaps, a more likely scenario is that we will soon witness a race to the bottom  unless better sense prevails.

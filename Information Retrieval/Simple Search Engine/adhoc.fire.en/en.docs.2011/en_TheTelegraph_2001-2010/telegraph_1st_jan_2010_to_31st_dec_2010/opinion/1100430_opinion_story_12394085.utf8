                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CRUDE GAMES                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The cut motion in Parliament was a display of the worst elements of Indian politics. The opposition benches were unruly, and many of the leaders had a strange smirk on their faces that gave one the sense that they were merely poking and pinching the ruling dispensation with no real purpose, thereby wasting time and money at the cost of the people of India. Parliamentary proceedings, now shown live on the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha channels, allow India to participate in the democratic process of decision-making through debate in both the Houses. The medium is salutary but, unfortunately, the message is very disturbing.        
	To see elected representatives of national parties make a constant mockery of everything that is important for India and its people is demeaning and embarrassing, to say the least. It is as though they have been coached in certain unchanging behavioural patterns. If in the Opposition, be raucous, undignified, prevent discussion, adjourn the House, live off the land, take home the allowances and perks, and disregard the mandate. This is the sad truth.         
	It was disgusting to witness the uncouth shouting and disobedience shown towards the exalted chair of the Speaker, who happens to be a woman this time. One wondered how a quiet new generation was responding to this hugely unsavoury tamasha on issues of concern that plague the nation. Is this the idea of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Left Front of a symbolic protest against spiralling prices? Is this how they alleviate the misery of the electorate? Did they genuinely believe that they would win the vote, or was this charade a crude game of time-pass?                 
	New Gandhi        
	We have taken the horror to a level from where it cannot descend further. Respect for the political class has dipped to an all-time low. Its racketeering across a diverse range of areas from real estate to benami shareholdings in dodgy companies  has made the profession unclean.         
	We are akin to small, struggling nations where the rule of law is a mirage and where those at the top of the pile exploit rapaciously. It must be very depressing for an honourable prime minister such as Manmohan Singh to have to preside over this truth. His pensive patience laced with deep distress, as he watches the scene in the House being replayed over and over again, is palpable.        
	The horse-trading for lucrative deals and positions is a sideshow that Indians are witnessing through innuendoes and references in the media, and through exposures. Whispers  in the traditionally oral transmission system that is our medium of communication  make us voyeurs on the outside, abreast with all the irregularities happening within the corridors of the government, ranging from lobbyists on the payrolls of large corporations wanting particular persons to be placed as ministers to fiddling with middle-level administrators to make them do their bidding.         
	Rahul Gandhi seems to be the only politician working diligently to fight the malaise his generation has inherited. His intention is clearly not just to have an office in government that will co-opt him into a moribund reality, but to be out there on the field, leading a Gandhian overhaul of a corroded reality. He is on his way to becoming the Mahatma Gandhi of this period of our turbulent political history.         
	Were he to announce that he would contest elections to become the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, and blow the lid off the superficial chatter about the prime ministers chair being kept warm for him, chances are that he would win over the electorate across class, caste, creed and faith. There is the underlying anger against the presiding political class that is ripe for being addressed to bring about real change.

	Tales from another time      
	A time elsewhere (Penguin, Rs 350) by J.P. Das stitches together history and fiction to offer a realistic portrayal of Orissa in the nineteenth century. Translated by Jatindra K. Nayak, the novel chronicles the fluctuating fortunes of the royal family of Puri. The sceptre passes to Divyasingh Dev, who proves to be a wastrel. As a result, the real power is exercised by his mother, Suryamani, who mixes tact with caution to deal with the incessant demands of the Empire. Dass book explores the complex points of contact between the Empire and its colony, and chooses to retell the story of an age of great social and cultural flux from the point of view of the colonized. Also appearing on these pages are several prominent figures in Oriya history who are both collaborators as well as victims of the churning. Dass lucid narrative succeeds in documenting the emergence of a new milieu from the debris of the old.                          
	Inspector Singh investigates: A Bali conspiracy Most Foul (Piatkus, Rs 295) by Shamini Flint signals the return of the corpulent, sweaty and scruffily-dressed detective who, on this occasion, is dispatched to help an anti-terrorist drive after a bomb attack in Bali. Singh, who would much rather solve murders, is initially all at sea. But soon, a body is found in the rubble, and it is clear that the victim was shot dead before the deadly blast. The discovery sends Singh and his wily Australian sidekick on a chilling trail that would have terrible consequences for the entire world.        
	Days of the Raj: Life and leisure in British India (Penguin, Rs 350) edited by Pramod K. Nayar depicts the lighter side of life led by those who helped build the Empire. Sourced from the voluminous imperial archival resources, the articles deal with mundane but funny incidents such as those of a bungling dhobi spoiling the sahib rsquo;s shirt, a chilling shikar encounter with a particularly dangerous tiger and an Englishman rsquo;s obsession with a charming nautch girl, among other things. The book is divided into chapters that examine the private and the social lives of the conquerors, as well as their ties with the local population. Readers will be familiar with much of what is on offer here, but there is no harm in rereading the goings-on in a quaint world now lost in time.

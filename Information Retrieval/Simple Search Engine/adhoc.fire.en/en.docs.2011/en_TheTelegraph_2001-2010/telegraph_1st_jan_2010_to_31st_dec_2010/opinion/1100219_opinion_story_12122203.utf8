	One would need to stretch ones credulity beyond permissible limits to believe that a top-ranking Taliban leader would allow himself to be captured at a checkpoint while trying to shift base (apparently from Quetta to Karachi) with a clutch of his henchmen. There is, however, no escaping the fact that Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar  reported to be second only to Mullah Omar in the Afghan Taliban hierarchy  has been arrested by Pakistan. Given that the arrest has taken place only days after Pakistan had successfully sidelined India to wrest for itself an exclusive place in the peace negotiations going on in Afghanistan, the move is significant. It shows that with the right incentives, Pakistan can not only be made to own up that the top Taliban leadership is indeed within its territory, but it can also be made to act in a way the United States of America has so long been wishing for. The terms of Pakistans co-operation have, perhaps, never been so directly pointed out. If the Western allies ensured that India was kept out of Afghanistan, Pakistan would deliver. Not surprisingly, many more arrests are supposed to be in the pipeline.        
	Pakistans sudden compliance with US directives to go after the Afghan Taliban leaders within its jurisdiction has, however, complicated the situation in Afghanistan. The Hamid Karzai government is presently trying to open channels of communication with the Taliban leadership so as to work out a reconciliation. Evidently, sufficient progress has also been made in this direction. Pakistans arrests could jeopardize this carefully orchestrated policy and end up making the Afghan president look like a two-timer who cannot be trusted. There is, of course, the hope that men like Mullah Baradar could still be cajoled into negotiating the terms of peace with the higher-ups. But, as for now, no one in Afghanistan is willing to hazard a guess, and much less the US, which has found very little to say other than congratulating Pakistan.

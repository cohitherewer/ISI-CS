The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Other fears in a different world
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OTHER FEARS IN A DIFFERENT WORLD                                  THE UNMENTIONABLE      To protect domestic workers from sexual harassment, the law must take into account the specific insecurities they suffer from                                                  
	Poverty develops its own culture. As a phenomenon, poverty in India is not merely about lack of money, it is also about the lack of education, even literacy, the lack of jobs, the lack of exposure and of confidence, and an overwhelming fear of both the known and the unknown. This culture is like a carapace hard to penetrate, although Indias many laws do try to enter and correct the injustices that lie beneath. Knowledge of some of these laws, say, that against dowry or minor marriage, reaches this world like news from a distant planet. People know all about them; it is just that such laws have no place in the reality they inhabit.        
	If the law were ever to seek to protect women domestic workers from sexual harassment in the workplace, what would it be dealing with? At first, probably a blank wall. In spite of the slowly growing data about WDWs, there is an astonishing lack of information about sexual exploitation of these women in middle-class households. It would be nice to believe in the extraordinary sexual virtue of the employers; that they beat and sock and pummel their domestic workers, sometimes tie them to grills or gates, lock them up without food and without lights, especially if they are minors (there is a law against child labour, by the way), they starve them, refuse them use of the bathroom  and here I am talking about adult women too  refuse to pay them, sack them without notice, but stop short of sexual harassment.        
	If that is not so, why are WDWs willing to talk about every injustice and insult except that one? They would have to lose their job anyway if they object to anything from extra work to a beating; what stops them from talking about sexual harassment if that actually happens?        
	It is a peculiarly painful irony that these women, who are often the only regular earners in their own families, are doubly oppressed. The husband may have to starve if the wife does not bring home her pay, but that does not take away his god-given right to be suspicious. A large section of WDWs are regularly beaten up at home and the main reason, at least the professed reason, is suspicion.        
	To understand the strange silence about the presence or absence of sexual harassment at the WDWs workplace, it is first necessary to examine the specific nature of these womens insecurity. A WDWs job situation is always insecure; she loses jobs and gets them too, because she is even willing to opt for lower wages. But she cannot afford to lose her married existence, her consequent respectability (never mind that her drunken husband makes a habit of breaking her nose or cracking her head once in a while), her children that she is struggling to keep in school, or her fragile sense of security in what she feels is a normal life. Any hint of sexual harassment in the workplace will be turned against her; she will be forbidden to work, she will be beaten black and blue, and she will be labelled loose within her own society. This is one thing she can never mention; her fear is impenetrable.        
	For the law to reach her, for it to help her, it will have to penetrate this carapace of fear.                          BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

	What are we to call this new decade? Lets agree, for a start, that a new decade it really is, and did begin last Friday. Ten years ago, plenty of people were insisting that the new millennium must wait until New Years Day 2001. Maybe there are still some planning to greet a new decade in January next.        
	Mathematically, these folk are correct: 2,000 years of the current era of the western calendar were indeed not complete until the last day of 2000. But language, happily, is not dictated by mathematicians but created by mankind at large, and mankind said boo to them. Even my late employers, The Economist, a magazine that loves being out of step with the rest of the world but (in its view) right, launched its millennium issue when everyone else did, at the close of 1999.        
	So the decade known to some as the Noughties is now over, and we are into a new one. But which one? The 2010s? And, if so, how do we pronounce that: the Two-Thousand-and-Tens or the Twenty-Tens? Maybe these are simply the Tens? What about the Teenies? Or (God forbid) the Tweenies? Or as one gloomy blogger has suggested, the New Dark Ages?        
	Or maybe none of these, or anything like them: I can easily, albeit not cheerfully, imagine some Chinese already feeling, with an inward smile of millennial superiority, that within a few decades it wont matter what English-speakers say, because the whole world will be taking its calendar from Beijing anyway.        
	My choice is the 2010s, pronounced twenty-tens. Its simple. Its short, written or spoken. And, not least, it is in line with most previous usage.         
	It is also unambiguous. That is rare when we talk of time. The meaning of yesterday, today or tomorrow depends entirely on when those words were used (and even so the journalists today means the day his paper comes out, not the day he was writing). Recently and soon are deliberately vague, and only the context tells you whether their user is thinking of a few months, weeks, days or hours. And what husband attaches any firm meaning to Ill be ready in five minutes?        
	Even some precise wordings can be ambiguous. The twelve-hour clock offers two meanings for every minute it marks. Even the 24-hour one is open to mistrust: dim memories of army life tell me no military event ever began at 24.00 or 00.00 hours, always at 23.59 or 00.01, for fear of a mix-up between today and tomorrow. This Friday, say, usually means the coming Friday. But if youre talking on Saturday it may mean the one just past, as in hes usually here on Fridays, but this Friday no such luck.        
	Geography plays its part. Indias midnight is not Britains, and you were well into this year before Id left last year (and dont ask me what happens at the International Date Line). Moscows winter is Melbournes summer.        
	Longer periods too can muddle us. For most of my lifetime the turn of the century has meant around 1900. What did it mean by about 1995? Even some precise names of decades can bring confusion. Does the early 1800s mean roughly 1800-1803, or 1800-1830? The former, on my lips; but probably not so, if it were the 1400s at issue.         
	I dont think these ambiguities are accidental: though scientists can measure it to less than a billionth of a second, in ordinary life time is pretty nebulous, and language reflects that. So roll on the precise, definite 2010s. Not too fast, though; I can hardly expect to see them out.

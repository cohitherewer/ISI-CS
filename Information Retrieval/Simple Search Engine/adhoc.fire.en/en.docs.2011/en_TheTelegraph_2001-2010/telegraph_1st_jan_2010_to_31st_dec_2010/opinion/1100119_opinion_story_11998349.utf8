	To be under trial in India can become a nightmare. At present, this is true of around 1.7 lakh people, either charged with petty crimes for which they have paid their debt to society many times over, or incarcerated for a period that is already more than, or almost equivalent to, the length of the maximum prescribed jail-time for the crime with which they have been charged. They represent one of the most shaming aspects of the Indian justice system, for their presence within confining walls is a persistent reminder of the violation of the rule of law by the justice system itself. The United Progressive Alliance government has decided to make sure that 1.25 lakh of these undertrial prisoners are freed in six months time starting January 26. Limitless detention without trial is illegal; no one has the authority to hold human beings if they are not going to be tried in court. Judicial delays for a variety of reasons, indifferent or undutiful lawyers and State representatives, an oblivious police, all contribute to this unbearable state of affairs. But what is implicit in this situation is the prisoners helplessness. They can be forgotten by the State precisely because they have no social, economic or political clout  which makes a mockery of the principle that all are equal before the law.        
	The Union law minister has in hand a structured plan that courts might like to look at in the process of freeing the prisoners. One of the chief features of the process needs to be daily hearings for each prisoner so that the sentence in each case, in line with the requirements of the criminal procedure code, can be passed faster. In many cases, prisoners have already lived out most of the prescribed maximum penalty. The law ministry has also divided the country into zones and appointed an additional solicitor general for each zone to oversee the freeing of undertrial prisoners. Apart from the chief justice of India, the head of the National Legal Services Authority, which ensures aid for poor litigants through the medium of the states, has also been made aware of the plan. This is the first notable step in the reform of the justice system that the UPA government had expressed itself keen to carry out. The necessary framework is gradually being put in place. Whether that will encourage action in the courts and among law-keepers is yet to be seen.

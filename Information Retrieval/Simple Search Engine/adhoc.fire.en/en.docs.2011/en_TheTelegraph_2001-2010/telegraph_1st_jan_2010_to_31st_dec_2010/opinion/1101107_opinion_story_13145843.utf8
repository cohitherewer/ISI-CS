The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | play, but with pleasure
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PLAY, BUT WITH PLEASURE                                                          
	If the choice were between a hi-tech cellphone and a brand new cricket bat, what would the average schoolboy in Calcutta go for? Probably for the former. A quick game of virtual cricket, which usually comes with most mobile phones, is so much easier to enjoy than taking the trouble of going out for a real match with a bunch of buddies. The challenges involved in the latter idea are far too complicated anyway. One has to first find a suitable spot to play in, preferably a park or a playground, which, truth to tell, are not exactly plentiful in the city. Then one has to look for friends who might be game for some outdoor fun. And finally, one must be able to afford a break from the books oneself. But given the burden of most educational curricula, the last sounds like wishful thinking. So whatever brief reprieve children are able to earn from the relentless cycle of classroom and tutorial homes usually ends up being spent marooned indoors  away from the world of sport and sunshine, the lack of which, as the proverb warns, makes Jack a dull boy.        
	As a recent survey shows, children in Calcutta, compared to those in the other metropolitan cities, have less of an opportunity to get air and exercise. Schoolgoers are increasingly losing themselves in gadgets and textbooks, which, at one level, may not be such a bad idea after all. Not many parents living in a notoriously polluted city such as Calcutta would mind keeping their children indoors. They would much rather have a dull boy than an ill one. Para cricket on a bandh day is a safer bet  assuming that the private tutor has spared the child for that day. But now, things are going to change, whether for better or for worse, it is too early to tell. With the Central Board of Secondary Education making outdoor activities mandatory, at least some schoolchildren in Calcutta are going to have some sort of physical exercise on a regular basis. The thinking behind this move is no doubt noble. But to what extent is such an idea practically feasible? And at what cost would it be implemented?        
	Many schools in Calcutta do not have adequate space or even the infrastructure for a full-fledged play area. But even if they were to opt for the second-best and introduce indoor activities  such as yoga, aerobics or gymnastics  that involve vigorous exercise, would they really be making any tangible difference to the quality of life currently enjoyed by students? In order to allow students to relax into a healthy body and mind, the academic pressure on them must also be reduced commensurately. It is simply not enough for students to take compulsory physical training modules, they must also be counselled to give up their compulsion to excel in the rat race. Otherwise, children might end up finding their precious playtime to be yet another menace in disguise  imposing its own demands on them and forcing them to adapt to an even more onerous regime of multitasking.

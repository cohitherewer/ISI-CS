	Smokescreen                  
	Sir  We are all aware of the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco (Killer tobacco is alive and kicking in India, Oct 20). An alarming number of active smokers in India consists of teenagers. Why would these young people smoke a cigarette instead of chewing some gum? I believe it is because they have grown up watching their parents or relatives smoke. Smoking is also a way of showing off in front of ones peers in school or college.          
	The report says that hiking the price of cigarettes might curb their widespread use. I do not think that this will help. Rather, those addicted to smoking might try to acquire the extra money through wrong means. Also, as long as corrupt policemen allow cigarette shops to thrive around schools and colleges, the law that bans smoking in public places can never be properly implemented. The government earns a hefty revenue from the sale of cigarettes, and is unlikely to bring about any change.          
	Adults must curb their own smoking habits before chastizing younger people, since teenagers tend to emulate their seniors. Celebrities should not smoke publicly or endorse tobacco brands. These measures may not reduce the dangers of smoking, but they may be able to decrease the number of people who smoke.          
	Yours faithfully,        Pritam Kumar Paul, Bhadrakali, Hooghly              
	Sir  The news about the heavy consumption of tobacco in India has not come as a surprise. Ineffectual government policy is largely responsible for this. The Union health minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, said that India cannot indefinitely tolerate a public health hazard in the name of protecting livelihoods (N-E tops tobacco use: survey, Oct 20). Perhaps he is unaware of the fact that tobacco lobbies in India and all over the world can destabilize any government by dint of their financial strength. There is no middle path that the government can adopt on this issue. It can either ban tobacco consumption altogether or do nothing, and let people die in the process.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In spite of causing serious diseases like mouth and lung cancer, the consumption of tobacco is on the rise in India (Step on it, Oct 20). The provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act of 2003 cannot control the use of tobacco. Tobacco is as harmful as other narcotics, and its cultivation should be banned. Earning huge revenues through the tobacco industry or offering employment to a large number of people cannot be used as excuses for putting human lives at risk.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Invisible state          
	Sir It is sad that there were no artists or performers from Bengal in either the opening or the closing ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games. In spite of being the cultural capital of India, Bengal was not highlighted in the way other Indian states were. This discrimination against Bengal and its invisibility in an international event speak a lot about the attitude of the rest of the country towards the state. Bengali culture is varied and rich. People need to be made aware of it so that they can understand and absorb it.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Santanu Dasgupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Not only is West Bengal quite low down in the list of Indias industrialized states, but it also had minimal representation in the CWG. There were few sportspersons from Bengal participating in the Games. Moreover, in the opening ceremony, Bengali attire was conspicuous by its absence among the dresses from other Indian states and cultures. West Bengal has not hosted any international sporting event since the World Table Tennis Championship in 1975. Disagreements between the South Club and the Bengal Lawn Tennis Association have ensured that Bengal does not host any Davis Cup match.          
	It is the sad condition of the state at large that hinders our progress. Punjab and Hyderabad, despite having namesakes in Pakistan, do not put an East before their names in order to separate themselves. So why does Bengal require a West before its name? This proves our divisive nature, which prevents our growth. The state government should look beyond votes, and work to ensure that Bengalis can live with dignity and respect anywhere in India.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tushar Kumar, Delhi

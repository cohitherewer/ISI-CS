	Left alone                  
	Sir  In the article, Dial M for modernity (Sept 16), Prabhat Patnaik applauds the Left on two counts. First, for being steadfastly democratic and second, for being consistently anti-imperialist. Since when did Marxists start believing in democracy? Karl Marx had no faith in bourgeois parliamentarianism and V.I. Lenin repeatedly referred to the parliament as pigsty. Besides, in which country ruled by the communists was a contrary ideology ever tolerated? The Communist Party of India (Marxist) swears by democracy in India because it has to work under a defined Constitution. If the party ever captures power, it may not dither in consigning democracy to the dustbin in order to establish one-party dictatorship. One only has to look at the states ruled by the communists for proof.          
	As for the Lefts anti-imperialism, it has been less consistent than Patnaik would have us believe. Where was its consistency when it saw the Soviet Union march its soldiers and tanks into Hungary and the East European countries? Why did the Indian communists maintain a stoic silence then? Did not the communists collude with the British  as Britain and Russia allied during World War II  during Indias freedom struggle? One should rather say that inconsistency has been the hallmark of the communists. If opposition to the Indo-US nuclear deal is the yardstick of the Marxists nationalism, why did they not oppose the China-Pakistan nuclear deal, which is detrimental to India? Why do our Marxist brothers keep mum every time expansionist China claims a part of Arunachal Pradesh as its own?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The photographs of the two Marxist leaders, one dead and the other living, that were carried with Dial M for modernity, added a satirical twist to Prabhat Patnaiks painstaking analysis of the Indian Left. The bright side of the leftist movement in India, according to Patnaik, is its anti-imperialist attitude, power of organization, immense popularity, secularism, democratic socialism, and above all, its modernity. Yet many will agree that the CPI(M)s stand on the Indo-US nuclear deal, and its subsequent withdrawal from the United Progressive Alliance government, constitute the greatest blunder committed by the party. The partys debacle in the recent civic polls in West Bengal is the proof of this fact. Patnaiks conscience, however, is clear for he believes that the opposition to the nuclear deal was grounded on what the agreement portends for the future of Indias relationship with America.          
	Patnaik is not totally blind to the misdemeanor of the CPI(M) cadres and the fact that their moral degradation has lead to the alienation of the party from large sections of the people. Despite this, he retains his faith in the party, and this is praiseworthy. Much like Patnaik, I do not support the Congresss dynastic politics, its sycophantic culture or the Hindutva of the saffron Right. However, I am equally disturbed by the CPI(M)s ruthless displays of might against the Opposition to retain power in the forthcoming assembly elections in Bengal.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Prabhat Patnaik shamelessly eulogizes the Communist Party of India (Marxist). But his logic starts giving way right in the second paragraph of his article when he deems that the CPI(M) and the organized Left are synonymous. He tries to ignore the fact that the history of the Left Front of India is full of ideological rifts and conflicts among the constituent parties.          
	Patnaiks concept of modernity is made of anti-feudalism, secularism and anti-imperialism. But he confuses feudalism with dynastic politics, secularism with religious tolerance and anti-imperialism with anti-neoliberalism. Not everything is wonderful with the Left. The politburo of the Left Front is highly centralized and hierarchical in nature. There are often differences of opinion among the major and the minor partners. There are also divisions along the Bengal, Tripura and Kerala lines. But the stance of the Front is usually decided upon by a centralized coterie. The way the Left intervenes in the private and public lives of its members, undermines an individuals freedom in a democracy. By appropriating the education system, culture industry, media and so on, Left governments create a party hegemony. The party once had the proletariat and the subaltern as its base. But by promoting partisanship among the wealthy, influential and often criminal sections of society, it has secured a feudal superstructure.          
	The Sachar committee report has revealed that the Left Front is caught in the middle of the integration-isolation debate concerning religious minorities. It is true that there has not been any major riot in the states ruled by the Left. But statistics regarding the employment of the minorities in government offices in these states show that there has been even less empowerment of the Muslim community here than in Gujarat.          
	The CPI(M) has failed to adapt itself to a changing world. It has promoted a medieval culture of bandhs. Its forceful acquisition of lands to build industries without trying to understand the peasants mindset reveals the lacuna between party policy and the ground reality. The same gap was visible during the opposition to the setting up of Reliance Fresh in Calcutta. Such confusion does not prove the ideological solidarity of the left parties. It rather exposes their navety and volatility.          
	Yours faithfully,

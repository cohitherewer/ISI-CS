	There is very little to doubt that the recently-concluded Brussels summit has put the impending free trade agreement between India and the European Union on a fast track. The intention at both ends had been to give political momentum to the talks that have been languishing since 2007. With Indias prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the president of the European Commission, Jos Manuel Barroso, now having committed themselves to a date  the spring of 2011  to sign on the dotted line, a primary objective of the meet may be said to have been achieved. The reason why the political cart has been set before the horse should be obvious. It is economy that drives todays politics, and the EU, which has successfully negotiated with nations of diverse political affiliations like China and South Korea for trade agreements, would know the truth as much as India, which has significantly stepped up its regional presence through FTAs with Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The implications of a successful trade deal between India and the EU could no longer be ignored. The lifting of tariff and non-tariff barriers in India is likely to open the floodgates for European industry to gain a much-desired access to legal, banking and retail sectors while assuring India of an equivalent reach into the software and information technology sectors in Europe. The global outreach, of course, would not remain restricted to the economy. India already sees its association with the EU as a strategic partnership; the latter, in spite of objections from Indias neighbours, has not been able to overlook Indias role in combating terror in the region.        
	However, between now and the promise of 2011, there are more unresolved issues than there are months. The EU seems to be nowhere close to giving up its insistence that India comply with its prescriptions about environmental safeguards, labour laws, restrictions on the movement of professionals or contentious intellectual property rights that may clamp down on the flow of cheap drugs from India. Yet, it appears that the trade partners are willing to walk the extra mile to accommodate sensitivities. At Brussels, there was no mention of Kashmir, which has been on the annual debating agenda of the European parliament since 2003. If ears are kept close to the ground, other concerns may be heard as well.

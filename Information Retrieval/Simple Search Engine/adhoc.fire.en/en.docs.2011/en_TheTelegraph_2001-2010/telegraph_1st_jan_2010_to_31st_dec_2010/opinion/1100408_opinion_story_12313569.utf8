                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ARMS AND TALKS                                                    
	Unpleasant and gory events have reminded P. Chidambaram that the buck stops at his table. Not that he needed a reminder about this. Mr Chidambaram, even his critics will admit, embodies that rare combination among ministers. He is both intelligent and competent. Add to this the fact that he is very articulate and what emerges is a man supremely confident of his own abilities. These qualities of Mr Chidambaram were on display during his stint as finance minister. His achievements in North Block, however, left the lingering impression that in a crisis he did not turn to the economists for advice and guidance. He allowed his confidence in his own abilities to inform his decisions. As Union home minister, Mr Chidambaram again faces a crisis of some magnitude. This is to do with the quelling of armed groups calling themselves Maoists whose actions affect large tracts of land spread over many states. It is undeniable that Mr Chidambaram has brought a new dynamism into the functioning of the home ministry, especially with regard to operations against Maoists. It needs to be recognized  the minister himself has to accept this  that success in these operations will be punctuated by setbacks.        
	Some of the energy that Mr Chidambaram has successfully infused is derived from his clever use of political rhetoric. He has the gift of using words to raise morale. He has backed his rhetoric with action but sometimes his words  perhaps because they are often sharp, straightforward and witty  have appeared to be dissonant. There are two factors here that need to be kept in mind. One is that given the scale and the spread of the Maoist menace, operations against it, even when they are directed by the Central government, will entail working with one or more state governments. A brush with words may not be the best mode to ensure the smoothness of a counter-insurgency operation in a state. Discretion could well be the better part of rhetoric. The other point is more fundamental. The problem of Maoist insurgency is rooted in socio-economic conditions, and is the product of years of neglect. It demands a political solution and a redressal of the grievances. Mr Chidambaram is using the mailed fist of counter insurgency; he also needs to extend the velvet glove of political dialogue. Otherwise, he runs the risk of winning a battle but losing the war.

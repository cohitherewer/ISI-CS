	Redrawing boundaries of Indian states is becoming a complicated issue. At the time of the reorganization of the states in 1960, this was done on ethnic or linguistic considerations. But most states have become multi-ethnic and multi-lingual over the past few decades, making the populations more mixed in many respects. This is at the root of the current impasse over the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas demand for a new status for Darjeeling. There is much truth in the GJMs case that the Dooars, the Terai and even Siliguri have large Gorkha-speaking areas. But that does not make it a foolproof argument for the inclusion of these areas in the proposed interim set-up for the Darjeeling hills. If the Centre and the West Bengal government want the interim arrangement to be limited to the three hill subdivisions of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong, the argument obviously is both demographic and territorial. A similar tussle had characterized the negotiations between the two governments and Subash Ghisinghs Gorkha National Liberation Front before the Darjeeling accord was signed in 1988. Even that accord identified the area under the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council on the basis of territorial contiguity.        
	It is still possible to re-examine the territorial jurisdiction of yet another set-up for Darjeeling. But the only way to do so is to continue the negotiations. And the success of any such talks depends largely on the ambience created for them. Bandhs and threats of violence will certainly not help that cause. Apart from causing hardships to the people of Darjeeling, the GJMs planned ten-day bandh from June 12 will vitiate the atmosphere for the current talks. Bimal Gurung, the GJM leader, knows that none of the three major political parties in the state  the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Congress and the Trinamul Congress  can afford to take the responsibility for another partition of Bengal. His demand for the inclusion of the Dooars, the Terai and the Siliguri subdivisions has, therefore, no realistic chance of meeting political approval. At the same time, the state government and the parties in Bengal must not treat the GJM as an adversary who must be defeated at any cost. They must not spare any effort to keep reaching out to Mr Gurung and persuade him to return to the talks. It is no easy bargain, but that is no reason for shying away from it.

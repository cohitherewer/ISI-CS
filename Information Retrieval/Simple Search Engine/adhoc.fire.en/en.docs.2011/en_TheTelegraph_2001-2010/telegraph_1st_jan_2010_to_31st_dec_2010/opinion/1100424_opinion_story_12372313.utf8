The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A ridiculous adventure
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A RIDICULOUS ADVENTURE                                  Ananda Lal                                                  
	According to an online source, Ashvin Gidwanis budget for The Alchemist was Rs 15 lakh. With that kind of shopping money, what did he buy? One erstwhile filmstar (Mohan Kapur) returning to acting after seven years. One static but spectacular set with interesting curvilinear wings and interchangeable, intricately-painted backcloths pulled on strings like curtains across the stage. One ecstatic but erratic singer with recorded soundtrack for accompaniment, cast as the heros alter-ego because the hero couldnt sing. An elaborate lighting rig with little to light up, so that it generated great excitement whenever the computerized swivel spots rotated. A fancy wardrobe befitting shaky sheikhs.        
	The play, did I hear you ask? If you havent read Paulo Coelhos novel, dont. In the shade of a Spanish sycamore, a shepherd (his sheep bleat over the loudspeakers) dreams of treasure hidden under the Pyramids. He goes to find it, and after getting robbed repeatedly (bad people, these Arabs) but falling for a desert damsel (liberated enough not to wear a burqa) whom he leaves, starts digging (his dream must have had a Google map of the precise pyramid), only to meet a local guy who says there is no treasure, dummy, and who relates his own dream of buried treasure under a Spanish sycamore. Cut to last scene: shepherd back in Spain, damsel in tow. Moral: if you find a girl whom you mistake for treasure, stay focused on the real treasure, which doesnt exist anyway, so you can always return home with the girl, who waited for you eternally. Short moral: dig under your own tree, first.        
	What made Mahesh Dattani agree to direct such claptrap? I cannot believe that he supports Coelhos pop bestseller philosophy, which boasts such gems as, When you want something with all your heart, thats when you are closest to the Soul of the World. Sole of the world sounds more like it, as it deserves the boot for encouraging selfish acquisitive greed. Which great religion has ever glorified the fulfilment of our personal wants? Not having read Coelho, I cannot comment on the fidelity of Deepa Gahlots dramatization, except that her dialogues are truly blah. The shepherd (Kaizad Gherda) looks totally dazed, as he should, poor thing, by the prospect of such a ridiculous adventure. Instead of a mystic, Mohan Kapur as the alchemist resembles Darth Vader without his mask, playing The Emir Strikes Back. Special effects? When the Arabs fight, three extras versus two, the odd man out shadow-fences himself off the stage. Speaking of shadows, we even saw a camels head (to establish the desert, of course), but its mock-up prop kept bobbing behind the screen. Surely Mumbai can do better?

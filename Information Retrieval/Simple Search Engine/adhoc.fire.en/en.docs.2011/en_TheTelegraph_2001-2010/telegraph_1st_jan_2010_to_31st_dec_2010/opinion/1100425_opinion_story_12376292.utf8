                              Goingstrong        
	 As far as political experience is concerned, one was of the view that Indias Gen-X politicians didnt stand a chance before their yet-to-retire geriatric mentors. Now they seem to be falling short in energy and vigour as well. The day-long rally organized by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the capital clearly showed how unequal the contest is. While the young BJP party chief, Nitin Gadkari, fainted and at least four other leaders of his age-group gave Parliament a miss to escape the 40-plus temperature, LK Advani remained a picture of patience, endurance and even stamina. There was no sign of fatigue in the octogenarian leader. All around him, his much younger colleagues were either sipping nimbu pani or guzzling ORS by the litre but Advani not only stayed put throughout the rally, but also made it a point to attend Parliament. For this veteran leader, neither has the rath stopped, nor his political yatra.                                    
	Rahul Gandhi has competition: that too from his own party. A minister from Uttar Pradesh in the United Progressive Alliance is believed to be doing his bit to revive the Congress in the state. He recently invited bureaucrats from UP for an informal get-together to get a feel of things. The move, given the partys sycophantic culture, has not gone down well. Partymen feel the minister is trying to become the chief minister after the elections, which are a couple of years away. Marching orders for him within a couple of days then?                          
	 When the prime minister was travelling from Washington to Brasilia, his media manager gave him a thick folder that contained news clippings. The good doctor received it with enthusiasm, thinking his visit had been a huge success back home. But his mood changed as he flipped through the file. The news was mostly about a junior colleague in the ministry of external affairs and his lady friend. MEA officials are believed to have made things worse by reminding the PM in jest that the unsavoury controversy could spoil diplomatic efforts during the forthcoming Saarc meet as well as during the PMs visit to Canada. The matter regarding the minister of state in the MEA, many say, was settled at that instant, way before the UPA core committee met at 7 Race Course Road.                            
	 The price agitation has seen the Opposition come together like never before. But the choice was not easy, neither for the Left nor the BJP. The Left, once again, brought together Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav and N Chandrababu Naidu in a meet involving 13 parties. The spectre of the third front was raised again, but this time, the Left itself scotched such hopes by saying that the parties have lent issue-based support. Incidentally, on the last occasion, the experiment of the third front was followed by a drubbing for the Left at the hustings. Perhaps it does not wish to revisit that fate again so soon. For the BJP, the decision to join the bandwagon was equally difficult. The leadership was in a dilemma for a long time. But the idea of driving the fear of god into the UPA by presenting a joint Opposition seems to have got the better of it. Hence the plunge. If the IPL controversy manages to push the Nationalist Congress Party into a corner and against the Congress, it may be swansong for the Opposition.                            
	 The IPL may be a money-making racket for a number of people connected with Indian cricket. But it is, after all, a private body, wholly funded by private sources. If the IPL and the BCCI tinker with books of accounts, only then can they be punished. But what about the Commonwealth Games organizing committee, which is accountable to the public for every paise it spends? By the time the games are over, it may end up spending approximately Rs 10,000 crores on the 15-day-long extravaganza. Some of that money will go into building new stadia. The committee, expectedly, seems averse to enquiries regarding transactions. A controversial joint director was not only reinstated recently, but also sent as head of a sports delegation to Australia. A little over Rs 27 lakh has reportedly been spent on chai-paani during the 50-odd meetings of the committee. That is a mind-boggling figure to spend on snacks and knick-knacks alone.                        
	 The Union minister for commerce and industry, Anand Sharma, seems to have begun combing his hair in a particular fashion, courtesy an astrologer who has asked him to refrain from exposing his forehead till the Congress gets him a berth in the Upper House from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh or Haryana. Sharma was with the prime minister during his recent visit to the US and Brazil. When volcanic ashes blocked the PMs return via Frankfurt, he arranged for a mandatory refuelling stopover at Johannesburg within hours. The PM was impressed, but spoilsports in the MEA whispered that Sharma had travelled from So Paulo to Brasilia by taking a lift from a South African minister. In diplomatic circles, such gestures are not too pleasant as they show that India is incapable of transporting its ministers. Time for a new hairstyle?

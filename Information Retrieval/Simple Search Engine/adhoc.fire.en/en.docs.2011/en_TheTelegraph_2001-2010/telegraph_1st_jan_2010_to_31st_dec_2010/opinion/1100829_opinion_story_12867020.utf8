	Somewhere in the past Indians stopped thinking deeply and creatively about mathematics. There were mathematicians in India around the first century AD who made contributions that were fundamental to science. One is the concept of the zero. Historians of mathematics have pointed out that other civilizations had also arrived at concepts akin to zero. There was, however, another concept that Indian mathematicians discovered which was unique to India and without which calculations would have become immensely complicated and troublesome. This is the notion of the decimal system which transformed the method of writing numbers and therefore modes of calculating. Radhacharan Gupta, a historian of ancient Indian mathematics who was awarded the Kenneth O. May Prize at the International Congress of Mathematicians, 2010 in Hyderabad, explained this contribution with a very simple example. Any double digit number is actually a sum of two numbers. If the number is 79, it actually means seven multiplied by 10 plus nine. A thousand years ago, some Indian genius devised a system by which the value of a number was made dependent on where it was placed in a sequence of numbers. Before this, in Egypt, for example, 79 would be written with the aid of seven hieroglyphics that denoted 10 followed by nine hieroglyphics denoting one. The decimal system saved time and space, thus facilitating calculations and the keeping of accounts in an era of flourishing trade and commerce.        
	It would be simplistic, however, to see this breakthrough in mathematics as a function of the demand emanating from burgeoning trade and commerce. There were other phases in Indian history that also saw increased economic activity without any originality in thinking about mathematics. For reasons unknown, there was a climate in the first century that helped abstract thinking. It has not been possible subsequently to recreate that climate. What is apparent, especially in more recent times, is that there has been a genuine dearth of truly original work in the fundamental sciences in India. It would be difficult to name a scientist like S.N. Bose in India today. There must exist some remarkable gap in the higher education system in India that stymies the development of original ideas in the sciences.        
	One possible explanation for this state of affairs is the emphasis on useful knowledge that is noticeable in Indian syllabi. Universities encourage subjects that will lead to employment. The quest for knowledge qua knowledge or the advancement of learning by itself has ceased to excite Indian universities. Indians have become good at applying scientific knowledge rather than at pioneering research in the pure sciences. Departments of mathematics thus languish in most universities. And Indians look back nostalgically at the wonder that was India.

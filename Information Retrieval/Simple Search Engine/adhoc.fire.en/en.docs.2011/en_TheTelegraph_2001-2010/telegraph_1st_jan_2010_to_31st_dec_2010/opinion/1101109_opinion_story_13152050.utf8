	Anyone remotely connected to public life is aware that propriety dictates an entire range of activities in that realm. It is also obvious, to all but those who choose to be blind or are completely ignorant, that propriety has no space for personal likes and dislikes or for ideological prejudices. The funeral of a former chief minister is not an occasion that can be governed by ideological whims. The government of West Bengal failed to give Siddhartha Shankar Ray a ceremonial State funeral. The point is simple but the contrast is sharp: Ray was a former chief minister, so was Jyoti Basu. Yet Basu was accorded a full State funeral but Ray was not. Ray was given his final send-off with a three-gun salute but his body was not draped in the tricolour; no gun carriage was provided for his last journey; members of the armed forces were not his pall-bearers; and no State mourning, with the tricolour flying at half-mast, was declared. Basu, in contrast, was bid adieu with full honours. The discrimination is blatant and its reasons are not difficult to locate. Basu was a leader of the ruling party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), while Ray is seen as a foe of the Left. On this alone, Ray was not accorded a State funeral: the codes of propriety were transgressed and an act of indecency perpetrated by the government.        
	The discrimination was deliberate. It was not an oversight. The state government failed to request the Centre  as is required  to arrange for a State funeral. A decision was taken at the highest level  perhaps by the chief minister himself  not to give Ray a State funeral. In the case of Basu, the state government had acted with uncharacteristic alacrity and a request for a State funeral had gone to Delhi within a couple of hours of Basus death. The chief minister of West Bengal and his comrades in Alimuddin Street are free to make any assessment they want to make of Ray but they cannot denigrate the august office he once occupied. Communists have a propensity to see everything through ideological blinkers. This makes them blind to the implications of their decisions and of the precedents they establish. Ray, like Basu, was a chief minister of West Bengal. Not to treat their funerals at par is to display a lack of culture that ill befits Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

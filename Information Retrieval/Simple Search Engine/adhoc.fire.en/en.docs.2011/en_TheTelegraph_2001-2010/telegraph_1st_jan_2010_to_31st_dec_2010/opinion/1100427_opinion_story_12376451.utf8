JAYAL                        Hamid Karzai (left) with Wen Jiabao, Beijing, March 25, 2010				                                             
	The last but one week of March saw major events involving the immediate neighbourhood, the impact of which will undoubtedly have profound strategic implications for India. Even before the Pakistan foreign ministers delegation that included both General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the army chief, and Lieutenant General Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the Inter-Services Intelligence chief, had left the shores of Pakistan for a much heralded strategic dialogue with the United States of America, the US ambassador in Pakistan stated that a US-Pakistan civil nuclear deal on the lines of the Indo-US deal could be discussed. This was followed by an interview to Pakistan television by the secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, in which her body language clearly conveyed a message to the people of Pakistan that the US needed Pakistan badly.        
	Closer home, the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, was on a formal visit to China where he was given the red carpet treatment. He followed this up with a visit to Tehran, where he participated in the first festival of the international day of Nauroz, attended by some 25 heads of State or senior representatives of countries. Aware that it was his countrys future that would form the centrepiece of the US-Pakistan dialogue in Washington, Karzais travels also had a message.        
	The Indian foreign ministers absence at the Tehran ceremony after having been invited by his counterpart was because the Iran government shifted invitation dates once, followed by a second time. Clearly, our foreign minister got the hint and mercifully declined. Iran was conveying its own message regarding Indias earlier voting in favour of the International Atomic Energy Agencys censure of Iran.        
	Considering that we have a vital stake in what shape the future of Afghanistan takes, one wondered what message India had for those attempting to shape this future in Washington. Judging by the nations infatuation with the Narendra Modi-Amitabh Bachchan tamasha, there was none. Those in the corridors of the State department no doubt got the message and drew their own conclusions.        
	In all fairness, the US has never pretended to be sensitive to our security concerns if they clashed with its national interests. That is why it was not the least apologetic about denying our agencies access to David Headley, who is the self-confessed mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. Although that situation has changed since, it can be asked whether the US would have taken kindly to being denied access to Ajmal Kasab, the lone survivor of the Mumbai attackers. Would India have had the courage to deny it access? Since Headley has named serving Pakistan army officers as responsible for planning and executing the Mumbai carnage, the least India expected was a US censure of Pakistani military and intelligence establishments, if not out of conviction then at least out of form.        
	Instead, it appears that praise was showered on General Kayani and the Pakistan army for their efforts on the AfPak front and commitments extracted that the Afghan Taliban, Pakistani Taliban and al Qaida  all organizations targeting the US and North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in Afghanistan  would be tackled. No such assurance was considered necessary for Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Haqqani network, both of which are considered Pakistani strategic assets to target India. This in spite of their also featuring on the US presidents list of those to be dismantled and defeated. Aware of these double standards and so to appease Indian sentiment, the US promptly announced the conclusion of the nuclear reprocessing agreement with India, hailing it as further consolidation of a strategic partnership.        
	The US is well on its way towards working out its exit from Afghanistan, and has decided that this needs the support and cooperation of the Pakistan military and intelligence agencies. How this strategy will impact the regional security scene is difficult to tell, but one thing is certain. Unless India is willing to work out a strategy to safeguard its interests and not outsource this to the US or anyone else, it may well be the biggest loser in this game.        
	Since every bit of action in Washington and in the neighbourhood would have a profound and long-lasting effect on Indias internal and external security, one had expected the nation to be treated to loads of informed news and discussion in both the print and electronic media. Instead what we got was Modi mania peppered with Bachchan drama.        
	It is not this writers intention to join political issues or defend the person of Narendra Modi who, as an elected representative from Gujarat and holding the constitutional post of chief minister, must abide by the law of the land and face the consequences. But surely, like every citizen, he must be presumed innocent until proven guilty and surely a constitutional authority needs more respect than to be subject to sustained media trial?        
	The issue that concerns one is the inability to separate the personality of an individual holding a constitutional post from the dignity and sanctity of the post itself and, by extension, the equation of the person rather than the position with the State. Some years ago, Modi, as chief minister of Gujarat, in which constitutional post he would carry a red Indian diplomatic passport, was denied a visa by the US authorities. Denial of a visa to an Indian diplomatic passport holder was a rebuff to the Indian State. The Central government should have strongly reacted to this slight to an Indian diplomatic passport holder. That it failed to do so and in fact relished Modis discomfiture speaks poorly of our national pride. Perhaps a counter-question would make the point. Would the US have tolerated such a slight at Indian hands to one of its diplomatic passport holders?        
	Similarly, to target Amitabh Bachchan because he is promoting Modi, when he is promoting Gujarat and its tourism potential, is to target the people of the state and, by extension, the people of India. Is it the case of Modi-baiters that all government functionaries acting on his orders or on his behalf are to be boycotted or their actions considered illegitimate? Such denigration of constitutional posts has other serious ramifications. What would this writer have done today had he been the air force commander of the region that encompasses Gujarat, in which capacity there are occasions to either call on the chief minister or attend formal functions presided over by him? This writer in his time, and as part of protocol, has done precisely this in Gandhinagar, Jaipur, Mumbai and all capitals of the northeastern states. But those were times when, in the words of Rabindranath Tagore, the clear stream of reason had not lost its way in the dreary desert of dead habit.        
	There is grave danger that today regional commanders with the Gujarat area under their command would rather duck these protocol obligations. If they do they will have conveyed a poor message to the people of Gujarat, to all their formations located within the state and indeed all uniformed people belonging to the state. Before any further damage is done to the constitutional fabric of the country, the prime minister and leaders of all political parties need to draw clear red lines beyond which petty politics must bow at the altar of national interest.        
	That a person holding a constitutional post is being investigated as per the law of the land speaks volumes for our justice system. But the system fails us by delaying justice. Rather than milk the delay to derive political mileage, our lawmakers would do well to institute laws to ensure that such cases are completed within stipulated time frames, and that during their pendency, the individual concerned steps down from the constitutional post. Whilst this may appear to infringe on individual rights of presumption of innocence until proven guilty, in the larger interest of the sanctity of constitutional posts, the price is well worth paying. Today, we have undermined the authority of the post of a chief minister by putting an incumbent on media trial. This is an indirect affront to the people who have, through a democratic process, elected their chief minister, and to his authority to govern. We are treading on very thin ice.              
	This brings us to the media, which of late have been in the news in the context of paid media reporting prior to the last elections with some electronic media channels reportedly offering paid news packages to political parties. A cynic could well conclude that the hype in the media over the Modi-Bachchan issue was to camouflage the far more serious ramifications for our future security that were unfolding in Washington under the patronage of our avowed strategic partner, the US. In this age of information warfare and commercialization, one wonders if such cynicism amounts to letting imagination run wild.

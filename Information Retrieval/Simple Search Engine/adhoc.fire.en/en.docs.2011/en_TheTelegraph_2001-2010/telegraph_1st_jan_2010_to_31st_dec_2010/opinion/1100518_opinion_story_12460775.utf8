	If I had lived and died in ancient Greece, I would have entered the Underworld and faced two rivers that flow from Hades. I would be asked to make a choice. If I drank from the stream named after Mnemosyne (the goddess of memory), its cool, sweet waters would help me remember the truths of life and guarantee access to the Elysian Fields. But if I opted to quench my thirst from the dark waters of Lethe (named after the goddess of forgetfulness), I would forget the joys and sorrows of my previous life. I would be reborn, and I would have to retrace my steps in the world with a mind stripped of all recollection, and start learning the lessons of life all over again.        
	If I were asked to make the choice, I know what I would have done. I would scoop up and drink the waters of Lethe, for can there be anything as beautiful as a mind free of the cobwebs of the past? Neither can any joy be greater than the happiness of looking at life and learning its lessons afresh. What is the use of remembering if memory cannot bring back with it the people and things that are now gone forever?        
	Mnemosynes predominance in the divine hierarchy of the Titans can be attributed to the fact that all ancient societies survived on the oral transmission of knowledge. The powers of memory played a critical role in facilitating such transmissions. The oral tradition is on the wane in modern societies, but they are as intolerant of forgetfulness. As in ancient times, wise men in this age have come up with clever tools and strategies that keep us locked in a perpetual state of reminiscence. Colourful bits of paper are pasted on refrigerators to remind ourselves that there is no dinner at home. Even as the dawn breaks outside, a sudden, shrill cry from the luminous clock announces that it is time to prepare for another day. Mobile phones make strange noises, even when there is no one at the other end of the line. The cunning device can actually remind owners that there are bills to be paid. Unlike in the past, there is no respite even in old age. There are shiny pills for the elderly that force them to remember even those things they would like to forget.        
	The paranoia about forgetting has been institutionalized because social survival and order supposedly depend on the collective ability to remember. The invisible prods to recall even seemingly trivial tasks all add up to ensure that the wheels keep turning. But sometimes, I wonder whether human memory, by making it difficult for society to forget and forgive, creates the vicious cycle of retributive violence that disrupts order.        
	These days, we are seldom allowed to savour the pleasure of not remembering. And, like all illicit pleasures, this one too remains distant but alluring. We may try to keep the world at bay, building walls around our souls, drawing curtains to keep out the light and shutting doors to thwart all sound. But memories, bitter and sweet, continue to pile up in the corner of our minds, making some of us pine for the waters of Lethe.

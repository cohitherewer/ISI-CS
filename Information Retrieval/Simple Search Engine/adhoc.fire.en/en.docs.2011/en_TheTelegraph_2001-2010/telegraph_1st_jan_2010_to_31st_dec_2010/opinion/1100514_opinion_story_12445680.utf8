	Where the mind is without fear and knowledge (of no repercussions) is free, the walls are besmirched with all the colours of the rainbow. That is, the select colours of contending political parties and the rest for lettering  although not always correct spelling. This is Calcutta before the municipal elections, that arena of empty-headed derring-do, where politicians gearing up to run the city begin their campaign by violating the Election Commissions dictates. In 2009, the EC had forbidden graffiti on walls of private houses unless the party had got written permission from the owner. Not that this had worked like a charm in Calcutta, given the propensity of parties here to threaten house-owners into compliance. Besides, many of those who complained that their permission had not been taken were left exposed to the wrath of the parties with neither the anonymity that the EC assured them of nor protection from the police. This time, local elections have dressed up in Calcutta and West Bengal to look like a rehearsal for the assembly elections. And with the State Election Commission in charge, the artist slumbering in the soul of the political worker is being allowed to wake up and run riot with his paintbrush. Apparently, the SEC cannot implement anything till there are specific complaints. But people want to know what will be done after they complain, before they expose themselves to the inevitable hassle of complaining and then the parties wrath.        
	Yet if monitoring bodies are weak there is no reason that people should not be strong. The people of one locality in central Calcutta have rid themselves of depredations by political artists by getting together and refusing to be cowed. Their logic is simple. The politicians want something from the people  let them first comply with the rules protecting peoples walls. Different localities and housing estates could try this out  the logic is so simple even the cadre can follow it. The city may be getting sick of being bullied.

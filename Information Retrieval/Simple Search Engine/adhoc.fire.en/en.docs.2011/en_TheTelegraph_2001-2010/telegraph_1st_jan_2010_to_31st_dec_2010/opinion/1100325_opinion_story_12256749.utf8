                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SOMETHING SIMPLE AND FAIRER                                  POWER PLAY      The womens reservation bill goes against the principle of gender equality                                                  
	The bill to reserve one-third of the seats in the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies for women was passed in the Rajya Sabha amidst jubilation from supporters of womens rights. The only opposition, descending to the depths of unparliamentary behaviour, came from a section of politicians who wanted sub-quotas for other backward castes and Muslims. This is a spurious excuse, as those who are making these demands are, and always were, free to select as many women candidates as they want from these categories.        
	If passed by the Lok Sabha and enough state assemblies, the womens reservation bill would change the face of Indian politics, resulting in a massive rise in the number of women in the Lower House and the state assemblies. In the Lok Sabha, the number of women would be guaranteed to rise from 59 in the current Parliament, the highest proportion in six decades, to close to 200.        
	Yet the womens reservation bill deserves to be abandoned by the government. The bill harms womens interests, and is against the principle of gender equality. This is not because of intrinsic problems with quotas  there is no doubt that Indian women need quotas for having equal opportunity in politics. But Parliament needs to pass a simpler, fairer, gender-neutral quota, versions of which have been available to the Parliament for a decade.        
	Despite having women in important positions of power, Indian society still severely undervalues them. Millions of women are missing because of female foeticide and female infanticide, and countless others suffer discrimination. The percentage of women members of parliament stayed in single digits for six decades, crossing the 10 per cent mark only in the current Parliament. The proportion of women in Parliament actually declined several times during this period. The bill to reserve seats for women has been around since 1996, and was introduced in Parliament before. Most major parties professed to support it, and yet it was shelved repeatedly.        
	The womens reservation bill ghettoizes women, forcing them to contest only against other women in reserved constituencies. It prevents suitable male candidates from contesting in these constituencies. This undermines merit, and is unfair to men and women.        
	Criticisms of the womens reservation bill have come from civil society. Yogendra Yadav, Madhu Kishwar, Jayaprakash Narayan and Dhirubhai Sheth thought that the bill was flawed and proposed a variety of alternatives, including an elaborate proposal to amend the Representation of the People Act, retaining the lower quota of one-third for women, combined with constitutional amendments to extend quotas for women in the Rajya Sabha and legislative councils. The detailed nature of this alternative risks providing the opponents of womens rights further excuses for objections and delay, but contains propositions worthy of consideration.        
	There are far better alternatives to achieve gender parity in India than the womens reservation bill. India should drop it and adopt a gender-neutral, easily enforceable quota by amending the Representation of the People Act. It is not too late for India to do the right thing for gender equality, in a way that strengthens, rather than damages, its intended beneficiaries and the electoral system.

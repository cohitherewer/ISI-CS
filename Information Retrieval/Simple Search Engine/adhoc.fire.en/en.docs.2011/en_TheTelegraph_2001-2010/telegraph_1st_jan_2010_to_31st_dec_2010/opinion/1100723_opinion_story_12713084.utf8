	Tiger Hills: A Novel By Sarita Mandanna, Viking, Rs 599        
	A flock of herons and a dead tiger form the core of Sarita Mandannas debut novel. They surpass their functions as metaphors to assume a life of their own, to become the Apollo and Dionysus of this intricate, dramatic tragedy.        
	Devi, born on the day of the herons, guides the pulse of the story. Tiger Hills is about her love and her loss, her destiny and her fight against it. A hundred herons had descended on the paddy fields at her mothers feet just a few minutes before her birth. Throughout her life, the herons watch over Devi. They appear at each crucial moment of her life, flying across those moments with a calm indifference. Unlike Macbeths witches, they do nothing to guide Devi to her fate; they become her fate. They seem to enter into her: so, for Devi, loving Machu is like having wings.        
	It is this love  an unwavering, unfaltering and yet unquenched desire  that shapes Devi. She is born out of her want of Machu and her sense of possession over him. I will marry only Machu, she claims with stern conviction after seeing him for the first time when she is only a child. Nine years later, she finally meets him and says with the same intense certainty, You are mine. This certainty gives her a sense of belonging, to Machu and to his soil, the soil of Coorg. But her love turns futile as a twist of fate changes her path and takes her away from Machu into a different destiny. But a wilful child-woman, Devi refuses to let go of her wings. She keeps soaring above her fate in her desire to possess Machu  a craving that defies all logic. After Machu is married to someone else, she keeps her alliance with him alive through secret meetings. Even his death does not deter her from wanting him; she adopts his child as her own in a desperate struggle to keep a part of Machu with her. Finally, it is Machus land  the Tiger Hills coffee estate  that gives Devi her true roots. From a simple village girl, she evolves into a coffee planter, a businesswoman of repute and a woman of substance. Her love for Machu stays in her, both as her identity and as an inalienable void within. She accepts it as the bastard aftermath of a loss I cannot even mourn as my own.        
	The herons silently watch Devi as well as the other characters entangling themselves in a complicated web of desire, loss, possession and sacrifice. The herons omnipresence gives them an uncanny dimension. Sometimes they seem to be the authors surrogate self, guiding the characters towards their irrevocable destinies. At other times, they become the readers alter ego, watching, with a distant curiosity, how events play with the characters.        
	The tiger, on the other hand, shapes Machu. Its skin, hung ceremoniously on a wall in Machus ancestral home, embodies the triumph of the human will, of Machus will. He, in Devis mind and in the readers, is the tiger killer, the bravest hunter in Coorg. Machu conquered the unconquerable by killing the mighty beast; in doing so he became, to himself and to others, the very image of invincibility. The tiger he had killed bestowed Machu with a strange and rare dignity. I am the tiger killer, he would remind himself again and again, throughout the critical phases of his eventful life  in joy, in distress and in fear. He calls his lover, Devi, a tigress, and enters with her into a dangerous game of passion, just as a hunter enters the jungle to face the unknown. Machu is so engrossed in the tiger that it becomes his own self. But, at a later stage in the novel, when fate turns against him and he forsakes everything he is and everything he has in a spectacular act of retribution, it is the tiger that becomes a force bigger than he  one he can no longer reckon with. It was the tiger who was the true hero, Machu resignedly accepts, I was but an instrument. A plaything.        
	Mandannas skill in shaping her characters is amply evident in Devi, Machu, Nanju and Reverend Gundert. But Devanna is her best creation. He is Devis childhood friend who has been in love with her ever since he can remember, and who, on being rejected by her, rapes her. Devi is forced to marry him. This marriage is the pivotal event that turns around the destinies of all the main characters of the novel. From this summary, Devanna may seem somewhat of a typical villain. But what is truly unique about Devanna is that he cannot be summarized. He has multiple shades of grey  his repressed love for Devi that both elates him and suffocates him, his relationship with Reverend Gundert and Christian education that splits him between Mission-Devanna and Coorg-Devanna, his stoic suffering of the cruel ragging in college that hardens him forever, his steady but silent devotion to Devi despite her deep-seated hatred towards him that makes him a curse, a punishment for her. One of the most gripping moments of the novel is when Devanna finds that his college senior has cut open his pet squirrel and labelled the different parts of its body  Oesophagus, kidney, heart  while it is still alive; the inhumanity of the act magnified by the precision of the operation. The other moment that may make the reader stop and ponder is when Devanna rapes Devi. While violating her, he repeats the same phrases that had once been used by a senior in college during an especially brutal ragging session  It is for your own good, and you leave me no choice.        
	Mandannas method of kneading her characters into the flow of the story gives away an unmistakable amor fati. The spine of the tale is the author herself, manifest in the flight of the herons, the memory of the dead tiger, and in Devis amulet that passes through the numerous curves of the story. She plays fate to Devi, Devanna, Machu and, later, to Nanju and Appu, lets them develop their own aspirations, then snatches away their very sense of being and watches them tumble helpless through the pitfalls of the narrative. She has done this with a finesse that deserves admiration. But, at times, her playful obsession with her characters goes a bit overboard; sometimes the epic proportions of her situations and the emotional grinds and turmoils verge on melodrama.        
	Nevertheless, Mandanna shows promise. Indian writing in English has been facing a void, what with every other corporate professional penning a wannabe novel and littering bookshelves with half-hearted, contrived prose. One who approaches Mandannas book with a similar apprehension will be pleasantly surprised by her grasp of expression, her involvement with her narrative and her extensive research. She has woven history and drama into a riveting story with the confidence of a natural.        
	Beautiful Coorg emerges as a backdrop to the story but eventually seeps into the skin of the characters, contouring their search for identity and their battle against their own selves, setting into motion a tale of possession and sacrifice, of love and loss. The novel spreads across a span of 50 years, starting in 1878, encompassing four generations, several events in history, the entire panorama of Coorg and the roots and aspirations of its people  sinking its teeth into their skin and drawing the flavour of their folklores and their ways of life  recognizing in them a rootedness brought alive only by loss.

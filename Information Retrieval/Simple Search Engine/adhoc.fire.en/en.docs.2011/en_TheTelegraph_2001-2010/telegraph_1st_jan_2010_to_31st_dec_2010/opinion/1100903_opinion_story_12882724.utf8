	Women on the verge of adventure                
	Evernight (HarperCollins, Rs 299) by Claudia Gray is the hair-raising debut by the now much-acclaimed mistress of modern gothic. Pitched at young adults, the story is suitably formulaic. Set in a gloomy boarding school, the plot focuses on the trials of poor Bianca, who is a real plain Jane. Neither can she belong to the elite club of rich kids nor hang out with the weirdos  which brings her close to Lucas, whose social life is trapped in a similar stalemate. There is, of course, initial resistance on Lucass part; then the inevitable first love. As the sparks begin to fly, before long comes trouble, in the form of  surprise, surprise!  vampires. The plot is slow in taking off, but soon becomes curiouser and curiouser. You have to be more young and less adult to be able to enjoy it fully.                                  
	Lessons in love (Avon, 6.99)by Kate Lawson has a content guide on its back-cover telling you what to expect: Tear-jerker, Thrills, Drama, Love, Sex, Humour, Friendship. Jane Mills (20-something, jobless and loveless) meets Jayne Mills (in her 50s and sick and tired of life)  and, no wonder, the most life-changing lessons are exchanged between the two. Lost chances are revived and new ones created. Men, young and not-so-young, add to the feelgood factor. Choices are made, lives are swapped, and both women, notwithstanding their age, get a chance to play at being Bridget Jones. Though certainly not comparable to the mother of all chick-lits, this ones a good read, especially if you are seeking that wonderfully warm feeling in your heart.                        
	Manasarovar (Penguin, Rs 225) by Ashokamitran recounts the story of a studio writers strange encounter with a reigning superstar. Satyan Kumar, a famous actor, moves from Bollywood to Madras to seek fame and fortune. There he meets Gopalan, the writer, and somehow the two men are able to forge a connection across the barriers of class and language. However, things take a bizarre turn as Gopalans son dies mysteriously and his wife loses her mind. Alive with resonances peculiar to its time and setting  characters like Jawaharlal Nehru make an appearance  this is a powerful narrative that explores resilience in the face of randomness and the struggle to carry on living in the midst of terrible loss. N. Kalyan Raman has rendered the Tamil original elegantly into English.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The little masters greatness
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE LITTLE MASTERS GREATNESS                                  Was Sunil Gavaskar the best opening batsman of his time? In spite of his brilliance, that question is yet to be settled, argues Satrujit Banerjee                          In a different league                                  
	On a recent visit to India to commemorate Indias first away series victory over West Indies in 1971, Garfield Sobers was all praise for Sunil Gavaskar and rated him the best batsman of his time. Always forthright, Sobers observed that being an opening batsman made matters more difficult when there were no rules to protect batsmen: There were no helmets and arm guards... he opened against bowlers like Andy Roberts, Colin Croft and other fast bowlers... Its only my view, because of the bowlers he played against during that period.        
	To put Gavaskars career in perspective, one has to consider two rules that were then in existence and have subsequently been changed. The back foot no-ball rule meant that pace bowlers delivered the ball closer to the batsman than they do now, and teams used to bowl around 72 overs a day instead of the 90 at present, which meant pace bowlers got more rest between balls and overs. In addition, bouncers were not restricted.        
	Gavaskars place in the history of Indian cricket cannot be judged by his scores alone. If an Indian cricketing calendar is ever devised along Gregorian lines, then Anno Domini should coincide with the arrival of Sunil Manohar Gavaskar on the Test scene in 1971. Before Gavaskar (BG), among cricket followers worldwide, India was better known for producing several gifted stroke players who lacked the grit to grind it out at the wicket and make big, telling scores.        
	In addition, Indians were associated with a distinct distaste for pace bowling with several unenviable records, namely, being bowled out twice in a single day for 58 and 82, and the first 4 wickets down for zero. Moreover, the most famous Indian cricketer BG was one who never played for India, the incomparable Nawanagar prince, K.S. Ranjitsinhji. Notable exceptions were Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare. But Merchant did not play enough Test cricket and Hazare, for all his stupendous efforts, had not won an away series against the big three  England, Australia and West Indies  the litmus test for a country or a player to claim recognition.              
	All this came to an abrupt end in Indias 1971 tour of West Indies. A hitherto unknown batsman, and that too an opener, had, with scores of 65, 67 not out, 116 and 64 not out, 1 and 117 not out, 124 and 220 in four Tests, helped India to win the first away series against West Indies, and forever dispelled the perception that Indian batsmen took a step or two towards the square leg umpire when the pace bowler was about to deliver the ball. Moreover, here was an Indian batsman with astonishing powers of concentration who just refused to give up his wicket, no matter what his individual score was. At the time of his retirement in 1987, Gavaskar had played 125 Test matches, scoring 10,122 runs including 34 centuries, and averaging 51.12. Against West Indies, he fared distinctly better, playing 27 Tests, scoring 2,749 runs in 48 innings at an average of 65.45 with 13 centuries.        
	Not long after Sobers was felicitated, I was invited to a chat of cricket aficionados. Among the usual knowledgeable bunch was an expert who frequently appears in an English language television channel. Soon enough, the expert opined that with Soberss endorsement, coupled with Gavaskars superior record against West Indies and their fearsome foursome, there is no reason why he should not be considered the greatest opening batsman of all time. Fortunately, cricketing statistics are elaborate and precise and I had to point out that while Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, James Garner and Malcolm Marshall formed arguably the most lethal fast bowling attack in the history of the game and enabled West Indies to be world beaters for well over a decade, Gavaskars career started before their advent and when he played against them, his numbers took a beating.         
	In the 1971 series in West Indies, when he scored 774 runs, he faced an opening attack of Sobers and Vanburn Holder. Keith Boyce made his debut during the series but was dropped after one Test. In the 1978-79 six-Test series in India, Gavaskar scored 732 runs, when the attack consisted of Sylvester Clarke, Norbert Phillip, Vanburn Holder, with Malcolm Marshall in his debut series playing three Tests. In these two series, Gavaskar scored eight centuries, totalling 1,506 runs, or well over half the runs and centuries he scored against West Indies. India won both series. In the four other series, when at least two of the foursome played, India lost all four, and in 17 Tests, Gavaskar scored 1,243 runs averaging 42.86, a distinct drop from his lifetime 65.45 average. The history of cricket is replete with examples of great bowlers making a difference to their sides performance or specifically in the underperformance of the opposition, more so when they operate in a pack. Gavaskars drop in performance is a direct result of this. Incidentally, he never faced Colin Croft, as Sobers had mentioned.               
	Great batsmen however, leave their imprints through a few extraordinary innings during their lifetime. One such was Gavaskars last innings of 220 during the 1971 tour of West Indies which lasted 8 hours 50 minutes, saved India the Test match and won the series as well. Another was during the England tour in 1979. India was one down in the series with the final Test at the Oval. England declared after tea on the fourth day, setting India a mammoth target of 438 to win in the fourth innings. India replied with a spirited 76 without loss at close and the stage was set for a Gavaskar innings of epic proportions.         
	He did not disappoint. His 221 is truly one of the great innings of modern times, bringing India within 9 runs of the victory with two wickets in hand when time ran out, and scripts one of the most heroic run chases in history. Len Hutton paid tribute to Gavaskar and proclaimed he was the greatest opening batsman in the world and, in a rare compliment, compared Gavaskars knock at the Oval with Wally Hammonds 240 at Lords and Stan McCabes 232 at Trent Bridge, widely regarded as the two truly great innings in the annals of the game. Hutton should know. Both innings were played in the England-Australia series of 1938, and Hutton, as a member of the English team, saw both first-hand.        
	The greatest opening batsman of all time ? The debate still rages.

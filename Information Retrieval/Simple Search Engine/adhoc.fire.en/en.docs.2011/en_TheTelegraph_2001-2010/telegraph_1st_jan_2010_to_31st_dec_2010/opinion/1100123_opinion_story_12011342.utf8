Datta-Ray                        Louis douard Fourniers The Funeral of Shelley, 1889				                                             
	Louis douard Fourniers painting of Shelleys cremation on the beach at Viareggio in Italy, where his body was washed ashore, romanticizes death. There is no hint in that tranquil scene of the poets discoloured and decomposed flesh, cracking bones and brains that literally seethed, bubbled, and boiled as in a cauldron that prevented Leigh Hunt from emerging from his carriage and forced Byron to flee the site and swim off to his yacht, the Bolivar. The macabre details are from Edward John Trelawnys eyewitness account. Fourniers idealized painting came 67 years later.        
	Death is demeaning. Its aftermath can be even more so, especially in India, more particularly in Calcutta. Attending a cremation in Delhi, I was about to say how clean Nigambodh Ghat looked compared to Keoratala when George Fernandes, standing next to me, exclaimed how dirty it was. James Cameron, the distinguished British journalist who thought Calcutta was dedicated to the maintenance of suffering, was also haunted by the nightmare of falling ill in Kiplings city of dreadful night. He did break his leg in a car accident somewhere near Murshidabad during the Bangladesh war and had to be brought back here and hospitalized, but was spared the ultimate ignominy of dying in Calcutta.        
	Wealth and status are no barriers against indignity, which makes me suspect that few see anything unseemly about either the grim setting or the mix of callousness and curiosity that attends the last trump. Death is public tamasha, especially when the deceased is a person of consequence. The funerals of cultural icons always lean towards Grand Guignol rather than mere street theatre, a Business Standard columnist, Devangshu Datta, wrote. Had Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee attended the obsequies that never were for Jyoti Basu, he would have recalled the fracas 17 years ago when the body of another famous son of Bengal was consigned to the flames.              
	According to newspaper reports, the police tried to use the occasion of Satyajit Rays funeral at Keoratala to arrest a goon who had made the burning ghat his hang-out. Described as an extortionist-turned smuggler, the cornered man called out for help to the police commissioner, addressing him familiarly as dada in the presence of the citys glitterati, including the then home minister, that is, Bhattacharjee. The man was later picked up from an illegal country liquor shop . A revolver was recovered from him. The police officer lost his job not so much, apparently, for consorting with such unsavoury types as because the association became public knowledge.        
	Such connections are probably routine. This one attracted notice only because the episode occurred at the wrong time in the wrong place. Few cremations are as dramatic. But they are all chaotic and they are all marked by a total absence of reverence or sobriety. There can be little question of grief being insulted when even breast-beating mourners often seem to revel in the attention. Moreover, the tradition of lusty local youths, by definition not the most modest or well-behaved of young men, carrying the bier (now dying out as hearses take over) and the rewarding of them with food and drink makes for an air of unconcerned jollity. The goon may well have been one of these muscled gangs.        
	There is (or was) a padlocked collapsible gate at one end of the Keoratala building directly opposite the oven doors, outside which a crowd gathered every evening, clutching the bars and gawking into the waiting room for the hereafter. My impression over the years is of mainly respectable middle-aged married women  ginnis in Bengali  sometimes with children in tow. You could sense their mounting excitement as the time drew near for the rusty iron doors to be cranked up. The salutations and deep namaskars reached an orgastic crescendo as yet another corpse was lifted off its bamboo stretcher and trundled into the flames. Visiting Keoratala once as a duty and not to mourn, I deliberately stationed myself with my back to those collapsible gates. You should have heard the shrill protests. Move! Move! You are blocking our view! We cant see! I told them the burning ghat was not a place for sightseeing but sightseeing was precisely what took them there day after day. Thus might the ancient Romans have thrilled to a gladiators death throes.        
	They were richly rewarded when a titled aristocrat was brought to be burned. Death is the great leveller but a jeep preceded the cortge, the shroud was of crimson silk and the mourners were visibly fashionable folk. Whos he? the excited whispers rippled and rustled through the crowd, but the name and title were as much beyond their comprehension as the Man in the Moon. Nevertheless, death was the spectacle they had come to enjoy and death in such resplendent garb was deeply gratifying. Keoratalas voyeurs suffer from an extreme form of what Cyril Connolly called an unseemly preoccupation with the cadaver when introducing The Loved One, Evelyn Waughs satire on Californian burial customs.        
	Not long ago I had to go to the Garia crematorium of whose existence I was unaware till then. Whereas Keoratala is brightly lit and packed, Garia seemed dark and deserted. One of its only two incinerators was not working, a tattered charpoy placed vertically against the closed door. A mangy street dog was curled up on a piece of grimy gunny that someone had considerately spread out in one corner. The Sanskrit phrases as a mourner performed the last rites, the periodic opening and shutting of the oven door and intermittent bursts of sobbing did not impinge on its slumber. The creature was used to it all.        
	Keoratala and Garia, and the other five Calcutta burning ghats, have this in common  they are all exceedingly dirty. Nimtalas licking flames look impressive from the distance of mid-river deck parties but close up the ghat is no exception. Unlike Fernandes in Delhi, nobody notices. There is no profound philosophical aversion to keeping clean a place that might be said brutally to demonstrate the ultimate illusion of life itself. Its just that no one cares.              
	Its the same with hospitals, public offices and even universities. They are festooned in cobwebs and thick with dust for the same reasons. The jemadars who are paid to keep them clean are both dishonest enough to pocket the pay without doing the work and have no understanding of hygiene and sanitation in their own private lives and environment. Second, as in most chains of command in West Bengal, the managers and supervisors to whom Class IV staff are accountable have become too lazy, corrupt or powerless to impose discipline.        
	Basus admirable gesture to the storehouse of scientific knowledge provoked an unaccustomed frenzy of sweeping, swabbing and painting in one particular corner of the SSKM Hospital. But for that decision, the burning ghat of his choice might also have benefited. But a lick of paint and a touch of polish would have made little difference to a rite of passage that is rendered unwholesome by grubby surroundings and greedy personnel who will not allow a corpse anything that has resale value. The climb down dingy steps to forage for the remains among glowing cinders and the slippery stone, mud and slush that have to be navigated before the final immersion in filthy waters could not be farther removed from the English crematorium where I attended a friends funeral. After a sedate service, the curtains moved automatically across a flower-decked stage to shield the coffin as it slid slowly away into eternity. Soft music and dimmed lights marked that last journey.        
	However elevated the spiritual symbolism of a Hindu cremation, circumstances make the sequence even in so-called modern electric crematoria loathsome and degrading. In escaping that humiliation, Basu also spared his family and friends a harrowing ordeal.       sunandadryahoo.co.in

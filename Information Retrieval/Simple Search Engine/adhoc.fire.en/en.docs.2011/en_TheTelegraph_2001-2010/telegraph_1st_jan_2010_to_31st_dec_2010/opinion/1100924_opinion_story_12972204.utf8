Raj Rao, 
  Penguin, Rs 250 
  Yaraana: Gay Writing from South Asia Edited by Hoshang Merchant, 
  Penguin, Rs 350        
	Described as an entertaining love story on its back cover, Hostel Room 131 opens in Belgaum, Karnataka, with the protagonist, Siddharth, going to the police station to lodge a complaint against his in-laws for hiding his beloved, Su, from him. Su, as we learn, is Sudhir, an engineering student at a college in Pune, with whom Siddharth is having a torrid, and of course clandestine, affair. Their cover is finally blown by Ravi Humbe, recalling Chatur Ramalingam in 3 Idiots, a Belgaum boy and Sus hostel-mate. Siddharth is threatened by Sus menacing uncles  the carnivores  and forced to return to Bombay, abject and lovelorn, shedding copious tears like a typical Bollywood hero jilted in romance.        
	The first section of the book is perhaps the most promising, as R. Raj Rao distinctly captures the seediness, undercurrent of hostility and obsession with honour in provincial India. The coexistence of puritanism about heterosexual relations with an unsuspecting tolerance of homoerotic friendships is a disconcerting feature of repressed societies. But the consequences tend to be deadly if such male intimacies turn actually sexual. So, while enlightening the unsophisticated small-towner Sudhir, the educated urbanite Siddharth keeps recasting Bollywood classics like Zanzeer, Sholay and Kala Patthar as essentially gay narratives cloaked in the garb of machismo. Amitabh Bachchan, who seems to have an unexpected hold over the gay imagination, is perceived as being actually interested in the men around him  Pran, Dharmendra and Shashi Kapoor  rather than in Rekha or Jaya Bhadhuri. The singular lack of irony, or of humour, in such solemn pronouncements takes the edge out of Siddharths subversive homosexual (mis)readings, and makes him sound like a rather insipid homopolitical man.        
	But Siddharth is too inconsistent a character to remain a steadfast activist for the cause of a gay revolution. After a spiritedly argued opposition to his lovers desire to undergo sex change, he agrees, like a typically spineless Indian male, to the gradual emasculation of Sudhir to Su, and then, to Sumati. Siddharth ends up as an uxorious man after going through hell for the sake of the love that dare not speak its name. Such an ending is not all that surprising. Raj Raos profile describes him as a pioneering Indian academic who runs a course on queer literature at the English department in Pune University. So, in this novel, tailor-made for queer theorists, he must pay lip service to the entire LGBT community. No one must be forgotten. Thats why in a tenuous sub-plot, a hijra is, quite incredibly, married off to a koti (a transgendered male) and the couple live happily ever after; firebrand gay crusaders take revenge on the straights by raping them; even Westernized gay men cannot outgrow heterosexual fantasies of impregnating their partners and cohabiting with them in marital bliss; and finally, there is an Iraqi man, employed by the CIA to spread the virus of homosexuality among his own countrymen so that they all fall  hook, line and sinker  for the proverbially gay marines. If the last is supposed to be a farcical interlude, then the farce, sadly, is lost on the reader. The tone of Raj Raos prose remains, at its best, flatly documentary, and is incapable of modulating itself according to the drama demanded by each occasion. Also, like a good deconstructionist, Raj Rao provides a counterpoint to every point he makes  which only deepens the confusion without necessarily enriching the complexity of this tale.        
	Raj Rao also had the dubious distinction of being included in Yaraana, an anthology of Gay Writing from South Asia, the first of its kind, edited by Hoshang Merchant more than a decade ago. Dubious, because the idea of isolating writers on the basis of their sexual orientation from the wider field of literature in general may not appeal to many readers, or even to the anthologized writers themselves. It may serve agenda-driven writers like Raj Rao quite well to be included in such a collection. But to put in this anthology the beautiful stanzas from Vikram Seths The Golden Gate simply because Seth happens to dwell on a troubled relationship between two men is to give excellent writing a limiting label. Even Bhupen Khakhar, whose stories are as mischievous as they are mysterious, deserves to be read for the painterly elegance and clinical, deadpan manner in which he portrays the vagaries of human desire  not because he happened to be homosexual. (Incidentally, the biographical notes to this 2010 reprint seem to suggest that Khakhar is still alive, although the artist died in 2003.) And what is Shibram Chakrabarti, who, the editor claims, was widely known to be homosexual, doing in this book? The excerpt from his story, Bhalobashar Anek Naam, is barely able to convey the goofy humour of the original.        
	This anthology, faithfully chronicling the exploits of gay men (lesbians are notably absent), alternates between high camp and predictable erotica. Most of the encounters are between unequal partners, and this romanticizing of class, caste and ethnic differences, without the redeeming touch of literary merit, merely provides fodder for queer theorists and activists. Also, most of the narrators are typically self-absorbed, unable to see beyond the confines of their sexual identities, and thus betray the first principles of good literature  that art is a mirror for humanity at large, not just for a small section of it. This passage from the editors Sharjah diary sums it all up: I consider myself selfish because I have never been able to get out of myself: not in love, not in friendship, not in religion, not in politics, not even in art because I write about myself.

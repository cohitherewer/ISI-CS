	 Leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party are apparently finding it difficult to stay awake during the day. It is true that they have been staying up late into the night, but that is not on account of the football World Cup. The party president, Nitin Gadkari, has got into the habit of calling late-night meetings that last till early morning. Recently, Gadkari decided to meet some BJP netas from Bihar. The meeting started at 11 pm and continued till 2 am in the morning. Expectedly, most BJPwallahs have lost sleep over Gadkaris new antics. Arun Jaitley, for instance, has excused himself from these occasions by citing that his doctors have ordered him to go to bed early. He didnt have to attend the meeting involving Bihars leaders because he was holidaying in Europe at that time. But healthier leaders, who did not get leave  Venkaiah Naidu, for instance  have expressed their displeasure over the strange schedule of meetings. Worse, Gadkari is also being accused of aping the rival camp. The Congress had actually started this practice, which has now been hijacked by the BJP chief.                              
	 The babus in Bihar are in a tizzy. With every passing day, the possibility of a split between Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (United) and the BJP looms larger. Consequently, the bewildered bureaucrats have intensified their search for new masters. Those close to the BJP are so peeved with the possibility of a change in the status quo that they have started sending feelers to Lalu Prasad as well as the state Congress leaders. But the problem is that nobody is quite sure about who will walk away with the honours if the JD(U) and the BJP decide to fight the elections on their own. Bureaucrats close to Nitish Kumar have conducted a survey, which has indicated that there will be a clean sweep in favour of the chief ministers party if it were to part ways with the BJP. But other babus, perhaps aware of the unpredictability of exit polls, are not convinced.Fearing the loss of their perks and powers, they are trying to keep both Kumar and the Congress happy. The reason? They think that the Congress will make way for the BJP in Kumars life once the elections are over.                            
	 Still on Bihar. Narendra Modi is not the only man that Nitish Kumar has crossed swords with. The Bihar CM is also waging a war with Sharad Yadav, and the JD (U), supposedly, is no longer a united house. The Kumar-Yadav saga took a turn for the worse when the latter ignored a party whip to oppose the womens reservation bill. Last week, when Yadav visited Patna to douse the flames lit by Modi and Kumar, he was shocked to find that, unlike in the past, a protocol officer had not been sent to receive him. A week before this incident, Kumar denied KC Tyagi a ticket to the Upper House. Incidentally, Tyagi is considered to be a close friend of Yadav. That is not all. In Patna, Yadav tried his best to convince sceptics that everything is well between the JD (U) and the BJP. The very next day, Shivanand Tiwari, who took the field on Kumars behalf, tore into the Gujarat CM and the BJP. All this has now put Yadav in a fix. His support base in the party is nothing to write home about. Similarly, he does not enjoy a huge mass base either. Much like the babus, a worried Yadav is looking out for greener pastures these days.                            
	 BJP supporters had hoped that Ram Jethmalanis entry into the Rajya Sabha from Rajasthan on a party ticket will help bury the controversies that preceded his nomination. But it seems that the BJPs troubles are far from over. Many in the party believe that given Jethmalanis views  which run contrary to the BJPs on a number of critical issues  he will end up embarrassing the party in the long run. BJP spokespersons, apprehending troubled days, are now coaching themselves how to counter the wily lawyers arguments.                            
	 At a meeting of the group of ministers on the Bhopal gas tragedy, P Chidambaram apparently warned his colleagues against leaking information. The PM, he added, should not get to know the GOMs recommendations from its report and not the media. Hearing this, the other members got busy plugging the leaks.                        
	 Murli Deora, the petroleum minister, is keen to take on a new ministerial role. Deora is said to be reluctant to bear the burden of a ministry that often finds itself at the receiving end of citizens wrath. Not just that, the veteran Congress leader is also upset about the constant interventions from the Prime Ministers Office, which, in turn, wants the ministry to act as some sort of a visionary and solve Indias future fuel and energy problems. Deora has also been unhappy with the PMOs unwillingness to spare him a secretary during his travels to attend international events. But Deoras loss can turn out to be Satish Sharmas gain. Sharma, currently a member of the Rajya Sabha, is eager to step into Deoras shoes and is often heard reminiscing about his earlier stint in the said ministry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | How not to land up in trouble
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOW NOT TO LAND UP IN TROUBLE                              It is imperative for the Centre to pass a new Land Acquisition Act that actively engages with the ground realities, writes Bhaskar Dutta                        Time for a new experiment				                                       
	Recent events involving the Vedanta bauxite mining project in the Niyamgiri hills in Orissa and the Yamuna expressway stretching for 165 kilometres through Uttar Pradesh have once again brought the issue of land acquisition to the fore. In the former case, the Union environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, has refused permission to the mining company. In the latter case, farmers, whose land needs to be acquired for construction of the highway, have launched an agitation and only time will tell when Mayavatis dream project will be completed.        
	Both events have once again brought to the fore the issue of whether owners of agricultural land can be forced to give up their land on the principle of eminent domain. All densely populated developing countries have to confront this issue because it is a stylized fact of development that people have to move out of agriculture to the industrial and services sectors. The inevitability of this process is not difficult to explain. It is well-known that individual demands for various products do not grow proportionately as per capita incomes rise. In particular, we spend a smaller fraction of our incomes on food and other agricultural products as we grow richer  we buy more expensive cars, laptops, bigger houses. Since a sector should only produce what it can sell, the relative size of agriculture, and hence the population which it can support, must shrink.              
	Of course, while there are similarities between the two events, there is also an important difference. The protagonists in Orissa were Vedanta, a private industrial group, versus the local Dongria Kondh tribal group, environmentalists and the Union government. (Incidentally, there are allegations that the state government was solidly behind the Vedanta group since the state would have earned very substantial amounts of tax revenue if the mining project did take off.) In Uttar Pradesh, the protagonists have been the state government versus the farmers. This difference in turn raises a quite distinct set of issues.        
	In the case of the Vedanta project, and indeed in all instances where the private sector wants to acquire land, a prior consideration must be whether the project is in the national interest. Indeed, the Central government refused clearance for the project mainly on environmental grounds  it was deemed to have violated green guidelines embodied in the Forest Protection Act, 1980. Apart from the fact that a legal issue was concerned  namely, the violation of an act  a decision on projects of this type raises important trade-offs. How much of damage to the environment is tolerable or permissible if there are large gains to be made in terms of conventional measure of national well-being such as gross domestic product?         
	Even when a private project passes the first hurdle, namely, whether it is in the national interest, another contentious issue is the role of the government in facilitating the transfer of land. Should the State play an active role in the process or should it let the private entrepreneurs negotiate directly with the landowners? On the other hand, when land is acquired for the construction of dams or highways, the presumption must be that the State has done its homework and that the project is indeed in the national interest. Hence, the more important consideration becomes the appropriate level and form of compensation to be paid to landowners.        
	Readers of The Telegraph must be aware that there was a heated debate about these issues after Singur and Nandigram. In particular, the bloody clashes between the police force and protesting villagers which culminated in several deaths has made State involvement on behalf of private entrepreneurs in the process of land acquisition very unpopular. This has prompted Mamata Banerjee, who is as aware of popular sentiments as any other politician, oppose all attempts to formulate any new legislation governing land acquisition, particularly if the legislation specifies any active role for the State. This is extremely unfortunate because it is absolutely imperative for the Central government to pass an appropriate Land Acquisition Act.        
	A principal component of such an act has to be a very transparent basis for fixing both the rate of compensation as well as the form in which compensation is to be paid. The rate of compensation is perhaps easier to determine when land is sought to be purchased in order to set up a profitable project. In such cases, it is only fair that farmers be given some share of future profits from the project. Some long-term benefits in the form of jobs for family members of the displaced families and vocational training would smoothen the transfer of land. What is a fair level of compensation becomes a fuzzier notion when the land is acquired for a public project, since there is no tangible profit to be distributed in this case. But, as I discuss below, there are instances where this has not proved to be an insurmountable hurdle in land acquisition.              
	It is equally important that the act also specify that in all cases of disputes, each state would have a negotiation group which involves parties other than those directly involved in the transaction. The involvement of neutral arbitrators always helps to resolve disputes, and there is no reason why this should be less effective in conflicts involving land acquisition. Interestingly, versions of these ideas have been used with a fair amount of success in some instances. Consider, for example, the process through which land was acquired in order to build the new airport in Cochin. The negotiation committee in this case was chaired by a minister of the state government, and included representatives of 900 landowners, the district collector, the elected representatives of the locality or panchayat and a representative of the company operating the airport. This group held several meetings and finally arrived at a settlement scheme that was acceptable to the displaced farmers. A crucial element of the rehabilitation package was the provision of jobs to one member from each family that lost its land or house. In addition, the company also allotted taxi permits to land evictees to operate as part of the pre-paid taxi service that operates from the airport.        
	A similar process has also been used in several provinces in China. Since there is no reason to believe that these success stories are isolated instances, it is imperative to initiate discussions which can result in a new Land Acquisition Act that will incorporate some of the features of the Cochin experiment.

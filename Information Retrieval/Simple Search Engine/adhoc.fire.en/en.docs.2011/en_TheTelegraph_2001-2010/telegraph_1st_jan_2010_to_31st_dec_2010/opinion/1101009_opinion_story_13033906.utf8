	Tagore-inspired original works, too, have begun appearing for the sesquicentenary. In the Further Soil (picture), presented by British Council and ICCR, had its world premiere on Monday. Created by three musicians, two dancers and one actor  six artists equally divided between India and the UK  and directed by the British-Asian, Harmage Singh Kalirai, it touches base with Tagores likening of the Indian diaspora to a banyan growing in both its own and further soil, then explores the trope of travelling, homing back to scenes in trains and railway stations.        
	The project neither delves deep into Tagore nor charts brave new trails of discovery in its brief hour, but does embark on the perilous sea of intercultural performance without floundering, hopefully to undertake a voyage of intenser engagement in future. Its strength lies in the experimental abilities of each individual, led by Soweto Kinch, one of Englands finest jazz saxophonists whose lithe touch (and humorous intervention on how a black passenger feels) was a privilege to hear even in this unlikely context. Sanjukta Ray (Odissi) and Anusha Subramanyam (Bharatanatyam) fluidly blend classical with creative dance, while Dibyendu Mukherji (songs) and Rahul Ghosh (percussion) provide rich musical eclecticism. But Satinder Kaur Chohans textual fragments on journeys, so fashionable nowadays, and some images like the tree formation remain ordinary.        
	A young Bengali group, Ethic, enters Tagore more purposefully in its metatheatrical Kothay Pabo Tare, where a troupe rehearses Rakta-karabi and Dakghar as it wards off internal difficulties. In doing so, it realizes Tagores enduring national and personal relevance today. Dramatist-director Debashis Sengupta uses some obvious symbolism (a large Tagore bust downstage) and unnecessary techniques (a redundant narrator) but keeps viewers thinking and, most inventively, concludes with a surprising, stirring piece of audience participation.        
	The Patton-Padatik One-Act Competition this year chose Tagore as theme. La Martiniere for Boys proved that imaginative spirit inspired by a Tagorean idea, allowing students full liberty to interpret, can work better than straightforward dramatization. They lampooned scathingly the Poly-ticks of Indian politics and its nexus with religion and class, based on Rajarshi and Dui Bigha Jami, and riding Yash Sarafs superbly camp role-playing. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy composed an original Unwritten Tale, in which members of a Tagore club find their lives paralleling his characters. Other schools faltered for one of two reasons: selecting a common subject or source (like education and Tota-kahini) reduced distinctiveness, while veracity to Tagores stories or poems imposed a burden of historical and psychological credibility that young actors cannot possibly carry.

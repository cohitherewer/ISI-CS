                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NEW POSSIBILITY                                                    
	It is now six months since Nitin Gadkari was elected president of the Bharatiya Janata Party  long enough for a leader to make his mark. It cannot be said that he has done so. His first problem was that he inherited a senior leadership that was sullen and unenthusiastic. It was not entirely his fault, for at least some of his colleagues dejection was due to the partys disappointing performance in the 2009 general election. That drubbing contributed to the rise of Mr Gadkari; it discredited tried and tested leaders, and convinced the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that a change of guard was necessary. But whilst it could change the president of the party, it could hardly change the courtiers  even if they turned their backs on him.        
	It is not as if Mr Gadkari has not tried to raise the morale of his party. He has been active, verbose and aggressive. His choice of metaphors has been particularly sensational; to call Afzal Guru the son-in-law of the Congress, Digvijay Singh a descendant of Aurangzeb or the Yadav leaders specimens of the canine species, certainly shows a lively imagination, even if it betrays a youthful lack of judgment. His critics may say that he does not know the limits of decency. He could well reply that decency in politics is flexible and that he is a pioneer establishing new limits. It is surprising that his opponents have not followed him and found even more derogatory descriptions for him. They may be suffering from the illusion that the picture of Mr Gadkari speaks for itself. Whatever may be the reason, he has got away lightly till now. As he has demonstrated, politics in this country is virtually a game without rules; if his opponents have not given him as good as they got, it may be due more to their conservatism than to their inability. It would not be beyond Lalu Prasad at least to find some pithy expletives that could stick to Mr Gadkari.        
	The BJP leader perhaps realizes this and is drawing in his horns. His statement on the Ayodhya verdict is moderate to a fault; he has asked his party to do precisely the reverse of what it did leading up to the demolition of Babri Masjid. In his party, even moderation can be risky; extremist groups to its Right could accuse him of treason against their revered Hindu rashtra. It is not enough for him to eschew extremism; he needs to find new ground on which to pitch his tent. As it happens, fate has presented him with a golden opportunity. Onion prices have risen 70 per cent in the past month. They are poised to rise much further, since fresh supplies are months away. He has the chance to give the Congress government as good as the BJP government got in 1998 when onion prices rose tenfold within months.

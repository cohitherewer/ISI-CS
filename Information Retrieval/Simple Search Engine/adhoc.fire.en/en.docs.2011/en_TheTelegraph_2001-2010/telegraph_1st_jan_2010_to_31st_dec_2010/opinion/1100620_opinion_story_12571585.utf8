The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To school on an elephant
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TO SCHOOL ON AN ELEPHANT                          - Women schoolteachers in early times had a lot to contend with					 					      Malavika Karlekar                                                      
	By the end of the 19th century, school teaching became a favoured occupation for early women professionals. The reasons have not really changed over the last century-and-a-half: social respectability, hours that can be managed with running a home and a safe, confined environment encourage women to become teachers the world over. In India, neighbourhood schools as well as those for girls were obviously preferred, often with students and teachers going to school in curtained tongas, carriages and, later, buses. However, there were a few intrepid ones like Sarah Massey, who not only chose to work in a school in the Terai jungle around Dehra Dun, but also to use an elephant as her usual mode of conveyance. When in her eighties (she was born in 1888), Sarah Barakat Ullah (ne Massey) hand-wrote memories of her life that have been preserved by her granddaughter, Jamila Verghese. Apart from the written text, there are many photographs that tell the story of this unusual family, cataloguing, among other things, changing sartorial styles, and, of course, Sarahs life with the familys Ford and with Kishan Piyari, the elephant (photo).        
	As is the case for many women in her generation who wrote, these accounts were meant for Sarahs children and grandchildren who often wanted to know more about her life and background. Her paternal ancestors came from Afghanistan and the doughty Pathans soon converted to Christianity. Sarah writes that her mother was brought up in a mission, having been left there by her recently-widowed father who could not cope with a brood of nine. As he was a Brahmin, the missionaries called the young girl their little Brahmini.        
	Sarah comments that schools were not in such abundance in those days, and very few girls went out to places of learning unchaperoned. One day, a young Pathan, an Inspector of Schools named Rahmat Masih came a-calling. He had come to the Mission in search of a bride. He found the little Brahmini of the Mission, interested [sic] and as knowledgeable in theology as he was. Looking at this likely pair, Dr. Lucas said, Why dont we marry the Pathan to the little Brahmini? And so it was that Rahmat married the young Brahmini who, over the years, also bore nine children.        
	When Masih  who had become Robert Massey when he had worked briefly in the railways  was with the Scottish Mission in Muzaffarnagar, his daughters went to school in nearby Dehra Dun. The journey was long and tedious and transportation painfully slow. Sarah recounts that the first lap was in a train that took us to Saharanpur, and there being no further train connection, we continued on our way in ekkas (one-horse-drawn vehicles) in which two or three persons could sit. It was only after this never ending journey that we reached school. Being on the move obviously never bothered Massey  his daughter comments that he was always juggling jobs  and he soon set up a company called R. Massey and Sons in Dehra Dun. Its high point came in 1914 when it imported Indias first Ford car. Years later, Sarahs son recounted in Ford News, January 11, 1980, the excitement that ensued. People came by train and bullock cart to see the car. A crowd went to the station to watch the engine with rubber tyres being unloaded. It took an hour to fit the wheels and open the hood. The huge packing case was bought by a hawker to serve as a shop. Some 14 men, women and children climbed on the car and were given their first motor ride up to the familys garage. A photograph memorialized the occasion with Sarah standing by the side of the car in a long gown, with a dupatta wound elegantly around a sun bonnet; her younger siblings sit gleefully atop the bonnet of the Ford.        
	By this time, Sarah was well established in the school that her missionary colleague and a doctor, Vrooman, had started. The doctor had been personal physician to the Maharani of Tehri Garhwal, and when she felt the time had come for her to retire, she decided to start a training school for boys. Parting gifts are not unusual, but who leaves with an elephant? Sarah writes, The Maharajah Sahib presented the dedicated doctor with the palaces much loved hathni, Kishan Piyari, an old and reliable elephant, a friend who had served three rajahs faithfully, but was now too old to perform the arduous routine set for a palace elephant. So Kishan Piyari was honourably pensioned off, and became Dr Vroomans most reliable means of transport after her beloved horse. The school for boys was started in a small place called Bhogpur in the heart of the Rishikesh jungle. Vrooman asked Sarah to join her in training 30 or so boisterous boys to become, as she writes, model Indians; civilization for them was across the unpredictable Song River, the elderly Kishan Piyari their chief source of transportation. Nor was it always an easy ride: This ponderous pachyderm was extremely careful when she crossed the turbid monsoon waters of the Song.... She was only used by us when the river was high, otherwise we usually crossed the Song on horseback. When the stream was in flood, [she] would feel the surface of the water gingerly with her foot. If she felt even small stones rolling with the current, she would simply refuse to attempt the crossing. Her diet needed to be carefully maintained, and the mahout thought little of kneading the ten seers (a little less than ten kilos) of atta that went into feeding [her] by walking vigorously in it with bare feet!        
	While some of the students were children of the Maharajas officials, others were too poor to contribute, but paid in kind. Prem Singhs Gurkhali [sic] mother crossed the eight miles of jungle between the school and civilisation with ten seers of potatoes from their field on her back to pay for her sons education. Sarah says that dignity of labour was unheard of in those parts  not only did students come with their lower-caste servants carrying their baggage, but also many baulked at having to sow and hew in the school garden. She adds piously that such notions were quickly dispelled from the minds of her charges. Life with the boys whose ages were in the range of six to 14 years was not always easy. Sarah recounts a full moon night of horror when, on her rounds of the dormitory, she found it empty. She was in charge as Vrooman was away on work. Running around the school in desperation calling their names yielded no result, nor apparently, did her fervent prayers. However, when she went back to the dormitory at 4 am, each boy was sleeping blissfully in his bed. A flustered Sarah later told Vrooman about this; her unfazed response was, These are hill boys, Sarah dear, and it was a full moon night. You cant expect them to stay in bed while the water is beckoning, can you? When they knew that punishment was not at hand, the boys took her to the source of their pleasure. While water containers were filled, the boys extracted permission to swim in the spring waters officially.              
	Nature and animals remained a defining point in the schools life: a bullock cart soon joined Kishan Piyari and Durga, a poor woman out of job and in debt, used a mule to carry spring water to the school. Vrooman had had to work hard to persuade the army not to shoot the animal who was declared a most recalcitrant animal. Every now and then, of course, his obduracy showed as, just when he reached the school after trudging three miles with his precious load, he would suddenly roll over, jettisoning the pots and their contents. Poor Durga had to start afresh  but this was nothing compared to Sarahs anguish as a cobra hissed in a rose bush, and her nightly vigil against scorpions and their ilk made for several dramatic moments. Clearly, early women schoolteachers had often to contend with much more than educating children  and Sarahs adventures provide us with vignettes that validate the clich, pioneering zeal.       karlekars@gmail.com

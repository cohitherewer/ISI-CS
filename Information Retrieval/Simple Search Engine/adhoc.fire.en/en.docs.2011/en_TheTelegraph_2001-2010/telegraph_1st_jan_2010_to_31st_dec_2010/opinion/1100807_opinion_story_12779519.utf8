The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Two satires on some things dark 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TWO SATIRES ON SOME THINGS DARK                                   THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Among Bengali dramatists less familiar to the general public, Rajat Ghosh has made a name in the group theatre for satires that scrutinize the ludicrous aspects of our society that we take for granted.        
	In Phata Gopal, inspired by a short story by Subrata Halder and staged by Natasena, Ghosh targets corruption in our penal system  another dimension of the police service whose unintentionally comic antics have always given Indians immense pleasure. A conscientious chief jailer, significantly named Amulya Hati, tries to force a sea change in the workings of his prison where every possible hanky-panky occurs in the glorious tradition of Indian lock-ups. Pitted against the even more elephantine system, the determined Hatis efforts naturally fail. So he gets his just deserts: a transfer to another district. There, Hati finds that the notorious convicted murderer, Phata Gopal, has hired a substitute to serve his time in his cell, while he continues his daily anti-social activities outside. Again, Hati attempts to impose his idea of order, but to no avail. In a Kafkaesque reversal, he lands up on the wrong end of the law for having rubbed implicated powerful officers the wrong way.        
	Under Durga Chakrabortys direction, Phata Gopal is quite a romp, with Ajit Das (picture) giving Hati an almost manic-obsessive virtue. Papiya Dutta portrays his long-suffering wife as resigned to her lot of perpetual quick transfers, to the extreme of suggesting that they may as well live out of their suitcases.        
	In Bidhuda, which Ghosh himself directs for Ekti Dal, he takes on religion and blind faith. The gods get angry with a priest for withholding worshippers offerings, theirs by right, which he takes home instead for his own consumption. So Bidhata (alias Bidhuda) descends to earth to teach him a lesson. But he argues back that the gods hold no power anymore  they do not help humanity any longer  so they do not deserve any offerings. This denial of God seems nearly existentialist. Eventually, he even traps Bidhata in an inextricable plight.        
	Bidhuda leans to farce more than comedy, a lesser work than Phata Gopal, but certainly evoked lots of laughter from the audience. Some scenes are indeed quite funny, as when the gods line up before the priest and, with straight faces and the perfect intonation of a labour union, start chanting amader dabi mante habe/chalbe na chalbe na, and so on. Sukhendu Chattopadhyay imbues the priest with canny practicality; Bidhuda is clearly his vehicle as an actor.

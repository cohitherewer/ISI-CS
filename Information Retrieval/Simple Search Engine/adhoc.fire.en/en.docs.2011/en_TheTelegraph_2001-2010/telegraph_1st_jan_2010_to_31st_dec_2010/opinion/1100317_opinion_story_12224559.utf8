                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      LEGAL FAQS                                  Advocate Nibedita Roye answers your queries                  
	Q: My maternal uncle, who was a bachelor, had a joint account with one of his nephews. After his death our cousin withdrew the entire amount of over Rs 30 lakh from the account. My uncle had two sisters (both passed away before him) and eight nephews and nieces, including me. Do the rest of us have any right to a share of that money? If so, what should we do now?  
	C.K. Raman, Calcutta  
	A: Since your cousin was allowed by the bank to withdraw the entire amount in the joint account without having to obtain a succession certificate, it may be presumed that the account was on either or survivor basis. In that case you and your cousins do not have the right to claim the money.  
	Q:I had filed a petition three years ago against a case of cheque bounce. The case has not gone anywhere. I have a feeling that my lawyer is in cahoots with the person against whom I had filed the petition. What should I do?  
	B.G. Santhana, Calcutta  
	A: If you are no longer able to trust your lawyer it is better to change him or her. Regarding the case not going anywhere, you can seek the advice of another advocate who will go through your case records and give you his legal opinion on the present position of your case. He will also be able to tell you what can be done to get speedy relief for your grievance.      
	Q:I did a BTech from Calcutta University. Our results were announced in July 2008. I applied for a review of my answer scripts but was told by the university that it did not have a review system. But now that the university has introduced the review system, what should be my next course of action? Could the Right to Information Act be of any help?
    Santosh Kumar Das, Calcutta  
	A: You could write a letter to the state public information officer of your university or the vice-chancellor, referring to your earlier application for review and make a request under Section 6 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, for inspection and obtaining certified copies of answer scripts of the particular subject, provided the same are not destroyed by now. After inspection you could again request the university to review the answer script. If the university turns down your request on a frivolous ground you can file a writ application before the Calcutta High Court.

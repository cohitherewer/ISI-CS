	Secret woes                  
	Sir The editorial, Known secrets (April 21), reveals that the existing records of history and political science are incomplete and lacking in truth. India still follows the colonial practice of selective dissemination of facts to protect the interests of ruling factions. The people remain ignorant and powerless, presumably because they will not be able to face sensitive facts. The editorial speaks of a a fetish of secrecy. One wonders what the root cause of this fetishism is. It is possible that revealing such secrets will put our present democratic rulers in a compromising position. Despite agitation for the right to information and greater transparency in governance, the practice of secrecy continues to prevail in India.          
	Yours faithfully,         R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly            
	Sir In the editorial, Known secrets, a report by T. Henderson Brooks is mentioned. Perhaps the Congress-led government at the Centre has reservations about making this report known because Brooks might have been critical of such leaders as Jawaharlal Nehru, V.K. Krishna Menon and Lieutenant General B.M. Kaul. It was probably a combination of incompetence and arrogance on the part of these three that led to Indias defeat in the 1962 war with China.          
	In 1960, the then Chinese premier, Zhou Enlai, visited India to sort out the border dispute between the two countries, especially in the Aksai Chin region. Talks between Nehru and Enlai, however, ended in a deadlock. To make matters worse, Nehru later declared to the press that he had ordered the Indian army to throw out the foreign intruders. Mao Zedongs response to this has become history. Nehrus vision of India did not seem to include the eastern regions of the country, and successive governments have maintained that attitude. Even today, the Northeast receives scant attention in terms of infrastructure and development.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Not right          
	Sir  It was shocking to read of the wanton killing of a leopard in North Bengal (Police kill leopard, April 12). The increase of human population is directly proportional to the need for land. This has resulted in encroachment on the natural habitats of wild animals. Bereft of green cover, the animals stray into human habitation. Humans heckle these wild animals, partly out of fear, and as a result, put their own lives in danger. Such conflicts between man and animal usually end in tragedy.          
	As the case of the leopard suggests, our forest department officials are thoroughly ineffectual and ill-suited to their jobs. Had they managed to tranquilize and capture the animal in time, the incident would not have spiralled out of control. In recent times, a number of elephant calves have also been found, apparently abandoned. At least, that is what forest department officials would have people believe. Elephants are extremely evolved social creatures. Their young would never be abandoned unless the mother is killed. It is very likely that poaching continues unabated, even with the knowledge and tacit consent of those entrusted with protecting wildlife. The officials, moreover, are usually not competent enough to look after these abandoned calves or to help them integrate with another herd. Many elephant calves die an early death as a result.          
	When the leopard strayed into human territory, the officials should have kept onlookers at bay while they tackled the animal. This would have ensured the safety of the animal as well as of the people. It defies all logic that the police were summoned to deal with the animal. Moreover, the polices excuse of having shot the animal in self-defence is contemptible. It is high time that the people engaged to protect wildlife in this country are actually trained to perform their job. If need be, the government should get professional advice from people and organizations involved in this sort of work. It is hoped that unfortunate incidents like this are not repeated.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir The legalization of hawkers is an ill-advised decision on the part of the government, evidently calculated to get a few more votes in the approaching elections (Wayward, April 23). Pavements are blocked by hawkers, forcing pedestrians to walk on the roads. This results in an alarming number of accidents. Instead of building new flyovers for the swelling vehicular traffic in the city and focusing on development work, the Left Front government has put millions in danger for the sake of a few votes.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The hills have heard that before
                                                     THE HILLS HAVE HEARD THAT BEFORE                                  STALEMATE      Peace will elude Darjeeling unless the GJM leaders stick to their promises                                                  
	The Darjeeling hills have been quiet for some time now. The next round of tripartite talks is slated for May 14. Perhaps the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha is right now busy preparing itself for that meeting and sees no reason why it should disturb the peace, particularly as the tourist season is about to begin. Tourist trade cannot be the only reason why the GJM is treading cautiously, especially since in the past it had not allowed such considerations to interfere with its agitation. But today, it has a serious cause for concern. And that is  will an acceptance of the autonomy formula go down well with the people? Is it not possible that in the course of time, some others will emerge to brand Bimal Gurung and Roshan Giri as the betrayers, very much in the same way as they have branded Subash Ghisingh?        
	This thought and the realization that there is not much the GJM can do right now are enough to send shivers down the spine. The GJM, of course, is asserting that it will accept autonomy only as a stepping stone to statehood, but the hills have heard that before. They heard it when Ghisingh accepted the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council and then saw how the once-fire-eating leader forgot his past promises to fend for himself. To a people with a long history of deprivation and forgotten promises, the Gurungs and Giris may well appear to be following the same course.        
	And there would not be any shortage of politicians to provoke such thought. The Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League and the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists are very much present on the scene. Madan Tamang, president of the ABGL, for instance, has already stated that nothing short of statehood will satisfy the hill people. Any insistence by the GJM that if there is a lull in the agitation, it is only to strengthen the ground for a separate state, may well be interpreted as a post-dated cheque which cannot be trusted.        
	There is little that the Morcha can do about this. Nothing really has gone its way. It had hoped that the Bharatiya Janata Party would return to power and act on its promise to sympathetically consider the GJMs demand. That did not happen. What was worse was that Jaswant Singh, whom the Morcha helped to win from Darjeeling, got thrown out of the party. It had hoped that the Greater Coochbehar and Kamtapur movements will gain momentum and create a wide area of unrest, but that also has not happened. It had hoped that the adivasis of the Dooars will make common cause with it, but the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad has made it clear that it has an agenda of its own. To cap it all, after the initial promise, New Delhi has gone silent on the Telangana issue. So with no external factor coming to its aid, the GJM is today faced with the alternatives of either accepting autonomy on a larger scale than that enjoyed by the the DGHC or to allow the stalemate to continue. It has realized that a separate state will remain as elusive as a clear view of the Kanchenjungha during summer and autumn. But the problem is, how to admit that?        
	Talks to find a solution to a stalemate imply a compromise. The GJM would like the world to believe that this compromise will only be for tactical reasons. But as its leaders get enmeshed in running the local administration, they are more likely than not to move away from the goal they had promised. But the dream they had, like others had before them, cannot be expected to fade away. And as long as that does not happen, the hills will not really be quiet. Hopes of any permanent peace should not be cherished even if the talks in May or later end in handshakes all around.                    SUMANTA SEN

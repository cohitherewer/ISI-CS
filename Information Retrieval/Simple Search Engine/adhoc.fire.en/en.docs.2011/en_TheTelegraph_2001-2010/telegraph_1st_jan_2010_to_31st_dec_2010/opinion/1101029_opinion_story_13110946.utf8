                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN AN UNRULY SPACE                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	The experience of getting out of Delhi is always an eye-opener. To travel in a trunk route train and to partake of the horror of filth and ineptitude that epitomizes the Indian Railways is to shake oneself into the disgraceful reality of our status as an emerging power. The way the Indian public services have deteriorated over the decades is truly unacceptable. There was a time when you could correct the time on your watch by the moment when the Frontier Mail pulled out of Delhi station en route to Bombay. Today, in its new avatar, the Golden Temple Mail is invariably late, as is the august Kranti Express. India is losing its grip on simple, everyday public services, which now operate on a corroded grid with a degraded infrastructure, manned by a lazy and inefficient lot of government employees, who live and work with no accountability whatsoever.         
	The experience of travelling in an AC II reserved compartment was nauseating, to say the least, and quite unexpected, since the same train and stretch were not so disgusting even last year. The neglect was palpable. Someone has to be made accountable for this totally unnecessary degradation. It is shameful that 63 years down the road of development as a free and democratic society that is an emerging economic power with an extraordinarily skilled workforce, the Indian State has failed to maintain public services as it should have. There is no excuse at all for this frightening betrayal, which is compelling social anarchy. The trouble is that our leaders and administrators are shielded from this truth by the State apparatus that was mandated to serve the people of India but has reduced itself to serving this small class of rulers at the cost of the larger nation.                
	Stand still        
	Nizamuddin Railway Station in New Delhi has become a garbage dump. The tracks in the station are layered with human excreta. The Golden Temple Mail smelt like a sack of rotting onions and the toilet facilities were despicable. Nowhere in the world does this level of filth exist. I do not see why Indians should be insulted in this manner by our national railways that have, in the recent past, been amongst the best. It is not difficult to keep public places clean. There has to be an assessment of the responsibilities given to various departments. Sadly in India, no government department follows such a credo. Any public facility becomes an unruly free-for-all space till a strange breed of persons called the VIPs use the same services. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, officials appear and a clean-up ensues. Small wonder then that two-thirds of India is in revolt. It is a scary uprising of citizens that is fast becoming unmanageable.        
	To deal with this uneasy social turmoil, the State will use the same tools that protect it  its rulers and officers, who will come down on the citizens who have been crying out for justice and good governance. That will, very quickly, alienate Indians from the State. Your guess is as good as mine about what to expect at the end of the aggressive, dictatorial, abrasive, undemocratic, short strut of the State. What was intended for the people has become for the State. Why have our leaders deviated from the tenets enshrined in our Constitution, the established rules by which they were mandated to administer India? Why is the State so uncaring?         
	Governments with different ideologies come and go and come again. Unfortunately, the immaturity of the Indian political class makes each government feel that it has to undo the good work of the last one. This selfish and rather illiterate exercise has forced India to stand still and be overwhelmed by degrading infrastructure, systems and projects. It has also protected the politician and the babu from being accountable at the cost of us Indians.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Battle Plan
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BATTLE PLAN                                                    
	Every Maoist massacre  in Dantewada or elsewhere  shocks the nation. But what seems to be more shocking is New Delhis inability to act, and worse still, its inability to decide how to act. Mondays mayhem in Dantewada should put an end to this seemingly endless spell of indecision and confusion on the part of the Centre. If anything, the latest Maoist strike is a clear signal that the time for quibbling over strategies is over. The governments at the Centre and the states may continue to debate the strategies. But there should be no doubt that it is time to strengthen P. Chidambarams hands in fighting the rebels. Immediately after Mondays killings, the Union home minister has called upon the government to revisit his limited mandate in the battle. An expanded mandate for him would mean the involvement of the security forces in the battle either through the use of air power or in some other form. It may not necessarily mean, though, a full-scale military operation. But an expansion of Mr Chidambarams mandate can immediately do two things. It can give an edge to the governments battle against the rebels. And it can go a long way to dispel the impression that New Delhi has so far failed to win the battle because it has been willing to wound but afraid to strike.         
	Mr Chidambaram has faced criticism from the Opposition and also from within his own Congress party over his strategy to fight the Maoists. Some of the criticisms, especially from his senior party colleagues, are clearly misplaced and unfair. It cannot be anyones case that the government should view the Maoist insurgency merely as a law and order problem. It would be unfair to Mr Chidambaram to suggest that he himself sees it in that light. He cannot be unaware of the social and economic roots of the insurgency, which the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, highlighted recently in the partys organ, Sandesh. But this view of the Maoist rebellion does not alter the fact that it remains, in the words of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, the gravest danger to Indias internal security. To take the two views simultaneously into account does not constitute a conflict of interests. In fact, highlighting one at the expense of the other shackles the governments strategy with unnecessary confusion. It could cause worse disasters if the debate over strategy becomes an excuse for inaction.

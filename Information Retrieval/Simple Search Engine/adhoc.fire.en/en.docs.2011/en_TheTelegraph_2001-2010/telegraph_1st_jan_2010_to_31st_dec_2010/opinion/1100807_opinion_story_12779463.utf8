                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ANARCHIC LEGACY                          - Indians fail to see that the government is of, for and by the people					 					      Sunanda k. Datta-Ray                        Jamshedpur, July 2010				                                             
	It will be 68 years on Monday since the catchy jingle  Sarkar ki mal/ pani mein dal (Into the water with State property)  rallied Indians for what the viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, called by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857. August 9, 1942, the day that shook the world, may have driven one more nail into the coffin of the British raj but it was also responsible for an affective divide that accounts for much of todays disorder.        
	However necessary it was to launch the Quit India movement, its legacy exalted protest, made violence a way of life and incorporated words like hartal, gherao and bandh and, at a slightly more emotive level, andolan, sangathan and satyagraha, into everyday speech. India hasnt looked back since. From Jayaprakash Narayan to the Communist Party of India (Maoist), no one with a cause recognizes that the State has changed colour. JP was Mahatma Gandhi to the Congresss colonial State, his total revolution another call to arms in this land of a million mutinies. Inquilab zindabad!        
	Governments may no longer be alien but are seen not as the national authority but as creatures of the ruling party. Not only are they fair game for those of other political persuasions but whatever belongs to them is up for grabs. Quit India bestowed respectability on damaging public property. Attacks are not always frontal. The highly-placed criminals whose thievery over the Commonwealth Games has disgraced India internationally are as vicious saboteurs as any terrorist. Nor is every murderer on the rampage in Jammu and Kashmir or involved in the attacks that have devastated Bombay since 1993 an al Qaida warrior in Pakistani pay. Many of Indias worst enemies are Indian.               
	An all-out war of independence such as the Americans or Vietnamese fought and Subhas Chandra Bose contemplated might have avoided the confusion between them and us that underlies civil disorder. But transfer of power meant a bewildering overlap, with no one quite knowing how to cope with rebels become rulers. An amazed world watched the bizarre spectacle of a government protesting against itself when this happened in West Bengal in 1969. It might happen again in 2011 with equally explosive consequences.        
	For some, Quit India was an upsurge of nationalist fervour. Others saw it as a tactical failure since it excluded Mohammed Ali Jinnah (he called it a Himalayan blunder) and the Muslim League. It presented communists with the choice of joining the bourgeois campaign for swaraj instead of fighting the Peoples War shoulder to shoulder with their Soviet comrades. Indians at the 1948 Conference of Youth and Students of Southeast Asia Fighting for Freedom and Independence (otherwise the Calcutta Conference) argued fiercely over whether Quit India was a movement, a revolution, a revolt or an uprising. Many speak of August Kranti.         
	Ironically, Gandhi chose Quit India as his slogan in preference to Get out, which he thought impolite. But politeness did not interest the mob which sanctified violence and vandalism in the name of freedom. If the police confiscated and burned Gandhi caps, swarajists forcibly replaced topees with Gandhi caps. But the fun evaporated when they set fire to railway stations and signal boxes and tore up railway tracks. Bridges were bombed, telephone and telegraph lines cut and post offices, police stations and government buildings burned down. In one instance, a group of policemen were doused in kerosene and burnt to death. Some anti-Brahmin militants established peoples courts. The army and police retaliated with extreme brutality. Precedents were set for Chhatra Sangharsh Samitis, Naxalites, khaps and Maoists.        
	If any people think they are helping Gandhiji by these ruinous activities, they are deluding themselves and bringing cruel discredit on him, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari admonished, magnanimously exonerating Gandhi of blame for lawlessness. Rajaji opposed Quit India for the sound reason that disenchantment with the British was no reason to welcome the Japanese who will be ten times worse. It was a question of priorities: the invader had to be repulsed first. But Rajajis was  as so often  a voice in the wilderness. Understandably so, for many private irons sizzled in the patriotic fire. True, the criminal underworld may not have been able to hijack the movement if Gandhi and his colleagues had not been rounded up in the early hours that day. But all political organizations engage musclemen to do their dirty work and the Congress is no exception. Some historians believe Birla Brothers and the Marwari community financed strikes and sabotage so as to hit the British capitalists hard.         
	Gandhis own attitude seems to have been more ambivalent than Rajagopalacharis comment suggests. He banked on non-violent non-cooperation but the enabling resolutions pledge of a mass struggle on non- violent lines on the widest possible scale went somewhat further. Gandhis own Karenge ya marenge (Do or die) exhortation at Bombays Gowalia Tank not only went even further but appeared to contradict the fetish he made of the sanctity of means over ends, even to the extent of reiterating that means were the end. Mobs are not strong on subtlety. Since violence breeds violence  another Gandhi aphorism  clashes with authority were inevitable.        
	Sir Padamji Ginwala withdrew from politics without abandoning his commitment to independence precisely because of this: he knew that preaching civil disobedience would encourage disrespect for the law. The jurist, G.D. Khosla, thought Indians may have been harking back to an older ethic. He wrote an article listing a number of instances from the epics (stealing the nectar of immortality from the churning of the ocean, deploying the hermaphrodite, Shikhandi, or the Ashwathama hatah... iti gaja legend) that I published in the Seventies under a heading something like A Little Evil For the Greater Good. Orthodoxy rumbled its disapproval but no one challenged the examples.         
	Not that I would attribute current rumbustiousness to atavistic duplicity. Trains are derailed and offices closed down because 63 years after the British quit, there is still little sense of identification with the government. Agencies like West Bengals Tram and Bus Fare Enhancement Resistance Committee or Bihars State Struggle Committee of Workers and Employees against Price Rise and Professional Tax are as proud of defiant nomenclature as of their ability to bring life to a standstill. Venal politicians and civil servants who wallow in the pomp and protocol of the raj (shades of Orwells Animal Farm) compound the distance between ruler and ruled. Churchills dictum that if you have ten thousand regulations you destroy all respect for the law remains relevant for liberalization notwithstanding, India still bristles with dos and donts.               
	Occasionally, there are flashes of belonging. As railway minister, the late Madhavrao Scindia was fond of recounting a possibly apocryphal story of public-spirited commuters on Calcuttas Metro (this was before Delhi had one) angrily pouncing on a man who had crumpled up his used ticket and thrown it on the platform. Apparently, they forced him to pick it up and deposit it in the litter bin. The Metro was theirs; it had to be kept tidy.         
	Such concern for public property is rare. When announcing his reforms as finance minister, Manmohan Singh memorably reminded listeners that Indians are no longer pitted against the East India Company. But who paid heed? He may have convinced rich Indians (whose households for the first time outnumber low income households, according to the National Council of Applied Economic Research) that all multinationals dont nurse imperial ambitions. But ordinary folk have yet to be persuaded that government is, indeed, of, for and by the people. There is no short and simple formula to counter Quit Indias anarchic legacy. But it would be a beginning for Incredible India not to turn up its nose at the large pockets of backwardness that constitute what the prime minister calls Indias biggest internal security threat.

	If you are wondering why some mediocre books get published, you can put it down to one simple factor: networking. This is vital for all new writers because they are not in a position to say in a party, Im a writer, a statement that can result in a publishing marriage. But they can say, Im really interested in wildlife preservation. That may not result in a marriage but it could result in a commission that is the first step in getting published.         
	Whom do you network with, because you may not be thought of as an author but as somebody who knows something about something? To begin with, there are two main centres that would ensure that you get known. First, the media  both print and electronic  and, second, a few editors of publishing houses who would examine your publishing proposal or commission you on a project. Merit still matters in some houses, but familiarity is equally important in a crowded market.        
	The media have become very important in recent years because they introduce you to the reading public and get you known. Publishers, too, rely heavily on the media for post-publication publicity, and if they know you have contacts in high places it helps to tip the scales in your favour.         
	Some authors leave it all to a literary agent to fix it for them, but it is far better to have direct contact with the editor who will pass the work for publication, prepare the costing, fix the likely price and then get the marketing department and accounts to finally approve the publication. No publishing decision is taken by the editor alone; it is always a team decision where all the players have to agree with the presentation of the editor.         
	How does an author break ground with newspapers and magazines? By writing articles, preferably for the editorial/op-ed pages, where they will be noticed. Nowadays, the print media have mugshots to accompany articles that authors should supply themselves after they have been suitably touched up by photo studios.         
	But what is important is that authors spread their net far and wide in a variety of publications, preferably those with wide circulation. And, in an age of specialization, stick to one or two subjects of public interest. Publishers want their likely authors to be identified as specialists in a particular field, not as generalists writing on a variety of subjects. This makes marketing easier because the author is already known for his or her expertise in the field.        
	And once the credentials have been established, the rest follows: invitations from TV studios and book commissions by publishers. Because of developments in print and communication technology, there is an appetite for raw material. But to exploit this, authors must network and get well-known, at least to a segment of the market.

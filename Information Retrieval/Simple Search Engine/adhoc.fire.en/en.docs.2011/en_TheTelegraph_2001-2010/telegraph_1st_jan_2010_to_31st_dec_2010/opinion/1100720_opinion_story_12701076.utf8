The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time for some unpleasant facts
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME FOR SOME UNPLEASANT FACTS                                  FEAR FACTOR      The recent G20 meet spread alarm among leaders of sovereign nations, and with good reason as well                                                  
	The recent G20 meet was a historic one. The leaders of the sovereign nations displayed one emotion  fear. They were terrified that if they fail to reduce the budget deficits noticeably, the financial markets would demand a higher price for buying the bonds that have to be sold to pay for the deficit  which, in turn, would drive up long-term interest rates. So they agreed to halve the budget deficits by 2013  a high target indeed, considering the level of unemployment.         
	They also agreed to reduce or stabilize the public debt to gross domestic product ratio by 2016. A critical issue was left out  guidelines on reforms of global financial institutions. Both facts confirm the fear of the financial markets. And like most fears, this one, too, is irrational. For instance, Greece agreed to harsh austerity in lieu of the European Union-International Monetary Fund loan only to find that its risk spreads grew ever wider. But the leaders took the opposite lesson. Austerity measures now would hasten deflationary spirals in both the continents, where unemployment is raging, in a mutually reinforcing way. And it will spread across the world through a fall in global trade since the United States of America and the EU together account for roughly half the global output. Just see how it would happen.        
	The US has revised down its growth for the first quarter and its unemployment is feared to reach 9.8 per cent while 8 million have lost their jobs in the recession. This is its worst employment scenario since the 1930s. Investment on plants and equipment is at its lowest level, as a share of GDP, in 40 years. Europes expansion during the last winter was negligible and the average unemployment is above 10 per cent. The core inflation in US and the euro-area is less than 1 per cent while both are saddled with huge spare capacity. A marked cut in public spending, and therefore in demand, would make industry reduce production and offer discounts to offload the inventory. Business and people will delay purchases and save more, anticipating a drop in prices and joblessness, reducing demand further and setting off a deflationary spiral. Import demand will fall, dragging down exports in the US, Europe and all over the world. National income and tax revenue will fall causing debt servicing and balancing the budget even harder. Central banks cant lower the rate of interest further which is just above zero. They can only generate electronic money through the banking system, risking hyperinflation thereby.        
	At a deeper level, the meet has exposed the basic flaws of the economic model that the West has imposed on the world, namely, globalization and its emphasis on low tariff rates. Consequently, China with its undervalued currency and a vast, skilled and cheap workforce has gone on accumulating trade surplus while the US has accumulated trade deficit. So a chronic imbalance has developed in the world economy giving rise to concentration of wealth in a few financial institutions. Thus China is saddled with a $2.4 trillion reserve, most of which it keeps with the US banks and treasury, which, in turn, are flooded with cash. Deployment of these funds has caused serious problems. In fact, it was one of the major factors responsible for the US housing bubble that had burst in 2007, precipitating the September 2008 crisis.        
	Financial liberalization, a concomitant of globalization and a condition for IMF loans, has enabled capital to move freely at home and abroad in varying degrees, thanks to deregulation and capital account opening. In reality, private capital, mostly invested in the FIs, has moved to various markets: namely, currency, stocks, real estate and commodities in different countries, primarily for speculative gains. In the process, they have ruined economies and have amassed enormous wealth. So much so, that way back in early 1999, the daily transaction in the currency market alone was estimated at $1.5 trillion. Recent estimates are not available. But one can well imagine the astronomical scale of speculative finance. This gigantic power of the FIs unnerved the G20 nations and they acted out of fear. Where is the sovereignty of the nations?

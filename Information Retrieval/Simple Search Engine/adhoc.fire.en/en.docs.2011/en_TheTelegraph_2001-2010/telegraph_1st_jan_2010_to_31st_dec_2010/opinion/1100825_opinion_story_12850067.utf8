The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Of no accord
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OF NO ACCORD                                                    
	Who is an Assamese? A government-appointed committee that has been working on it apparently for nearly ten years promises finally to offer an answer by October. The search for an answer, however, began, at least on paper, in August, 1985, when New Delhi signed the Assam accord to end the six-year-long agitation by the All Assam Students Union. Today, few Assamese are in a mood to celebrate the 25th anniversary of what then was described as a historic accord. The Assamese peoples disappointment with the accord is easy to understand. The AASUs anti-foreigners agitation was sparked off by a fear that the ethnic Assamese would lose their territorial identity and culture in the face of an unending wave of Bangladeshis infiltrating the state. The fear unleashed a long spell of violence, which culminated in the horror of the Nellie massacre. The accord not only brought peace back to Assam but also raised hopes that the Assamese would no longer have to live in their own state in constant fear of being swamped by illegal settlers from across the international border. Clearly, that hope has been dashed. The Assamese people feel they have been let down by successive governments in New Delhi and Dispur.         
	Assams fear should also be Indias concern, especially in these times of trans-border terrorism. Unfortunately, governments tend to see the problem only as a matter of political expediency. If the identification and deportation of foreigners in Assam did not get off the ground, it was only partly because of the inadequacy of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, which the Supreme Court struck down, or the lack of judges for the tribunals. The more important reason was absence of political will. The illegal settlers in Assam have become such a large vote bank that some parties simply cannot do without them. The issue of the Assamese identity and the states politics will continue to be linked to the question of foreigners in the state. That the indigenous Assamese people may face this threat to their identity had been predicted by both British and Indian administrators for over a century. But using the issue merely for electoral politics is not going to solve the problem. An official definition of their identity may mean nothing to the Assamese unless their fear of losing it is addressed. It is time for a new deal to heal Assams old wound.

	Accent slur                  
	 Sir  The front-page report criticizing President Pratibha Patil and Doordarshans coverage of the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games was in bad taste (Horror to hurrah: Guess whos grinning after the Games opener, Oct 5). Patil cannot be faulted for putting a clipped edge on her Ps and Qs when even Westerners often speak with a false accent. And, Ten Sports had fared worse than Doordarshan when it had cut short the telecast of this years US Open while the matches were in progress.     
	Yours faithfully,       
Rajorshi Das, Calcutta

      
	More questions          
	Sir  The arrest of the principal of La Martiniere for Boys and three teachers of the school in the Rouvanjit Rawla case is rather shocking (Principal, 3 teachers held in caning case, Oct 5). Children are sent to school to be educated and to pick up skills that they may not be able to acquire at home. For this to be possible, students and their parents must abide by certain norms of discipline imposed by the school authorities.           
	Rouvanjit Rawla had often violated school rules, and his offences had been brought to the notice of his parents. The incident which prompted the caning that purportedly led to Rouvanjits suicide involved setting off stink bombs in class. Such an act should have caused Rouvanjit to be rusticated. The parents should also have been blamed since it is their duty to ensure that their son does not commit such nuisance. Since Rouvanjit did not end his life immediately after the caning, I doubt whether there is a direct link between the punishment and the boys death. I see no reason why the school principal, Sunirmal Chakravarthi, should be arrested. Chakravarthis arrest is a slur on the educational system. The case against the teachers should be dismissed immediately.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa   
	 Sir  The editorial, Unwarranted (Oct 6), rightly points out that the manner in which Sunirmal Chakravarthi was arrested in the early hours of the day is unacceptable. Whether the case against Chakravarthi is justified or not, the police could have done their job more decently.Since the Supreme Court has banned corporal punishment, teachers must be careful about the ways of disciplining students. But parents should also not be indifferent to the behaviour of their wards. A class of students should not suffer because of the unruly behaviour of a disruptive few.           
	Yours faithfully,        Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta
      
	Sir  The action taken by the police against the principal and three teachers of La Martiniere for Boys is welcome. In recent times, teachers have often been punishing students in a way that is nothing less than barbaric. Of course, if children are being naughty, they have to be punished. But the punishment should not border on physical assault.   
	It is time that stringent guidelines are laid down on the disciplinary function of teachers so that they do not cross the line. Justice should also be meted out to the seven-year old student of Tagore School in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, who lost her vision in one eye after being thrashed by her teacher on July 3, 2010. Delinquent students should be counselled instead of being beaten.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Ram, Pune

                          
	Erratum          
	In the editorial, No winners (Oct 8), Janata Dal (Secular) has been wrongly identified as Janata Dal (United). The error is regretted.           
	 The Editor

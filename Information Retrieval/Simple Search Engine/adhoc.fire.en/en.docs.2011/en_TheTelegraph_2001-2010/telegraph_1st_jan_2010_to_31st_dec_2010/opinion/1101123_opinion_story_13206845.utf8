	Haste is not always a virtue in politics; neither is procrastination. Timing is of the essence as is the best utilization of opportunities. In retrospect, it would appear that the government went too much on the defensive when the allegations broke against A. Raja, the former minister of telecommunications. To an extent, the response is understandable because in India nothing stirs public opinion more than the smell of corruption. Righteous knives are immediately sharpened to cut into the existing government. The memory of Bofors lingers and therefore the present government moved with uncharacteristic swiftness to remove Mr Raja. There was no attempt made to transform a threat into advantage, which could have been done by showing that Mr Raja, whatever his personal rectitude, has actually opened up the market that had previously been dominated by a couple of very powerful operators. In the haste to jettison Mr Raja, two other things were overlooked. One was that his impending exit could have been made part of a larger change, namely a reshuffle of the cabinet. Second, this would mean that the government was not merely conceding to a demand to remove Mr Raja but to a wider concern about better governance. His exit could have been made an occasion to get rid of non-performers.        
	A cabinet reshuffle is a very powerful instrument in the hands of a prime minister. Manmohan Singh, for reasons best known to him, is a reluctant user of the weapon. Even if Mr Singh is not willing to follow the advice of Lord Mountbatten to Jawaharlal Nehru to change the cabinet very frequently, he can emulate Indias first prime minister, who used cabinet reshuffles with great effect during his long term in office. At the present conjuncture, Mr Singh does not even need an excuse to make changes in the cabinet. The ministry of external of affairs is waiting for new appointments not only because a minister of state had to resign under a shadow a few months ago. The nation could do with a more effective and a more articulate foreign minister. Kapil Sibals competence is now stretched as he is looking after three important portfolios. Is the prime ministers reluctance related to his perceptions about the absence of talent? Or is it a case of a failure to make capital out of a crisis? Mr Singh somewhat underestimates the goodwill he commands.

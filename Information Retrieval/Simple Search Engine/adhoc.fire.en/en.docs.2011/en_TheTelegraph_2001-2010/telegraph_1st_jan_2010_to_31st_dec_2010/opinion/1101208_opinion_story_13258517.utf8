The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Stay Behind
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STAY BEHIND                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	Desperately sad, said the prime minister. Absolutely heartbreaking, chimed in the culture minister. But dont the British famously have stiff upper lips? What disaster was this that so moved two of their politicians?        
	Fire at the British Museum, baking the Elgin marbles, the Benin bronzes and other noted British artefacts (OK, ex-Athenian and Nigerian artefacts, if you insist) and, incidentally, several hundred visitors? An aircrash killing the entire royal family, forced as an economy measure to fly Air Kazakhstan? The death of some well-loved racehorse?        
	Id hate to lose the Elgin marbles, let alone their visitors, though I could live, in respectful regret, without the royals, and wouldnt give two hooves about a horse. But the tragedy was none of these: just the world football authorities failure last week to locate their 2018 World Cup in England, despite frantic lobbying by David Beckham, Prince William and the said prime minister, aided by his culture colleague, whose portfolio, curiously, includes football. Stiff upper lip, my foot.        
	That feature of the head is in fact as outmoded in todays Britain as the bowler hat. Mawkish sentimentality has replaced it. This reached its apogee over Princess Di, but it has been bubbling ever since. A young motor-biker quits the pub car-park, hits a tree and the local weekly laments his tragic death. A child drowns, and television broadcasts the parents private grief to the nation, in words crafted for them by the family solicitor, while total strangers drape their front wall with flowers. No rifleman can step on a Taliban mine but he is a hero and his colonel must aver him the finest soldier in the regiment.        
	All this diminishes not just the British character but also the English language. Tragic is the word for tragedies, not for some fool too drunk to stay off the road. Family grief for a child is one thing, solemn eulogies and phrases like she made the world a better place should be another. Hero denotes an exceptionally brave man, not just one tolerably brave, however unlucky. And any minister who feels broken-hearted because some sporting event is allocated elsewhere should go for an electro-cardiogram, while musing how hed react to a tragedy more nearly deserving that adjective  which even at best is always an exaggeration.         
	Publicity is the broth in which this overheated language thrives. Just as politicians lie, we journalists habitually exaggerate. We write avalanche, wave, flood or now tsunami when all we mean is theres a lot of it about. Fury does headline duty for displeasure, joy for contentment, woe for it didnt work out. Film critics roll out must-see, fashionistas must-have for you might enjoy watching/wearing this. And of course, we all declare that were all doing/thinking/feeling/saying this or that when what we mean is I and a few people like me.         
	Not unreasonably, ordinary folk imitate us when the camera crew turns up, indeed after it has left again. Heads are cocked sideways until they look ready to fall off, voices rise or fall to suit the wanted sentiment, vocabulary soars or sinks. Vox pop, as journalists used to call it, the voice of the people, often reflects merely what they expect us hacks to expect of them, a wild overstatement of what they actually think.         
	We journos  or politicians  can hardly blame others for doing what we so readily do. We cheapen language, why not they? But cheapened it is. And the birthplace of English, Britain, with its mighty down-market press, brilliantly written albeit less famous for truth, is leading the way downhill. Too bad its not so brilliant at sports politics.         
	Indian English  I didnt say politicians  is not (yet?) rushing as fast downhill, if only, though not only, because the vox pop of India is less likely to be expressed in English. May it stay behind.

	The 2006 decision by the United States of America to send Ethiopian troops into Somalia was one of the stupidest moves in a very stupid decade. Recently, some of the chickens spawned by it came home to roost.        
	Last week, the al-Shabab militia launched a massive war against African Union peacekeepers, most of them Ugandan, protecting the so-called government of Somalia. However, all it actually governs is a few dozen blocks in Mogadishu, and its members are a group of Somali warlords and clan leaders who proclaimed themselves the Transitional Federal Government in 2004.        
	Six members of parliament were among the 40 killed when an al-Shabab suicide squad stormed a hotel in Mogadishu; but there will be no by-elections to replace them. They were never elected in the first place. The TFG made no progress in reuniting the country. Its surviving members sit surrounded by al-Shabab fighters who control most of the sprawling capital.         
	Southern Somalia has been trapped in a civil war since the last real government collapsed in 1991, but the current round of killing was triggered when the US invited Ethiopia to invade Somalia in 2006. This was a bit high-handed, especially since Ethiopia is Somalias traditional enemy, but Washingtons aim was to destroy the Islamic courts in Somalia.        
	The TFG failed to restore order in Somalia, but the Islamic Courts Union took a different approach. Its roots were in the merchant class in Mogadishu that simply wanted a safer environment to do business in. It understood that Islam was the only common ground on which all of the countrys fissiparous clans and militias might be brought together.        
	The Islamic courts, applying sharia, were instruments by which society would gradually be brought back under the rule of law. For a while, it worked amazingly well. Peace zones spread through southern Somalia, the epicentre of the unrest; trade and employment revived. A made-in-Somalia solution emerged from the chaos.                
	More violence        
	Inevitably, younger supporters of the Islamic courts movement enjoyed ranting in public about the virtues of al Qaida, the wickedness of Americans, and matters they knew little of. Every popular movement has a radical youth wing that specializes in saying stupidly provocative things. It is the job of the adults, inside and outside the organization, to contain the excesses, and not to panic.        
	Alas, the US panicked, or at least its intelligence agencies did. The mere word, Islamic, set off alarm bells in the Bush administration. Washington concluded that the ICU, Somalias best hope of escaping perpetual civil war, must be removed. Since the TFG was not up to the task, Washington asked Ethiopia, Somalias old enemy, to provide the necessary troops. A divided Somalia was clearly in Ethiopias long-term strategic interest, so why not? Especially since the US financed the whole operation.        
	Ethiopian troops invaded in 2006 and the ICU was destroyed, leaving the field clear for the movements radical youth wing, al-Shabab. Attacks on both the TFG and the Ethiopians multiplied, and civil war and chaos returned. After two years, the Ethiopians, having wrecked any prospect of peace in Somalia, went back home.         
	Since late 2008, only African Union troops have kept alive the fiction of a Somali government friendly to the US. But al-Shabab is now trying to overrun the last patch of Somali territory still held by the TFG. The northern half of former Somalia is already at peace and will remain so. Southern Somalia will have to endure more years of violence because the US never understood that the ICU could be its ally in stabilizing Somalia. But nothing particularly bad will happen to anyone except the Somalis, so thats all right.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DRESSING DOWN                                                    
	How should one dress while visiting a temple? Should such a question be at all relevant in a country that takes pride in having a robust democracy? Is it not but natural that democracy and divinity  the two great levellers of humanity  should fit each other as a hand does a glove? With its embargo on all other dresses except for saris and salwar-kameez for women, and dhotis, simple shirts and trousers for men, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam has given a new edge to these questions. Although the temple tried to impose a similar dress code in 2003, it was quashed by the late Y.S.R. Reddy when he took over as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. The ostensible reason behind this injunction, as clarified by the temple authorities, is concern for ordinary people who may feel offended or awkward standing in queue with people in fashionable western clothes. Apparently, such sartorial differences lead to tension between two sets of differently attired devotees. So a ban on provocative outfits was considered to be the most sensible course of action by the Devasthanam board.        
	Such may be the ground realities, but there are other things between heaven and earth  such as the freedom of expression  that fundamentally go against the spirit of such sweeping, draconian rules. Both democracy and divinity make no distinction between the rich and the poor, the famous and the unknown. Be it the rule of law or divine blessing, everyone has an equal right to invoke its protection. By the same logic, every individual is also entitled to their right to self-expression that is endorsed by law, both divine and secular. If people are provoked by well-dressed citizens standing in queue with them, as the temple authorities claim, then the situation looks more like a serious law-and-order problem than a crisis precipitated by inequality. Indeed, to try to iron out differences in individual tastes and social standing in one fell stroke is to undermine the essentially plural spirit that is famously associated with India. It is not as though only Indians, and that too just Hindus, visit Tirumala. The temple is also thronged by visitors of other faiths, as also by foreigners, who may feel more at ease in other kinds of clothes. To impose a blanket ban on specific dresses is to thus disregard the question of personal choice and comfort. That, perhaps, is the sort of disrespect one least expects while visiting the house of god.

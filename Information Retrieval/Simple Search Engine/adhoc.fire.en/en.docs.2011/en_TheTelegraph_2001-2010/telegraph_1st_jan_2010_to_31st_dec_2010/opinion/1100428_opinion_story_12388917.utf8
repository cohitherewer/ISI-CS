	Q:I returned to my parents in India after putting up with verbal and physical abuse from my husband and in-laws in Singapore for three and half months. My in-laws and husband have taken lakhs of rupees from me. My marriage was registered in India but my husband is a citizen of Singapore. How do I move for divorce and get my money back? Can I ask for maintenance?        
	Name withheld                
	A: You have not stated under what act your marriage was registered or under what religious customs you got married. If your marriage was registered under the Hindu Marriage Act or the Special Marriage Act, you can file for divorce and maintenance once a year has elapsed from the date of your marriage. But you may find it difficult, expensive and time-consuming to recover your money or the maintenance since your husband is a foreign citizen.              
	Q:I booked a flat in 2002 and took possession in 2008. Despite repeated requests, the builder has not arranged for the registration of the flat. Whose responsibility is this  the builders or mine?        
	Name withheld                
	A: Without the registration you cannot claim to be the owner of the flat. Since you have taken possession, it may be assumed that the entire consideration amount has been paid for. Under such circumstances it is the builders responsibility to register the flat in your favour as it is he who will have to convey the title of the flat in your favour. Send him a legal notice at once and if he doesnt comply, file a complaint before the consumer disputes redressal forum against him for deficiency of service and specific performance of the agreement for sale.              
	Q:Our premises were leased to a public sector bank. The lease expired 20 years ago. But the bank continued to occupy the space and was depositing the lease rent every month in our current account. We gave them a written notice not to do so and to get the lease renewed at the current market rate. When the account was closed about a year and a half ago, the bank began sending us pay orders at the old rate. What should we do now?        
	Ankit, via email                
	A: Since it is obvious that the bank has no intention of renewing the lease at the current market rate send the bank a legal notice for vacating the premises. And if there is no positive response from the bank, file an ejectment suit against it.

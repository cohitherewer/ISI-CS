	Guess who is keen to step out of the shoes of Union ministership? No, we are not talking about the embattled A Raja here. It is none other than Ambika Soni, the Union minister for information and broadcasting. Soni is keen to return to the party as she feels that she no longer enjoys the clout she did as the gen-sec attached to the Congress president. All those who used to queue at her door are now found paying their respects to Ahmad Patel. Even in the I amp;B ministry, someone else calls the shots. For instance, during Manmohan Singhs recent press meet, Harish Khare, the PMs media advisor, not only moderated the show but also decided who the invitees would be and who would get to ask questions to the PM. To top it all, when Doordarshan tripped, disturbing the live feed momentarily, a red-faced Soni was left to deal with the crisis. Because of all the troubles she has been facing, Soni has expressed a desire to go back to her roots. It remains to be seen whether the party president allows this prodigal daughter to return home.                        
	Ever since Narendra Modi found himself in a spot of bother, he has been busy sprucing up his public image. First he got Amitabh Bachchan to agree to become the brand ambassador of Gujarat. Perhaps unsure of whether the ageing superstars magic would work wonders for him, he has now cosied up to none other than Munnabhai who, as we all know, has a cure for every kind of trouble. Sanjay Dutt recently met the Gujarat chief minister with a proposal to set up a film studio in the state. Modi is only too keen to oblige the two men who have a history of being close to the Congress. Even as Modi basks in the limelight, the news of Bachchan and Dutt teaming up with him is likely to cloud the faces of Congressmen with despair.                        
	 Has anyone ever wondered how the Congress manages to keep its allies together? Despite their strong opposition to the womens reservation bill, both Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav have not shown any inclination to distance themselves from Manmohan Singh and his party. Not only that, Mulayams sworn enemy, Mayavati, has also pitched in occasionally to help the coalition survive. Now it seems that more people are willing to become members of the friendship club with the Congress. Ajit Singh and his RLD are already discussing possibilities of a merger. Chiranjeevi has also promised to extend unconditional support to the Congress during the elections to the Rajya Sabha, while HD Deve Gowda, apparently, has managed to secure a seal of approval from Madam to bail out the JD(S)s nominee to the Upper House. Perhaps the Opposition, which has not quite managed to put up a united front all this while, needs to learn a trick or two from Indias Grand Old Party when it comes to keeping friends happy.                            
	 This is also the season of patch-ups. The Ambani brothers buried their differences following the apex court verdict. Reconciliation efforts are on in full swing between the Marans and MK Azhagiri. Apparently, Kalanidhi Maran met Azhagiri when he visited New York and the meeting went well for both sides. Meanwhile, things are also cooling down in Mumbai with a section of leaders working hard to bring Raj and Uddhav Thackeray to the negotiation table. After the debacle at the hustings, the estranged cousins have realized that the electoral fortunes of their respective parties depend on the possibility of the two men mending the fence. All this makes it evident that the patch-ups have not been brought about by a change of heart but by cold logic.                            
	 The AICC gen-sec, Satyavrat Chaturvedi, has done what none could accomplish before him. In his room at 24 Akbar Road, he has put up a photograph of Rahul Gandhi, in addition to the mandatory pictures of Sonia Gandhi and her husband. Even by the established standards within the Congress, a party gen-sec putting up the picture of another gen-sec is certainly odd. But Chaturvediji surely sees nothing strange in this.                            
	 The defence minister, AK Antony, arrived at the first anniversary of UPA II wearing a NDA cap. Now, before Congressmen rise up in arms, we must add that Antony had come to attend the event straight from a meeting at the National Defence Academy.                      
	The Advanis cooled their heels for a few days in Panchmarhi, away from the hectic lobbying for Rajya Sabha seats and the heat generated by the Naxal violence. The Bharatiya Janata Party leader also found time to indulge in some sightseeing. With his daughter in tow, he visited the caves, which, according to legend, were the dwellings of the Pandavas. Daughter Pratibha also screened her documentary, Dada, which featured clippings of Hindi films and songs that have been juxtaposed with shots of her father in various moods. When asked whether she had plans to join politics, she answered that she hadnt yet mulled over the option. Seeing how the spotlight has shifted away from her father, one can understand why Pratibha is in no hurry to enter the rough and tumble world of rajneeti.

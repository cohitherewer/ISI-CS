The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A classic from the Bard and seven short stories
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A CLASSIC FROM THE BARD AND SEVEN SHORT STORIES                                  Theatre - Ananda Lal                                                  
	Youth theatre in English brought back two of its familiar Calcutta institutions with new productions after two years. The unique, differently-enabled The Action Players turned to Bonophools short stories in translation, dramatized by Zarin Chaudhuri as The Pebble and the Tal Tree. Bonophool often wrote impressionistic miniatures, from which Chaudhuri chose seven very carefully, for together they covered every aspect of life  growing up, love, marriage, old age, death and even nature. The assemblage gave the semblance of one connected strand, though one longs for a single, fully-developed narrative from TAP, which it has not done in some time.        
	Directing a mix of seasoned hands and juniors, Chaudhuri and her deputies, Shanno Begum and Jhooma Sircar, sculpted cameos that ranged from the accomplished to the sketchy. The best of them included Lavina Jagtiani in the title story, effervescent as the pebble aspiring to tal heights. The Lost Eyes featured neat ensemble work among the heroine, Mini (Neelum Begum), her friend (Kinjal Shah) and mother (Jhooma Sircar). Jagattarini and the Crow showed great chemistry between the harassed old woman (Shreyashi Chakraborty) and an intense, philosophical-looking crow (Noorain Akbar Shabbar). Likewise, the married couple (Shanno Begum and Prakash Jayaraman) in About Parul played off each other. The greenish-blue of Seema Bhasin Singhs costumes and Tom Lais lights gave In the Pond (picture) a magical, watery tint.        
	St James School laudably attempted Shakespeare, and that too the complex The Tempest, which must have given the pupils an educative experience of theatre art transcending textbook learning. But the label of musical did not quite stick, because most of the songs came from non-Shakespearean hands and served as decorative transitions among Shakespeares own scenes. The correct procedure, if one does not have a new libretto, is to set selected passages from the original to a score; then these musical sections do not sound linguistically alien. Progressing from St James last production, the singing here occurred live; yet the challenge is to have the musicians perform live as well. Indrashis Laharry, teacher and director, claimed that he interpreted the drama from Calibans perspective but, shorn of dignity, Calibans grovelling characterization remained inferior to Prosperos, whose voice and statuesque posture still dominated the dramatis personae. Ariel (why two of him, anyway?) was too obviously linked to evil by his red-devil costume. Of the non-school inputs, I liked Chandan Sens scenography, especially the tunnel under a natural bridge, reminiscent of Gordon Craigs designs for Macbeth, which gave the set height and depth, besides creating an intriguing exit route or hiding place, albeit under-utilized.

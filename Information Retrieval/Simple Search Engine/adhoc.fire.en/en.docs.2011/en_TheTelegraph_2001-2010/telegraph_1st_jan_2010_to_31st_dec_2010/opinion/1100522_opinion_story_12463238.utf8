                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Uphold the law                  
	Sir  The Allahabad High Court recently ruled that a Muslim man cannot marry a non-Muslim woman unless the bride converts to Islam (Muslim marriage, May 12). One could understand such an edict had it come from a religious leader. But arent courts supposed to uphold nothing but the law of the land? Now that Indian courts have started looking kindly towards live-in and pre-marital relationships, a judgment that robs a woman of her right to follow her own faith while being in wedlock with a man of another religion sounds archaic.

	Tough talk          
	Sir  The demand for autonomy put forward by the people of Darjeeling is perfectly legitimate. But the trouble starts with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha asking for more and more areas to be included in the proposed Gorkhaland. The party has now demanded that parts of the Dooars, where the Nepali community supposedly forms the majority, be included, alongside the Siliguri subdivision, which has only a small number of Nepalis, but a large Bengali population.          
	By making such illogical expansionist demands, the GJM has created unwarranted tension among the people that may even lead to ethnic unrest. In the interest of the people living harmoniously in Siliguri, the GJM should refrain from trying to push for such incompatible regions to be included in Gorkhaland.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.K. Sikdar, Siliguri

                
	Sir  The last tripartite meeting held in Delhi to resolve the Gorkhaland issue involved just the Centre, the state government and the GJM. But the West Bengal government has now asked for the other stakeholders  the Gorkha National Liberation Front, the Revolutionary Socialist Party, and so on  to be part of the next round of talks (Steep climb, May 18). However, the fact that the state Congress and the Trinamul Congress have not yet been invited is telling.          
	It must be borne in mind that these other stakeholders too, in their own right, have annihilated the aspirations of the people. Subash Ghisinghs GNLF has failed miserably in delivering the promises it had made to the people. Ghisingh has become a puppet in the hands of the state government. All political parties make a great blunder when they mistake the peace-loving nature of the people of the hills for simplicity. For how long will the hill people remain quiet? The incidents that took place in Nandigram and Singur showed the might of the stick and the sword. The TMC had then portrayed itself as a saviour of the oppressed. Why is it now silent on the Gorkhaland issue and not backing Bimal Gurung and his GJM?          
	Yours faithfully,      
C.K. Bhattacharjee, Mumbai

                          
	Way to go          
	Sir  Heartiest congratulations are due to Viswanathan Anand for successfully defending his crown as the world chess champion by defeating Veselin Topalov in one of the toughest matches of his career. Anand has now secured for himself a permanent place in the history of the game of chess. It is Anands flexible style of play that is most effective against opponents with all kinds of temperaments. In an international career spanning more than two decades, he has evolved from being a bright, talented boy to a battle-scarred veteran. Anand is a perfect role model as he is humble, and is not interested in self-promotion or self-aggrandizement. The country is proud of Anands outstanding feat.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

	Parliament is being misused and democracy is being abused and insulted. It is shameful to watch our elected representatives reduce every critical issue that the country faces into a tragic farce. One rues the gargantuan political immaturity involved in not being able to work out the mechanisms of protest  taking along the affected citizens and encouraging their participation to evolve a strategy to ensure dialogue and thereafter, a solution. For example  why dont our parliamentarians address and complete pending legislations in Parliament during working hours, and indulge in protests thereafter, in their leisure? Why are they so adamant about the unending screaming and yelling, forcing the constant adjournment of both Houses at huge cost to India?         
	The selfish, daily disruption of parliamentary proceedings by the Opposition has meant a gross misuse of privilege and public money. The values projected by our leaders that we are witnessing in the public domain, smack of selfishness and of a clumsy use of untenable tools of protest. The MPs and MLAs should march through the streets and mohallas, address meetings and do whatever else after office hours to win the support of their constituents. On price rise in particular, all parties could walk hand in hand and apologize for their collective failures, ensure safe and sane solutions, storage and distribution systems, and more. The lack of serious intent is evident in the hollow hysteria India is being subjected to every passing day.        
	In the midst of all these embarrassing activities in Parliament, we had the visit of the British prime minister, David Cameron  whose name was mispronounced as Cameroon  and his high level, impressive entourage. From culture to economics, he has envisaged a broad canvas for possible exchanges and partnerships. It was most refreshing to hear him speak with candour, honesty and intellectual integrity.                 
	Without prejudice        
	Quite different were the comments of expat journalists settled in this country, who felt that their prime minister should not have aired his real views on Pakistan. To many in India it was an absurd reaction of a retreating generation, one that is mired in policies that have divided the peoples of this subcontinent. Hopefully now these stances  which had added fuel ever so often to the fire that had kept the pot of the subcontinent simmering  may change. Past policies were fashioned to keep the largest marketplace, housing one quarter of our planets population, backward, insecure, disturbed and ridden with socio-economic and political problems. This constant enactment of divisive tactics laced with a profound sense of condescension kept the club of Western powers closed to diversity and pluralism.         
	Sadly, this kind of diplomacy has aggravated and destroyed relations between India and Pakistan over the decades. Half-truths planned and fine-tuned by officials in favour of the status quo, and then put in the mouths of visiting heads of State during official trips, created much suspicion and alienation. Now, the same lot is criticizing Prime Minister Cameron for breaking away from the untenable foreign policies of the past because the fresh approach could intervene positively to support new processes for peace in the region. Today there is a leadership at the helm of the United Kingdom that does not carry the baggage of an imperial power.         
	After a long time, one got the feeling that there was genuine political will to build an inclusive, abiding partnership based on faith and commitment for a more purposeful future. In the next few years, we shall experience a generational shift that will bring with it new mechanisms of governance, an attitudinal transformation, and hopefully, a desire to reinvent India and Bharat without the prejudices of the past.

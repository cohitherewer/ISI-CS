	Wrong medium                  
	Sir  Shashi Tharoor using Twitter to comment on the visa policy of the ministry of external affairs is unacceptable (Boss fumes, Shashi cool, Dec 29). The issue is directly related to national security, and it should be debated behind the closed doors of the concerned ministry. Tharoors views certainly need to be taken into account, but the medium he has chosen to express his opinion is inappropriate. Networking sites can be useful when it comes to debating national issues, but it is dangerous to disclose key policy matters on such platforms.          
	Yours faithfully,         Siddhartha Ganguly, Calcutta 
        
	New vision          
	Sir  While releasing the Pratichi Education Report, Amartya Sen demanded the overhaul of the present curriculum to reduce the size of the syllabus. The report, Class-bunk probe after teacher quits (Dec 26), indicates why a huge syllabus is seldom completed in schools.          
	Sujoy Pal, a para teacher of Senpara Radharani School in Nadia reportedly signed the attendance register every morning and left without taking any classes. The teacher-in-charge, Banshiram Biswas, was party to Pals scheme and did not report him to the higher authorities. Perhaps Sen should have also offered a solution for teachers absenteeism that often takes place as a result of political patronage.          
	Teachers in state-run schools such as the one in Nadia are highly unionized. Biswas is reported to have stated that he took pride in advancing the career prospects of the truant teacher who was engaged to take four classes every week. Biswas has the liberty to pursue his philanthropic activities with his own money. But when it comes to public money, he needs to be reminded to stick to the basic rules.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is heartening to learn that Pratichi Trust (India) has taken up the task of identifying and addressing the problems that ail primary education in West Bengal. The report published in two parts as Primary schooling (Dec 19 and 20) instils hope that primary education will be taken in a positive direction in the near future. Among other things, the report stresses on a radical reform of the primary school curriculum, and on making home tasks redundant.          
	The present curriculum is geared towards providing students with livelihood skills. However, I feel that the syllabus must include some texts that would inspire children to become good human beings as well. We often complain about the unruly and inappropriate behaviour of certain members of our society, but we do not have a system in place to inculcate in youngsters values such as justice, prudence and sacrifice. These qualities must be cultivated in them from a young age. Only then will we be able to expect a society of more reasonable adults.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Amartya Sens reference to the school in Boston where his son, Kabir, teaches reminded me of something I observed here in Michigan. Sen mentioned that Kabirs school does not give any homework. But I remember being surprised at the sheer amount of homework assigned to my son at the school from which he graduated in 2004. My experience in the US tells me that homework is an integral part of a childs education. Several teachers I met believe that homework brings in a sense of responsibility and commitment which serves the children well in later life. However, I do agree with Sen that private tuition creates a two-tier system, and is therefore harmful. Tuitions should be banned, although homework may not be bad for learning.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Q: I purchased a flat on V.I.P. Road in Calcutta three years ago. What do I have to do to register the flat? How long does it take to get the original deed of registration from the registrars office?        
	Priya, via email        
	A: Until the flat is registered in your name, the purchase is legally incomplete. Do not waste time. Get in touch with the owners and developer, if any, of the flat and get them to be present on the date of registration to endorse their signature on the sale deed. Arrange for two witnesses and funds for stamp duty, registrars fees, and advocates fees. Once the registration is complete you will be able to collect the deed of conveyance on that day or a day later.        
	Q: One of my tenants had taken three godowns on rent 20 years ago. He hasnt paid the rent for the last six years. I had also sought an increase in the rent. Last year he approached me for a settlement. We could not come to an agreement as he was offering too little. Then he deposited three cheques in my account with the help of the manager of the concerned bank. I have not withdrawn that amount. I am thinking of filing a criminal case for fraud and another case for an increase in rent. Am I taking the right step?        
	Vinay, via email        
	A: For increase of rent, you have to file an application before the rent controller who shall fix the fair rent in accordance with the provisions of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997. Have you given a written notice to your tenant for increase of rent? If not, do so immediately. Regarding fraud, I do not find any merit in the case. You could, however, close your account or give standing instructions to the bank.         
	Q:I had been a member of a housing co-operative society in West Bengal. I resigned recently. Am I entitled to any interest on the contribution made by me when I was a member? What is the relevant rule or Act?        
	S. Banerjee, Tollygunge, Calcutta        
	A: Section 81 of The West Bengal Co-operative Societies Act, 1983, deals with disposal of share or interest of a member on resignation, expulsion or insanity. You are entitled, within two years from the date of your resignation, to the value of your share or interest in the capital of the co-operative society that is transferred to the next transferee. Rule 143 of the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Rules, 1987, also deals with refund of deposits made by a member towards the cost of the project.

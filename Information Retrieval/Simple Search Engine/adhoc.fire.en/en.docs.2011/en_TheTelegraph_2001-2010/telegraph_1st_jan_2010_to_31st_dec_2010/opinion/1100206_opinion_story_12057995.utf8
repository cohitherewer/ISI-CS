	Grand success                  
	Sir  Heartiest congratulations are due to Leander Paes for winning the Australian Opens mixed doubles title (Leander, Cara are the best, Feb 1). He has now equalled Mahesh Bhupathis record of 11 Grand Slams. At the age of 37, Paes has once again shown that grit and will power can remove all obstacles. His unforgettable performance in the Atlanta Olympics of 1996, at which he won the bronze, entered Indias name into the medal tally after a period of 16 years. This sportsperson from Calcutta also has a enviable track record in the Davis Cup.          
	Yours faithfully,        Indranil Sanyal, Calcutta
        
	Deadly scenes          
	Sir  In Grim and grubby (Jan 23), Sunanda K. Datta-Ray has drawn attention to the filth that exists in the cremation grounds of Calcutta. However, to talk only of cremation centres would mean overlooking some of the other parts of the city that are characteristically dirty  the streets, pavements, parks, ponds and ghats. Total nonchalance on the part of the municipality is just one of the problems that have led to this grimy affair.           
	The fact that the residents of Calcutta are not bothered, or have acclimatized themselves to this condition, seems to be the prime reason behind the lack of improvement in matters of hygiene. Merely installing dustbins in every corner of the city is unlikely to help unless the peoples mindset changes.          
	Plenty of campaigns have been launched to protect the Ganga, but the current state of the river is proof of the lack of implementation of these plans. The Maidan too presents a revolting scene. Measures such as landfilling, composting and incineration can ensure some improvement, but disregard for public health on the part of the authorities continues to haunt the people.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhirup Bhunia, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There cannot be an archetypal ethos since ethos is culture- and geography-specific. Sunanda K. Datta-Ray seems to have forgotten this fact. Maybe that is why he has tried to impose a Western, neo-Christian spirit on the ambience of Hindu crematoriums. If the presence of a mangy street dog at the Garia crematorium or the rusty iron doors at Keoratala makes Datta-Ray sick, he is at liberty not to visit these places. How can he say that a burning ghat [is] not a place for sightseeing? As long as the practice of visiting crematoriums does not harm people, there should not be any problem with it.          
	As members of a multicultural, multi-ethnic and pluralistic society, we must respect the sensibilities of others. Like many other Calcuttans, I like going to Keoratala. I visit it for its authentic snacks such as kachoris, langchas, roti-tadka, dim-toast and tea. I also enjoy sitting on the terrace, and do occasionally peer inside the doors of the oven if they are ajar, humming Agun amar bhai. It reminds me of the transience of life. Datta-Ray may find this an unseemly preoccupation with the cadaver, but any attempt to see death in a sanitized ambience is an exercise in self-deception.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

                          
	Wrong tune          
	Sir  The classic song of Indian national integration, Mile sur mera tumhara, has recently been recreated as Phir mile sur, featuring some of the popular Bollywood celebrities of our time. This latest version, which was aired on television, has come as a shock to me. It is depressing to note that India, which is a unique collage of ancient and diverse cultures, chooses to express its spirit of unity in the clichd form of a Bollywood musical.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Soumya Banerjee, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Move with Caution 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MOVE WITH CAUTION                                   Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	Today, on February 26, we will be watching the budget being read out from the treasury benches of the Lok Sabha, and there will be the usual, frivolous interruptions followed by endless pontificating about the rights and wrongs of the many announcements. The Opposition is in disarray, and seems to have had its wings clipped for various reasons. Voices from those benches, meant to argue with the ruling dispensation, are usually more disruptive than serious. Faith in the processes of governance and in the political checks and balances that make for a robust and healthy democracy is at an all-time low with the national leaders bickering in public. They are clearly being pulled in different directions by a myriad motivations that have little to do with good, inclusive governance. The unpleasant odour of the rot around us has begun to infuse the public domain with an intensity that is suffocating.        
	Speculation is rife about why the minister of agriculture has set his guns on the minister of state for environment and forests. For a whole decade and more, our laws have been circumvented, abused and misused by powerful lobbies and business interests in many areas like road- building, power plants, mining and more. Irregularities have been tolerated, often blatantly condoned, using development as an excuse. This is a reality that has successfully managed to corrode and corrupt civil society. Our administrators and political class have set the standards for corruption and breakdown of law and order. When I reprimanded a scooterwallah for over-charging me for a short ride from the railway station to my home, he shamed me by saying, why dont you start by telling them at the top to stop stealing and being dishonest, they need the extras less than me, and therefore, when they stop, so shall I. And, he is right. It is as simple as that. Lead from the front.                
	Rich legacy        
	Today, we have a minister who has begun to follow the law while clearing applications for projects that are detrimental to all civilized environmental norms. We need to salute him for taking on the weighty lobbies and multinationals that have walked roughshod over every norm by means that are not kosher. Faulty judgements, substandard short-term solutions to large and critical problems, superficial assessments have all come together and destroyed our natural resources. We have permitted ourselves to be used by powerful and wealthy nations as a market that could sustain and grow their multinationals at our cost. We have not learnt the lesson that we should have from the United States of America  that we shall do everything that is in the interest of our citizens. Here, what I mean by we is Indias ruling class, which looks after its personal gain only. This is the tragic story of modern India, a nation that is on a high-growth trajectory, led by an entrepreneurial people who are being consigned to a workspace that is anarchic and corrupt.        
	There is no problem with exercising caution while taking decisions and making policy that will affect millions of unsuspecting Indians. If stringent, independent tests are carried out before introducing pharmaceuticals into a market, why this desperate haste to fast track GM foods that will be consumed daily, unlike medicines that are taken occasionally? Sensible moratoriums are essential to think through issues before plunging into final decisions.         
	Jairam Ramesh needs the support of his party and his colleagues to enable him to cleanse a process that has been corroded over time. Surely we believe in restoring integrity in governance and in decision-making. Let us hand over a legacy that is on the path of renewal to the next generation of leaders.

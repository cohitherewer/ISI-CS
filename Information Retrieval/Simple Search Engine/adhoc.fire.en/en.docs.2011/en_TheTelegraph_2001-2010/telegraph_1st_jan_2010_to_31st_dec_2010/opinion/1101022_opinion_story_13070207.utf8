	An extraordinary man                  
	Sir  K.P. Nayars article, World in his pocket (Oct 13), throws light on the outstanding achievements of the Union finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee. He fully deserves the title, Finance Minister of the Year for Asia 2010, bestowed on him for the fiscal reforms he has brought about. But Mukherjee has excelled in managing whatever portfolio he had been given down the years. The recent recognition is, no doubt, another feather in his cap, but it is nothing new for a man of such extraordinary vision.           
	Mukherjee had been honoured in 1984 for his bold economic reforms, which lessened Indias dependence on the World Bank. His performance has been uniformly praiseworthy thereafter. However, it is an established fact that Mukherjee could be a success because of the kind of training he received from Indira Gandhi, who had been instrumental in translating the slogan, Garibi Hatao, into reality. At the same time, Mukherjees efficiency and skills helped him take the country to greater heights of economic development.          
	Notwithstanding the vibrant economy, the country is still plagued by poverty, unemployment and malnutrition. The corporate houses and affluent sections of society have benefited the most from the current economic growth while the hopes of the aam admi have been dashed. Common people continue to suffer the effects of double-digit inflation, and find it difficult to make both ends meet. It is sad that when India is on the verge of becoming an economic superpower, millions of people are on the brink of starvation.          
	Economic progress and the rise of a particular individual carry little meaning when the common man is in distress. One hopes that the finance minister will implement measures to bring down the prices of essential commodities. If Mukherjee succeeds in controlling inflation, his achievements will acquire real meaning. The hopes of the aam admi must not be frustrated.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayant Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  K.P. Nayar talks about the significance of Pranab Mukherjee being chosen as the Finance Minister of the Year for Asia 2010 by the London-based magazine, Emerging Markets. This is not the first time Mukherjee has been honoured in the international fora for his acumen  he had been rated the best finance minister by Euromoney Magazine in 1984. Mukherjee has performed really well as Indias finance minister, successfully battling the odds resulting from the global economic crisis following the recession.           
	In 1980-81, India took a loan under the Extended Fund Facility from the International Monetary Fund to tide over the economic crisis. Then the Left Front government of West Bengal published a white paper entitled IMF Loan: Facts and Issues after a conference attended by 23 left-wing economists. For the Left, the loan was inflationary. At this juncture in 1982, Mukherjee was given the charge of the finance ministry. He realized that India should reduce its dependence on international monetary assistance and increase its economic self-efficiency. India refused to take the final instalment of the loan. The country improved the performance of its public sector undertakings, reduced public expenditure and market-borrowings, and followed a policy of industrial deregulation. This marked the real beginning of economic reforms.           
	Mukherjees recent steps have helped India achieve a high growth rate. In the next couple of years, India may well emerge as the worlds fastest growing economy. During the recent inauguration ceremony of the financial hub at Rajarhat, Mukherjee said that growth must aim at creating jobs and income. Taking the cue from his comment, we can expect the Union finance ministry, under the able stewardship of Mukherjee, to frame policies that will generate more income and employment.           
	Mukherjee is an asset for India as well as for the Congress. We, the people of West Bengal, feel proud of this national leader from our state.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Pranab Mukherjee has been honoured as Asias best finance minister by the magazine, Emerging Markets, which is the daily newspaper of record for the World Bank-IMF meetings. Doesnt this show that rather than the world being in the pocket of Mukherjee, the finance minister is actually in Washingtons pocket?                     
	Yours faithfully,

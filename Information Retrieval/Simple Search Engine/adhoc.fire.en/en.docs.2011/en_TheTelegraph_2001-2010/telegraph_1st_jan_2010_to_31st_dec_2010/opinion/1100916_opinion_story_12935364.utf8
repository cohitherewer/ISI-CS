	Thirty-three years ago, Hong Kong expert Leung Chun-ying recalls lecturing to Chinese bureaucrats on transforming Shenzhen from a fishing village into an industrial centre. Chairman Mao was dead; Deng Xiaoping, desperate to link China to the Western economy, was in charge. Two fishing villages in South China  Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, and Zhuhai, bordering Macau  were chosen as Chinas first special economic zones, where foreign investors would enjoy concessions and avail of cheap Chinese labour.         
	Today, Shenzhen is mainland Chinas counterpart to Hong Kong, boasting of the highest annual economic growth rate on the mainland. A lot of people live here and work in Hong Kong and vice versa, crossing the six entry points between the two cities everyday. In 1980, there was just one such crossing. Leung recalls having to dispose of his Chinese currency before re-entering Hong Kong. He also had to go through a half-hour entry procedure and report to the police station in Shenzhen everyday, apart from coping with the villages rocky roads, hard bicycle seats and lack of public toilets.        
	For seven years  starting 1979  the 24-year-old, UK-returned Leung lectured Chinese bureaucrats older than him. Speaking Cantonese to a Mandarin-knowing audience, he needed an interpreter for the first three years. But that wasnt the only reason for the silence with which his lectures were received. It was his subject  land use systems and practices of land, property and planning in the West and in Hong Kong  that made his audience uneasy, said Leung in an interview to Beijing Review. Not many were comfortable with the proposed auctioning of land that was inevitable under Dengs decision to loosen a planned, agricultural communist economy. It was only in 1980, when it was decided to turn Shenzhen into a SEZ, that they accepted the idea. Leung, now a member of Chinas top advisory body, recalls planning for a targeted population of 300,000, a figure that seemed impossible to achieve. Today, Shenzhens population, comprising mainly of migrants, stands at 14 million. And cycles are hard to find in the sea of swanky cars on the citys streets.                
	Another time        
	In 1982, a giant poster bearing the words, Time is money, Efficiency is Life, was put up near Shekou Industrial Zone, Shenzhens first industrial centre. It soon replaced Maos Serve the people as the slogan of Dengs China.To mark 30 years of Shenzhen, China Daily has a photo feature tracing the transformation. The black-and-white pictures show a simpler era, the faces fresh and innocent. In one, a young girl in a frock seated on a chair in a street talks on one of the mainlands first oversized mobile phones, while a man kneeling before her polishes her shoes. Then there are migrant factory girls practising ballet dancing between bunk beds in an overcrowded dorm.        
	Many of Shenzhens migrant workers have ended up as millionaire entrepreneurs. Today, Shenzhen boasts of the highest minimum wage on the mainland: one of the factors that has made foreign companies move to the interior. But the real story of Shenzhen lies in the Shekou Incident of 1988. Communist League workers had just finished lecturing youth at the Shekou Industrial Zone on upholding the partys revolutionary ideals. One young man sprang up and retorted: We have come to Shenzhen to make money. Here, we find work on our own; if one factory fires us, another hires us the next day, even as the audience clapped. This retort spread across the country, carrying its exciting message: the State-run work unit that controlled a Chinese citizens life, was about to collapse. But along with it, went the lifelong security provided by the State.

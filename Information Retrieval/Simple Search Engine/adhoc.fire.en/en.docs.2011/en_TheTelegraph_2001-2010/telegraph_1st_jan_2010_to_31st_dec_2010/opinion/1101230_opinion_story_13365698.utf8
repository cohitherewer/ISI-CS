	Orissa is a state where the past is as glorious as the future full of possibility. This is why it is an exciting place, not only for those who live there but also for the rest of the civilized world. So, it is rather unfortunate when the world comes to Orissa, and then trips against a mindset that asserts itself, somewhat aggressively, as an irreversible tradition. It is unlikely that the American PhD student who got into disproportionately serious trouble for entering the Jagannath temple will go back to her studies with a favourable impression of either the state or its religious priorities. That this should happen in the middle of a beautiful temple in a fascinating city makes her experience all the more regrettable. To be taken to the police like a criminal offender for being genuinely interested in Indian temples, and then being made to sign a declaration to the temple authorities stating her ignorance of its rules, do not do justice to the inclusiveness and catholicity of the religion that Katie Leonard was curious to explore. In a secular democracy, a place of worship, particularly one that is of historical and aesthetic interest, should be open to all those who respect the living traditions it embodies. Besides, any form of discrimination founded on religion, race or sex should be as unacceptable in a modern democratic nation like India as anywhere else in the civilized world. In India, to bar non-Hindus from entering a temple site also ends up being a form of publicly practised racism. Inevitably  and the history of such incidents in the Jagannath temple bears this out  the rule of non-entry gets applied to visitors who stand out because of their skin colour.        
	Such traditions amount to a form of apartheid, rightly discarded by most nations today, that a state like Orissa, ruled by a famously literate and cosmopolitan chief minister, would hardly want to perpetuate, given the richness and beauty, much of which is rooted in religion, that the world expects to enjoy when it comes to visit the state. The several lakh crore of investments that Orissa has attracted in recent times has to do as much with the states cultural resources as with minerals and with new institutions of higher education. Religion, no less than commerce, science and technology, could be part of a changing modern world. Surely, Orissa would not wish to fall by the wayside of this modernity.

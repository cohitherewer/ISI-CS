The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | targeted move
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TARGETED MOVE                                                    
	The city police have presented Calcuttans with a unique puzzle. Should they be thrilled that they were granted one day of normal, civilized movement in the heart of the city or be furious that political processions, space-hogging hawkers and rule-breaking drivers are considered far more important than the ordinary office-goer or shopper every single other day? Should they be reassured that the police they are paying for actually know the laws and can even implement them, or should they despair that only the presidents visit can get them to move? It is difficult to calculate whether the peoples response to the police is likely to take on a more positive tinge after their show on the day of the presidents visit. The Durga Pujas, for example, have shown the police at their best so far, and people are aware that they know how to keep the peace and smooth the passage of masses of humanity. But that does not mean that the police are interested in doing their job every day. Anyone trying to go anywhere, even on a day without a rally, knows that the city is gradually becoming impossible to navigate. Endless road repairs, broken pavements spilling with hawkers and messy with overflowing waste seem to close in as signals and traffic police conduct mysterious rituals that can leave resigned cars, snorting buses, restless two-wheelers and panting rickshaw-pullers stalled not just at crossings but at any point in the road. Evidently as antidote, the police completely closed traffic in certain parts of the city on the day of the presidents visit. They decided that a VVIP was far more important than ordinary people trying to leave home for work.        
	Yet the police in Calcutta are going high-tech. Marvellous machinery to catch cyber criminals, to monitor traffic and seize offenders, to respond to distress calls has been set up. No lack there. But none of this has anything to do with, say, allowing political processions and rallies to always have right of way, or permitting patently lawless drivers of autos to get away with the most outrageous behaviour on the roads, endangering their own passengers and those of all other vehicles. It is a question of attitude. The police often say that they cannot perform uniformly because of a lack of manpower. It is not clear why recruitment should not be made a priority in this teeming city where jobs would be welcome. But would increased manpower also bring about a change of attitude?

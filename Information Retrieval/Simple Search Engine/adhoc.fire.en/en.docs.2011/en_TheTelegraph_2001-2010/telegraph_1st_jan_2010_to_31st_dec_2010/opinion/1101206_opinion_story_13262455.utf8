                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO CHANGE                                                    
	No amount of preparation seems to be good enough for climate talks. The acutely disappointing Copenhagen talks are casting long shadows on the 16th conference of parties currently being held in Cancun. Various parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met more than once during the past year  the latest meeting was held in early November  so that some progress could be made in Cancun. So far, these do not seem to have had any effect. The leaders of the two blocs, developing and developed countries, remain immovable, although the specific bone of contention now is a second period of commitment after 2012, the date originally determined in the Kyoto Protocol. Japan, which is set against extension of commitment, is insisting on a new agreement from 2012. Its ire is directed as much at China, and by implication, India, as at the United States of America, which had refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The protocol requires that 37 developed countries cut down their greenhouse gas emissions by about five per cent below 1990 emission levels between 2008 and 2012. But the US refused, while China and India, two major emitters among the developing countries, are being asked to show that they are taking their responsibilities seriously. That they are not doing so is Japans grouse.        
	While the countries bicker about who is to bell the cat first, it is pertinent to ask whether they are really serious about climate change. The US is frankly shameless. But it is pointless to pretend, for example, that India is not a major polluter, given its massive population and the enormous difference between its rich and poor, each of whom pollutes the atmosphere and destroys the environment in its own way. India may not be covered by the Kyoto Protocol, but what stops its governments from ensuring the protection of forests and rivers, the reduction of urban pollution, implementation of industrial norms and ecologically conscious quality control of manufactured items? The problem with global bickering is that even issues which could have been satisfactorily concluded, such as the transfer of technology for environment protection, are crowded out. To refuse to change because no one else will is hardly a point from which rational negotiations can be made.

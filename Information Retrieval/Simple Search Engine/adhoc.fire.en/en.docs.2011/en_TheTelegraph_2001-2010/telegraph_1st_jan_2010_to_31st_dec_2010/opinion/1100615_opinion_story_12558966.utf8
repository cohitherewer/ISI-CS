The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Too much money, too little comfort
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TOO MUCH MONEY, TOO LITTLE COMFORT                                  CAPITAL CONSUMPTION      The power of speculative capital is such that it can destroy even a healthy economy                                                   
	Too much money has been floating around in a world that is searching for quick profit since the beginning of globalization. This has proved to be the bane of the institution that is known as the market. It also caused the markets to crash in southeast Asia in 1997. Now it seems to be Europes turn.        
	Some major economic trends have emerged on a global scale over the last two decades. For instance, the opening up of trade in goods and services. This has been greatly facilitated by a sharp fall in transport and communications costs and by the reduction in the time taken to transfer goods and services. Another development has been the manner in which some countries in a region are forming trade blocs to reduce or remove trade barriers and to have a separate set of rules for trade with others. Finally, capital account opening, de-regulation of the financial market and privatization of public enterprises have emerged as concomitant features of globalization that have enhanced capital mobility.         
	The most important factor, internationally, has been capital account opening imposed by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for loans. This has enabled the colossal capital of financial institutions to move about freely in search of profit.         
	Sadly, it has mostly been used for currency speculation, which was estimated to be around $1.5 trillion per day in early1999. This, along with capital account opening, was the main factor that precipitated the financial crisis in Southeast Asia. In Europe, just three years back, nations like Spain, Portugal and Greece were not in crisis. Spain actually ran a budget surplus. Portugals budget deficit was less than three per cent in 2008. Till September 2008, foreign capital was flowing freely into these countries on the assumption that their euro membership ensured safety. After September 2008, the funds stopped flowing and the countries were left facing high costs.         
	Their bonds have been downgraded by the rating agencies because the market perceives these economies to be weak. It shows the irrationality inherent in the market, which is dominated by speculators. Since the latter only look for quick profit, their perception of a countrys economic health is essentially superficial. Unfortunately, financial liberalization has legitimized the worldwide free-flow of immense speculative funds.         
	Hedge funds speculating in various markets played a crucial role in the 1997 crisis. According to IMFs estimates, in1997, six major hedge funds could mobilize 900 billion dollars against any currency they perceived to be weak. At that time, the foreign exchange reserves of the stronger Asian economy, China, was 128 billion dollars. On February 20,1999, the then US treasury secretary stated that there is no practical way to achieve currency coordination in a world where $1.5 trillion is traded each day in currency markets. Speculative capital can destabilize even a strong economy.        
	Just how damaging such speculation can be is clear from Britains case. In September 1992, Bank of England fought to defend the pound  under attack from speculators  and failed, forcing Britain to exit the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Bank of England, reportedly, lost more than 7 billion sterling pounds.

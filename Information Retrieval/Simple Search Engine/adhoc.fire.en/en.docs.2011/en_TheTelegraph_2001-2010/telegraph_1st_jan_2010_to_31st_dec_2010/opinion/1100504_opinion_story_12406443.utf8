                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BACK TO BASICS                                                    
	The decision of Mahindra and Mahindra to disband its football team will dismay its supporters, and please competitors. The men who made the team will not fade away. They will find new teams, and have a chance to shine there. But this is the end of M amp;Ms ambitions in football, at least for now. Or perhaps it is their fulfilment: M amp;M decided perhaps that the team has done as well as it could  it has been champion 15 times since its creation in 1971  and cannot go any further. These are tough times for engineering firms. Sport is not a part of M amp;Ms business. It was somewhere between a promoters hobby and a socially responsible activity. Either way, it is bound to have low priority, and to be amongst the first activities to be pruned when the times require it. That is how many businesses must be thinking; if they are, the question arises whether business is the best sponsor for sport. Industries will have their ups and downs. Within industries, firms will do better or worse. Amongst their promoters, fathers will hand over to sons, and preferences will change. So business is a fair-weather friend for sports. Some will say that fair-weather friends are better than no friends. Certainly, football has gone further after companies began to sponsor it; sponsorship has not been bad for it.        
	But it has not been good enough. After 40 years of corporate interest, Indian football languishes at the global bottom. Indian teams cannot compare even to the middling teams of Europe. The question is, what is the best way of improving their game? M amp;M came up with the answer: by the time Indians turn to professional football, they are too old to improve. If they are to become world-class players, they must get into the game much earlier  in their teens. This is what M amp;M now aims to do. It will still face the problem of how to keep the best infant kickers interested in football when they grow up. For unless football offers them a good career, Indians will continue to prefer software and hospitality. The answer to this problem also lies with companies; traditionally, they have employed sportsmen for the sport. This has been more common with public enterprises; it is to be hoped that private companies like M amp;M will go more for sponsorship  not of teams, but of good sportsmen.

	Democracy signifies the right to debate and discuss. The right to protest, also a part of democracy, follows from a failure of discussion. In Indian democracy, unfortunately, the right to protest precedes the right to discuss and debate. Take the functioning of the Lok Sabha in its current session, known in parliamentary parlance as the budget session. In this session, the Union budget, which was presented to Parliament at the end of February, is supposed to be discussed threadbare, and then the finance bill is supposed to be passed. Thus the budget session enables the government of the day to proceed according to the budget that it has presented to the elected representatives of the people. But in this budget session, up to the time of writing, the budget has not been discussed by the members of the Lok Sabha. Issues of great pitch and moment like a junior ministers involvement with a cricket team, the allegations of corruption within the Indian Premier League, the phone-tapping of politicians and so on have occupied the attention of the members of parliament. Precious hours in Parliament have been spent in shouting and protesting against a variety of subjects, but the one theme that was missing was the one that ought to be the focus of debates in the budget session. This speaks volumes about the MPs sense of priorities.        
	It has often been said that the real strength of Indian democracy is its demographic depth: millions of people have the right to vote. As a result of this, people who previously had no access to State power and to governance are getting elected to the Lok Sabha and even becoming ministers. A deepening of the right to vote and a broadening of the gateway to political power does not necessarily signify the robustness of a democracy. The ability to discuss and debate, which is the essence of democratic governance, is disappearing from the Indian polity and its institutions. Parliament is the principal sufferer of this process. High decibel levels and disruption are more heard and seen on the floor of the house than reasoned discussion. Yet this is not the reason that people elect their representatives to the Lok Sabha. The aim is to give to the country the best available form of governance. But issues of governance have taken a back seat in the deliberations of Parliament. In fact, it will be no exaggeration to suggest that deliberation has yielded place to protest.

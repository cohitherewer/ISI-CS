	The chief minister of Karnataka, B.S. Yeddyurappa, is the new miracle man of Indian politics. In about 30 months, this is the third time he has bounced back from the face of what seemed like irreversible defeat. But that alone does not make Mr Yeddyurappa a phenomenon. In surviving his latest battle  an imminent exit from the Bharatiya Janata Party for corruption and nepotism  the chief minister of Karnataka has also subtly changed the way the game of politics is expected to be played out in this country. At a crucial juncture in the moral duel with its main political opponent, the Congress, the BJP has ceded moral high ground and bowed to the wishes of its local leaders. This is an unprecedented development because, so far, the state units of all major national parties have been expected to abide by the diktats of the central command and, in most cases, that is what has been done. The centralized leadership had the unchallenged authority to decide how the states were going to be led and the timing and nature of any changes in the state leadership. The price for this has been borne by the state units, which have often been fractured or torn asunder by dissent. This problem lay at the heart of the repeated political crises in Karnataka, headed either by the Congress or the BJP. In a unique turnaround, the saffron party has decided to break with tradition, which it followed during the 2009 crisis, and listen to the legislature party of the state.         
	The gain from this pragmatic politics obviously accrues to Mr Yeddyurappa. Despite the irrevocable evidence of his nefarious dealings, the chief minister now has the mandate from the central leadership to uphold the only government the saffron party has been able to form in the South. Mr Yeddyurappa, of course, is crucial to this larger game plan. He commands the undiluted loyalty of the Lingayat community, which has given the BJP the opportunity to form its own government. He has also shown his political astuteness by surviving two successive confidence motions in the assembly. Mr Yeddyurappa has given the party major victories in every municipal and assembly by-election it has fought since 2008. When the state is looking forward to the zilla and panchayat polls that would strengthen the saffron partys hold, the BJP could have overlooked Mr Yeddyurappas claims to leadership only at its own peril.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Sounds from the Ground
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SOUNDS FROM THE GROUND                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The elections in Bihar have been one of the major celebratory happenings on the political scene in recent months. Nitish Kumar, the reigning chief minister, along with his close ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party, have swept the polls and decimated Lalu Prasad, Rabri Devi and their henchmen. The Congress had decided to go it alone in an attempt to discard the baggage of past coalitions and start anew, from scratch, with a fresh attitude and an eye to the ground reality. Hopefully, the Congress will put in place a mechanism that will help it revive and revitalize its rather sagging image. New beginnings are best made from the bottom, moving up on a clean slate, without having to compromise on issues or the candidates responsible for the complete degradation of the party over the decades. Will the Congress president introduce clean and unknown faces to build an energetic and vibrant Congress in Bihar? In the past few years, there has been no single Congress leader who could organize and galvanize his soldiers to win the war. This has been hugely detrimental to the fortunes of the party. General secretaries have operated out of Delhi, creating mayhem with ticket distribution and suchlike  something that has diminished the strength of the Congress in many states.         
	Change is in the air as winter sets in and leaders begin to introspect. If the Congress is to have a strong and dynamic future, it will have to let go of the old guard which has been petrified in processes that are no longer valid. Nitish Kumar has seen the writing on the wall and the BJP too is beginning to adjust to the palpable change beneath the fragile layer of top skin, which is fast fraying. Stuck in the arrogance of having been the largest political party in power for the longest time, the Congress has lost out on the headstart it had as recently as in 2009.                 
	New strategy        
	In government at the Centre, with a prime minister who is squeaky clean in every way, the party has managed to fritter away that strength by mishandling ticket distribution and political management in the states. Uttar Pradesh was a surprise the last time round, with 21 seats coming to the Congress. But thereafter, the by- elections and other state elections were consistently lost. This only proves how internal factionalism continues to plague, corrode and destroy party mechanisms. Here too, there is an urgent need to project a regional leader who can drive his team.        
	Andhra Pradesh brought in the votes to consolidate the Congress numbers at the Centre. That state has been a source of strength to the party on the national scene. Today, the Congress is in a shambles there. The demand for Telangana is real. The factions are pulling in different directions, allowing the opposition parties to step in and swing the votes in their favour. Here again, it is better to take a concerted, calibrated decision, stick to it and face the consequences at the hustings. There is honesty in this and the people can see it. A restructuring has to be done and all the attempts so far have only helped the bad overwhelm the good measures that some in the Congress had initiated. The general secretaries of the party, in their late fifties and above, have been stopping the processes of change. They have not comprehended the new strategy. They are ignoring the sounds from the ground. They either need to be prevented from injecting their negative vibes into an emerging and young Congress or be put to pasture. Without this, the National Democratic Alliance will take a lead the next time round as it has seen what is under the surface. Unfortunately, senior Congress leaders are stuck in a groove, unable to see beyond what they think they know.

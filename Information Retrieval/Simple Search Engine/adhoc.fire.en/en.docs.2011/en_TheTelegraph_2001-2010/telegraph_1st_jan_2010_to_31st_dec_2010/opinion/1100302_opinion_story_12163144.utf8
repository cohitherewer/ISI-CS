The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Another empty promise
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ANOTHER EMPTY PROMISE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Vedanta, the international mining giant, wrapped itself around the front page of a national newspaper, advertising how it was going to change the economic and social face of Kalahandi with the initiation of its multicrore projects in the region. The company also claimed that the projects will generate employment, dispense education and health, and give the people aluminium, which, according to some, is the great new green product. Maybe the time has come to do a substantive, investigative and truly in-depth story on this company and all its international deals and growth trajectory. I am always wary of elaborate and unnecessary claims made by corporates about the work they are doing for social good: such projects are always announced wherever they have business interests. Of course, they will offer employment, or else how can they build their plants? They also promise to set up crches and primary play schools, medical dispensaries, as well as to provide sporadic electricity supply and mid-day meals. But thereafter what? Will environmental norms and rules be violated? Will social- sector commitments get diluted as the projects near completion?        
	The budget was a solid, matter-of-fact document without the usual frills. It was approved across the board, except by a sulking Opposition in disarray that needed to be seen to be united for a short while for public consumption. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance has scored good points with this budget. The unprecedented walk-out by the Opposition during the finance ministers statutory budget speech was unwarranted. The Opposition could have used the budget session to argue and present whatever it believed was wrong instead of indulging in this kind of unacceptable behaviour. Parliament is not to be abused in this manner. Citizens find walk-outs and adjournments shameful and embarrassing. It makes a young, robust, energetic India look like a pathetic banana republic that this nation certainly is not.                
	Down, but not out        
	Squabbles in the Bharatiya Janata Party are far worse today. The most vivid example that comes to mind is the reckless manner in which the party handled the Vasundhara Raje episode. Raje made it her business to devote all her energy to build her base in Rajasthan. She showed complete commitment, and her future seemed more secure than that of her colleagues. Raje, after she lost by a whisker, continued to live in Jaipur and did not abandon her gadh because she had lost the election. She has hung in there, and she remains a power to be reckoned with. She did not opt to kow-tow to the top brass in Delhi. She understands her strengths, and is working hard to develop her base. Perhaps for this reason  and because she is a strong and wilful woman  her party bosses have tried to undermine her. They have succeeded in humiliating her for a short while with their attempts to remove her from the post of the leader of Opposition in the state assembly. But the question is whether they will be able to suppress her political ascendancy in the future.        
	Chances are that they will fail to hold back the political acumen and energy of Raje. Chances are she will remain committed to her party; she will be able to set a fresh agenda in the state if she is allowed to remain and operate from there, win internal support slowly and steadily, extend it beyond the state and lead the party into becoming a modern, thinking, inclusive, non-strident Opposition to the Congress. It is imperative for a vibrant democracy to have a responsible and intelligent Opposition that believes in debate and consensus for the growth of the nation. Will the coming of spring herald the change?

	Wen Jiabao was the first Chinese premier after Zhou Enlai to visit India twice. But his just-concluded visit would perhaps be counted as eminently forgettable from Indias point of view. There were the usual platitudes about the world being big enough for the rise of both India and China and about the need to build a new strategic consensus. It is impossible to miss the irony in the joint statement, which talks of the two countries promising to treat bilateral issues with mutual respect and sensitivity for each others concerns. The real message was not in such empty words, but in Mr Wens complete silence on issues that are hugely sensitive to Indias concerns and aspirations. The Chinese premier had practically nothing to offer on Indias concerns about Pakistan-based terrorism, Chinas support to Pakistans nuclear programme, Beijings recent move to issue stapled visas to residents of Jammu and Kashmir or on a possible time frame for the resolution of the border dispute between the two countries. Predictably, he remained utterly non-committal on Indias aspiration for a permanent seat in the United Nations security council. On all these issues, the silence on Mr Wens part was in sharp contrast with the clear and uncomplicated responses by Barack Obama and Nicolas Sarkozy during their visits to New Delhi only weeks ago. Mr Wens silence on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism must have been particularly galling for India as he was the first major Chinese leader to visit India since the terror strike in Mumbai in 2008.         
	True, there was better news on the economic front. Mr Wen and Manmohan Singh, Indias prime minister, have now set a target for bilateral trade between India and China reaching $100 billion by 2015. Beijing has also offered to give Indian goods and services greater access to the Chinese market. But, given the trend in the growth of bilateral trade, these are modest targets and promises and can hardly be counted as high points of the first visit to India by a Chinese premier in four years. For New Delhi, the only reasonable response to Mr Wens visit should be to see it as a major diplomatic disappointment. Only by seeing it as such can India hope to play the game on equal terms. Knowing the nature of China-Pakistan relations, it would be unrealistic of New Delhi to expect Mr Wen to openly link Pakistan to terrorism in India. But the manner in which he avoided this issue and that of the stapled visas for the residents of Jammu and Kashmir should actually be a warning to New Delhi to be more vigilant about Beijings moves and motives. India and China need to engage more and on a wider range of issues, both bilateral and global. But, no strategic consensus will light up the horizon unless Beijing does more in order to clear the mist of suspicion and mistrust.

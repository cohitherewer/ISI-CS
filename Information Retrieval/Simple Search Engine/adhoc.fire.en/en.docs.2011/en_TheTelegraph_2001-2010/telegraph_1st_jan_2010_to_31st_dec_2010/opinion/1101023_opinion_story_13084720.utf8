The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Extra bit of exploration
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        EXTRA BIT OF EXPLORATION                                  VISUAL ARTS: Soumitra Das                                                  
	Raghu Rai stretches things too far. Occasionally. Some of his panoramic views of the city being displayed in an exhibition titled Calcutta, Kolkata, It never beginsIt never ends, at the Harrington Street Arts Centre till November 13, are quite breathtaking. A wide swathe of the city is captured in these images that project quintessential Calcutta in popular imagination. The masts of several ships docked in Khidderpore hold aloft the dark canopy of lowering clouds. The same clouds hover dramatically over the image of Durga as she is being immersed in the Hooghly. A marionette-like policeman tries to direct the chaotic flow of traffic on Chittaranjan Avenue. The famous flower market at the Calcutta end of Howrah bridge buzzes with activity as two men calmly smoke bidi. Images of deities fished out of the Hooghly line the strand, as a woman in a white sari stands stock-still with her back to the camera  a human being turned into an idol.        
	These are vibrant examples of photojournalism at its best, and Rai puts in what he calls that extra bit of exploration that sets his frames apart from the thousands of similar shots that are clicked every day by droves of aspiring photographers. Rai waits for the right moment  it would not be wrong to call it the decisive moment  when the moustachioed man, out for his constitutional, fixes the lens with his eye at the precise instant when he happens to pass by the head of the bronze cherub in the foreground. In a vertical shot, Rai freezes the man the moment the top half of his body has moved out of the frame and the focus shifts to the dog he had been feeding on the ghat.        
	The moment to release the shutter may have been determined with exactitude, but photography is the art of light, and in these giant blow-ups it is light that suffers most, pitted as these prints are with millions of micro dots that go against the grain of the available light at that time of the day. Rai had blown them up for maximum impact but the dots come in the way. Many of these photographs date back to the 1980s, and are quite familiar. Dots do not exist in the earlier silver gelatin prints in which the light is soft and limpid, and that greatly enhances the quality of the images.        
	The dots are particularly intrusive when the photographs depict beautiful women. While his shot of a modest size of Satyajit Ray staring wide-eyed into the lens, as if caught by surprise, is startling, the glamorous picture of Moon Moon Sen in her youth at her toilette is marred by a million marks. Rai is not Roy Lichtenstein. The then young actress is surrounded by images of the beauties in her family. The photograph should have been smooth as satin. It ends up looking pockmarked. Stardust does not blend with specks of soot. Rai had used film for these panoramic shots and the prints are digital, but however enthusiastic he may be about new technology, it does not work all the time. Out damned spots.        
	At one time, postcards used to be manufactured in Great Britain that carried the label This is a real photograph. Actually, these were hand-tinted photographs and the colours were often once removed from reality. Raghu Rais colour prints may remind one of such hand-tinted photographs. The tints are digitally exaggerated to such a degree that they look anything but real.        
	In the photograph of the cupboard on the bank of the Hooghly with a man lying on it, the sky is almost the same shade of electric blue as the piece of floating furniture. The gleaming white clouds are scattered across the floor of the sky like fleece. Rai obviously has painted these shots by using digital technology and by giving full rein to his imagination. In a typical shot of Kumartuli, the lemon yellow used in the garland of severed heads leaps out of the print  it is so hot.        
	In one print of labourers at their morning ablutions on the ghat, however, the wide expanse of the red wall exudes a warmth that is missing from his other coloured shots that look so synthetic. It is an earthy red, the colour of a heap of bricks (picture).        
	Except for a few, most of Raghu Rais colour photographs are, to lift a phrase from the Shakespearean critic, A.C. Bradley, the exaggeration of a vital truth.

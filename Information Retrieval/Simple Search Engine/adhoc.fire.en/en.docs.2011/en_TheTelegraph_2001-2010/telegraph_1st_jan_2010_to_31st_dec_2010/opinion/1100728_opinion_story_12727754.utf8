                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ROUGH AND TUMBLE                          - Three questions about the talks between India and Pakistan        Krishnan Srinivasan                                                          
	The latest round of high-level talks between India and Pakistan ended in a fiasco. Even at the worst period of relations between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, there was never a round of talks at foreign-minister level that ended in such acrimony and mutual media hostility. Neither side has emerged from this event with credit. Now that the theatricals have died down somewhat, three basic questions remain to be asked and answered.        
	The first is why the talks between S.M. Krishna and S.M. Qureshi took place and ended so badly. There were preparatory talks between the foreign secretaries and the home ministers that should have paved the way but, in reality, the ground had not at all been properly prepared. The top leadership in India was apparently divided on the merit of holding the talks, and this view was shared by the real authority in Pakistan, namely the army. Thus, there were more infiltration attempts from Pakistan in Kashmir and instigation and financing of stone-throwing mobs, with the predictable lethal reaction from the security forces. This set the stage for Pakistan to bring up the issue of human rights and the future status of Kashmir.         
	In New Delhi, a few days before the talks, details of the David Headley interrogation were leaked to the media that explicitly implicated the Pakistan military and ISI in planning and executing the terrorist attacks of 2008 in Mumbai. These revelations were extraordinary and not in keeping with the understanding with the US, where Headleys plea bargain is still sub judice. It would have been possible to make far better use of this information had it been kept confidential and used selectively, for example, shared with influential countries and the 13 other governments that had lost their citizens owing to the terrorist attack, and used as a pressure point on the establishment in Islamabad.         
	To make matters worse, the home secretary, G.K. Pillai, then took it on himself, or was instructed, to visit a newspaper office and underscore the point that the ISI was instrumental in the terrorist attack on Mumbai. Irrespective of the truth of the leaks, both sets of actions sabotaged Krishnas position and played into the hands of Pakistan. Pakistan is a sovereign state, whatever its failings may be. To have one of the institutions of state assailed by a bureaucrat from another country is to invite a tit-for-tat reaction. India would have done exactly the same thing if one of our major institutions had been similarly indicted, and Pakistans position is worse than ours because the civilians, even the foreign minister, have to kowtow to the army and appear holier than the pope. Governments are not known for their propensity to apologize or eat humble pie. Did our home ministry think it would achieve results with Islamabad by issuing a public charge-sheet?         
	Krishna has every reason to feel aggrieved by Pillais comments and their timing. How is it that bureaucrats in India are given the liberty or authority to make statements that have a bearing on policy and international relations? This is a trend that needs to be reversed urgently if more fiascos, both at home and abroad, are to be avoided. In the United Kingdom, whose practices in this regard we would do well to follow, civil servants are totally anonymous and unknown to the general public. If Pillai had been instructed to make such views public, it needs to be known who authorized this action. The sad truth is that before and after the Islamabad talks, New Delhi looked strangely dysfunctional.         
	The Krishna-Qureshi meeting was badly timed. Given the official sentiments on both sides of the border, it would probably have failed in any case, but prudence demanded a reasonable time to elapse for both capitals to digest the impact of the visit of the home minister to Pakistan and the action, if any, taken in consequence of that. It appears that the foreign ministers were locked into a pre-arranged time-frame that was badly misjudged. The basic necessity for such high-level talks is that they should be meticulously prepared, and all possibilities of unpredictability eliminated. In this case, it seems that even the agenda was not known to both parties  Pakistan wanted to resurrect the composite dialogue under a new nomenclature and India had a mandate to discuss only the terrorism issue. What was the purpose in Krishna covering nothing but the same ground that the home minister had dealt with three weeks earlier? The dismal outcome of the press conference only revealed the total lack of choreography: even the most dim-witted politician knows that you lose control of a press conference if you fail to bring it to a conclusion at a time of your choosing.        
	The second question is whether India should be talking to Pakistan at all. The Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition party, does not think India should. Certainly, as Richard Nixon said, talking is not better than not talking, if you do not know what you are going to talk about. But India is the only country in history that has two nuclear-armed, potentially-hostile neighbours sharing its land borders, and it is inconceivable that it should not be talking to both, not least to give itself more options in dealing with either. Also important, though not crucial, is the fact that all the influential power centres in the world would like to see India and Pakistan in a dialogue. And there is plenty to talk to Pakistan about  trade, re-opening of consulates, visa regime, sporting links, transit to Afghanistan, prisoners on both sides, fishermen who mistakenly sail into the others waters, communications, rivers, and so on. Talking to Pakistan also resolves one dilemma; we cannot insist on bilateralism on the one hand and refuse to talk to Pakistan on the other.        
	The third question is about how we can expect any positive results from talking to Pakistan. India always said it would only engage in bilateralism with Pakistan, which is why it does not take the evidence on Mumbai to the United Nations counter-terrorism committee or the Security Council. For years, New Delhi said it would not discuss Kashmir, then it said that Kashmir could be discussed, and now, it is saying that we have to have a priori satisfaction on terrorism. Each of these positions can be justified in its context, but collectively they have not helped in moving the dialogue forward. Pakistan, for its part, has purveyed its share of deceit and double-dealing with the likes of Kargil and Hafiz Saeed.         
	Presupposing that both countries sincerely wish to make progress in addressing bilateral problems, the answer will lie in a structure of discussions that are more or less continuous and as far removed from the public gaze as possible. The temptation to rush to the summit with the lure of photo-opportunities must be firmly resisted. The public on both sides must deliberately be sensitized over a long period to the prospect of concessions; there can be no solutions without give and take. Expectations of quick results and media circuses should be discouraged; the public should get accustomed to the banality of Indo-Pakistan meetings. The format should include discussions between the police, customs, border guards, immigration, home, defence and external affairs officials of both countries at the working level, and later extended to the army and intelligence contacts.         
	The endeavour must be to achieve a broad-based framework for building confidence. This will not be easy, for so far we have been talking to the wrong people in Pakistan  it is necessary for us somehow to involve the Pakistan army. A window of opportunity opened during General Musharrafs presidency, but was lost through India waiting for a legitimate government. All impediments to trade should be removed. This will lead to building trust and have its effect, in time, on Pakistans military thinking since they will be direct beneficiaries.               
	This scenario is difficult and long drawn out, but it is time it was seriously contemplated. There are no shortcuts, and we cannot have a cherry-picking approach to bilateralism. After 63 years of the Kashmir dispute, one would have expected the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, to be better briefed. She is wrong in assuming that any solution of the Kashmir question would be a magic formula transforming the relationship between the two neighbours. Such a view ignores the whole ethos of Pakistans existential hostility to India as a means of asserting its fragile nationhood.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A shift in basics 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A SHIFT IN BASICS                           - The world economic order is changing inexorably        Ashok Ganguly                                                  
	Since the financial mega-crisis of 2007-2009 (is it over yet?) there have been frequent articles about the impact of the advanced (developing) economies on the economies of developed nations.        
	Initially, groupings such as BRIC and BASIC were seen as catchy acronyms emerging from the flights of imagination of some economists at Goldman Sachs; however, these same castles in the air are increasingly being viewed with a mixture of apprehension and scepticism.        
	Global growth and prosperity is not a zero sum game, but the fact remains that developing economies are laying claim to a growing proportion of global natural resources and commodities. While this is generating its own price spiral and mismatch between supply and demand, the consequences are a source of deepening concern.        
	Climate change is a critical instrument to raise the ante with the objective of eventually questioning the robust growth of developing economies. The popular argument is that, although the bulk of the carbon emission emanates from the developed world, those countries cannot be held entirely responsible for climate change, as global warming was an unknown phenomenon until recently. It further argues that since global warming has now become well established as a surrogate of economic activity, developing economies cannot repeat the mistakes of the past and exacerbate the problem by driving high economic growth in countries such as Brazil and India and double digit growth in China.        
	Whereas the need to face the challenge of climate change is now acknowledged as a global responsibility, slowing down growth will not win the argument with the BRICs.              
	Instead of considering the growth of developing economies a threat, one would have expected a huge amount of investment in the industrialized nations to develop new green/clean technologies to replace heavy traditional industrial processes as one of the biggest commercial opportunities of the 21st century. The scale and scope of clean technology potential is similar to, if not even greater than, the information technology revolution in the second half of the 20th century. The development of this emerging sector may have been disrupted by the global banking and financial crisis, the after-effects of which continue to unfold. But the fact remains that slowing down economic development in the BRICs is not the magic bullet to tackle climate change.        
	As the banking crisis erupted in the United States of America and Europe in 2008, its seriousness suddenly became palpable with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. It had already become apparent that, unless governments intervened and rescued banks by massive injections of funds and other measures, the crisis would plunge the world into depression. By then, the housing sector had well and truly collapsed in the US and unemployment was rapidly rising in the US and Eurozone. There was, naturally, growing anger amongst dispossessed home-owners and tax-payers at the governments rescue of fat cats who had enjoyed years of humongous annual bonuses without, as it transpired, really understanding how their institutions were making huge profits while heading towards a perfect crisis.        
	During this period, guided by a history and practice of prudent monetary policy, India remained reasonably insulated from the crisis, while the financial crisis in the West made it turn to China, which held the largest amounts of American debt alongside a grossly undervalued currency. Both the American Republicans and the Democrats unsuccessfully tried various means to persuade China to revalue the yuan. China was already facing its own challenge. Since its economy was significantly export driven, China had to undertake urgent course correction as its exports started to fall and growth had to be sustained by seeking to enhance alternative employment generation while boosting domestic consumption.        
	Although it did not appear so in the public domain, the creation of the G-20 was a reluctant acknowledgment that in order to enlist the growing importance of countries such as Russia, India, China, Brazil, South Africa and others, the G-8, which had presided over global economic policy since World War II, had outlived its utility. One must, however, be aware of the fact that the G-8 is not quite dead. Canada and Japan are said to be insisting that the G-8 still has a serious role for the superior economies, one which is needed to distinguish it from the gaggle of the G-20.        
	Even though the economic crisis is far from over, the issue regarding the excesses of the banking sector in the US has come into sharper focus. This was most prominently displayed during the hearings of US House committees on banking. It is interesting how these hearings have gradually undergone change during the past three years. When the hearings first started, there was a sense of contrition and mea culpa on the part of the bankers but, as soon as there were early signs of mild recovery, the same bankers started expressing a sense of being unfairly treated when questioned about their fragile business practices and unconscionable bonuses. The discomfort of financial leaders must also be seen in the context of the strong global view that banks and financial institutions need to be regulated and controlled more closely, if the world has to avoid another mega-crisis and another government bail-out. In response, the banks and financial institutions are now raising a chorus of alarm that any unusually tighter control will curb economic growth and put the developed economies at greater disadvantage vis--vis the BRICs.        
	While the developed countries were preoccupied with their economic and banking crisis, the developing economies continued to grow in spite of some unavoidable contagion from the West. One of the reasons cited by commentators for the lower impact on the BRICs is that the financial sectors of the developed countries had been unfairly excluded from establishing their presence in countries like India, where banks were over-regulated and protected from international competition. Instead of praising the BRICs for their prudent regulatory regime, their policies were criticized as anti-competitive.        
	Finally, there is the long and troublesome history of the World Trade Organisation Doha round. The WTO, alongside climate change and global banking, is seen as an instrument to contain the developing economies by trying to impose unequal global trade terms. The Doha round has remained inconclusive because of issues such as unequal and unacceptable terms of trade. In the Doha round, the US and the Eurozone are united in their challenge to the unified forces of BRICs and other developing economies, and a resolution in the foreseeable future is unlikely under the circumstances.              
	There is a realization, if not an acceptance, in the rich countries that, unlike in the last 200 years, growth and prosperity will have to be more equitably shared with the rest of the world. Europe and Japan face the additional problem of a rapidly ageing population, growing shortage of the workforce and fear of immigrants. It is a challenge they will have to face sooner or later.        
	The changes in the world economic order are inexorable; the changes that we are witnessing are not new. After all, India and China were major economies in the 17th and 18th centuries. In a sense, what we are witnessing is a very slow move towards the restoration of a more equitable global equilibrium. But the developments are not welcome news to Western analysts and political leaders who keep hoping that the BRIC may yet unravel and not disrupt la dolce vita.        
	While I was writing this article the Eurozone had, once again, been plunged into another deep crisis by the stark financial calamity in Greece, and which, some fear, may spread to Spain, Portugal and even beyond. The Greeks have led a charmed life for many years, living well beyond their means, and are not ready to face the austerity measures now needed for their survival. The euro and sterling have hit a historic low vis--vis the dollar. If the relief measures taken by the European Union and International Monetary Fund fail, the future of the EU itself may be in jeopardy.        
	So the BRICs must now guard against the spread of the Eurozone contagion, since any prolonged crisis in Europe will eventually and adversely affect the rest of the world.

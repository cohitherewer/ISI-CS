	Grim faith                  
	Sir  Gross negligence by district authorities is to be blamed for the stampede at the ashram of Kripalu Maharaj in Kunda, located in the Pratapgarh district of Uttar Pradesh (Poverty stampede crushes 63, Feb 5). According to reports, about 10,000 devotees flocked to the ill-fated bhandara, which claimed the lives of 63 and left more than 200 injured.           
	The authorities allowed this mammoth gathering to take place without conducting a survey of the grounds, putting up barriers to control the movement of the crowd or having the local police follow the necessary procedure in such events. It appears that the ashram could only be accessed through a narrow lane. In a short span of time, thousands of devotees flocked into the alley. With no one to monitor the crowd, chaos ensued and one of the gates collapsed, trapping people beneath it. As the devotees rushed to leave the ashram in a panic, a stampede began.           
	Another vital gap in the arrangements was the absence of ambulances or medical assistance in case of an emergency. Whenever there is a mass religious gathering which might result in law and order problems, the organizers are expected to inform the authorities prior to the event and obtain permission to carry on. If the organizers at the ashram did indeed have permission to hold the bhandara on such a scale, the authorities did nothing to ensure the safety of the people.          
	Negligence on the part of authorities has led to many such tragedies. Most of the time, the people responsible go unpunished. One prays that justice is done to the victims in this case.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is unfortunate that small shrines, with their lure of free food and gifts, draw innocent people to their deaths. A number of incidents similar to the one in Kunda have ended in tragedy. The incident underscores the penury of the villagers. Politicians, instead of addressing this problem, fritter away vital funds on trivial issues. One hopes that this tragedy will make Mayavati more responsible and put a check on her tendency to waste crores on installing memorial statues all over UP. The government must also closely monitor self-appointed babas who take advantage of superstitious devotees and mislead them.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

              
	Sir  The death of 63 people, mostly women and children, at the stampede in Kunda is a grim reminder of poverty in India. Crowds thronged the venue for largesse worth only Rs 20 per person and for free food. The management of the ashram is to be held responsible for the incident. It invited massive numbers to the event without making proper arrangements to supervise the crowd.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Delhi

                
	Sir I was pained to hear of the stampede at the ashram in Kunda. It is a matter of shame for all Indians that in an emerging superpower people should clamber for pitiful offerings and be trampled to death as a result. To make matters worse, the district authorities have attempted to deflect responsibility for the incident, saying that they had not been adequately informed.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Mitendra M. Das, Auckland, New Zealand               
	Friends in need          
	Sir K.P. Nayar, in his article, rightly commends Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs sagacity in making overtures to Saudi Arabia (Old idea, new initiative, March 3). Nayar says that Singhs visit to Saudi Arabia is the first made by an Indian prime minister since Indira Gandhis visit in 1982. Saudi Arabia accounts for a large chunk of Indias energy imports. It should also be kept in mind that, as Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, the king of Saudi Arabia holds a pivotal position in the Islamic world.          
	Nayar dwells on Singhs efforts to realign Indias relations with other countries. While the prime minister remained adamant on the nuclear deal with the United States of America, he also chose to rekindle relations with Saudi Arabia in keeping with the compulsions of the global scenario. Singhs determination to chalk out paths he believes are right shows him to be a politician with a difference.When he visited Saudi Arabia as finance minister in 1994, Singh had read and was struck by the joint communiqu issued at the end of Indira Gandhis visit in 1982 which urged the unconventional view that the security of Saudi Arabia was linked to that of West Asia, the Gulf region in particular.          
	In recent years, there has been a significant exchange of warmth between the two countries. King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz was chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in January 2006. As a gesture of solidarity, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, visited India in December 2008 to express his condemnation of the terror attack on Mumbai.           
	Crude oil imports may be a priority in Singhs agenda but India has also kept its sights on a more diverse partnership. The government is keen on tracking the Saudi response to Pakistans moves to take advantage of growing American weariness in Afghanistan. Nayar is correct in observing that the implications of 26/11 apply to Saudi Arabia, as well as to other States in the region with vulnerable coastlines and domestic jihadis waiting to overthrow the existing government. Saudi involvement in the subcontinent must also take into account the situation in Kashmir.           
	If India strengthens its ties with Iran, currently one of its largest sources of oil imports, it risks upsetting Washington and being marginalized in the international arena. A failure to be attuned to changing global equations would only hinder Indias emergence as a powerful nation.          
	 Yours faithfully,            P.B. Saha, Calcutta

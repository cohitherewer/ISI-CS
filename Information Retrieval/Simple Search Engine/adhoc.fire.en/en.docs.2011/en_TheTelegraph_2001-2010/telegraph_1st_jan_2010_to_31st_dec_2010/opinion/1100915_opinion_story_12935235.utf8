	If the situation in Kashmir seems to have taken a turn for the worse, it is not merely because a day of street-fighting has claimed a greater number of casualties than before. It is also because the political momentum that seemed to have gathered after the prime ministers address to the people of the valley last month now appears to be coming to a grinding halt  but to look at it this way may not be entirely right. The failure of the cabinet committee on security to evolve a consensus on Kashmir would not have been perceived as the dead end it is being made out to be now, had the Omar Abdullah administration not carefully built up a campaign for an Id bonanza from the Centre. The disenchantment, particularly in National Conference circles, stems not only from the the Centre not fulfilling what was expected of it, but also from the cabinet committee reminding the state government that it had to take responsibility for the lack of trust and inadequate governance. However, even if one were to disregard the National Conferences sense of betrayal, the truth now staring the Indian government in the face is not a particularly happy one. In spite of the failings of the state government, the Centre has no option now but to support it, with the chief minister remaining unchanged. A change of leadership in the state is not feasible, and the imposition of governors rule is the least healthy option.         
	Since it is going to be a virtual status quo in Kashmir until the crisis is resolved through a necessarily long and arduous process of dialogue, it is important to remember that a bumbling state government is just one of the realities which the participants in the dialogue will have to contend with. There are other factors, which they will not be able to ignore. That creating new jobs and economic regeneration will foster the right atmosphere for talks is as true as the fact that a decision on draconian laws like the Public Safety Act and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act may also help restore a semblance of normalcy. Unfortunately, the latter is not being considered worth talking about. The cabinet committee on security did not even touch upon the issue, and the strong objections of the Opposition and the army may keep the matter out of the agenda of the all parties meet. It may be unwise to bend under pressure, but is it wise to appear inconsiderate?

	For no good reason                  
	Sir  The Bharat bandh called by all Opposition parties on July 5 to protest against the rise in fuel prices will not serve any purpose (Strike date the same but no unity, June 30). As usual, the common man will lose a days work and find it difficult to commute. Senior citizens and the unwell will face a lot of difficulties. The bandh being called on a Monday, banks will be closed for two days in a row. The political parties should realize that the hike in petrol prices is for a reason, and refrain from inconveniencing the public.          
	Yours faithfully,         R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam
        
	Fear reigns          
	Sir  It is shocking to learn that once again the Maoists have killed several Central Reserve Police Force jawans in an ambush in Bastar, Chhattisgarh (26 jawans killed in Maoist massacre belt, June 30). It is sad that the half-trained CRPF jawans were pushed into the Maoist-infested areas without a proper strategy or in-depth knowledge of the region. It is now amply clear that the CRPF is no match for the Maoists. One fails to understand why the Centre is not deploying the army and the air force to wipe out the rebels.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.N. Mahanty, Puri 

                
	Sir  It is appalling that Bapi Mahato and his aides celebrated the attack on Jnaneswari Express as their victory (Dance to celebrate deaths, June 29). The brutal murder of a 16-year-old boy by Maoists in Belpahari also proves how heartless these rebels are. Their acts are a travesty of humanity. The continuous atrocities perpetrated by them reveal their insensitivity, greed and bias.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Angana Adhikari, Kalna, Burdwan

                
	Sir  The massacre of 26 CRPF jawans in Bastar makes one wonder if our so-called protectors themselves need protection now. This is not the first time that CRPF personnel have been butchered by Maoists, and it is unlikely to be the last time. The Maoists are probably rejoicing over every death. The loss of the families of the jawans is irrevocable. It is true that the government has taken some measures to uproot the Maoists, but it has not done enough. The death of the jawans will be discussed in the media for some time, and then everything will be forgotten until another attack takes place. The government must ensure that the jawans feel safe, otherwise they will not be able to fight the Maoists with a brave heart.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
L.L. Bhutia, Pedong

                
	Sir  Once again the Maoists reminded the government that they would not give up their brutal attacks on the CRPF till their demands are considered  which seems impossible at the moment. Repeated Maoist assaults will lead to a gloomy future for the affected regions. Many ordinary people are now being forced to spend time in jail on suspicion of being involved in Maoist activities. Several others are being labelled as police informers and killed by Maoists.          
	This situation could improve only if the government adopts tough measures against the insurgents. But to do this, the tribals who allegedly shield the Maoists should be taken into confidence and persuaded to cooperate with the government and the joint forces.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Shafaque Alam, New Delhi

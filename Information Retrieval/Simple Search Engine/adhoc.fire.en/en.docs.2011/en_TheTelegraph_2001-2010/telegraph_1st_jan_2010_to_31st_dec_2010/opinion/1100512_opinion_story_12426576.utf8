	Mr Gladstone W.E. Gladstone, Queen Victorias least favourite and most famous prime minister  could hold a crowd for two hours and more with a speech. These days, were told, all that persuades in politics is sound bites, tweeting and opinion polls. I wonder. For all its tsunami of evasions, hypocrisies and plain lies, of tireless pontification by on-screen pundits, Britains election campaign showed that the seriously-spoken, thought-out word still has remarkable power, even when its claptrap.        
	Gladstones verbosity was nothing unusual among the politicians of his day. The 19th-century speech now most famous is Abraham Lincolns Gettysburg address. Yet the keynote speaker that day was not he but Edward Everett, a defeated runner for the vice-presidency at the election that brought Lincoln to power. Everett spoke, and spoke well, for two hours, using over 13,000 words. Lincoln used 271 in less than three minutes. No contest, by todays standards. But not everyone thought so then.        
	Lincolns address, said the Chicago Tribune, will live among the annals of man. The Chicago Times called it silly, flat, and dishwatery. That view was shaped by political animus, its true. But our forebears did indeed like weighty words and plenty of them. If Gladstone was as ponderous with his queen as with other audiences, little wonder Victoria was said to have complained once that he addressed her as if I was a public meeting.         
	Nor did this sort of oratory die fast, or everywhere. I once listened to a three-hour speech from a 1960s Italian politician  and filled barely one page of a small notebook with anything worth reporting. In 1961, I heard Nehru on Mumbais Chowpatty sands. His audience was not quite as huge as the press had it. In those days, convention held that at that venue he drew a million listeners. I paced out the crowd, and, even if all were skinny and narrow-shouldered, there werent above 250,000. Still, thats a lot  and not many had left by the late time I did.         
	Britains election brought nothing like this. But it produced a novelty that improbably recalled the past: three 90-minute televised debates among the three main parties leaders. True, the three were told to keep their remarks short and sharp. But I had never imagined that Britains televiewers would stand for 90 unbroken minutes of serious political argument. Yet so it was, and  for a couple of weeks  British politics was turned upside down: after 80 years of near-irrelevance, Gladstones Liberal Party, todays Liberal Democrats, was back in business.        
	Thanks to the command of language (and, I grant, the youthful good looks) of the Lib-Dems leader. One can overvalue persuasion, as against fact. There are indeed Britons  as in several countries, India not least  whod like electoral law to do so: one ninny wrote to a London paper urging a ban on the publication of opinion-poll results during the campaigns, so voters could hear more about party policies.        
	The politicians usual argument for this is so that we shant be influenced by dubious pollsters; as against, presumably, their ever-truthful selves. This is rubbish. Pollsters aim at fact, politicians seldom do so, and if either group is to be censored, it should be they. Happily, most of us think neither should be. Sure, free speech will include free lying. But so be it; and as an addict of language, I rejoice to see politicians, honest or less so, rediscover its use for solid argument in real debate.        
	Well, fairly solid, fairly real. The three men were held to their promises of brevity and, as the election results showed, the effects too were short-lived. Triviality will probably triumph in the end: the sound bite, the Twitterbug, the political bloggers semi-literate ranting and abuse, the 30-second YouTube clip. But maybe that dismal day can be postponed at least till Im no longer around to lament it.

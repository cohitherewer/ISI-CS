The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A vote for change
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A VOTE FOR CHANGE                          - No one can tell which way Britains election results will go        WESTMINSTER GLEANINGS -   ANABEL LOYD                                                        
	The results of our general election were always going to be interesting, even those with ears closest to the political ground being unable to make the call. The campaign itself, however, seemed likely to be little more than a dreary extension of the less than covert party jockeying that has been going on since Gordon Brown first inherited the prime ministerial mantle. Gamesmanship has become the name of the game and death by platitude for those watching for a sign that politicians put the people and voters of the country before their own self-seeking ambitions.         
	Who would have expected that a first time ever televised debate between the three main party leaders, played out under bizarrely restrictive rules, could suddenly heighten the interest of the country? Even the most disinterested can hardly have remained unaware of the event and may now even know the name of the Liberal Democrat leader. Whether they are persuaded to exercise their democratic rights and actually vote when the time comes is less certain. There is deep disaffection with the whole political race but at least people are talking about what is going on.        
	On Thursday night in a one-and- a-half-hour debate, Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, was given equal billing with David Cameron and Gordon Brown and frankly trounced the pair of them. To be fair, he was the underdog with less to lose than the others, the leader of a party that last held power under its wholly Liberal guise in 1915. Less reason for nerves then, but his demeanour and performance were not only relaxed and attractive but also very much those of a highly intelligent young statesman right on top of his game. If he did get some of his facts and figures wrong, so did the others  and with them we had heard it all before.              
	The format of three men standing at lecterns is an uncomfortable one for both participants and audience and one to which we are unused in this country. Our politicians more usually appear as individual interviewees, part of panels or in inevitable party political broadcasts. This way they looked more naked and a lot less happy. Admittedly the programme started by looking like no more than a carefully orchestrated tripartite party political broadcast of adjudicated sound bites. Excessive nervous use of hand gestures from all three during early statements made them look like a row of puppets having their strings pulled. This feeling was aggravated by the somewhat robotic delivery of over-rehearsed anecdotes used to illuminate particular issues and the usual rerun of trite statements from Cameron and Brown over Afghanistan.         
	Clegg, immediately easier in his own skin than the others, increasingly commanded the stage, his manner, his confident and articulate delivery and the things he actually said sounding like a breath of something really new. As some commentators have said, it was a performance reminiscent of the young Tony Blair with a similar diffident charm and a sense of the wind of change blowing. It was believable and highly appealing.        
	Brown just played himself. Ultimately a performance judged relatively relaxed and not wholly unsuccessful, his answers and statements larded with the usual level of statistical back up we expect from him, whether or not we believe in their veracity. He was authoritative enough as the man in the driving seat and looked reasonably at home if not actually happy. Occasional flashes of the peculiar forced grimace that passes for his smile after a near joke or at least a dig at Cameron looked relatively genuine and, for an incumbent prime minister with his back against the wall, he survived relatively unscathed, coming an easy second to Clegg.         
	Cameron frankly blew it. He looked intensely nervous in an elegant bespoke suit that unfortunately underlined his stiffness. For those critics hunting for the bogeyman of class, his trappings reeked of privilege and the old-style conservatism that might once have been a comforting contrast to a rough, tough Labour Party. These days we no longer trust signs of privilege among our political representatives and the image of old-style conservatism, played up recently by the Labour Party, has become one of the old-style class distinctions. This is a low blow in the vain endeavour to make any distinctions at all for the average voter between one party and another, and it was Camerons bad luck that his background showed so clearly on Thursday night. The more Clegg relaxed, the more rigidly ill at ease Cameron became. His brow furrowed, face set and mouth a hard, unfriendly line, he looked furious and unattractive, the boyish charm completely gone. This picture of contained rage and frustration has, one suspects, been the biggest turn-off for viewers. Whoever scored winning points over the well-known and contentious issues discussed, and we were busily collating them at the time, the details are already almost forgotten. There is no doubt that Cameron came off worst in substance as well as style, but a few days later it is the style that is counting in Cleggs favour and a vague feeling that the things he said last week may make him a genuine force for change.         
	Will this change the results of an election that is already completely up in the air? Who can tell? Nobody is second guessing this one but the Liberal Democrats, the third party by a mile for as long as anyone can remember, never likely to hold more than at best a balancing power without a change to proportional representation, have suddenly thrown the campaign open and made it altogether a more interesting affair. If they do pick up the disaffected Labour vote, the reluctant Tories, the terminal floaters and, most of all, the young for whom they have enormous appeal, they will still remain the third party in Parliament. Barring the sky falling and unimaginable voter swings, our first-past- the-post system does not allow for a LibDem victory. If they gain a high proportion of the overall vote in the country they will nevertheless be a powerful force in a hung parliament where Labour will probably retain the largest number of members of parliament.               
	With a large proportion of the country LibDem constituents, the party would be in a position finally to fight for electoral reform and the real substance of dramatic change. For the Conservatives, it must be pretty galling, for this week at least, to look like has-beens when the party electoral banner is Vote for Change. Cameron is fighting back but the press vultures have been circling in the aftermath of Thursdays personal setback and he doesnt seem to be summoning up the smiles. He is now saying, quite truthfully, that a vote for Clegg could keep Labour in power but nobody much cares at the moment. By polling day that may change. Meanwhile, new Conservative policy ideas, such as instituting elected police chiefs, are being treated with entirely reasonable distaste; the police force has enough problems without politicizing it further. Proposals for a metamorphosis in governance being tagged as small government, big society, are being scorned as faintly ridiculous electioneering.         
	As for the Labour Party, they seem to be keeping their heads carefully below the parapet. One imagines they are getting on with the job and hoping no one asks tricky questions about the economy and one or two wars. They came out of last week respectably enough and the flak is currently flying elsewhere while the countrys attention is mainly on the Icelandic volcano that has brought European air travel to a standstill and left British travellers stranded all over the world. Well, we still have a long way to go if an hour-and-a-halfs television can throw this sort of spanner in the works  and there are more debates to come. Who would have imagined it could all become such compelling entertainment?

	It would not be out of place to hazard a guess on how Rabindranath Tagore would have reacted to the experiments around his music today: he would have welcomed a lot of it. For the man, whose 149th birth anniversary was celebrated this year, broke stereotypes in all his undertakings, creative or otherwise, and embraced the new with rare passion. And so, if everything from the didgeridoo to the saaz is being used today as accompaniment for Rabindrasangeet, it is a tribute to his fervour for experiment.        
	True to form, however, most of the musical programmes marking his birth anniversary this year stuck to a worshipful rendering of his songs that would meet with wholehearted approval from the purists. If one of the recent evenings at Rabindra Sadan (April 30) was dedicated to an exploration of his forays into Indian classical, folk and Western music (at least one-tenths of his 2,000-plus songs were influenced by other musical forms), another at Sisir Mancha (May 4) featured performances by well-known singers.        
	The first of the evenings, presented by Baitalik, took the audience on a journey through the various genres of classical music that inspired Tagore. Shubhashis Mukherjees accomplished vocals did justice to the profundity of the introspective dhrupad and dhamar as well as devotion in the semi-classical bhajan and thumri that were behind many of Tagores compositions. The corresponding Tagore numbers were sung with finesse by the members of Baitalik. Swapan Shomes Ke boshile aaji in the tappa style was meditative while Debarati Shomes Khelar sathi was achingly evocative of separation and loss.        
	The focus later shifted to baul and keertan and then to English songs such as Drink to me only and Robin Adair. While Tamasranjan Banerjee was comfortable in the folk numbers, Mithu Ghoshs rendition of the English songs was laboured and the lyrics remained unintelligible for the most part. Once again, Debarati Shome shone in her impassioned Robin Adair-inspired Sakali phuralo Swaponopray.        
	The programme at Sisir Mancha, featuring Mousumi Bandopadhyay, Swapan Shome, Debarati Shome and Mohan Singh, presented by Howrah Sangeet Kalakendra, began with choral singing by Baitalik. Swapan Shomes Boro bedonar moto bejechho tumi was engaging, while Debarati Shome was deeply atmospheric in her rendition of the enthralling ballad, Krishnakali ami taarei boli. The latter part of the evening clearly belonged to Singh, who stuck to meditative numbers rendered in his richly introspective style. If Shudhu tomar bani noy go in the tappa style was profoundly inward-looking, Danriye achho tumi aamar was bold in its invocation of the supreme.

	Where Gods Dwell: Central Himalayan Folktales and Legends (Penguin, Rs 299) by Kusum Budhwar collects the lores of the region spanning present-day Garhwal and Kumaon. Budhwar says in the introduction that she offers her readers whimsical, imaginative stories associated with high adventure, romance, pastoral gods, local heroes, medieval warriors, sacred spots and historical anecdotes, all of which are... popular in these parts but little known outside. The first tale is about Nanda Devi, the patron goddess of the Central Himalayas, who is a creator, guardian spirit, healer, protector, as well as a common woman in her joys, sorrows and aspirations. Then there are the sagas of the Ramola clan, ballads about popular heroes, anecdotes about local deities like Kal Bisht or Mahasu Devta, and stories about places like Haat Kalika. To read these tales is to travel to strange, enchanting lands and to rediscover lost time.                                 
	Glimpses from Indias Natural World: A Book for Nature Education (Broadway, Rs 595) by A.K. Sahay contains breathtaking photographs of Indian wildlife. Sahay, who is a well-known columnist, laments the fact that foreigners have more interest in our flora and fauna that we do. His book is meant to inspire us to conserve the disappearing forests, the vanishing animals, and the dying birds and butterflies. Sahay should succeed in his aim, for the photographs are fascinating. If they cannot urge us to protect our priceless natural heritage, nothing else will.                        
	Kaihan (Frog, Rs 225) by Lisbon Ferrao is about finding a Purpose in life. A shepherd boy of the Baluchi tribe, Kaihan which means the universe  tends sheep, plays his musical instrument, moons over his ladylove, and, in general, spends his time doing nothing till death invades his village in the form of the Persian army. It is easy to figure out where such a tale would head, and Ferrao has no surprises up his sleeve. Evidently, he is deeply inspired by Paulo Coelho, and has the latters irritating habit of capitalizing words to underline their importance. If you can find a purpose in continuing to read this book after the very first line which says, Ill-fated is the man in the midst of his life with no Purpose, for it is in the truest sense the Raison Dtre, then go ahead and martyr yourself.

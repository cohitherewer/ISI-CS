	Some authors dont like to be told that there is always a hidden hand at work in the creation of their books. You may call this invisible hand the editor who oversees the work before it goes to press or some professional rewrite man, but there is always someone who fine-tunes the copy to make it more user-friendly and interesting. Why should authors view these interventions as tampering with their work?        
	After all, as in other pursuits, the creator rarely acts alone: the artist has his apprentices, the scientist his research assistants, the lawyer his clerks, and so on. What is so peculiar about a book that its value should be enhanced by the knowledge that its author worked in isolation?        
	Should editors who act as rewriters be given the authority to check out the nitty-gritty of the copy before it goes to press? And at what point does an editor become a ghost? Above all, should the ghosts be given a free hand to rework the copy according to what they think is best for the reader?        
	Let us not be too squeamish about the role of editors.They are absolutely indispensable as supervisors because many authors in India gloss over the minutiae of manuscripts which make for the success or failure of the book. Facts have to be checked, along with other details like consistency of spelling, presentation of dates, scientific and mathematical formulae, and so on.         
	In India, simplicity of language is the key factor because of the falling standards of language. A book takes off only if authors write it as if they have spoken it. Over the years it has been proved that it is the spoken, not the written language as academics tend to use it, which is the real source of authority and understanding.         
	But herein lies the rub: simple language that a common reader can understand is not easy to achieve. It requires a familiarity with grammar and with the usage of everyday words that comes from regular writing and editorial revisions. Many editors involved in book publishing lack this. Journalists, to whom several publishers turn as an alternate, tend to bring their own style or journalese, into the writing. The contrast between semi-academic writing and everyday journalism is too glaring to ignore         
	In the absence of in-house expertise, what can be done to make the printed book better tailored for the reader? Obvious errors of fact can be eliminated, shoddy grammar and presentation can be improved but infelicities of language are much more difficult to straighten out. Authors here are far too touchy about stylistic changes because they take it as a reflection on their writing.        
	So what do publishers do? They turn to packaging, which means making the finished book look good: an attractive cover, an easy-to-read type. Then they leave it to marketing to flog the book with tempting discounts and credit facilities. It works sometimes but often doesnt go beyond a single edition. But for all the practical difficulties that editors here encounter, it doesnt obviate the necessity of checking out the authors copy before it goes to press.

	Everybody seems to agree that quality control is of capital importance in higher education in India. Yet confusion prevails over the question as to who should play the controller. Common sense says that it should be the responsibility, if not the priority, of every institution to ensure that the best faculty and infrastructure are made available to its students. It could only be advantageous for an institution if its students go on to scale rare heights. The aura of success would not only enhance the prestige of the institution but also attract other intelligent students, faculty, and more funds to it. Based on this sound logic of market economy, hundreds of young people every year aspire to enter some particular institution, where, they believe, their interests would be best served. It is evident, therefore, that most students have their own accreditation system which helps them sort out various colleges and universities according to a personal hierarchy of priorities. The State, however, seems to put greater faith in the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (which evaluates the performance of institutions across the country) than in individual instincts.        
	Yet a body like Naac is redundant for more reasons than one. The fear of Naac only inspires periodic, frenzied cleaning up among the colleges, just before a team of evaluators is scheduled to visit. For the rest of the year, it is business as usual, as faculty and students remain mired in politics, or laboratories and libraries lie in a shambles. It also appears that many institutions do not even care much about the Naac, considering the 108 colleges in West Bengal alone that are yet to apply for evaluation. This indifference is explained by the prevailing laissez-faire ethos in Indian higher education. As long as the State makes sure that teachers get their salaries every month, and pampers institutions with monetary grants from time to time, no sense of accountability can be fostered among the academic community. A sharp rap on the knuckles cannot be delivered by the Naac alone. It would be a good lesson for colleges if they are deprived of State funds and forced to subsist solely on students fees and donations. That should take care of errant teachers. Unless they do their duty, teachers would fail to attract quality students, and thus endanger their jobs  as it would be impossible to run the colleges without further enrolment. And so, everyone will get their moneys worth.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CHOICE MATTERS                                   Sumanta Sen                              
	Any mention of peace-talks with Naga rebels tends to elicit a yawn. And not without reason. For well over a decade now, such talks have been held at long intervals in New Delhi, Bangkok and elsewhere, but without any appreciable progress. The only success that has been achieved so far is that they have kept alive the ceasefire, and peace in Nagaland remains undisturbed. Otherwise, the general feeling is that the impasse will never end.        
	This time round also, there is little to suggest that cynicism would be replaced by hope. On his arrival in the nations capital and before meeting the prime minister, the leader of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, T. Muivah, again spoke of sovereignty and of Greater Nagaland including the Naga dominated areas of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. But the fact that his earlier demand, that he be given an audience with the prime minister, had been met must have satisfied him to some extent.         
	This was evident from his decision to talk even with a new interlocutor about whom he had some reservations. R.S. Pandey, the new man in, is an IAS officer of the Nagaland cadre. Muivah and his team obviously knew that sitting down to talks with him will mean they were indirectly giving credence to a state government, which they had all along refused to recognize. Even then, they did not walk out and this should raise expectations of a positive note creeping in at last. It is too early to talk of any settlement, but perhaps for the first time, Muivah, Isak Chishi Swu and others have decided that the time has come to take the road towards that goal.                
	Plan ahead        
	And there is some reason for that. Muivah and his comrades had earlier proceeded on the assumption that the situation within Nagaland would be such that the Centre would be pressurized into granting them a fair measure of their demands. For some time, things went their way as a parallel government came to exist and the rebels called the shots. New Delhi, however, held on, and today things are not exactly what they used to be. Not only in Nagaland but also in the entire Northeast, the younger generation is much more eager to be a part of the mainstream and to avail themselves of the opportunities it offers.         
	Many of these youths have talents in various spheres and they cannot afford to keep themselves aloof. At the same time, they want their identity in terms of culture recognized and respected within the Indian Union. Muivah and Swu are witnessing the changes in Nagaland and must have realized that pressures for sovereignty can no longer be kept up. They also know that the closer they move towards a settlement, the more they will be able to isolate the rival faction, the NSCN (Khaplang).         
	That group also knows this, and in its desperation, is now seeking to create inter-tribal tension by saying that Muivah and his friends, being Tangkhul, do not represent the real Nagas. This is unlikely to cut much ice unless overground politicians begin to talk along the same lines.         
	As for a Greater Nagaland, the demand continues to be raised in the Ukhrul district of Manipur, dominated by the Tankhul Nagas. But this is also a pressure tactic. The NSCN leaders must be aware that the Centre cannot create a situation that will earn it the anger of three states.         
	The pressure on this count is to wrest as much autonomy for Nagaland as possible. Sorting out all this will take time, and here a lot will depend on the attitude of the international Christian community  how long will it extend its support? For the rebels, time is running out. While New Delhi can play the waiting game, the choice for the rebels is simple: either play a role within the Constitution or end up like the Naga leader, Angami Phizo, on foreign shores.

                              Too many words        
	 Shivraj Patil may not be a Union minister anymore, but he hasnt given up some of his old habits. During his days in office, Patil was known for his love of speeches. Even though he finds himself out of the spotlight now, he seems not to have changed much. As the governor of Punjab, he recently delivered a long sermon at the National Development Council meet, making many in the audience squirm. Among those present was a Congressman  a cabinet minister  who was heard muttering that the National Human Rights Commission chief should be asked to be present every time Patil graced a function. The reason? Patils dreary and longwinding speech violated the human rights of the audience, quipped the leader. The Congressmans sentiments were shared by many who were present that evening. Bleary-eyed dignitaries were reportedly heard complaining that with Patil unwilling to let go of the microphone, staying awake and nodding in approval at the same time had proved to be a Herculean task.                              
	 Can a father, whose son got married recently, be considered young? The question seems to be haunting Bharatiya Janata Party supporters, so much so that they now have little time, or the inclination, to discuss Nitin Gadkaris latest faux pas or Amit Shahs predicament. The man in question is none other than the party vice-president, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who, at the ripe age of 53, considers himself to be young enough to take on the much-younger Shahnawaz Hussain. Hussain, a little over 40, seems to be secure in the knowledge that his rival is too old to be competition. But Naqvis supporters insist that a persons age is just a state of mind. What matters, they add, is that Naqvi is still young at heart.                            
	 Apart from Mukhtar Abbas Naqvis age, there are other issues that are raising a storm in the BJPs tea cup. Take, for instance, Murli Manohar Joshis heated exchange with a leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh over Nitin Gadkaris recent outbursts. It so happened that an important leader of the RSS rang up Joshi and demanded to know why he had criticized Gadkari in public. Gadkari, incidently, had attracted Joshis ire for describing Afzal Guru as the Congresss son-in-law and Digvijay Singh as Aurangzeb ki aulad (descendant). An undeterred Joshi gave back as much as he got. He defended himself by saying that his RSS roots prompted him to question Gadkaris conduct. The former professor of physics then went on to deliver a crisp and spontaneous lecture on the importance of ethics, probity and values in the Hindu philosophy. One does not know how the RSS leader reacted to this dose. But what one does know is that Joshi has emerged with flying colours in this round of the verbal duel.                            
	 Digvijay Singh isnt under attack from the BJP only. Some of his colleagues in the Congress have criticized him for imitating his guru, Arjun Singh, too closely. Digvijay has declared that he considers Arjuns guru, DP Mishra, his superguru. Much like Arjun, Digvijay has now busied himself with stitching together an influential lobby of thakurs at the national level. The word is that many Rajput leaders, who are close to Rahul Gandhi, are Diggy loyalists as well. But the similarities between Arjun and Digvijay dont end here. Both seldom lose an opportunity to flaunt their secular credentials, and the two men are known to be equally superstitious. There are two more things in common. Digvijay, like his guru, nurses prime ministerial ambitions. And, if his opponents are to believed, Digvijays dream will soon turn sour, as had happened in Arjuns case.                            
	 After getting elected as a Rajya Sabha member on a BJP ticket, Ram Jethmalani had rushed to defend the beleaguered Gujarat politician, Amit Shah. But BJPwallahs were shocked by what happened next: only a few hours later, Jethmalani tore into the idea of a caste-based census, even though the leader of the Opposition, Sushma Swaraj, had asked Manmohan Singh to declare his commitment to a caste-based enumeration exercise some time back. Meanwhile, BJP supporters are spending sleepless nights over what Jethmalani does next.                        
	 It has been raining snakes in Mumbai! You could ask Rishi Kapoor and Sanjay Dutt in case you doubt what you just read. Rishi, on spotting two slithering species at home, behaved in a manner that was least heroic  he promptly locked himself up in his bedroom till help arrived in the form of professional snake catchers. Sanjay, too, was having his share of reptilian visitors. But unlike Rishi, he made an attempt to master the art of snake-catching. In fact, while exchanging notes with Rishis actor-son, Ranbir, Sanjay is supposed to have advised him to use tongs with a headcatcher to capture poisonous snakes and a snake-stick with an attached hook for the non-poisonous ones. When Rishis wife, Nitu, heard what had passed between Sanjay and Ranbir, she wisely warned the young star against such a catch.

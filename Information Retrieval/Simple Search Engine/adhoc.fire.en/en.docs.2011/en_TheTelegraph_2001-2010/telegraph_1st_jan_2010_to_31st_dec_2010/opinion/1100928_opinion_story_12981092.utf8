The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Staring at a sporting debacle
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STARING AT A SPORTING DEBACLE                                  DOOMED PROJECT      If Indian sport is to reach international standards, it has to be liberated from government control                                                   
	A fortnight ago, when I was in Calcutta, I was deeply envious of the money and effort being spent on sprucing up Delhi ahead of the Commonwealth Games. Why was so much attention being given only to Delhi, and why couldnt the sporting events be distributed among the other metros that also deserve improved facilities?         
	Having since returned to Delhi, I grieve no more. The bog-mired capital, strewn with potholes, infested with dengue and with traffic restricted to a few lanes, makes Calcutta seem like heaven. Given the excessive media coverage, I had promised myself that I would not write on the CWG. But the plethora of adverse news reports in foreign publications after the collapse of the footbridge and the complaints about the lack of cleanliness in the Games village, coupled with the flood of critical messages I received from friends abroad, made it impossible for me to stay silent. The issue no longer concerns just Delhi or the organizers woes; it concerns national pride, or, to put it more succinctly, national shame.         
	Some months ago, after visiting Shanghai just ahead of the World Expo, I had written in The Telegraph about the citys targeted preparation for the event. The anxiety I expressed at that time concerned our perennial reliance on last-minute bandobust and our reluctance to clear debris. With only days to go before the scheduled start of the Games, Delhis beauty lies obscured by the rubble and mud along every major road. A lot has been written about the corruption underlying the Games. But Delhi has witnessed the timely execution of the relatively bigger Metro Rail project, that too ahead of its scheduled completion date and without serious allegations of corruption. So all this talk in the international media that India is incapable of completing large tasks is unfounded.         
	The problem lies elsewhere. Successful project leaders are experienced professionals, not politicians. Whom would you choose if you were spending your precious money to build a house or a factory? What led the country to hope that politicians would come together and execute the CWG project efficiently and on time?        
	The licence raj is now a thing of the past. In the two decades since it ended, the government has modified its role to that of a facilitator and regulator. Industry seized the opportunity to become globally competitive, and the consumer has benefited from the impact on price and technology.         
	Yet, sport in India remains within the governments control. Sports bodies are dominated by geriatric individuals, often politicians, with no background or achievement to speak of. Is it at all surprising then that a nation as populous as India has failed to produce even a handful of world-class athletes? Those who have succeeded at the international level have done so without any assistance from the national sports organizations.        
	The educated middle class has been pilloried for staying silent on the CWG disaster. Civil society should demand a trade-off. We expect nothing from the promised investigations into corruption. But let us have an altered role for the government and overhaul all relevant organizations to produce winners in the arena of international sports and athletics within a decade.                    SEKHAR RAHA

	Truth be told                  
	Sir  It was pathetic to watch the official spokesperson of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) choke with tears while announcing the demise of Jyoti Basu (The last helmsman, Jan 18). Biman Boses act symbolizes the dominance of emotions over rationality that characterizes the Bengali psyche.          
	After his death, Basu has been praised for land reforms and increase in agricultural output in Bengal during his tenure as chief minister. But if truth be told, the yields from those reforms had dwindled after a time. It is the duty of a good leader to drive his people towards a better future, even if that entails the reconciliation of differences with the Opposition. Basu failed to perform this duty. Bengals growth was hampered due to the Left Fronts hostile attitude towards the Centre; the state lost large-scale industrial projects.           
	Simultaneously, the existing infrastructure of the state was slowly dismantled under Basus leadership. Capital fled from a politically disturbed Bengal to other states that were more welcoming. Basu also contributed to the decline of the state education system by politicizing it. He politicized the police force too. He vowed to protect the interests of workers and peasants, but made the Bengali youth migrate to other states or abroad in search of education and employment, leaving Bengal in a dismal condition. History will not be kind to Basu who presided over the transformation of Calcutta from a thriving cosmopolis to a moribund provincial wasteland.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  An era has ended with the passing away of the CPI(M) patriarch, Jyoti Basu. Jyotibabu was one of the strongest leaders among his contemporaries. Basus uninterrupted tenure of 23 long years in West Bengal showed his influence over the people. He did everything he could for the poor, especially the rural masses. Land reforms and panchayati raj were his most important achievements. Being a visionary and a pragmatic leader, Jyotibabu had converted West Bengal into an impregnable fortress of the CPI(M).           
	Basu was the last surviving member of the original nine who had formed the CPI(M) politburo. Despite being gentle and dignified, he was firm in his beliefs. Basus decision to reject the post of prime minister in 1996, in keeping with his partys diktat, displayed his magnanimous character. However, he regretted the CPI(M)s stand afterwards, and called it a historical blunder.          
	Basu was one of the few Indian leaders who were highly respected by leaders cutting across party lines. His contribution to Indian politics will always be remembered. With his death, not only Bengal but also India has lost a powerful political figure.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur 

                
	Sir  Jyoti Basus admirers would insist that he was a liberal communist leader. His critics, however, condemn him as a failure, despite the fact that Basu was the longest-serving chief minister in India. His remarkable life demonstrates how much he had done for the country  for secularism, political equilibrium, ethnic relations and for the well-being of democracy. But the leftist ideology, in which Basu had unwavering faith, lost its relevance after the collapse of the Soviet Union.          
	Nevertheless, Basu has made the gift of land reforms to West Bengal  the value of which Calcuttas urban people have never fully understood or appreciated. Basu gave poor people dignity and self respect. But he failed to guarantee prosperity, as the term is defined in the post-liberalization world. However, he has inspired most modern politicians in one way or the other. He will be remembered not for his achievements but for who he was and what he represented. His death is a very significant loss for the Left Front.          
	Yours faithfully,       
M. Ziyaullah Khan, Nagpur 

                
	Sir  Jyoti Basu was the strongest communist leader India has ever seen. However, he was trapped in his own ideology and was unable to unshackle himself, especially towards the end of his tenure as chief minister when he desperately tried to attract investments. The dearth of investments in Bengal is a product of the very trade union movement that had made him a leader. The poor work culture in the state and the militant trade unionism are aspects of the destructive politics Basu and his comrades practised.Although we would like to remember Basu as a great administrator and the sanest voice in an otherwise discredited Marxist movement, history would, perhaps, judge him more harshly. His rule saw the beginning of the decline of West Bengal, which, at one time, had been the political and the economic capital of India. His death could not have been more inopportune for the CPI(M), coming as it does at a time when the party is facing a crisis in West Bengal, its most important stronghold.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Erratum          
	In Minds in thrall (Jan 19), by Rudrangshu Mukherjee, it was mentioned that in the 1930s, Rajani Palme Dutt was the general-secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain. The correct name, however, is Harry Pollitt. The error is regretted.

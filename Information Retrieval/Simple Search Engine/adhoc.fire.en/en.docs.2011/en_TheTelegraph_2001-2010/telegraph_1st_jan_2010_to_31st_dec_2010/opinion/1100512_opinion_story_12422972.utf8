	Divided stance                  
	Sir  It is unfortunate that caste has been included as a separate category in the ongoing census exercise (Census to ask for caste label, May 8). While our leaders speak of a casteless society, they do just the opposite when it comes to implementing the same in practice. Why cant we take pride in the fact that we are Indians, and not label ourselves as Brahmins, Rajputs, Yadavs, Kurmis, and so on? How can the caste component help in the nations development? In fact, casteism will divide society further as more and more groups demand reservations for government jobs or in educational institutions on the basis of their caste identities. The government will also find it difficult to meet the demands of these specific groups.          
	The ruling United Progressive Alliance government has played its hand very well by conceding to the Oppositions demand to include caste in the census. But it can be argued that the UPA is itself in favour of this. Although heated debates on this issue will continue among different groups, the bottom line is that our leaders will persist in dividing the people on caste lines to secure votes.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  A caste-based census is a blow to the concept of unity in diversity. Union ministers like P. Chidambaram were against this format at first. But it is obvious that they eventually had to give in to the demand made by some of the champions of caste politics whose support is essential to ensure the governments survival and to pass various bills in Parliament. Caste-based reservations have created rifts and generated acrimony among different groups in the past. So the caste factor poses a great danger to the unity and progress of the country.          
	It is being estimated that the authorities will take five years to verify the caste data collected for the census (5 years for caste count, May 8). It goes without saying that the census will lose its purpose if it fails to cover every citizen. By the time the results are tabulated and published, thousands of people will be dead and a similar number of babies born. Lakhs of inter-caste marriages will also occur, thereby changing the caste equations of some citizens. So, it would be meaningless and technically incorrect for the government to draft policies on the basis of unreliable data.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Revised opinion          
	Sir  The proposal to declare January 23, Subhas Chandra Boses birthday, as desh prem day is a novel idea, which should be supported by every Indian (Karats Bloc prem day, May 6). Netajis contribution towards Indias liberation from the clutches of British rule is exceptional. It is astonishing that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has held a negative attitude towards this great man for so long. But now it seems that in a bid to placate a diminishing vote bank, Prakash Karat assured the Forward Bloc members that he would fight for this proposal to be implemented. Karats desperation to keep the Forward Bloc happy only shows how panic-stricken his party is. Even A.B. Bardhan has now accepted that the communists had made a mistake in their assessment of Boses contribution.          
	If the Left Front starts accepting its other mistakes as well, some of its erstwhile supporters may come back to vote for it. Any party that can ensure peace and development should get the mandate of the people.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Benu Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The demand to celebrate Subhas Chandra Boses birthday as desh prem day is justified. Bose quit his glamourous job in the Indian Civil Services to join the freedom struggle. His move to take help from countries like Japan and Germany during the movement for independence was a brilliant one. Unfortunately, after advancing for some distance with his Indian National Army, he was let down by his allies and his efforts went in vain. He was the first man to think of the idea of a national army to help in the cause of Independence. Boses notion regarding communal harmony was equally unique. Why should his birthday then not be celebrated as desh prem day?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The governments move to protect the interests of domestic helps is more than welcome. But it is doubtful whether it will be able to implement this regulation in letter and spirit (Workplace rights for maids, May 6). If domestic helps were to demand minimum wages and a weekly off as per government stipulations, they will, in all probability, lose their jobs. Employers must look after their maids since government rules are seldom followed.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

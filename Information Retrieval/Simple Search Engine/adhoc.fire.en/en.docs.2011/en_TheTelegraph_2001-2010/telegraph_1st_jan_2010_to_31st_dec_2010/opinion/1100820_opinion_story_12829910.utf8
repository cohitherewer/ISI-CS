                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT CRICKET                                                    
	It is a measure of where the game of cricket has sunk that a bowler could deliberately bowl a no-ball to deny a batsman a century. At the fag end of the India-Sri Lanka one-day international at Dambulla on Monday, Virender Sehwag was poised on 99 and India needed one run to win the match. The bowler, Suraj Randiv, by his own admission, deliberately bowled a no-ball so that Mr Sehwag could not reach 100. There is evidence that the suggestion to bowl a no-ball had come from Tillekaratne Dilshan, and the captain of the Sri Lankan side took no steps to stop the occurrence. It should be welcomed that those who run cricket in Sri Lanka have acted on their own, without a formal complaint from either the umpires or the Indian side, to punish the two players; they also asked the Sri Lankan captain to ensure that similar transgressions of the spirit of cricket did not recur. There are two points to be made in this context. One concerns the lightness of the punishment. The other relates to the seriousness of the offence  was it only a violation of the spirit or was it, in fact, a violation of the very letter of the law?        
	The second point needs to be addressed first since it is linked to the weight of the punishment. It is apparent from Mr Randivs own statement that he deliberately broke the law to influence the outcome of the match. As has been pointed out in the columns of The Telegraph, if Mr Randivs delivery had not been a no-ball, there could have been many other possible outcomes. Theoretically, India could have lost the match by losing all the six wickets without a run being added. Mr Randiv removed the glorious uncertainty of cricket by violating a law. In so doing, he not only broke the spirit of the game but also the law itself. The code of the International Cricket Council explicitly forbids any act that improperly influences the result. Mr Randiv, aided and abetted by Mr Tillekaratne, did exactly that. The umpires and the Indian team management erred in not making formal the charges against the Sri Lankan team in general and the two players in particular. The Sri Lankan authorities have recognized that their national team actually did something outrageous. By acting on their own, they have downplayed the enormity of what was perpetrated. A deliberate violation of the law, in letter and in spirit, deserves the harshest of punishments, like a time-bound ban on the entire team. Maybe such high standards have disappeared from cricket.

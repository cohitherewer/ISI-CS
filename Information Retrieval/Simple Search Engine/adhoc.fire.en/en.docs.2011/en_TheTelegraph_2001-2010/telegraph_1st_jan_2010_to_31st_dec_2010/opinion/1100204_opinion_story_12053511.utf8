	Let there be light                  
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the Calcutta Book Fair gets mired in controversies every year. Some time back, the fair was the bone of contention between the government and an environmentalist, owing to environmental concerns over its then venue, the Maidan. The fair was subsequently shifted to the Yuva Bharati Krirangan in Salt Lake, but the location of the new site proved to be inconvenient for many. Now the Milan Mela grounds have been chosen for the book fair. But problems still persist, because of mismanagement, and the unprofessional attitude of the organizers.          
	Although the book fair has stepped into its 34th year, it seems it still has not attained adulthood. The fair has assumed worldwide importance but lags behind with regard to international standards. The two-hour power cut at the fair during peak hours disheartened visitors, many of whom had come from afar (Here, books lead us to darkness, Jan 31). Had it not been for the halogen lights illuminating the space outside the bookstalls, a stampede could have taken place. Such a poor show is not expected, since the book fair is being held at the Milan Mela grounds for two years now.          
	Only last month, Eden Gardens sank into darkness owing to a power failure, stalling a one-day international match. But it seems that the general secretary of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, Tridib Chatterjee, has not learnt a lesson from that incident. After a similar mishap at the book fair, a blame game has started, leading to a 72-hour probe being ordered by the industry minister, Nirupam Sen. Despite the fiasco at Eden Gardens being fresh in public memory, not enough has been done to check similar lapses.          
	Apart from the incident of the power cut, the book fair is burdened with other niggling problems. The ground in which the fair is being held is dusty and uneven. Before organizing the fair, the guild authorities should have made a thorough assessment of the number of stalls that can be accommodated, the power requirement and the availability of civic amenities, so that the mess could have been avoided. A year is enough for the authorities to chalk out a sensible plan for next years fair.          
	The guild profits from the fair, and it is its responsibility to ensure flawless infrastructure for the bookstall owners. Muddles of the kind that happened this year at the book fair show the government in a poor light. The government should compel organizers of such huge events as the book fair or one-day international matches to act more responsibly.          
	Yours faithfully,         Subhankar Mukherjee, 
Burdwan            
	Sir  I was one of the unfortunate people who visited the Calcutta Book Fair on the evening of January 30, when the entire fair was plunged into darkness owing to power failure. Groans and sighs could be heard all around. The crowds dwindled as the authorities failed to bring the lights back. Over the next two hours, the people who stayed back at the fair roamed around helplessly. Many flocked to the food stalls, but most of the stalls were also affected by the power cut.          
	If booksellers are unable to sell at the fair as per expectations, can it be called a successful event? Most of the stalls were emptied during the dark hours, and it felt very bad to see the disappointed looks on the faces of the salesmen. Some people tried to buy books with the help of the light from their cell phones, but the method did not work. Why should visitors to the book fair have to go through this? People visit the fair to read and buy books. The absence of electricity ruins the experience. If such a state of affair continues, Calcutta may lose one of its greatest assets  a safe and lively book fair.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sinjini Sengupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is indeed a pathetic situation for a book-lover if he suddenly discovers himself in a book fair enveloped in darkness. On January 30, in the Milan Mela grounds, I had bought three books and was about to search for the Ananda Publishers stall when the lights went off. The fair grounds looked like a version of Dantes inferno. People were panicking and running about madly. Several stalls began to close shutters. I waited for some time, and then left the place with a heavy heart. This years book fair has been facing several problems from the very outset that raise questions about the reliability of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild and the state government.          
	Yours faithfully,         Anindya Bhattacharya, 
Calcutta            
	Under threat          
	Sir  The report, Govt eye falls on dirty ponds (Jan 23), about the governments plan to revitalise neglected ponds in the state through de-silting and other procedures, instils hope. It has become a practice in West Bengal to fill existing water bodies for creating landmasses, which are sold at high prices, by people who have good connections at the municipal and higher levels.           
	In Durgapur, where I live, there is still a water body at the heart of the city, just beside the newly constructed Bengal Ambuja Housing Complex. This was a lake once upon a time. But after many years of being used as a garbage dump, it has silted up almost completely. Water is left in a small portion of the lake now. That water is very dirty because all the poor people living nearby use it as their toilet. Surprisingly, the Durgapur Municipal Corporation seems to be ignorant about the gradual death of such a big water body.          
	The people who have their houses in the Bengal Ambuja complex are all well-off. They can afford to pay some money for the maintenance of the water body, provided the DMC helps them by taking effective measures for the protection and restoration of the lake. If a garden-cum-childrens park is built around the lake (after restoring it) then people will willingly pay some token amount as entry fee. That way, the DMC can earn the money for its upkeep. If revived, this precious water body at the citys centre will help maintain the atmospheric balance during the scorching summers and will also absorb a lot of pollutants emitted by a nearby power plant.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Partha Sarathi Banerjee, Durgapur

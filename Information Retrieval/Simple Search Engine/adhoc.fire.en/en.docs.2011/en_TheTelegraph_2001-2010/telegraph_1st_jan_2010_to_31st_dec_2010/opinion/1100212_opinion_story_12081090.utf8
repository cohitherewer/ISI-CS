	The Special Protection Group is a particularly precious wing of the army; its Cobra unit is even more precious. The decision to open a training centre for the Cobra in West Bengal has been reckoned by the state authorities as an important development. The new training centre  the second in the country  of this crack unit set up to hunt down terrorists assumes an additional significance because of its location in Salboni, right in the heart of the Lalgarh area where the Maoists are on the rampage. The state government has allotted, with alacrity, close to 150 acres of khas land for the purpose; the land is being handed over to the army free of charge.         
	At one time, economists used to amuse themselves by playing around with a concept they described as opportunity cost. Resources are limited. Assume a certain bundle of resources is needed to produce x. An alternative use of these resources is however possible; they could have produced y. The given quantum of resources could not obviously produce both x and y. In deploying the resources to produce x, it is necessary to surrender the opportunity to produce y, which is then the opportunity cost of x.        
	Economists tire easily. They soon realized that the opportunity cost concept has little that is earth-shaking in it, and they could do without its pedantry. This nearly moribund concept has, however, attained a relevance in the context of the decision to establish the Cobra training centre in a Maoist-infested terrain. Consider what the opportunity cost of gifting 150 acres of land in Salboni to the Cobra outfit can be. It is possible to think up an entire array of opportunities that has been surrendered by gifting the land to the army.               
	The land could have been used to set up an industrial training institute to impart skills to the local adivasi youth. It could have been used to start an experimental farm for dryland cropping. Or the land could have been used to set up an experiment in collectivized agriculture: its ownership might have been transferred to, say, 75 adivasi families, each of them being offered free two acres of land, on the condition that they would agree to pull their holdings together and engage in cultivating the total tract on a cooperative basis. Or perhaps the 150 acres of land could have been used to build a research centre on ethnic culture, a sort of a cultural university with individual departments running training courses in a variety of adivasi arts and crafts, including dance, music, painting, hut construction, furniture building, pottery, terracotta, et al. Attached to the centre, there could be a library, a hostel for students as well as accommodation facilities for visiting scholars. If imagination is permitted free play, the land could even have been deployed to develop a sports complex, with a stadium thrown in, where traditional forms of sports and athletics would be encouraged.        
	The opportunity cost of the Cobra training centre thus consists of any number of things, provided the purpose behind the gifting of the land was to foster development activities in the neighbourhood: an industrial training institute or an agricultural research centre or an experimental cooperative farm or a university specializing in ethnicity or a sports complex. The people in the region could have been invited to choose among these alternatives. The decision to set up the Cobra centre, therefore, means depriving the local populace of availing of any of these alternative opportunities. That is to say, the opportunity cost of the army training centre is either a cultural university or an agricultural research station or a cooperative farm or a sports complex, not, of course, all of them together. If only the authorities had sat back and thought upon it, they might have themselves come to realize that, to the residents in the area, each one of these missed opportunities would perhaps have been more preferable than a centre for training counter-insurgency forces.         
	The authorities are clearly thinking on a different wavelength. First things first, they might well argue; restoring law and order has to be accorded, at this juncture, the highest priority in Lalgarh. Without law and order, there can be no development, there can be neither agriculture nor industry, nor the blossoming of arts or resurgence of athletics and sports activities. Rooting out Maoist violence must be at the top of the agenda. A Cobra training centre eminently fills this bill of immediate requirement. Once this centre gets located there, Lalgarh would immediately acquire national importance. At least, such is the expectation. The expedition, jointly organized by the state police and the Central Reserve Police Force, is already active in Lalgarh. The Cobra training centre, in effect an adjunct of the army, is bound to develop a symbiotic relationship with those in charge of the ongoing joint operations. It should be possible for the latter to draw upon resources at the disposal of the training centre. There could be, for instance, continual advisories on aspects of war strategy and manoeuvres to control terrorist acts, thereby heightening the efficiency of the joint expedition. Perhaps the thought is also being entertained that once the training centre is fully operational, the army would develop a contingent interest with regard to the state of affairs in Lalgarh. The local population too, it could be suggested, would begin to feel assured that the Maoists were not the only major presence around them, the establishment of the Cobra centre was strong evidence of New Delhis intense concern for restoring peace. Once the people were convinced of the Union governments determination not to leave Lalgarh in the lurch, allegiances that were getting shifted to the Maoists would move back to where these originally belonged. The installation of a superchief policeman as the nominal head of the state administration, the latest no-nonsense statements of the prime minister and the Union home minister on the imperative need to crush Maoist violence and the establishment of the Cobra training centre, all considered together, are indications of a new determination to re-establish the rule of law in the region; a major offensive against the wild Maoists is obviously in the offing.        
	Is there, though, not a reverse side of the picture? Army and police personnel are known for their rough ways while dealing with common people. Warnings and admonitions from above are of little help here. A pronounced presence of the forces of law and order, whatever the lofty reason underlying this presence, might, it is possible to argue, actually foment a feeling of sullen hostility among the local people towards the police and the army.        
	Even as state and Central troops intensify their operations, chances are that the bulk of the Maoists, as is wont with hardened guerrillas, will melt away into the forests and low hills. In the circumstances, the wrath of the combined expeditionary force is likely to target the helpless, innocent villagers abandoned by the Maoists. The sequence of events could then take a strange turn. It may not be altogether irrelevant to recall here what took place in Bengal itself in the third and fourth decades of the last century. Circa the early 1930s, Calcutta was the epicentre of terrorist violence unleashed by groups of armed revolutionaries, often described as anarchists by the rulers. Their activities spread across the Bengal districts. The authorities, led by Calcuttas police commissioner, Charles Tegart, mobilized their entire resources to hunt them down. The police bandobast was ubiquitous and unrelenting; army marches to instil fear of the imperial power were not infrequent either. Midnight raids on sleeping households and indiscriminate arrests of young people suspected of links with the revolutionary terrorists were commonplace.               
	Children, growing up in that environment and sensitive to the core, were conditioned to hate the police and army personnel regarded as symbols of the cruel and repressive alien masters. In the process, the revolutionaries, whom the police were hunting, emerged as heroes and role models for Bengali youth. Some of the so-called terrorists or anarchists were shot dead by the police, some were caught and either sent to the gallows or given long prison sentences. Most of the surviving revolutionaries, once let out of prison, invariably joined a leftist political formation. The majority of them found their way into the Communist Party, the rest joined the Forward Bloc, the Revolutionary Socialist Party, the Revolutionary Communist Party or the Royists. Not surprisingly, that phase also coincided with the cross-over of the Bengali middle class to an enduring affiliation with the Left.        
	Is there any warranty that the youngsters belonging to adivasi families in West Bengals Jangal Mahal will not develop a mindset nearly identical to that of children in middle-class Bengali homes eight decades ago? Their sympathies, it is altogether conceivable, will not be with the hunters but with the hunted, more so since the latter are their own kinsfolk. In such an eventuality, the consequence of sticking to the doctrine of pacification-first-the-rest-of-the-agenda-could-wait and the refusal to consider any alternative course of action might turn out to be something unimaginably horrendous.

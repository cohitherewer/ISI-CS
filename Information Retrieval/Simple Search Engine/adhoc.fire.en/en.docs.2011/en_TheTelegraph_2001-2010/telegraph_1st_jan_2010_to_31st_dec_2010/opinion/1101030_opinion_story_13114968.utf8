The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | On the cusp of change
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ON THE CUSP OF CHANGE                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Amidst one of those temporary lulls in original Bengali playwriting, Ekush Shataks Rater Fashion House shows promise. Subhasish Gangopadhyay, who used to innovatively lead Blind Opera and successfully dramatized Jibanananda Dass Malyaban for Swapna-sandhani, has written and directed a thought-provoking script of his own about the socio-economic transformation of old to new Calcutta, equally applicable to India.        
	He places his magic-realistic parable in a tailoring shop, with his central character as its oldest employee, Madhu, who joined long before under its dear-departed founder-proprietor and now continues to work under that mans son. Buffeted by the winds of change and business competition, the latter has to keep up with the times  not just new styles, but also glitzy window-dressing and gimmicky advertising  all of which causes great distress to Madhu, who is accustomed to earlier ways. His mind hallucinates between memory and reality, adequately reflected by the coming to life of those ubiquitous portraits one sees on the walls of Indian entrepreneurships: the founder himself, Lord Ganesh, Mahatma Gandhi and (not forgetting in Bengal) Lenin. Periodically, these figures emerge from their frames and hector Madhu with blasts from the past. When the new owner orders him to shape up or ship out, Madhu sadly decides he has no option but to commit suicide that night in the shop.        
	Yet even that becomes impossible. Madhu realizes the shortcomings in all his heroes: despite his loyalty to his kindly dead master, the Babu behaved like a feudal tyrant, after all; Ganesh turns into a parody of idols, focussed single-mindedly on what offerings he receives by way of worship; and the ideologies of Lenin and Gandhi (who stays remarkably quiet) seem to hold no meaning any more. The political implications are clear: obviously every god has failed. But structurally, the play has a problem at the beginning, which mostly concerns Madhus fantasies about a woman  the combination of a former colleague and a mannequin. Gradually, we find that she has little bearing on the theme, and so does not require this extended presence.        
	Unquestionably, Dipankar Chattopadhyay delivers a bravura performance as the confused but sincere Madhu (picture), symbol of the common Indian, discarded by the cutthroat economy of globalization and living in a dream-world of his nightmares. Among the others, the authoritarian Babu (Supriyo Sinha) and greedy Ganesh (Saibal Bandyopadhyay) put in rounded characterizations.

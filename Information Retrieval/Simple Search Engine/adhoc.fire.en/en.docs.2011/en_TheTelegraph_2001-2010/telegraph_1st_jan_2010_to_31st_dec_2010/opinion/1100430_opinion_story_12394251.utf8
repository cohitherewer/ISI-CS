	Secret Son By Laila Lalami, 
  Viking, 12.99        
	A couple of haunting epigraphs usher in the story of Youssef El-Mekki, the 19-year-old protagonist of Laila Lalamis second novel, Secret Son, which recently reached as far as the longlist of this years Orange Prize, though it certainly deserved much better. Silence is death, says the first one, a poem by the Algerian writer, Tahar Djaout: And you, if you speak, you die/ If you are silent you die/ So, speak and die. Terse as a haiku, it is followed by another poem, Dedication, by the contemporary Cuban writer, Gustavo Prez Firmat  The fact that I/ am writing to you/ in English/ already falsifies what I/ wanted to tell you.        
	These two statements capture, with a bitter but moving irony, the inner contradictions of present-day Moroccan society, from which both Lalami and her young hero hail. In the first part of the novel, this inherently conservative society, guided by an archaic shame culture, sentences Youssef to a painful silence, compelling him to keep the most profound truth about himself under wraps. After spending the first two decades of his life in a filthy Casablancan slum, with nothing much to look forward to except the ephemeral pleasures offered by Hollywood and local cinema, Youssef discovers one day that his supposedly dead father is actually very much alive. Even better, he happens to be one of the richest men in Morocco. However, being the lovechild of the powerful Nabil Amrani and a poor nurse, Youssef has to live down the shock of this epiphany for days. When he finally confronts his father, he gains a provisional reprieve from his miserable existence, before being propelled into bizarre circumstances that bring upon him absurd troubles. Youssefs fate is akin to that of Meursaults in The Stranger.        
	Youssefs tragedy is sealed by a double sorrow. Like Chaucers Troilus, he is allowed a glimpse of happiness, only to be thrust back into the slough of despond from which he had risen. In a chilling literalism, Djaouts final injunction (speak and die) is also borne out by the conclusion of Lalamis story. Yet even in the end, as with the rest of the novel, Lalami preserves a tone of noble understatement, reminiscent of Mohsin Hamids prose in The Reluctant Fundamentalist. Although Lalami explores the origin and appeal of violence in a repressive society, she scrupulously avoids the crude hysteria that is generally associated with representations of political Islam and jihad. On the contrary, there is a naturalness, a poetic justice of sorts, in the way Youssef gradually moves towards religion for consolation.        
	Lalamis achievement lies in making the several transformations of Youssef humanly credible. From being a sensitive student of English literature, Youssef tries his best to refashion himself into a suitable heir to his father; but he simply cannot be one of the Amranis, no matter how hard he tries. When he is thrown back into the gutters from where he had emerged, he decides to reinvent himself all over again, this time as an assassin for the cause of Islam. But even there, his real self surfaces at the last moment from the detritus of the various fictional selves he has tried to inhabit, making his calculations go terribly wrong. Like Changez in The Reluctant Fundamentalist, Youssef is afflicted with the malaise of existential incoherence, so that life, for him, moves along a dreadfully uncertain path, pushing him into corners he had never anticipated. Instead of the rage of victimhood, in Youssef we find a vulnerable youth betrayed by his private memories of love, a young man struggling to reckon with the hollowness of his mothers projected widowhood or the sudden arrival of a father who had merely been an imaginary figure in the early years of his life.        
	At the same time, there is nothing particularly fanatical about Youssef, even after he enlists with al Hizb (the Party) and accepts a commission to kill an influential journalist. Instead of being anti-West, Youssef, like most of his peers, is attracted to the freedom of expression and easy charms of Western civilization. He loves to go to the movies, which titilate his hormonally charged teenage libido stifled by convention and proprieties. His friends are taken by gadgets. In college, Youssef decides to read English, and is enamoured of The Great Gatsby. As in any postcolonial society, in Morocco too, generations of people, especially the younger ones, living in poverty, have aspired to the Great American Dream. This may be news to foreign writers harbouring a very different image of Muslims, but is not all that extraordinary to inhabitants of the anglophone postcolonial world. For a majority of Muslims, the West is enmeshed in their deepest sense of self; the history of imperialism and globalization make it impossible for the West to remain the inalienable Other. Lalami explores this truth beautifully in the daily habits of the people living in a Casablancan slum.        
	Lalami also exposes the darker side of this fascination with the West. The painful irony of reading and dreaming of Gatsby in Casablanca is unsettling for those who are familiar with the sordid realities of the third world. The vision of life as an endless dream of sex, splendour and success can only spawn a soul-numbing hopelessness in a society riddled with corruption and unable to offer any real prospect of change to its young. Although Youssef is given access to a fleeting reality vaguely resembling Gatsbys dream, his one chance at happiness is cruelly thwarted even before he has started feeling properly happy.        
	Lalami acknowledges through the epigraph from Firmat that Youssefs story, both its narration and reception, is untranslatable. The truth of his experiences and feelings will remain fundamentally incommunicable, if not ineffable, to a Western readership that has never wanted the East to exert much influence on its self-perceptions. Yet she is also aware of the necessity of speaking to the West  now waging a war out of its terror of the East  in its lingua franca, so as to point out that Muslims, like followers of any other religion, are defined by the various exigencies specific not only to their geography but also to personal circumstances. Perhaps for this reason, the trilingual Lalami has forsaken her first and second languages (Arabic and French respectively) to write in English.                          SOMAK GHOSHAL

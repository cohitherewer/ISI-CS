                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOTHING SERIOUS                                                    
	In the curious world of Pakistans diplomacy, nothing can be deemed conclusive evidence of the countrys ill will. An emphatic no (to Indian aid, for example) is not supposed to mean anything so serious that it cannot be overwritten by a crate of mangoes. Information exposed by WikiLeaks on the establishments links with the Afghan Taliban is not expected to stop the flow of aid from international donors, and cartloads of dossiers on terror groups in Pakistan planning more attacks on India is not likely to unsettle bilateral peace talks. The recent expos by the international media on Pakistans dubious intentions behind the arrest of a Taliban commander, Abdul Ghani Baradar, in early February may fall into this grey area of suspended belief. Pakistan officials have apparently admitted that the authorities helped the Central Intelligence Agency to capture the Taliban leader in order to queer the pitch of Hamid Karzais unilateral moves towards seeking peace with the Taliban. These moves would have sidelined Pakistan in the strategic game. Such an admission confirms a long-standing suspicion of Pakistans motives, which, even at the time of arrest, were perhaps not as magnanimous as they appeared to be. But pinning Pakistan down to admitting its double standards may achieve nothing.         
	Then again, Pakistan may make an exception this time and not run away from the implications of the admission. It has less reason to do so than previously, given that certain pieces of the jigsaw have quietly fallen into place. Mr Karzai, who had long been trying to forge his own path, has come round to acknowledging that he cannot ignore Pakistan if his presidency is to survive. Baradars arrest may well have led to this realization, but there cannot be any doubt about a turning point in Mr Karzais understanding of Pakistan. Afghanistans transit deal with Pakistan (leaving India out), the dismissal of the pro-Indian Afghan security chief, Amrullah Saleh, closeness to the Pakistan army chief, a sudden go-slow in reconciliation attempts with the Taliban are all proof of this. Undergirding this new friendship is the old realization of the United States of America that Pakistan would be important for its exit plan. It is advantage Pakistan. But submerged in flood waters, Pakistan may not want the truth to be rescued right now.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BAD JUSTICE                                                    
	How effective is a national commission that officially fails to understand a national vernacular? There is something deeply flawed about a justice delivery system that refuses to understand complaints made to it in one of the Indian languages. But this is exactly what the national commission for scheduled castes has done with serious complaints addressed to it in Oriya. That the targeted beneficiaries of this body are the scheduled castes makes such a flaw even more difficult to fathom. A set of complaints made to the commission in Oriya by poor Dalit villagers from Orissa has been shuttling between the commissions Delhi headquarters and its Calcutta office simply because the latter, which has jurisdiction over Orissa, failed to find translators who would translate Oriya into English (or whatever other language it is capable of working in). The complaints are far from frivolous  they are about the forcible displacement of rural Dalits because of the construction of an irrigation project in a district in Orissa. Incredibly, the commissions Calcutta office sent the complaints back to the collector of the same district  effectively asking the accused to deal with the problem.        
	It is difficult to believe that nobody who understands Oriya could be found in Calcutta. It is the governments responsibility to have a panel of translators ready, and obviously it has not bothered to be alert to this fact. Such inefficiency and indifference add to the inequalities and loopholes that exist already in the Indian justice system. In a society disunited not only by economic disparities but also by linguistic diversity, the built-in checks and measures in the systems of governance and law have to be kept in place scrupulously to make the systems serve their minimal functions. Effective two-way communication is at the core of access to justice. For ordinary Indians  or extraordinarily disempowered Indians  to be able to access the protection of the State, the latter has to ensure the proper running of its basic services. Every government body, whatever its executive powers, should have quick access to a panel of translators who would be able to work, without delay, to deliver to the people the attention, and comprehension, that they are entitled to as citizens. To plead ignorance about existing services speaks of a callousness about the basic principles of democracy.

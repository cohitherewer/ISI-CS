                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Raging controversy                  
	Sir  The fact that a fire killed 43 people in the heart of Calcutta is shocking and sad (Crossed wires, April 5). It is appalling that a building like Stephen Court, which posed a threat to its inhabitants, failed to draw the attention of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The fire also revealed the governments inability to cope with sudden adversities. Even after the explosion at McDonalds in 2007, the authorities sat idle instead of coming up with plans to handle such situations better. Lack of safety nets, delay in the arrival of fire engines and other such crucial lapses are classic examples of the governments indifference. Moreover, virtually every old building in Calcutta, especially in places like Sealdah and Park Street, is a death-trap. If the government took adequate safety measures, many such accidents could have been averted. Instead, the government continues to waste precious resources, leaving the people at the mercy of such mishaps.          
	It is indeed a relief that Calcutta is still safe from terrorist attacks. But if a terror strike were to take place in the future, the ministers would probably get busy protecting themselves instead of ensuring citizens safety. Such a sluggish and inept government can be found nowhere else. This is a matter of shame for Bengal as well as for the entire nation.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Amrita Mallik, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The terrible catastrophe at Stephen Court, which claimed a number of lives and ruined many families, shows how rotten the administrative system is in West Bengal. It is unfortunate that even after the building had caught fire, adequate resources were not made available to rescue the victims. The skylift  one of the most effective life-saving equipment  did not arrive on time. The firefighters had not even been handed safety cushions. Had the government been a little more organized in its rescue efforts, a few more lives could have been saved. Moreover, some of the dead bodies lay unattended for more than 24 hours.          
	It was even more appalling that the ministers who visited the spot after the incident left quickly. None of them stayed back to take care of the injured, assist the rescue units or provide mental support to the victims families. The chief minister also paid a brief visit the day after the fire.          
	Nevertheless, in the midst of such misery, it was touching to see people, irrespective of their backgrounds, working together to save the victims. Perhaps this is the real India. The tragedy proved that despite the provocations, ordinary people can stay united in times of crisis. I salute people like Pervez Akhtar who fought the catastrophe braving the risks.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The city has been deeply shocked by the Stephen Court fire. People lost their homes and families, but there was little time to grieve as they had to ensure that their belongings were not robbed during the rescue work. Politicians had been in slumber all this while. But with elections creeping closer, they are using this event to show their love for the people. Even the media forgot about ethics and chose to interview the grieving families. The police and the rescue teams were late as ever. Even after such a gruesome accident, the government has not woken from its slumber. Perhaps a few more incidents such as this will force the authorities out of their sleep. The government has only itself to blame for the tragedy at Stephen Court.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Tragic cycle          
	Sir  West Bengal is caught in the web of dirty politics. The ongoing political violence between the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Trinamul Congress in the districts has claimed many lives. After its impressive performances in two elections, the TMC chief, Mamata Banerjee, and her supporters have started behaving in a rash manner. Banerjee is determined not to cooperate with the ruling party. As a result of her vehement opposition, the Tatas were driven out of Singur. For the time being, the future of industrialization in Bengal looks bleak. Banerjee and her supporters also stood in the way of the governments plans to set up power sub-stations in the state. Recently, Banerjee rejected an invitation by the housing minister, Gautam Deb, to a government function. Hoping to win the 2011 assembly polls, Banerjee has proposed a lot of railway projects for West Bengal, but it remains to be seen whether all of them would materialize. This year, the college elections also witnessed considerable violence between the Students Federation of India and the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad. The saddest part is that common people, too, have to bear the brunt of the continuing violence.          
	Banerjee should keep in mind that if she comes to power in West Bengal, she might have to face similar resistance from the Opposition. If this turmoil continues, West Bengal will never be able to draw any investors. Both the ruling and the opposition parties in the state fail to understand that they have to work in tandem for the betterment of the state. Otherwise, Bengal will lag behind all the other states in the near future.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Private companies and MNCs pay the best salaries. But they also make their employees work long hours. This affects employees productivity. The employees should be spared some time for leisure too, as recreation is important for achieving good results at work. The government should not allow organizations to keep their offices open after 9 pm, unless the nature of the job makes it mandatory for workers to stay behind after the stipulated deadline.          
	Yours faithfully,

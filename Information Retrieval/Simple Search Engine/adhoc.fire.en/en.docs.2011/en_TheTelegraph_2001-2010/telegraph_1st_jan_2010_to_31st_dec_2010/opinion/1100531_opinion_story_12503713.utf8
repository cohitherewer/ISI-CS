	The twin attacks on two Ahmadi mosques in Lahore may appear shocking because of their brutality, but they are no longer surprising. For one, the commando-style operation that the militants employed is now part of a well-established regimen. It has been successfully tried and tested in several recent attacks, even on highly secure and high profile targets such as the police training academy in Manawan near Lahore and the army headquarters in Rawalpindi. With close to a hundred deaths in the latest attack in Lahore, there can be no question about the effectiveness of the mode of attack. As for the reason behind the attack, that too is part of a design which has been evident for a while. The growth of Taliban influence has been directly proportional to the rise of sectarian violence in Pakistan. In fact, it has often been measured by the widening of the sectarian divide in the country. Since the mission of the soldiers of Islam involves purging the land of infidels and non-Muslims, Pakistan has seen a sharp rise in atrocities directed against the minorities  Shias, Mohajirs, Sikhs and, as in this case, the Ahmadis  together with the spread of militancy. The recent attack on the Ahmadis may have been inspired by the Talibans effort to regain initiative after the successive blows from military operations in South Waziristan or by the ulterior motive of keeping the forces away from the western borders.        
	Unfortunately, the experience of brutality is not new to any of the minority communities. It has been a part of their lived experience since the formation of Pakistan. Torn between conflicting notions of community and nationhood, Pakistan has come to define citizenship entirely on the basis of religion, but here too confusion has led it to accord primacy to the majority community of Sunnis and to certain set notions of what constitutes Islam. The result has been a shocking disregard for the rights and freedoms of the minorities which has been institutionalized through laws that deprive people belonging to certain communities of the opportunity to fully participate in the life of the nation. Where the administration itself brands sections as second-class citizens, it cannot do much to discourage malevolence towards them. Without ridding itself of this drawback, Pakistan cannot protect its minorities or hope to control the men who have usurped the right of the State to decide who should inhabit its territory.

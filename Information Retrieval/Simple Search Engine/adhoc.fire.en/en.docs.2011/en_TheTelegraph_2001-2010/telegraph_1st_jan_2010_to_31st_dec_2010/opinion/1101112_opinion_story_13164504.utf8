	Encounters with the past                
	A guide to the heritage of Hyderabad: the natural and the built (Rupa, Rs 495) by Madhu Vottery is a comprehensive guide to the citys heritage structures. Vottery, who is an architect, describes the structures in meticulous detail. In this thorough and well-researched guide to Hyderabad, pictures of the monuments are often accompanied by maps to help travellers locate the buildings. Votterys concern about protecting and conserving the monuments is reassuring; only a few months ago, the iconic Charminar had shed chunks of lime after heavy rains.                        
	Sahibs India: vignettes from the Raj (Penguin, Rs 299) by Pran Neville offers impressionistic accounts of the lives led by the British in India. Most readers will be familiar with the armies of native servants, the splendid darbars, the shikars and the nautch girls. In keeping with academic fashion, Neville also mentions women like Fanny Parks and Emily Eden who recorded their experience of India in the early 19th century. However, the tales about the escapades of Lola Montez and her legendary breasts read like digressions, since most of them are set in Europe. The narrative voice starts off being chatty and conspiratorial but soon becomes what can be described kindly as quaint. Several chapters are spent marvelling at the adultery that was rampant in European circles, and at the ladies flirtings. And Neville is not quoting when he says that Fanny Parks preferred the flowing lines of Indian clothing to the vile, round hats and stiff attire of the European gentlemen. The book is an entertaining read, as long as one does not read too closely.                                  
	Atisa and his time machine: Adventures with Hieun Tsang (Puffin, Rs 175) by Anu Kumar makes contemporary travel seem pass. Kumars latest novel, replete with illustrations by Priya Kurian, is a mad and energetic sequel to Atisa and the Seven Wonders. Having repaired his 5,000-year-old time machine, young Atisa naturally wants to spend the winter break with his mother in seventh-century Central Asia. Instead, he ends up meeting Hieun Tsang, nestled among camels in the Gobi. The famous explorer, who is on his way to India, is the target of a murderous plot. Needless to say, Atisa does a lot more travelling than he had expected.

	If old age is a problem in life, thirty-three years in government is equivalent to senility in politics. There is thus very little surprise in the fact that the Left Front finds itself lost and in steady decline after completing thirty-three years in office in West Bengal. The stridency of power has yielded to the quiet acceptance of losses in elections and erosion of its popularity. Arrogance has reconciled itself to the inevitability of defeat in the not-too-distant future. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), the driving force of the Left Front, can go on believing in the impersonal forces of history as its ideological touchstone but the fact of the matter is that the CPI(M) is the main reason behind the present plight of the left in West Bengal. The CPI(M) led the Left Front to victory in successive elections over three decades. These triumphs carried with them the mandate to bring about major changes and developments in the state. The CPI(M) squandered that mandate by nurturing its vested interests at the cost of developing West Bengal. It blurred the distinction between the party and the government; it destroyed work culture through irresponsible trade unionism; it promoted its own cadre and unions in hospitals and educational institutions; it strangled dissent by the widespread use of terror and violence. Its failure to carry out any economic development in the state is admitted by the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who in an open letter confessed that the industrial sector... took a rear seat in the state. His efforts to assign it a seat in the front row now lie in tatters.        
	The mood in West Bengal, if the results of elections are any indication, is in favour of a change in the political dispensation. Whether this includes a desire for changes in the economy is something that the future will reveal. In the recent past, all political forces in West Bengal have shown a reluctance to support the creation of the conditions necessary for rapid industrialization  the transfer of land from agriculture to industry. Various forms of populism have scuppered this process. The Left Front may not be able to celebrate another anniversary of its term in office but this may not mean that West Bengals tryst with economic development will become any less elusive. The defeat of the state of West Bengal could very well become permanent.

	Rereading Thomas Hardy, Ive come across a phrase that made me wonder just how right I was in asserting recently that by the 19th century all educated people spelt English the same way  Anglo-American differences apart, of course.        
	The phrase, in my 1925ish edition of A Pair of Blue Eyes, was unplummetted ocean. Really? Sure, we double the t to write, say, wetted or regretted, where the stress falls right before the t. But not when it doesnt; eg, coveted or pocketed.        
	Could this be a vagrant Americanism? No. In inflecting some verbs, Americans famously use a single l where we use two: our travelling is their traveling (though even they inflect words like compel, stressed just before the l, into compelling, not -eling). But they dont double up t (except, at times, in benefitted where we have benefited).        
	Maybe Hardy  and/or his proof-readers  had simply erred. Or was this a spelling rare but once acceptable? Theres a far odder Hardyism in Far from the Madding Crowd: Whos farm were you upon last? Indeed? What ever happened to whose? And this is not one of Hardys excursions into quaint peasant speech and therefore spellings.        
	Nor is this an issue of punctuation, which could differ notably in the 19th century from todays usage: Jane Austen, for instance, if she separated some phrase off with a pair of dashes, habitually added a comma after the second dash, as we would not. Even now, one writer often punctuates differently from another. But a comma is indeed mere punctuation, an apostrophe is in practice a piece of spelling.        
	Ive at times met apostrophes from the past where we would not use them today: in hers, for example. The obvious case is from Tennysons poem, The Charge of the Light Brigade: Theirs not to reason why  a spelling which a former editor of mine once repeated, to the loud mockery of his staff when he tried to call the Light Brigade to his aid. But whos is entirely novel to me (except, of course, in the quite different sense of who is).        
	Misplaced apostrophes are legion in Britain these days. Its is very often spelt its. Far odder, by now it is almost normal to shove an apostrophe into plurals, so that, for instance, jets becomes jets, to advertise the courgettes on some vegetable stall. So far, these are usually errors only of the semi-educated, but I wonder for how much longer.        
	One can argue, of course, that it doesnt matter a damn. Whether Hardy wrote unplummetted or unplummeted, whos or whose, any reader knows what he means, and it is not the spelling that makes his novels good or less so. Indeed there are spellings on which no two people will agree, notably when the hyphen rears its head. A shoemaker is indeed a shoemaker, but is, say, Toyota a carmaker, a car-maker or a car maker? I wrote proof-readers higher up; does The Telegraph maybe call its version of them proofreaders, who have therefore sternly corrected what was, to them, my error? (Editor: it does, so they did.) Frankly, why worry?  though any publication or publisher will try to set rules.        
	Yet Im old enough to think that whats well written should be rightly spelt. That very word once brought me proof, across the Atlantic gap, that other people think so too. Id argued that some word should be spelt in such-and-such a way. In shot an American readers letter assuring my editor that to its writer spelt meant a kind of wheat, did we perhaps mean spelled?                    thewordcageyahoo.co.uk

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Change is in the air
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CHANGE IS IN THE AIR                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The hulla gulla, which has become the sole business of the Indian Parliament, has begun to pall and suffocate Indians across the country. The careless and futile waste of many working hours has discredited the political class to such an extent that unexpected surprises are likely in the next general elections. The surprises will shatter all those meticulously crafted and closed-door academic surveys that have been getting hugely disconnected from the mobile changes happening under the surface. The endless analyses, which liberally use caste and other such parameters in their superficial surveys, are missing the underlying changes happening in India and Bharat.         
	At this point in contemporary history, a new and modern generation is genuinely disgusted with this breed of bombastic, uncaring, gas-bag-type politicians, who are vocal about irrelevancies, defend limited personal agendas and are completely inept when it comes to finding radical solutions to sensitive problems that are undermining growth and development. These men and women, carrying unacceptable political baggage and equally untenable formulas for change, need to step back and reflect on the reality. The people of India have been victims of faulty, exclusive and opaque governance, and have experienced grand betrayals. But today, for the first time in decades, there is a real choice ahead of them. Another generation with another methodology, attempting a clean delivery system, will draw the voter regardless of class, caste and faith.                 
	New promise        
	At the cost of losing the first round, the Congress needs to break away from its status-quo position and start anew. India is desperate for dignity and appropriate political operations in the public domain. Patterns of administration and governance have, over the last few decades, insulted the ordinary, law-abiding citizens and turned them into frustrated individuals. Indians living below the poverty line have been neglected and exploited by the State, and lured by militant politics as a last resort to have their voices and demands heard and addressed. Their numbers have snowballed, and the issue has become the single most critical and volatile reality that UPA II is confronted with.        
	Will this government take the bull by its horns or continue to look the other way, hoping that the problem will get buried in the sands of time? Being in perpetual denial, unable to be proactive and creative in the delivery of justice and transparent administration, government servants and politicians alike have mismanaged the system. However, there comes a time in the life of every nation when an active, aspiring generation of young leaders refuses to be manipulated by a few at the top of the vast pile. This is that time.         
	There is a great deal of reorganizing and planning happening at the base. The work is being done silently and with determination. The new leaders are not enticed by the false sparkle of upward social mobility. The phase of political leaders attempting to become socialites is starting to wane. It is only the political lightweights who are now being seen regularly in the glitzy party circus that has overtaken the once gracious and stylish Delhi.         
	The fresh minds in active politics will lose some and gain some as they move towards consolidating the changing ethic. Older leaders will dissuade those at the helm from supporting the change, realizing that their days are numbered. The alphabet and language of politics are being re-established. The priorities are shifting. The new demands are infused with vitality and energy. The goals are straightforward and clear. Mechanisms of delivery have to evolve and that in itself will reorder India.

	Up in flames    
	Sir  As reported in The Telegraph on March 26, the chief minister has made a very candid admission that there has been collusion among builders and officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and other agencies in connection with the development of buildings in the city (Vicious circle: CM speaks, CM sleeps, CM wakes up, March 26). Now that the chief of the state has admitted this fact, I think it is very pertinent that, as the captain of the state, he appoints a committee of impartial experts, not politicians, who should have the authority to go into the facts on how several buildings in Calcutta have been built violating the building laws. The committee should also examine the safety standards and whether these have been violated. I think if the Left Front government wants to improve its battered image after the recent tragedy, where 33 innocent persons lost their lives for no fault of their own, it is essential that the chief minister takes firm action by appointing a committee and giving a specific date by which it should report. The committee should have full powers to go into all the papers of the CMC and other agencies, particularly with regard to the buildings built in the last 10 or 15 years in Calcutta.          
	I wish the chief minister will act swiftly.          
	Yours faithfully,      
G.K. Bhagat, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The recent fire on Park Street and the abysmal crisis management indicate a complete failure of the administrative machinery in West Bengal (Left in lurch, people leap to death, March 24). Not only was the fire brigade slow to react, but equipment needed to combat the fire was also stored in distant parts of the city. To cover up for a lack of effective leadership, there is now a heated blame game between authorities and a volley of theories to defend inaction on their part.          
	In the wake of the tragedy, emotions are running high. For a while, there will be heated debates on television channels, articles in newspapers and possibly demonstrations expressing outrage. Monetary compensation for the survivors will be announced, investigative committees set up, and lofty promises made. Once the furore subsides, things will go back to what they were. Calcuttans will forgive and forget. All flaws in the administrative machinery will be accepted. This is the greatness of the city: come what may, nothing can disturb our slumber.          
	Yours faithfully,        Amar Lahirimajumdar, Calcutta            
	Sir  Since the fire services minister, Pratim Chatterjee, has refused to resign from his post, saying he is not a thief or a robber, it is recommended that he be sacked (Cry in House for Pratims scalp, March 24). When you have a special ministry for fire services, and firemen are not provided with basic tools such as safety nets, bodysuits and smoke masks, the head of the ministry is guilty of a much graver crime than theft or robbery.           
	The fire services minister has blamed the wooden staircases in Stephen Court for spreading the fire. There are a number of buildings in the city with similar staircases and almost all old buildings have wooden beams. What steps has the ministry taken to prevent fires in such houses?           
	The CMC is rife with corruption and equally responsible for fire hazards. It has given indiscriminate approval to buildings, with no regard for regulations. How is it possible that the additional two floors in Stephen Court, which obstructed the common terrace that connected all four blocks of the building, were sanctioned in 1984? Residents of such buildings are also to be blamed for neglecting to take appropriate precautions against fire, despite being aware of the hazards.           
	Yours faithfully,      
J.K. Bubna, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  Even with the most sophisticated fire safety measures, fires cannot be avoided. Only the impact of such disasters can be minimized if the fire brigade acts swiftly. Unfortunately, in our city, it is always late to reach the spot.The number of casualties in the Park Street fire could have been much lower had the rescue operation started in time. Incidentally, the fire brigade is stationed just minutes away from Stephen Court.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj Bagri, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I am not in the habit of going for morning walks but, by some coincidence, I happened to be walking past Stephen Court with a friend at eight in the morning of that fateful day. It is hard to believe that the catastrophe happened just hours later. Every time I walked through Park Street, I would admire the Stephen Court building. On the morning of the fire, I remember my friend remarked that it was one of the most beautiful buildings in the city.           
	This is the worst thing that has happened to Park Street since the explosion at McDonalds in 2007. The next time I pass by Stephen Court, I know I will be looking for traces of the tragedy. The flames have succeeded in obliterating the beauty of the building from my mind.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Gaurab Chatterjee, Calcutta

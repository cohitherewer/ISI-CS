The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In the beginning was not the word
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN THE BEGINNING WAS NOT THE WORD                                                                  
	What is a public library all about? It is about books, of course. But the true essence of a public library lies in the need to share books. The method of sharing has to be accompanied by the process of collecting books and caring for them. The National Library in Calcutta has the most extensive collection of books, journals and periodicals in the country. Yet a visit to the National Library may not always be pleasurable for a book-lover.        
	People who use the library often find it difficult to get hold of a book in the first place. Adris Biswas, a researcher in popular literature at Jadavpur University, said that the problem is not always the non-availability of books, but the ignorance of most staff members about where a particular book could be found  It can take [them] up to two hours to find a single book. And when the reader gets the desired book at last, he may not be able to find a quiet place to read it in. Jishnu Dasgupta, a research student at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, complained that he has been disturbed more than once by staff members talking on the phone inside the library.        
	Handling of books, especially the rare ones, is another problem. The Rare Books section has books that are very old, and therefore fragile. Frequent visitors to this section often find these books in a bad shape. Biswas said he found the rare and valuable Battala books in the Ramdas Sen collection carelessly tied with strings. Despite the fact that the librarys collection is of international standards, it often fails to fulfil the readers needs. Many books are already torn, some are in such a bad condition that they cannot even be photocopied, he said.        
	An effective way to preserve old and fragile books is to digitize them. The National Library has started the process of digitization since 1999, but according to a library employee, the process is moving at snails pace. He said that while funding is not the issue, the absence of a clear-cut policy is. Moreover, the task of digitizing the huge number of books is being undertaken by personnel who do not have the minimum technical knowledge  it is our handicap. There are no centralized standard procedures, no technical policies, he admitted. He also said that the library is definitely understaffed.        
	Why has the library not been able to recruit properly trained personnel to handle the digitization process? Why do staff members at the library, except a few, lack the expertise to find and handle books? And why is the library understaffed, despite having sufficient funds? A library needs to be manned and run by book-lovers. This is hardly the case as far as the National Library is concerned. The reason, it seems, is the politicization of cultural institutions that has now become the hallmark of Bengal.        
	To be fair, some progress has been made. The library has been shifted to a new building with better infrastructure, availability of books has improved, and books are being digitized at last. But is this progress sufficient? I wish the library is made more reader-friendly, and books are digitized faster, said Sraman Mukherjee, a post-doctoral fellow at the CSSSC. Is this too much to ask of the largest library in the country?                    ADHEESHA SARKAR

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WASTE LAND                                                    
	Patience is a virtue, unless it is a Calcuttans patience. Another day wasted for most people in the city, as in the state, is just part of routine. Almost as though it is ordained by nature, like a cyclone or flood. The point, of course, is that it is not a cyclone or a flood that is stopping work and movement, but a group of political parties led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in protest against the rise in prices. It is an all-India bandh, predicted to be fully effective only in West Bengal. Besides, the Trinamul Congress, in headlong opposition with the Left Front, has a lot of points to prove in that same unhappy state. The citizens of West Bengal are not only patient to the point of inertia, but they are also used to great expectations of unpleasant excitement. But so deep-seated is the culture of protest through the stoppage of work that the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist), along with a few other parties, has called a bandh on this same day, without supporting the CPI(M)-led bandh. The issue, though, is that of rising prices. This one  a mental microscope may distinguish it from the CPI(M)-led bandh  accuses the Left Front of not having used its powers as a state government to correct the price-rise. But the day of work stoppage is the same, the logic of that being closer to that of the world beyond Alices rabbit-hole than anything in the unexciting workaday world. This mind-boggling imbroglio is made still more amazing by the fact that the SUCI(C) is the Trinamul Congresss electoral partner. The latter is committed to opposing the Left-led bandh; how is it going to separate the wheat from the chaff?        
	All of this could have been just an exhausting joke, had it not meant the wastage of another day of work, another prolonged violation of civic rights, further hours of harassment for the acutely ill and those who tend them, another empty day for the daily wage-earner. It may be relevant from the point of view of man-hours and productive energy wasted to recall that the week preceding the bandh has been one of protests, dharnas and processions campaigning for municipal election candidates, holding up traffic and commuters for hours on end. Not a single party is innocent. In this city of protests, it is ironic that the citizens have not found a way to protest against protests. Maybe they do not want to. That is when patience becomes a vice.

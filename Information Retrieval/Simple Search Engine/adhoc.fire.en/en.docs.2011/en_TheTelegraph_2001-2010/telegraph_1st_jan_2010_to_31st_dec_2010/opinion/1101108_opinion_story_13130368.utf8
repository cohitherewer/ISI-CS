	Sometimes we have to be grateful for small mercies. The deal on biodiversity that more than 190 countries recently agreed on in Nagoya, Japan, was a day late and a dollar short. But its better than nothing, and even better than most people expected.        
	Technically, it was only the 10th biennial conference of the parties that signed the Convention on Biological Diversity 18 years ago. But it was not just another meeting. It was a serious effort to move past rhetoric and come to grips with how to stop the slow-motion catastrophe of species extinction. The most important target set by the Strategic Plan 2011-2020 will increase the area of protected land in the world from 12.5 per cent to 17 per cent.        
	Thats almost half the land that should really remain untouched if nature is to go on producing the ecosystem services that keep our environment relatively stable. Its a dollar short, of course: we will ultimately have to give 40 per cent of the land surface of the planet back to nature if we really want long-term stability, but its a good start.        
	Even more importantly, the strategic plan will increase the protected area of the oceans from only 1 per cent to 10 per cent by 2020. If that is done in the right places, it would create no-fishing-allowed marine reserves big enough to allow the many endangered fish populations time and space to recover.        
	The other big achievement of the conference is a deal that promises governments in the developing world, and also indigenous peoples in those countries, fair payment for genetic material that ends up in highly profitable first-world crops and drugs. There are also useful measures to protect life in wetlands, forests, freshwater systems and coastal zones  and the financing to pay for it.        
	This is particularly encouraging after the climate change conference in Copenhagen last year ended in a complete train-wreck, for the climate change convention is the long-lost twin of the biodiversity treaty. Maintaining the stable, benign climate of the past 10,000 years is critical to the well-being of a global civilization that now numbers almost seven billion human beings  but so is preserving the web of life that underpins that climate.                
	Wasted decade        
	The climate change treaty was intended to tackle the key issue of global warming, but scientists and even lay people were beginning to understand that everything joins up. About 40 per cent of human greenhouse gas emissions, for example, come from forestry and agriculture, and those same activities are decimating or destroying the living species, many of them microscopic, whose interactions maintain the environment we live in.        
	But nothing much happened after the signature of the biodiversity convention. The rainforests of the Amazon, the Congo and Indonesia continued to be cut down, the worlds fisheries drifted closer to collapse, and though many deplored the neglect, no government did anything about it. After a good start in the 1990s, the climate change accord also stalled after the United States of America began actively sabotaging the talks under President George W. Bush.        
	Now the world is emerging from that wasted decade, and all sorts of things that were put on hold at the height of the terrorist panic, or just postponed because the US wouldnt play, are back on the agenda. Not always with instant success, as Copenhagen amply demonstrated, but real progress is possible again  and the treaty in Nagoya is proof of that.        
	You probably expected me to write about the two little explosive packets found aboard cargo aircraft last week, because thats so much more exciting than the fate of the planet. But everybody else is doing that, and there really isnt much new to say about it anyway. Apart from the observation that a civilization that thinks the biggest threat it faces is terrorism is a dangerously deluded civilization.

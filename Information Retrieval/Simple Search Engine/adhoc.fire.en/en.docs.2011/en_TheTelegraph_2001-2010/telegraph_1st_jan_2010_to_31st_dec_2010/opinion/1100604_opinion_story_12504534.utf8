	Blot on the shine                  
	Sir  In the light of the recent controversy surrounding the distortion of records concerning the Kargil war, it might be pointed out that a number of misdemeanours among army officers have now been revealed (Wrong history, wronged officer, May 27). The goings-on have tarnished the image of the army, which was renowned for its integrity, impartial judgment and rigorous discipline. It is now up to the concerned authorities to restore the past glory of the army and render it free of corruption. To begin with, the errors in recording the history of Operation Vijay should be corrected, Devinder Singhs contribution in the war recognized and the man felicitated.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjit Singh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The editorial, Doctoring the past (May 29), contends that the Indian army is reluctant to make public the details of the Henderson Brooks report, which records the reverses suffered by the country during the Sino-Indian conflict of 1962. It seems more likely, however, that the Centre is unwilling to publish the details, since they would expose the blunders committed Jawaharlal Nehru, the former army chief, B.M Kaul, and V.K. Krishna Menon.          
	The political leadership was also diffident about engaging in an armed conflict with Pakistan during the war in 1965. However, the then prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, eventually gave the army and the air force full authority to launch an offensive. It was a decision that worked to Indias advantage. All the facts of the 1965 war have still not been made public, and it appears that the Centre is reluctant to do so.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It took almost 11 years for the truth about the Kargil infiltration to see the light of day. However, all discerning and objective observers must have been aware that there was something amiss in the facts about Kargil. The war seems to have been a ploy of the government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee to ensure a victory in the elections that followed the crisis.          
	Vested interests could also explain the reticence of the military top brass and intelligence personnel, who allowed the infiltration to reach critical proportions before they made it known. By the time it became known, the gravity of the situation was such that it took a prolonged conflict and the loss of hundreds of lives to beat back the infiltrators. If, as some people have alleged, such a war was actually fought just to fulfil the selfish political agenda of the party in power, it is indeed a great tragedy.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir - It was shocking to learn that the records of the Kargil war were distorted to suit the personal agenda of senior officers in the army. It is even more disturbing to learn that Devinder Singh, who reportedly sustained injuries in the war and has since retired from the army, had lodged a complaint within a year of the war. But nothing had come of it till now.           
	For the citizens of India, it would seem that none of the countrys institutions can be depended upon. Army officers are accused of land scams and of tampering with records. Judges are reported to be involved in corruption and there is no end to the charges that are levelled against Indias politicians. In most cases, there is very little that is done to bring the offenders to book.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Othello Mazoomdaar, Barasat 

                
	Sir  The recent furore over the case of Devinder Singh will, undoubtedly, open a Pandoras box as far as the Indian army is concerned. Many other army documents are bound to come under the scanner. There are people other than Singh whose contributions remain unacknowledged. These men also fought the enemy against tremendous odds and under extremely inhospitable conditions.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Sunil Pradhan, Nuapada, Orissa

                
	Sir  The army has been riddled with scandal in recent times. There was the Sukna land scam, and senior army officers were also accused of siphoning away food and liquor supplies for sale in the market. The latest instance of documents being tampered is shocking. Not only does the incident damage the armys morale, but it also brings back traumatic memories of the Kargil war.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

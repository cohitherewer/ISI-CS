	Free at last                  
	Sir  At a time when Islamic fundamentalism is on the rise, the Dhaka high courts ruling that no woman in Bangladesh should be made to wear the burqa against her wish is heartening (Burqa freedom in Bangladesh, Oct 5). Many in Bangladesh may object to this judgment. But they should remember that the Quran does not mention anywhere that the burqa is compulsory for women. Such matters are left to ones own interpretation. All that the Quran says in this context relates to the need to maintain the modesty of men as well as of women. While the hijab (veil) is fard (obligatory) for women, the niqab (veil which covers the entire face except the eyes) is only mustahabb (recommended  something one loves to do for the sake of Allah), as is the advice for men to wear caps or to grow beards.          
	While Islamic scholars have divergent views on the hijab and the niqab, the four major Sunni schools of thought hold that the entire body of the woman, except her face and hands, is awrah. Awrah denotes those parts of the body that are not meant to be exposed. In short, one may say that Muslim women (according to the Quran, Sunnah and Hadith Sahih Bukhari) should not wear dresses which are revealing, so that they do not attract the attention of the opposite sex. One must keep in mind here that no religion asks women to be scantily-clad. Men are also told to dress decently.           
	Moreover, it has often been observed that terrorists have used the burqa to their advantage to carry out militant activities. The best example of this can be found in the siege of Lal Masjid and the adjoining Jamia Hafsa Madrasah in Islamabad in July 2007. Maulana Abdul Aziz, one of the terrorists who led the siege, was captured by the army of the then Pakistan president, Pervez Musharraf, while he was trying to escape disguised as a woman in burqa.          
	Muslim countries should take a cue from the Dhaka high court judgment. If women are forced to wear the burqa, they might demand that men should also dress in accordance with the Shariat, leading to a never-ending debate. However, women who prefer to wear the burqa or the niqab should not be prevented from doing so.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Not again           
	Sir  I have been engaged in research on elephant ecology in north Bengal for the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science. We have been conducting radio-telemetry, and studying elephant-human conflict, elephant corridors, and population demography in this region since 2001. The report, Jumbo alerts were absent, cry railways (Sept 24), quotes the divisional railway manager of the Northeast Frontier Railway, Alipurduar division, S.N. Singh, as saying that the spot where the train accident, which killed seven elephants on September 22, took place is not among the ten identified elephant corridors. Such a statement is unfortunate.           
	The railways have always been told by the forest department that there are many elephant corridors besides the ten identified ones. There are more than 50 places in the stretch between Alipurduar and Siliguri junction that elephants pass through frequently. But then, elephants may use any area of the forest. As such, it is necessary for train drivers to negotiate the stretch between Alipurduar and Siliguri very carefully from start to finish. I have a few suggestions as to how accidents can be avoided in this area. First, if possible, trains should not be allowed to run at night. Second, the driver should have a full frontal view. Third, there should be a good communication system in the trains so that the forest department staff and the railway patrol can exchange information prior to the trains passage through the forests.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The president of the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad, John Barla, has objected to the state governments proposal to ask the Union minister, Jairam Ramesh, to request the Indian Railways to stop trains from plying in the stretch between Siliguri and Alipurduar at night (Rameshs jumbo scan visit on Oct. 2, Sept 29). Barla forgets that the Siliguri-Alipurduar route is not utilized to its full capacity. It would make no difference to the people of the Dooars if a few night trains, which are anyway mostly freight trains, are stopped between 6 pm and 6 am. I think that the chief ministers suggestion to halt night trains and run day trains at a slower speed is quite sensible.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Nelson A. Petrie, Siliguri

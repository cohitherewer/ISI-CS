The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Too optimistic
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TOO OPTIMISTIC                                                    
	Reading the Economic Survey 2009-10 is akin to recalling Noam Chomskys idea that optimism is a strategy for creating a better future. The survey said that double-digit economic growth is achievable in the next four years; the economic recovery in India from the slowdown following the global financial crisis has been broad-based, and is therefore on a sound footing. The finance ministry seems to have taken heart from recent data like the Central Statistical Organisations advance estimates that put gross domestic product growth for 2009-10 at 7.2 per cent, signalling the return to pre-crisis levels of economic growth. So confident is the survey that it recommends the government begin a calibrated exit from the fiscal stimulus packages introduced as a response to the effects of the global crisis. The survey seems to have taken the possibility of achieving 9 per cent GDP growth as almost inevitable; given the circumstances, that attitude may be a little worrying. The road to serious fiscal consolidation is a hard and rocky one, and may prove to be a medium-term challenge  meaning three or four years  rather than a short-term one. While the seeming independence of the Indian economy from global conditions is cause for cheer, India is not an island but a peninsula that can still be buffeted by global shocks. The markets are still dependent on foreign capital inflows whose continuity in changing circumstances is not a sure bet.        
	GDP growth in the last few years has been driven strongly by the services sector, and that may well continue. But taxes from this sector are minuscule when compared to taxes from manufacturing. While manufacturing may have grown faster than services in 2009-10, that may not persist. And as the survey noted, investment growth is lower than GDP growth just now, so a larger quantum of indirect taxes may not materialize. The alternative is to reduce expenditure which will mean reduction of subsidies, an issue with political minefields. Thus, tax revenue growth, a necessity for improving fiscal health, is not likely to ramp up very soon. The survey also notes that export growth is fragile, and in all likelihood, net exports will be a negative number which will lower the GDP growth numbers too. Thus, the growth estimates need to be reviewed. Lots of people become pessimists from financing optimists.

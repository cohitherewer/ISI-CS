	Food for thought                  
	Sir  Rise in food prices will continue unchecked unless there is a significant increase in food production and administrative measures to stop manipulation of prices by hoarders and profiteers. It is of utmost importance to extend the Green Revolution to the eastern states where there are ample opportunities to increase food production (Seeds of revolution, Feb 27). One recalls the first Green Revolution, which took place in northern India in the Sixties.          
	While it is debatable if Rs 400 crore is enough to finance a Green Revolution in six states, the chief problem in this case is that the size of the landholdings of poor farmers in the eastern states is small in comparison to that of their counterparts in prosperous states like the Punjab and Haryana. It will not be easy to apply new technologies on small pieces of land.          
	Bold, new innovations are needed to solve this problem. The innovations can be implemented in one village as a pilot project and then extended to other villages. Panchayats can play a big role in such schemes. The project could be instrumental not only in curbing food prices but also in generating employment in rural areas more effectively than the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. If this project is successful, people from villages will not have to travel great distances for employment anymore.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The growing public furore over the astronomical rise in the prices of food products has been aggravated by the additional burden of transport charges due to increase in fuel prices (Bid to free foodgrain exports, March 5). However, in a country where a large chunk of the total food produce is wasted due to vermin attack, bad storage facilities and an inefficient distribution system, inflation and a marginal rise in transport costs are but minor factors.          
	Another major reason for the scarcity of food is the strong-arm tactics employed by political parties. The Forward Bloc, for instance, that derives a considerable part of its support from middlemen, is virulently opposed to large business houses running an efficient distribution system that would benefit producers as well as consumers. The middlemen who support the Forward Bloc have siphoned off huge amounts of money through their control over the distribution system.          
	Meanwhile, ration shops have not been allowed to function properly by any of the political parties. A couple of years ago, angry villagers in West Bengal set fire to the houses of ration shop dealers. The episode revealed a history of corruption and nexus between dealers and the ruling political party. Resources meant for distribution among the poorest of the poor were being diverted.          
	When large amounts of food are wasted through callousness and corruption, price rise and transport costs can make little difference for us.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Wrong battle          
	Sir  Shyamal Dattas article on the Maoist problem,The battle for peace, alongside the war on violence (March 11), contains analysis and recommendations that have been doing the rounds for years but have not been implemented.          
	To begin with, the Maoist problem is essentially a socio-economic issue, a result of Indias lack of progress in its human development index. Funds meant for development are continually misused by the states as well as by the Centre. Political leaders have been shrewd enough to present the Maoist threat as a law-and-order problem, ensuring that security forces bear the brunt of it while the looting of funds continues unchecked. Deprived villagers have turned to violence as a last resort.          
	Another reason for the conflagrations is the abysmal Indian intelligence system, which is never asked to account for its failures. It would be advisable to appoint a cabinet rank minister for intelligence, at the Centre as well as at the states, who would be answerable to the Central and state legislative assemblies.          
	Yours faithfully,         Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta              
	Sir  It was heartening to read that K.P.S. Gill had been consulted on how to deal with the Maoist problem (Gills pill: Make up your mind, Feb 28) . It is becoming increasingly evident that the Indian Maoists have the support of their counterparts in Nepal and possibly even in Beijing. What is surprising is that Maoism in India is growing despite rapid progress and development.          
	The top leadership of the Naxalites is mainly from Andhra Pradesh, where they have been quelled by the tough measures adopted by the state police. Security forces in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and West Bengal need the same kind of expertise to withstand the onslaught of Naxal veterans from Andhra Pradesh. The representative nature of the Indian Maoists is also suspect. It is doubtful whether they actually uphold tribal interests.          
	Yours faithfully,

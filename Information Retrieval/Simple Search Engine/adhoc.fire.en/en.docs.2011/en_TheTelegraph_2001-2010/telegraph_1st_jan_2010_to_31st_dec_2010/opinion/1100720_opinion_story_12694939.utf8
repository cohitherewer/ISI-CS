	The reports about the destruction of records pertaining to the 1971 war have failed to elicit any response from the Indian army or ministry of defence. These records were apparently shredded months after the war by the eastern army command. The armys stance on this question underscores its indifference to, not to say disdain for, its own past. History has evidently ceased to matter to the Indian military. The war, however, remains an issue of tremendous contemporary importance in Bangladesh. The history and memory of that conflict continue to shape the structure and texture of Bangladeshs politics and society. The link between the past and the present can be seen most clearly in the ongoing trial of those implicated in acts during the 1971 conflict that amount to crimes against humanity.        
	The trial is aimed at individuals who actively collaborated with the Pakistan army in its brutal efforts to snuff out the movement for an independent Bangladesh. These measures had exacted a colossal humanitarian toll, resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians, the rape of thousands of women and the displacement of millions. A list of alleged war criminals compiled by the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee  a private research organization that has been working on this issue for nearly two decades  identifies 1,150 individuals. Back in 1971, many of them had been associated with the Jamaat-e-Islami (which opposed independence) and its affiliates, the student body called the Islami Chhatra Sangh and the paramilitary outfits, Al-Badr, Al-Shams, and the Razakar.         
	The Jamaat-e-Islamis political standing has since been resurrected. In 2001, it was invited to join a coalition government led by Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Unsurprisingly, supporters of the BNP and the Jamaat have challenged the necessity and validity of the trial. The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, is, by all accounts, determined to move ahead. Her party, the Awami League, not only promised a trial in its election manifesto but also considers the exercise as part of the unfinished agenda of the liberation struggle. The Jamaat, on its part, asserts that the trial is nothing but political vendetta. Its approach is best understood as one of establishing innocence by dissociation. Had there been specific allegations, it argues, there would have been trials in the past 38 years. The mere fact that these did not occur attests the innocence of Jamaat cadre who are being maliciously tarred with the brush of war crimes.              
	To cut through the smoke-screen of evasion and propaganda put about by the Jamaat, it is essential to revisit the historical reasons for the delay in holding these trials. The issue of war crimes initially encompassed Pakistani soldiers (in the joint custody of Bangladesh and India) as well as their collaborators. As early as January 1, 1972, the interim government of Bangladesh decided to create a genocide investigation commission. The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman repeatedly affirmed its intention to bring to justice all individuals culpable of these grisly crimes. As a first step, the Collaborators (Special Tribunal) Order of 1972 was promulgated. Under this order, over 37,000 individuals were arrested and the trials of 2,842 were completed. Subsequently, as a measure to effect national reconciliation, Mujib proclaimed a general amnesty in November, 1973. This acquitted those accused of petty crimes, but specifically excluded collaborators who were charged with serious offences such as rape, murder and arson.        
	During this period, the Bangladesh government was also considering war-crime trials of Pakistani army officers. The initial list comprised 400 officers; it was subsequently brought down to 195 against whom the government had collected irrefutable evidence. The possibility of these trials was naturally a major source of friction between Dhaka and Islamabad. But the issue was enmeshed with other outstanding disputes between the two countries. The tackling of these proved particularly difficult because Pakistan refused to recognize Bangladesh, and hence the negotiations had to be routed through India. Apart from war-crime trials and the issue of recognition, the thicket of disputes included the repatriation of 93,000 prisoners of war in Indian custody but held jointly by India and Bangladesh, the repatriation of Bangladeshi civilians stranded in Pakistan, and vice versa.         
	Following the Simla Agreement of July 1972, India was, in principle, open to repatriating the PoW to Pakistan, but insisted that it could not be done without the concurrence of Bangladesh. Mujib and his government were clear that this could happen only if Pakistan recognized the state of Bangladesh. Then, too, those charged with war crimes would not be sent back. The Pakistani president, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, played his cards carefully. From his standpoint, the delay in repatriation of PoW was not entirely problematic. It kept down the morale of the Pakistan army, and so enabled him to strengthen his grip over the polity. But acquiescing in the trial of senior officials in Bangladesh would be tantamount to signing a political suicide note. Bhutto responded by erecting obstacles in Bangladeshs road to seeking international recognition. He prevailed upon the Chinese to veto Bangladeshs entry to the United Nations, and upon important Muslim countries like Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia to withhold their recognition.        
	Faced with Pakistani intransigence on the issues of recognition and civilian repatriation, Mujib decided to announce the trial of the 195 Pakistani army personnel. New Delhi took a pragmatic stance. It reminded Dhaka that the trials could further complicate relations with Pakistan and generate concern in the international community. To allay these, it was important that the Bangladesh government also announce the legal framework of the trial. On civilian repatriation, India was of the view that Dhaka should set aside its precondition of recognition and treat it as a humanitarian issue. The upshot of these consultations was two-fold. Bangladesh brought into force the International War Crimes (Tribunals) Act in July, 1973. It also reached an agreement with India, allowing the latter to negotiate on its behalf the exchange of civilians with Pakistan.         
	In the ensuing negotiations, Bhutto came out firmly against war- crime trials. According to the official record he told the Indian delegation, So far as prisoners of war are concerned you can throw the whole lot in the Ganges, but I cannot agree to the trials. If Bangladesh did proceed with the trials, he would be forced to charge 203 Bengali civilian officials in Pakistan with espionage and high treason. If Mujib was reasonable, he could not only recognize Pakistan, but could ask China to drop the veto.               
	The Indians suggested to their counterparts in Bangladesh that the trials be postponed to facilitate the resolution of the other issues. By this time, the issue of international recognition, especially entry to the UN, was playing heavily on Mujibs mind. Equally troubling was the possibility of reprisal trials by Pakistan. In August, 1973, he assented to an agreement between India and Pakistan for the repatriation of PoW and civilian internees, suspending the issue of trials. Eventually a tripartite agreement was concluded whereby those accused of war crimes were sent back to Pakistan.         
	Mujib received an undertaking from Bhutto that these individuals would be tried in Pakistan. These, of course, never took place. By the time the Bangladesh government reverted its focus to trials of its own nationals, Mujib and his senior associates had been assassinated. The new regime at once revoked the collaborators order and suspended any movement on the trials. It also initiated an insidious rehabilitation of those who had opposed the liberation struggle. This process culminated in the BNP- Jamaat coalition government 25 years later.        
	The ongoing trials, then, can be described as the resumption of a quest for justice that was short-circuited. Supporters of the trials rightly feel that only by confronting the harrowing past can the countrys democratic present and future be secured. Now, more than ever, the history of the 1971 conflict does matter.

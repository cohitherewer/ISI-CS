The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The humble masterpiece that stuck on
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE HUMBLE MASTERPIECE THAT STUCK ON                                  Thirty years after the Post-It Note hit the market, ways of forgetting and remembering remain as fascinating as ever                                             
	Ickylickystick (the word is from Joyce) they are not, and yet they have managed to stick around after their own fashion. They come, most commonly, in the form of three-inch squares of canary yellow. And they turn 30 this year.        
	Post-It Notes, those ubiquitous missives so many of us send to ourselves every day, most often as reminder of some future chore, are perhaps the most disposable objects around us. As aids to memory, these bits of coloured paper are incredibly handy. Although repositories of valuable information, they are, in themselves, quite ephemeral, instantly dispensable once their purpose is served.        
	Indeed, a firmly utilitarian streak marks the the origin of the Post-It Note itself. In 1968, Spencer Silver, working at the corporate research laboratory of the American stationers, 3M, came up with a unique low-tack adhesive that practically left no mark on surfaces. He wanted to market the glue for commercial purposes, in the form of a spray that could be used to stick notices on bulletin boards. However, his bosses adamantly refused to see any merit in his idea.        
	Meanwhile, unknown to Silver, one of his colleagues, with the unlikely name of Art Fry, was having difficulties at his other job as a choir singer at the local church. Every time Fry opened his hymnal, its pages marked with bits of paper to help him find the songs on the days programme, the bookmarks would slip away, causing much embarrassment to the stalled singer.        
	Preoccupied with such challenges, as Fry fidgeted through a rather boring presentation by Silver one day, he had a Eureka moment. Suddenly, the perfect use for Silvers long-neglected wonder glue dawned on Fry. He suggested that the adhesive be put on small strips of paper intended as reusable bookmarks. Still the idea was not really a hit with business strategists, who never expected people to pay for such a nave contraption. But after a few tentative experiments, in which samples distributed among the 3M staff and the local people proved to be a great success, the product was formally launched in 1980. The rest is history.        
	Although 3M is somewhat secretive about the profit it makes from Post-It, there is no doubt that the product is hugely popular. To give a modest estimate, according to a New York Times report, the NPD Group, which studies retail trends, claimed that the category known as self-stick notes, which is dominated by Post-It Notes, accounted for $106 million in sales at office superstores like Staples between June 2006 and May 2007, a 13.5 per cent increase from the year before. The figures seem even more astonishing if you consider that the market is already full of far more sophisticated aids to memory, thanks to modern information technology. Post-It Notes can offer no real competition to personal organizers, handheld devices and laptops that come with in-built To-Do Lists and Tasks folders. And yet most workstations at offices continue to be cluttered with tiny slips of paper with urgent little memos scribbled on them.        
	The beauty of the Post-It Note lies in its power to establish a sense of intimacy, however fragile, even for a fleeting moment. You can only scribble, scrawl or sketch on it  and through such an action you must necessarily leave behind a trace of yourself for the recipient of your message. The impression left behind by a living hand, the imperfect curves and curlicues of words formed with pen on paper, retain a far more vividly personal touch than what may be conveyed through a set of words typed out in a severely neat font on a text message or email. Even better, you can turn your Post-Its into miniature site-specific installations. Angry mothers can leave terse reminders on their offsprings bedroom door to Tidy up! Teenagers can stick notes to the bathroom mirror pleading with their parents for something special, knowing all too well that their demands cannot be missed if placed with strategic cunning.        
	The seemingly innocuous Post-It also has its own aura of quaint thrill. Habitual Post-It users are secretly delighted by the covert exhibitionism that oozes out of the papery trail they leave all over the house. Artists have had a field day with Post-Its. R.B. Kitajs sketch on one such note fetched 640 at an auction. Rebecca Murtaugh covered her entire bedroom with Post-Its of different colours  yellow for objects that mattered less to her, such as the walls, and bright fluorescent hues for more precious things, like her bed.         
	In 2004, Paola Antonelli, the head of design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, included Post-It Notes at a show called Humble Masterpieces. Thanks to Post-It Notes, compulsive scribblers of the world, archivists of everyday aches and pains, angsty existentialists can now have their own special exhibition of emotions or build their private museum of mystery and mundanity about the house.        
	From impersonal instructions to kinky pillow talk to tragic heartbreaks, the Post-It Note has been one of the most prolific receptacles of memory in the modern world. Confidences, confessions, curt one-liners, it has absorbed all into itself, only to have them committed to oblivion.

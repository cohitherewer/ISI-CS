The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An easel for a camera
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AN EASEL FOR A CAMERA                          - The changing life of a war photographer					 					      Malavika Karlekar                                                      
	Do you think that you can photograph and think at the same time? asked Ivo Markovic of Andrs Faulques, the hardened war-photographer-turned-artist. Faulques did not give him a direct answer but replied that he wished he could kill him instead. Ironical, as Markovic had sought Faulques out with the very same intention, retribution for publishing a photograph that changed the Croatians life irrevocably. Spanish author Arturo Prez-Revertes The Painter of Battles, its morbidity riveting, compels the reader to try and understand what made a top-class photographer of destruction a recluse in an abandoned castle on a cliff. He spent his days painting an enormous mural of battles seen, imagined and viewed in endless European galleries. His laborious exercise in personal expiation was rudely interrupted by Markovic who announced that he had spent years in trying to understand his enemy, meeting persons who knew him, visiting places he had frequented, and, of course, poring over his photographs. He needed to know all about his unwitting tormentor before he could kill him.         
	The photograph of Ivo Markovic was one of the many visual documents of inhuman destruction that Faulques had taken in his past life. Perhaps he would not have remembered him had the photograph not been on the cover of Newszoom and won him an award. Markovic reminded Faulques of the day when the latter chanced upon him  a frightened new recruit, facing Serbian tanks. The visual went on to win an award, but of course, the acclaimed photographer did not know the name of the man who had brought him fame.               
	Markovic reminded Faulques of how that photograph led him to be later recognized on a bus ambushed by Serbs and, as a symbol of Croatian separatism, to be tortured for six months. Like an animal. When Markovic was miraculously released, he began a search for his Serbian wife and son who had remained on in his home town. The photograph had given Ivo an infamy as well among some who did not care for him  or were perhaps jealous  and it was not long before a group of marauding Chetniks were led to his house; his wife was raped, mutilated and killed and his five-year-old son bayoneted as he cried in protest. From then on, it became Markovics lifes mission to find Faulques.         
	And Faulques continued his gory assignments photographing humans in agony with mechanical precision with hardly a thought to their willingness or otherwise to be on view for a world revelling in sensation and gore. With the skill of a knowing raconteur, Prez-Reverte, who had been a war correspondent for over two decades, narrates horrific tales of torture and destruction as Faulques goes to the Lebanon, Somalia, El Salvador, Iraq, Israel, and among Sahrawi guerrillas  almost every major theatre of war had beckoned him. When at work, it was almost as though Faulques was all searing ambition, driven by the need to provide the most explicit images for the viewer/voyeur safely tucked away in the worlds safe spaces.         
	Yet, his professional life consumes him  even when not with the camera, Faulques takes what Olvido (his companion) calls mental photographs, framing, including, rejecting; introspection, the ethics of war, questions of morality, of privacy and the basic right to refuse to be photographed are kept at bay and perhaps that is why he chose not to answer Ivos question of whether he thought when he photographed. Of course Faulques thought as he composed his shot; his mind buzzed with the technical requirements of the moment. Finally, he gives up his profession, in part devastated by the death of Olvido in a mine explosion that he could have prevented and in part facing the familiar burnout of an exacting life where it was impossible to photograph the danger, or the guilt. Faulques, however, cannot get war and destruction out of his blood and when he turns to painting he does so also because he can say more than he could through his photographs; as fantasy, chiaroscuro, and the imagery of horror and death take over his painterly eye, the creator can now give expression to the desolation of his soul. When, after days of sharing experiences over shots of cognac, Markovic discovers that the world-renowned Faulques is a mere shell, his disappointment is palpable: I thought I was going to kill a living man, he says as he leaves.         
	On one occasion, Markovic forces Faulques to reflect on his past role. He reminds him of two world-renowned photographs in Freetown, Sierra Leone: a prisoner was being beaten by several people  before being hacked to death by machetes. What Faulques did not know was that he too was filmed between the two shots, filmed, on his knees, begging the perpetrators to spare the life of the victim. Markovic had seen the television film, and was surprised; I thought you were an indifferent witness, he said to Faulques; Faulques wearily replies, sometimes photographing and thinking are compatible. In this case, his professional commitment took precedence, and he continued photographing the dying man at his feet. Nor had he any answer to Markovics charge that perhaps the man was killed just so he could be photographed. Of course Faulques had thought of the possibility, the thought had found space in his devastated mind that acknowledged that no photograph is inert or passive.        
	In the process of describing Faulquess various adventures, the author also causes the reader to reflect on the changing nature of photographic discourse. The intimate relationship between the photographer and his client when both were cosily ensconced in a studio gave way gradually to outdoor domestic photography, and with the rapid growth of the much more impersonal photojournalism, the photographer often took on an adversarial role, exemplified in the invasiveness of the paparazzi. Questions of privacy, truthful or correct representations, subjectivity of the camera become issues that are amplified in times of disaster and of war.               
	Though in most cases, it becomes the photographers eye that prevails, all images of war are not always accepted as incontrovertible evidence. Robert Capas celebrated photograph (picture) of the dying Republican soldier during the Spanish Civil War became part of a huge controversy. Photographer-editor Hans-Michael Koetzle argues (Photo Icons) that when the photograph became a poignant symbol of the war, critics seriously considered whether it was authentic: how could a man hit by a bullet fall backwards when he is rushing down an incline? And where was Capa positioned? Before the soldier obviously  but that appeared to be an impossibility. The mystery over the photograph could not be solved by recourse to negatives as these were lost; Capas words finally settled it. Both the soldier and Capa had been left behind by the troops, and the young man was anxious to get back to his lines. His impatience caused him to be foolhardy  and Capa was at his side as he keeled over. Later, he [Capa] discovered that he had taken one of the finest shots of the civil war. Like Capa, Faulques too, no doubt, thought that many of his shots were exceptional. And so, obviously, did the world. However, Faulquess soul finally confronts him and he moves away to the easel. As the novel nears its inevitable finale, the readers covert sympathy for Faulques has to contend with the niggling thought that perhaps it is only in fiction that nemesis catches up with photographers obsessed with destruction and the politics of hate.

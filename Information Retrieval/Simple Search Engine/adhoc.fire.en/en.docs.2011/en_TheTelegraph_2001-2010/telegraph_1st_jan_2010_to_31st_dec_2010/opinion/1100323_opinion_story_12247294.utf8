The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | No time to dream of the past
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO TIME TO DREAM OF THE PAST                              The Left Front government must undergo a thorough image makeover if it wants to retain power in West Bengal, writes Shyamal Datta                                                
	The recent State-sponsored rally of the Left Front government at the Brigade Parade Grounds was impressive. It sounded the bugle for the march to retaining power for another term and also marked the conclusion of the central committee meeting of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Calcutta.        
	The committee had earlier deliberated on the contents of the rectification report prepared by the state unit, following the drubbing of the Left Front, led by the CPI(M), in the Lok Sabha elections last year. The report took cognizance of the growing incidence of bourgeoisie vices among the rank and file. Over the years, the revolutionary fervour got dented, and ideological impurities crept in at all levels. There was a greater hunger for power, lavish lifestyle and corruption. This showed that the committees at the grass-roots level have failed to detect and deal with the aberrations. Even the control commissions at the state and Central levels did not succeed much in this regard.        
	The committee drew some satisfaction from the assessment of the state unit that signs of a turnaround are visible. This was manifest in the emotional send-off that the party patriarch received from the people during his last journey. The Brigade rally hummed with snatches of speeches by Jyoti Basu. Hundreds of posters, cut-outs and masks painted the ground red as a mark of tribute to the legend. In Basus death, the party has found a beacon of hope to revive its electoral fortune. The crowd at the rally roared that the party was sure to return to power under the able leadership of the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, whose eyes were, reportedly, moistened.        
	The rally unfurled the electoral strategy of the Left Front in its broad contours.The focus will be on the forthcoming elections to the 83 civic bodies, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The Front, and the CPI(M) in particular, consider a victory in an overwhelming number of municipal bodies to be an absolute must. It would not only help retrieve ground lost in the panchayat and parliamentary elections, but also to restore the morale of the workers and leaders. The command over the civic bodies would help the campaigning for the assembly elections gather momentum. It would also demonstrate that the partys influence in urban areas has remained formidable, that there is nothing much to worry about.        
	The seriousness that the Marxists attach to the municipal and assembly elections is clear from the decision of the central leadership to postpone the 20th party congress by a year  from 2011 to 2012  a step that is out of routine. The leadership wants the focus to remain entirely on electoral triumph to retain power in Kerala and West Bengal respectively. The party must go all out to deliver on the rectification committee recommendations on a war-footing. It must improve its image by bringing itself closer to the people. Frank admission of mistakes and expression of regret for the same will be in order. The rectification campaign should be carried forward to keep the house in order, election or no election, so that the party could measure up to the expectations of the people. After the municipal elections, the party should undertake a review of its performance and draw up the blueprint of its political tactics.        
	An important element of the electoral strategy would be to try exploit the inner contradictions in the Opposition, making a distinction between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress. The recent acrimony over the impromptu meeting between Subrata Mukherjee and the Trinamul supremo on sharing of seats in the civic body elections behind the back of the Congress indicated the strains that exist between the allies. The fact that Banerjee was upstaged in the Siliguri municipal elections by the Congress last year is also fresh in mind. The CPI(M)s objective would be to try frustrate efforts at Opposition unity and engineer a split in the Opposition votes, which have not only remained substantial but also shown a measure of accretion. A division in the Opposition vote bank would be the key to retention of power in the state. In keeping with this, the party should build up a campaign highlighting the alleged high-handedness as well as the anti-Centre and divisive politics of the Trinamul Congress.        
	The CPI(M) should appreciate the Congresss graciousness of giving a State funeral to a former chief minister. Such grace was lacking in the Trinamul Congress. The Left Front must be also happy with the Centres support in dealing with the Maoists. Straws in the wind suggest that in the event of a split electoral verdict, the Congress could depend on the support of the CPI(M) from outside, and form the government on its own in the state, if it fell short of the required numbers. After all, the United Progressive Alliance government was formed in 2004 at the Centre with the Left extending outside support.        
	For a political party, image makeover is not an easy task. It becomes more difficult when the party has to carry the burden of the past, marked by arrogance and inefficiency. For the CPI(M), these infirmities clogged the channel of information, and it developed a denial syndrome, allowing the so-called non-communist vices to continue unabated. The CPI(M) leadership also refused to see the structural drawbacks that festered on account of its failure to maintain a clear distinction between the party and the government, and the government and the State. By holding a rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds, in violation of high court orders, the Left Front has weakened the State. Describing the elite of Calcutta, whom the party disempowered, and the rural rich whom the land reforms dispossessed, as black forces bent on destabilizing the state, the CPI(M) only transgressed norms of acceptable human conduct.        
	In every political process, aberrations like the abuse of the State authority for self-aggrandizement are present in varying degrees. The capacity to curb these tendencies gets weakened when the system lacks transparency and accountability. In closed political systems, the flow of information, lacking in integrity and falling short of objectivity, is a recurrent feature. Secrecy and unquestioned decision-making power without any respect for other opinions make the situation worse. Political muscle is built to perpetuate a monopoly on power. The simultaneous need to strengthen the economic muscle for the growth of the state is lost sight of. The party, driven by ideological compulsions, tends to overlook the mind of todays youth, which wants economic, rather than political, enfranchisement.              
	West Bengal is beset with intractable problems. The party that is able to mobilize people on the plank of humanity is not required to score brownie points on the eve of elections or to opt for reservations for a particular community. Less of the politics of rallies, and violent protests, and more of the politics of work culture and good governance, is called for. The party that is able to appreciate the challenges, adhere to the power of example, not to the example of power, is prepared for a proactive response. The dreams for a better future, not the memories of a legend, are more life-affirming.

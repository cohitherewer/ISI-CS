	Ethnic violence is usually the result of chronic insecurity over the allocation of limited resources. It is significant that the Uzbeks, who are being exterminated in a frenzy of slaughter by the native population of Kyrgyzstan, happen to be a more or less prosperous community. The ethnic Uzbeks, who make up only 15 per cent of Kyrgyzstans population, are reputed to be an industrious people. They are also in the minority in the towns of Osh and Jalalabad from where they have been practically wiped out. Worse still, the Uzbeks find themselves on the wrong side of the political divide. A majority of them are sympathetic towards the new government that came into being in April this year, ending the misrule of the last president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who fomented ethnic disputes. Since then, the volatile south, where Mr Bakiyevs supporters lord over, has turned into the centre of a brutal civil war.        
	What is the new government, which has been supported by so many Uzbeks to their great detriment, doing? Apparently, not much. The interim government, led by Roza Otunbayeva, did try to quell the dissent in the Fergana Valley, but finally threw up its hands when faced with an increasingly belligerent Kyrgyz mob out there on a killing spree. So the only hope now is to wait for a Russian intervention, although Moscow has made no such overture so far. Twenty years ago, Mikhail Gorbachev had sent troops to Osh to control another outburst of ethnic violence. But that was in a different era, and Russia has quite sensibly moved on from its Soviet hangover. So, in spite of its desire for supremacy in Central Asia, Russia is unlikely to jump headlong into the fray. After the recent disaster with Georgia for control over South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Russia will probably wish to avoid being dragged into yet another quagmire  this time, not even of its own making. Among the so-called global superpowers, China is keeping quiet, probably because of its economic interests in the region. The United States of America is also being tardy, possibly because it leases an airbase vital to its interests in Afghanistan. The Uzbeks are left with no choice but to flock back to their native country, which too, after a point, will stop accepting refugees. This collective ducking of responsibility not only helps strengthen authoritarian leaders in the region but also portends bigger catastrophes in the days to come.

	Tug of war                  
	Sir  It is no surprise that the chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, has objected to advertisements that portray his Gujarat counterpart, Narendra Modi, as a role model for Bihar, as well as to those which show the two leaders together (Nitish slap greets ad-happy Modi, June 13). Kumar has even gone so far as to return the Rs 5 crore donated by Gujarat as relief for the Kosi floods. Probably keeping the vote banks in mind, Kumar does not want to be depicted as Modis ally.           
	Modi, on the other hand, is obsessed with promotional campaigns. These seem to be based largely on fabrications and false promises. I have been a regular visitor to Gujarat since 1988 and am of the opinion that the states prosperity cannot be attributed only to Modi. While he has taken important measures such as curbing corruption, the state has certain other advantages, such as big seaports and the positive mindset of the people who live there.          
	The worst aspect of the Modi regime, however, has been its attitude towards the Muslim population of the state. Gujarat might have been even more prosperous if the communal riots of 2002 had not taken place. Moreover, if the Gujarat government had taken sufficient measures to punish those responsible for the atrocities, Modi might not have needed aggressive advertisements to preserve his image.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  In protest against the advertising campaign launched by Modi in Bihar, Nitish Kumar should immediately terminate the alliance between his party, the Janata Dal (United), and the Bharatiya Janata Party. In that case, the Congress and other secular parties would be only too eager to step in. This would give Kumar, who is currently reliant on his tie-up with the BJP, new coalition partners and perhaps a full term in office. The former chief minister of Bihar, Lalu Prasad, who must be observing the situation from the sidelines, might find that helping Kumar break off with the BJP serves his own long-term interests.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Jorhat Singh, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Narendra Modi, who has been voted to power twice in Gujarat, is a popular target for human rights activists. Even the United States of America, which itself has no impeccable human rights record, reportedly denied Modi a visa. This is a classic case of condemning a person on the the basis of hearsay. There have been a number of Indian chief ministers who have witnessed communal riots during their tenure. None of them have been as severely castigated as Modi has been. At present, it is Nitish Kumar who has set out to prove his secular credentials before the 2011 assembly elections. Kumar is quite evidently playing to the gallery.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The report that Nitish Kumar returned the unutilized flood relief aid received from the Gujarat government was saddening (Flood money back to Modi, June 21). A politician of Kumars calibre should not have acted in this manner.          
	In the aftermath of the Kosi floods, the Gujarat government had sent aid, doctors, relief teams and materials for the flood-ravaged regions of Bihar. In such moments of crisis, aid is sent for the benefit of the people, regardless of which party rules the region. The Bihar chief ministers decision to return the aid was a purely political one.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
N.R. Ramachandran, Ooty

                
	Strong hold          
	Sir  Ashok Mitras article, Eye on the main chance (June 21), examines the episode involving the American marine base in Okinawa and an affluent, globalized Indias failure to respond to the incident. The article exposes the USs intentions of establishing hegemony over Asia. There has been a strong movement among the Japanese people against the American naval presence in Okinawa. The popular sentiment has strengthened after several charges of rape were filed against American marines stationed there.The most well-known case was filed in 1995, when three US servicemen, Marcus Gill, Rodrico Harp and Kendrick Ledet, were charged with raping a 12-year-old Japanese girl. Despite the Japanese governments efforts to dislodge the US troops from the region, they have refused to leave.          
	In the light of such incidents, Mitra has expressed his reservations about India entering a strategic alliance with the US. While the richer classes in India enjoy the luxuries afforded by a globalized market and by close ties with America, there seems to be an underlying fear that Indias sovereignty may be imperilled by the US. According to Mitra, the nuclear liability bill and the failure to press charges against Union Carbide Corporation indicate Indias surrender to the USs demands.          
	Mitra also berates India for being indifferent to Israels attack on the flotilla carrying aid to the Gaza strip and for entertaining defence deals with Israel. It must be admitted that with China and Pakistan as neighbours, India must strengthen its defence as much as possible. Globalization is needed to speed up economic growth but the interests of the poor must also be taken care of.          
	Yours faithfully,

	My Favourite Cricketer   Edited by John Stern,     A CB Publications, Rs 599  
	The title of the book, My Favourite Cricketer, leaves no one in any doubt about the nature of its contents. However, this book is not about a biographer penning his views on one single individual. Forty-six authors have been brought together to write about their favourite cricketers.                  The immortal      
	When one of my favourites, Frank Keating, waxes eloquent about the regal bearing of Tom Graveney at the crease, or another favourite, Peter Roebuck, pays homage to the sterling character of Harold Larwood, you realize that all is well with the cricketing fraternity.         
	In a compendium of this kind, authors are encouraged to perpetuate their own heroes for posterity. Of course, not all the subjects are top-quality Test cricketers why should that be? But there are players who range from immortals like Trumper, Tendulkar and Sobers, to characters such as Trueman and Close, Edmonds and Bedi, Barrington and Procter, to the unlikely emergence of Ally Brown and John Dye.        
	The books quality prose describes the exploits of Pollock, Akram, Engineer, Knott, Thompson and Garner. Jardine and Gower did not share much as men and cricketers, but they share space in this collection. Gooch and Lamb have their idiosyncrasies mentioned, while Wes Hall and Doug Walters have been fondly remembered. I was particularly happy to see that the big-hitting Arthur Wellard is still remembered.        
	But even hero worship can get tiresome if you are given a dose of utter nonsense. One professional author, Shakespeare of surname, relates that Adam Gilchrist happens to be the man who changed the face of cricket by his speed of scoring! One wonders where the memories of Trumper, Jessop, Constantine, Bradman (a triple century in a single day), the two Richards and our own Mushtaq Ali have gone.         
	As if this assertion was not ridiculous enough, the author has taken the art of flattery to new heights. He claims that Gilchrist is the inventor of a stroke: he, apparently, was the first person to lift a ball over the slip cordon. No cricketer worth his bat would ever say that he can convincingly place the ball over the finer slips. Generally, batters have been slashing at a rising delivery with the bat blade pointing up. Remember Tony Greig against Lillee and Thompson? This has been done over many decades. Actually, Sir Don had done it against Larwood in the Bodyline series. He would move towards the leg side and smash the ball to the untenanted region over slip and gully. This stroke is now extremely popular with the modern-day slaughterer, Virender Sehwag.        
	A very important issue here is that a magnificent cricketer of Adam Gilchrists class does not need such unnecessary certificates. He is a legend of the game and would remain so  not only for his playing skills but more so for his sportsmanship. Once he walked off in a World Cup match even before the umpire had given him out. Men like Gilchrist, like our own Gundappa Viswanath, represent the best of cricketing manners.        
	Thankfully, the same author mentions Ranji as the man who invented the leg glance. Not many players can take credit for inventing new strokes. It is said that Duleepsinhji was the first to reverse sweep. This is not confirmed, but no one would dispute that Kevin Pietersen is the innovative founder of the switch shot. The so-called Dilshan scoop was not Dilshans invention at all. Zimbabwes Douglas Marillier was the first to do it at the international level.        
	While on stroke innovators, Rohan Kanhai happens to be the person who invented the falling sweep. No one till date has been able to replicate its highly unorthodox execution. Kanhai was one of my early heroes and has remained so. The chief reason being that the man was highly artistic as well as an exemplary architect. Probably he was the greatest of the creative geniuses in cricket because the falling sweep of his is still beyond the reach of all cricketers. Kanhai, like the Brazilian artistic soccer star, Garrincha, has never received his due recognition.                    RAJU MUKHERJI

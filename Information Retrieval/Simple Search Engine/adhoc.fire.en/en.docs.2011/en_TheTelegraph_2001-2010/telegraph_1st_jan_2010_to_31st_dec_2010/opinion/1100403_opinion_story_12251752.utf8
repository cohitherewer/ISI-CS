                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CRAFTY ACROBATICS                              Rita Datta      VISUAL ARTS                                                
	Metaphors and symbols are so much a part of human thought, so woven are they into our speech and perception, our gestures and diet, our customs and taboos, that their ubiquitous presence in traditional visual culture is accepted without enquiry. But much of modern art is anchored to conscious references and thats what CIMAs current show, on till April 3, reminds viewers of.         
	As Kingshuk Sarkars leaping, looping surge of voluminous grey-black hurtles across two canvases and crashes into a frozen spray of sooty splinters and blobs, you think of elemental forces (picture). Forces that warn of environmental upheavals, even as the dark smoky colour speaks of toxic wastes. A riveting diptych.        
	Shreyasi Chatterjees unusual mtier  constructing collages from fabric, thread and paint  yields suggestions both in the medium and in the matter. A feminine identity and the intimate minutiae of homemaking are archly premised on what is a romantic landscape of infectious, compelling radiance.        
	In their tribute to Bhupen Khakhar, who died in 2003, Partha Pratim Deb and Abir Karmakar revisit The Man with a Bouquet of Plastic Flowers. Deb retains the general layout of the original while incorporating little deviations with his usual impish humour. But it is Karmakars self-portrait that haunts the viewer with its pensive vulnerability. Its the male torso that he highlights, the lower anatomy, discreetly smudged in shadows, disappearing beyond the frame. This is not the sculpted six-pack pin-up of heroes but a fleshy, somewhat flaccid body typical of the average man, and it is portrayed with empathy.        
	A. Balasubramaniams small sculpture suggests a teasing paradox in the title, In, But Out. The closely arranged copper wire shaped like a head traps space in but is empty of substance. Or is the tangible  that is, the head mounted in a box frame locked in while whats tenuous, like thought and memory, remains out?         
	Theres an in-out conceit in Sumitro Basaks art too. The spry stylization makes figures flat but agile and edgy. They seem caught in the pincer pinch of contrary realities  the internal and the external  which must be negotiated, nimbly, precariously. Their bodies, invaded by external reality, seem to have been turned inside out, as a hand does a glove. Pulling whats meant to be in quite out  the innards. Survival, therefore, calls for crafty acrobatics, because its only for the fittest, isnt it?        
	The optical dynamics of Baiju Parthans prints induce the viewers close scrutiny. From his tiny, meticulously placed cones, triangles and springs in metallic tones there emerge large images as you step back. Somewhat in the manner of Ben-Day dots. Stepping forward dissipates the illusion as the images dissolve into their neat little components.         
	Its difficult to gauge whether its anger or just blas irreverence that makes Alok Bal resurrect Abanindranaths Bharat Mata in a dark robe of mourning. Maybe theres a little of both, for the one is often inverted into the other: when things are too bleak, on the brink  as they indeed are in India  what can one do but resort to black humour? The devi, demeaned, must ever walk the tightrope, holding a balancing pole that uses as weights excerpts from the iconic work on the horror of war, Guernica.         
	Sanjeev Sonpimpares urban fable catches the protagonist  himself  disoriented, teetering, split down the middle in Dividers. The other work, Barefoot Back 2 Bihar, probably refers to the politics of intolerance in Mumbai against north Indians. His technique of abbreviating images in black and white against solid ground colours approximates computer graphics to hold the eye.        
	But Jaya Gangulys protagonist, a limp, putrid, sub-human creature, bloated in some parts and shrivelled in others, seems to have been through a wringer: a survivor of trauma. But if the violence is palpable here, it is noiselessly implicit in Samir Aichs acrylic. Its survivor, with an open wound that unzips the head as it were, is drained to a stark, fleshless outline. The silence grows in Jogen Chowdhurys drawing. The violence is chillingly understated, even clinical, as the prone figure, with raw gashes on the back, appears to be pulverized, maybe dead, and on a dissecting table.        
	But if the dystopia of urban artists unsettles the viewer, the antidote comes from the refreshing, animistic imagination of tribal art, structured into inherited iconography though it is. Mayank Kumar Shyams black-and-white drawing, and Ram Singh Urvetis colourful acrylic indicate the vitality of both their visual tradition and tribal myths. M.F. Husain, Ganesh Pyne, Arpita Singh, Atul Dodiya, Jyoti Bhatt and Jitish Kallat are also among the artists represented.

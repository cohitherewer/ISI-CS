	Once again, the Reserve Bank of India pulled off a surprise, even if it was a small one. Before the RBI announced policy measures at its third quarter monetary policy review on January 29, the fear was that any measure the central bank took would hurt: it could stop the growth momentum, or worse, lead to a serious slowdown. In the end, the RBI announced just one  an increase in one of the two reserve requirements applicable to banks. While most people anticipated the increase in cash reserve ratio  the other is the statutory liquidity ratio, both of which are calculated as a proportion of banks deposit base  many were still surprised by the size: three quarters of a percentage point (or 75 basis points) to 5.75 per cent. The unexpected increase first shocked the equity markets, but as most banks and experts made reassuring noises, some semblance of stability was restored.         
	The RBI governor, Duvvuri Subbarao, in his press conference said that the decision was not an easy one to make, given the various complexities in our current economic situation; as he emphasized in his remarks, the margin for error in implementing an exit strategy from an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy is small. Choosing the right tactical measures to manage liquidity is critical to the success of the policy. Judging from post-policy review market reactions and comment, the RBI seems to have gotten it right.         
	Three factors appeared to have influenced the choice of policy measure. The RBI seems to have conducted its liquidity forecasts carefully, and focused on keeping core market liquidity intact, while excess liquidity that could skew prices can be sucked out. So the additional 25 basis points CRR hike is actually a pre-emptive move to smoothen the liquidity cycle. The RBI and the markets are looking ahead to the large number of equity issues  particularly the divestment of the public sector enterprises, NTPC and NMDC  to bring in large capital inflows. The number of foreign institutional investors has actually grown over the past year or two, and has probably led to significant capital inflows over the last few months. There will be significant government expenditure in the months of February and March which will add even more liquidity to the system. The governments borrowing programme for the year is effectively over. For the next three months, its borrowing will be largely in the form of short-term treasury bills that will take out of the system what repayments put back into it. But if equity markets flounder as they have been doing in recent weeks, the estimates of inflows  and liquidity  could go awry. That would put pressure on the governments annual budget  the next policy event.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Walk unafraid                  
	Sir  The editorial, Walking free (Nov 15), accurately points out that it would be nave to see Aung San Suu Kyis release as a change of heart for Myanmars ruthless military junta. Its motives must be held suspect. On the eve of the Nobel Peace Prize winners release, the junta conducted elections that can only be called a sham. The victory of the army-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party has merely created a faade of democracy. Setting Suu Kyi free seems to be a ploy to deflect attention from the irregularities in the recent elections.          
	For the last two decades, Suu Kyi has endured arrest and incarceration. It is unlikely that the juntas attitude to her will change and that it will let her be truly free. She must navigate the current situation with her characteristic savoir faire and expert negotiating skills. The editorial points out that Suu Kyi has been profoundly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and the Buddha. Ironically, in India, their teachings seem to have been forgotten.          
	Suu Kyi herself has become an inspirational figure over the years and she enjoys phenomenal public support. Her voice of protest should not become a cry in the wilderness. If the whole world stands by her, she will be able to fight the ruling junta more effectively. The quest for freedom and democracy must be extended to other countries as well, as the editorial argues. The world must also fight for the release of Liu Xiaobo, this years Nobel Peace Prize winner, who is still imprisoned in China.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It was heartwarming to read about Aung San Suu Kyis hard-won liberty. Having spent the first 16 years of my life in what was then East Pakistan, I have personal experience of what it is like to live under military rule. Leaders like Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan were dictators who thrived by suppressing democratic movements.          
	In Myanmar, the fearless Suu Kyi has suffered years of imprisonment with stoic endurance. She has never compromised on the ideals of freedom and democracy. Her life is a story of sacrifice and political rectitude. Even when her husband was dying of cancer, she refused to go and see him, fearing that she would not be allowed to come back to Myanmar once she left. Suu Kyi symbolizes mankinds innate desire for freedom, unfettered by fear or oppression of any kind.           
	The recent elections in Myanmar were blatantly rigged by the junta. Following the nationwide uproar over the elections, the junta was compelled to free Suu Kyi. It is no wonder that news of the popular leaders release at this juncture was greeted by ecstatic crowds.          
	Although it welcomes Suu Kyis release in the same spirit, the editorial, Walking free, also registers a sense of unease. This is only natural, given the history of the last couple of decades. It seems only proper to question the sincerity of the juntas intentions.          
	In the midst of all this excitement, Suu Kyi has remained calm. However, restoring democratic governance to the country must be uppermost in her mind at this point. Perhaps she will consider reconstituting the National League for Democracy. If there are fresh elections, it is to be hoped that she will be allowed to participate. It is unlikely that Myanmars powerful generals will be reluctant to let her be really free. Nevertheless, Suu Kyi remains committed to the ideals of peace and non-violence. She has even expressed a desire to engage with the junta and discuss ways in which freedom and democracy may return to Myanmar. It is precisely for this purpose that people all over the world, and across the political spectrum, must support Suu Kyi. If Nelson Mandela could succeed in South Africa, there is no reason why this equally courageous lady cannot.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Free at last after years of house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi is poised to bring back democracy to Myanmar. It remains to be seen how the military junta deals with this crusade. Suu Kyi is endorsed and supported by the West. In the interest of the common people, she will probably use her popularity to persuade Western powers to lift the economic sanctions imposed on Myanmar. The junta can only welcome the end of such crippling sanctions. Perhaps the struggle to cope with the economic problems that plague the country will provide a common platform for Suu Kyi and the junta.          
	The editorial, Walking free, observes that despite doubts and foreboding, Suu Kyis release carries an overwhelming message of hope for the future of freedom. Nevertheless, it may be too early to hope that China will release Liu Xiaobo anytime soon.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The Rajasthan governments decision to grant 40 new mining leases near Sariska is bound to have a disastrous effect on the ecologically sensitive zone. It also spells doom for the ambitious project to reintroduce tigers in the forest reserve. According to reports, this decision was in defiance of norms laid down earlier by the Supreme Court. Since various government ministries refuse to act responsibly, it is now up to non- governmental organizations to garner public support and protest against such violations of the law.                    
	Yours faithfully,

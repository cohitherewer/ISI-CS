	Driven to destruction                  
	Sir  The report, Bengals migrant underbelly (Nov 17), highlights the plight of the labourers from Bengal who were killed when the building they were working in collapsed in east Delhi. Most of these workers had been driven to look for jobs in Delhi because of the paucity of jobs in their own state. As residents of West Bengal, we must be aware of the quality of life of our fellow inhabitants. It is a shame that we notice the suffering of others only after reading about it in newspapers. Hunger drives people from remote villages in Bengal to places as far off as Kerala.           
	This problem has persisted for years, but we have refused to acknowledge it. People who lead comfortable lives in Calcutta are oblivious to the plight of others. Our demands for healthcare, transportation, drinking water and education have increased over the years. But some people, living perhaps within a hundred miles of our homes, cannot afford even the basic amenities. We make expensive trips to places like Santiniketan, Digha and Siliguri but turn a blind eye to the poverty at places closer home. We fail to recognize that electricity, drinking water and healthcare are rare everywhere in Bengal except Calcutta.           
	It is easy to blame the politicians for this, but we are the ones who voted them to power. We always shy away from taking our share of the blame.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Arindam Dutta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The building collapse in Laxmi Nagar in Delhi that killed a number of workers from Bengal brings up uncomfortable questions about the lack of job opportunities in our state. One wonders why the workers had to go all the way to Delhi in search of work instead of coming to Calcutta. Our city may have been the cultural and historical capital of the country, but now it has lost much of its former glory. The reason why Calcutta has been unable to match the progress of other metropolitan cities lies in the lackadaisical attitude of its people. They are satisfied with what they have and do not have the urge to perform better. The city must develop by leaps and bounds if it is to regain its former prestige.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Saurav Roy, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is tragic that so many people died in the building collapse in east Delhi, especially since the building is suspected to be an unauthorized one. Politicians are known to illegally authorize the construction of such buildings. Since these structures are unlawful, it is not surprising that they are often so unstable. This mishap should make the government aware of the foul play that goes on in the real estate sector. The people who authorized the construction of the building should be brought to book, and the families of the victims should be given proper compensation.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Without prejudice          
	Sir  The editorial, Pride and prejudice (Nov 14), says that it is Indias mindset, as a third world country that hinders its progress. However, India is the worlds largest and most populous democracy. It is inevitable, therefore, that there should be a huge number of dissenting voices in our country.           
	China, on the other hand, has an authoritarian communist government. India was able to do justice to the Commonwealth Games. But it cannot be denied that to ensure a grander success like the Asian Games, a stronger authority is required.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Pass the buck          
	Sir  The United States of America protests against the flow of cocaine into the country from Columbia. It also has a problem with China exporting consumer goods to the US. But instead of curbing cocaine abuse in the US, the American government is destroying the crops of an already-impoverished Columbia. And instead of trying to slow down the consumption of Chinese exports, the US is blaming the strength of Chinas currency.          
	China is able to buy dollars by exporting goods which affects the ratio between the yuan and the dollar. In the consumption of cocaine and Chinese exports, the problem lies with the American consumer. The US has a propensity for passing off its own problems as the faults of others.          
	Yours faithfully,

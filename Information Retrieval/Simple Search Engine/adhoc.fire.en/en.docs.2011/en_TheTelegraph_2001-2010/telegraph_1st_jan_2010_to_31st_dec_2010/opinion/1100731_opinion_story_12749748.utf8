The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An evening of harmony and promise
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AN EVENING OF HARMONY AND PROMISE                                  Aveek Sen                          Auguste Renoir, Girls at the Piano                                        
	Imagine what a harmonious world it would be, it said on the programme, if every single person, both young and old, shared a little of what he or she is good at doing. The occasion for which this definition of harmony felt so apt was the fifth annual concert by the pupils of Fauzia Marikar at the Max Mueller Bhavan auditorium on July 24. That evening, there were many boys and girls whose feet dangled well above the stage-floor when they sat on the stool to play the piano. But there were also older children and young adults of heart-warming talent, as well as one valiant gentleman playing Schubert on the cello who proved that it was never too late to come to music.        
	Almost 25 soloists played in the concert. But to be in concert is to come together in the pleasure, discipline and humanity of music. It is to learn to focus ones skill and sensibility  ones musicality  not only to play for, but also to listen to, others; to sit still in order to give and take the gifts of melody, harmony, rhythm and the special form of thought (or is it feeling?) that only music can stir. For a flamboyant performer to step back a bit and accompany another soloist, or even to sit next to a pianist quietly and turn her pages, is an education in alertness, humility and communication. These, perhaps, are the best fruits of an early education in music; examinations, prizes and other kinds of success come later, if they must.        
	Given the collective, and entirely uncompetitive, promise of the evening, it feels particularly wrong to mention some of the pupils specially. But, little Reet Mitras courage with Go Tell Aunty Rhody, Oishik Gangulys sophistication and lightness of touch with Mozart and Mendelssohn, Ranajoy Banerjees sensitiveness and edgy intelligence with Beethoven, Yaelin Hans confidence and precision with Bach at his most difficult, Deepanjali Lobos delicate virtuosity with a demanding set of Mozart variations, and Poulami Ghoshs lan on the violin (she is a student of Mihir Gupta) were especially memorable. Gourab Datta, playing an impressive range from Kedar Awati (present in the audience) to Schumann, was as virtuosic as ever. Given his inclination towards Romantic flamboyance, it is perhaps time to sentence him to a year or two of nothing but Bach.         
	Generally, the older pupils could work towards a steadier groundedness in what they are playing, rather than rushing nervously through their performances. But they were playing on a rather good Steinway  a cold and unsparing piano, which never fails to remind the pianist that, even at its most delightful, music is never not a precise and difficult affair.

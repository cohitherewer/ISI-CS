	Manmohan Singh once adapted a famous comment about Britains R.A. Butler to say that Jyoti Basu was the best prime minister India had never had. The prime minister may long ago have outgrown that personal view privately expressed before he held a governmental position; but there is no denying that Basu had a panache that never failed to impress. This writer too waxed eulogistic about the former chief minister in an anthology published about 15 years ago. Its only when West Bengal is compared to other states that doubts about Basus long stewardship creep in.        
	People who worked with him in his early years in politics say he strove to model himself on Bidhan Chandra Roy, his hero. If so, the main resemblance was in his relationship with his party. Basu towered over his comrades as Roy had done over other Congressmen. He also had a broader perspective than other Bengali Marxists. Legend had it that he was on first-name terms with Indira Gandhi, whom he had known as a student in England. Others (P.N. Haksar, Bhupesh Gupta, Mohan Kumaramangalam) had also fallen under Rajani Palme Dutts spell and returned to join either politics (Congress or communist), law or the civil service. But surrounded by sycophantic civil servants, Basu was intolerant of independent appraisals.        
	His principal asset was his personality. It followed, therefore, that his successes were largely personal. A Roman Catholic prelate told me he would pick up the telephone and speak to Jyoti at the least hint of labour trouble in any of their church institutions. Basu had not forgotten his childhood and adolescence at Loreto House and St Xaviers School. A former communist colleague recalls that Basu fell silent for a whole month when the undivided party resolved that public speeches would be only in the mother tongue. He was brushing up his Bengali oratory. In some ways, he was a sahib in a dhoti.              
	Given Indian class consciousness, villagers and the partys rank and file were awed by his aloof manner and unseeing, hooded gaze. He seemed born to rule. Westerners, especially the British, loved his unsmiling visage and clipped, monosyllabic replies. Society women swooned over his gallantry. One who wanted her whiskey small at a cocktail party was very taken when Basu intervened, Dont worry, they serve it in homeopathic doses in this house! Such repartee was not expected from an austere Marxist whose government was identified with radical social and economic measures.         
	There was a serious dimension to his pleasantries. They enabled him to enjoy convivial sessions with the captains of industry, who profited from the relationship. To my intense embarrassment, I have more than once opened a door at some large gathering and stumbled on Basu in a huddle with some of West Bengals best-known business operators. The wintry smiles I got made it clear my presence was unwelcome. Basu could be very cold when he wanted to. He was too sophisticated to discuss land concessions, contracts, loans and licences at social occasions; but they soldered the bond that gave rise to the Communist Party of India (Marwari) joke about the CPI(M).        
	Ideology sat lightly on this urbane man of the world. He did not slave through the party ranks like the Cambridge-educated Indrajit Gupta, who came from a more distinguished, affluent and Westernized background but identified himself wholeheartedly with the mazdoor he represented. Snehangshu Acharya, Basus lifelong friend and, some say, financial supporter, used to talk of taking him to Alexandra Castle, the family seat of the Maharajas of Mymensingh, after their return from England. The castle was said to boast a stairway of solid crystal and two kitchens that served lavish Bengali and European meals every day. Basu left after a week of this luxury, saying he would lose his communism if he stayed.         
	One of his campaign promises in the Seventies was that sub-divisional officers and district collectors were archaic institutions and that the government would find new channels of communication with the people. Having just visited Sri Lanka, I told him on the morning after the CPI(M)s sweeping victory that Sirimavo Bandaranaike had appointed a political officer from her Sri Lanka Freedom Party in each district. The PO bypassed the established colonial era conduit. Basu was outraged. That would mean duplication and confusion! he expostulated. What new channels of communication did he have in mind then? He thought for a moment and said mahila samitis were very effective. The answer reminded me of the Fifties English joke, Vote Labour to keep out the Socialists! It is party lore that ambivalence and inconsistency also marked his stand on the revolutionary line that B.T. Ranadive advocated. To start with, he was critical of armed insurrection as in Telangana but later supported Ranadive as general secretary replacing P.C. Joshi. Tiger was his unlikely code name when the party went underground.        
	It would be unfair not to give Basu credit for the major changes that transformed West Bengals landscape during his chief ministership. Operation Barga was a significant achievement. So was the tiered panchayat administration. But it seems now that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has a better appreciation of how to handle the fruits of success than Basu did. He did not seem to realize that his own reforms in the countryside had created a new breed of ambitious young Bengalis with a smattering of education, determined to break out of the peasant mould and become bhadraloks.         
	One saw the same upward mobility in Punjab after the Green Revolution. Agricultural universities like the one at Ludhiana were set up for the sons of well-to-do cultivators in the hope of turning them into modern gentlemen farmers. But those youths had no intention of demeaning themselves by going back to the land. All the boys I spoke to then on the Ludhiana campus demanded a white-collar job  in the block development office if all else failed. Luckily for them, industry mopped up Punjabi manpower and avoided the kind of discontent that manifested itself in the Naxalite movement and other forms of unrest. I found Basu singularly unsympathetic to this phenomenon when I was interviewing him in the early Seventies for a British magazine. He dismissed Naxalites as wagon-breakers and anti-socials.               
	He sanctioned or turned a blind eye to criminally harsh repression and the use of agents provocateurs. He chose to condone police brutality, often making light of the atrocities reported in the newspaper I edited. Editor-sahib sees torture everywhere! he once joked. When I defended my reporters eye-witness account he replied that he had asked the police commissioner, who had denied the story. Naturally, the police commissioner would deny a report that indicted his men. Similarly, Basu did little or nothing to prevent the CPI(M) and its allies from sponsoring illegal immigration from Bangladesh. He railed against the Anandabazar group at our last meeting, saying they invented stories about him.        
	A former governor of West Bengal would say that Basu refused to read or sign files. He preferred to discuss things over a drink in Raj Bhavan. The governor saw this as a form of escapism. That may also explain why he did not ever try to grasp the nettle of unemployment as Bhattacharjee is trying with his plans for rapid industrialization. However inept the operations may be, they represent a realistic appraisal of West Bengals requirements.        
	Compare that with the fate that befell Roys tangible legacy. Salt Lake has flourished because land means profiteering but Kalyani has not. And very little remains of the nurseries Roy planned for the hills, his deep-sea trawlers and the Haringhata farm. Jyoti Basu with his charm, access, privileged position, legal training and worldly outlook could have done so much. His sad epitaph is that he did so little.       sunandadr@yahoo.co.in

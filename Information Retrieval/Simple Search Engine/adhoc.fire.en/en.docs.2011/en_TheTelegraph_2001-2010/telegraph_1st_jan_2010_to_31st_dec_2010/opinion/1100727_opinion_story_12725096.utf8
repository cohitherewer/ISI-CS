Desai                                                  
	The prime ministers economic council has given him a forecast for the next two years. It has also released the report on economic outlook to the public. It begins with a review of global prospects. Here it relies to a great extent on the International Monetary Funds World Economic Outlook, but takes a slightly more optimistic view of the European Union and a less optimistic view of the United States of America. To do so, it notes the 15 per cent depreciation of the euro against the dollar in the past eight months, and projects that this will continue; if it does, it will improve the EUs balance of payments vis--vis the US.        
	This method of looking ahead is the same as that of the IMF  the method of smoothing. One takes quarterly macroeconomic growth figures and ratios available, and inserts reasonable figures for the immediately following quarters  figures that look neither too high nor too low in the light of past figures. This method tries to extract trends from the past and ignores possible discontinuities. For instance, there are a number of possible events that the IMF does not consider: Spain or Italy may go into a fiscal crisis like Greece, the French and German banks that hold much of the debt of these two countries may face liquidity problems, or the German Landesbanken, which have lent much on mortgage, may find their collaterals devalued. One should not deduce from this that the venerable members of the economic council were unaware of these possibilities. Maybe they considered and dismissed them. But even a first-year student of economics can project trends; one does not need such a heavyweight council of advisers to do it. Any value they add must lie in their improvement upon trend projections.              
	The Western economies went through a downturn in 2008 and 2009 and are staging a weak recovery now. How did this affect India? The answer should be obtainable from the reports table 3, but it has 15 columns and 14 headings; one has first to work out which is the extra column and what it represents. My answer, from earlier Central Statistical Organisation figures, was that both growth of private corporate investment and private consumption slowed down considerably, and their impact was moderated in 2009 by a huge rise in government expenditure designed to win the general election. This inference is no longer supported by the Outlooks figures, which show little change in the demand structure of the gross domestic product. What they show is a significant rise in the payments deficit from 2008 onwards. As world trade collapsed, Indian exports came down, especially exports of capital goods such as machinery, equipment and electronic goods. Imports fell less. On the production side, it shows an enormous fall in the growth of agriculture and of construction in 2008 and 2009. There is no obvious connection between the three occurrences, and since the economic advisers have not noticed them, they have no explanation to offer. My current explanation would be that the rise in exchange reserves led to a liquidity overhang and fed a construction boom which collapsed in 2008. At the same time, the global downturn from 2008 onwards worsened the balance of payments. These two factors had a disinflationary impact which led to the drastic fall in growth in 2008 and 2009.        
	Both the downturn and the upturn were reflected in manufacturing, whose growth has shown a strong revival in recent months. The Outlook considers the possibility that the apparent revival is just due to base effect  that even if there is no upturn in growth, year-on-year growth figures show an upturn one year after the growth rate falls. It rejects that possibility by calculating growth over two years instead of one. That is clever; I wonder why the advisory council does not apply this superior method to all its comparisons.        
	The downturn of 2008 and 2009 has left the current account considerably worse; the question a forecaster has to answer is whether it will get back to a better shape or continue to worsen. The economic advisory councils answer is that it will get somewhat worse: imports will rise faster than exports, and invisibles will rise, but not enough to make up the difference. I think the council has underestimated visible imports. It has ignored the impact of the current bout of inflation on imports; they are likely to go up rapidly for some time. I also think that it has overestimated invisible exports. The great information technology boom has ended, and the growth in its exports will be negligible from now on. If so, the current account will worsen even faster than the council thinks. At the same time, it has been too optimistic about the capital account. A number of Indias big firms are running into a market constraint in India and are being forced to expand abroad; Reliance and Bharti are prominent examples. Their number will rise, and so will their acquisitions of companies abroad. The purchases could be offset by bigger purchases of Indian companies and shares by foreign companies; but I do not see any strong reasons for positing larger capital imports. So the steady accretions to reserves that the council has projected are unlikely to materialize; I think it perfectly likely that reserves will begin to fall before long.              
	How fast will they fall, and how far? The calculation becomes so speculative at this stage that one would need to have the gumption of the prime ministers advisers to make it. Let us just say that there is a 50 per cent chance that in three years, reserves will fall to a level that the government considers inadequate. That would be no problem. India was short of foreign exchange  or acted as if it was  from 1939 till 1991. It gained considerable experience in managing the shortage; at its peak, the government issued a million import licences in 1989, each with its modicum of delay and bribes. It was a stable equilibrium, for import licensing made exports unattractive, and made itself indispensable. The memories of chronic exchange shortage may have faded, but the machinery to deal with them has been kept in good condition by the department of commerce and the Reserve Bank. As soon as there is a crisis they will spring into action and take India back to the socialist era. Liberalization will be seen as a childish episode  fun while it lasted, but inappropriate for a mature leader of the developing world. Old import-export policy handbooks will be retrieved, and import licensing will be introduced for ten thousand import products. There will be six different types of import licences for big industry, small industry, tiny industry, public enterprises, infrastructure industries and residual industry; there will be 15 different forms of 15 pages each, and one more to describe which form should be used for what, and what supporting documents should accompany it. Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram, who destroyed licensing in a fit of youthful enthusiasm, will usher it back in their mature years. And the prime ministers economic advisory council will add a laudatory chapter on import-substitution industrialization (ISI) to its reviews of the economy.

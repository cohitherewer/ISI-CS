	Futile thoughts                  
	Sir  The Indian governments resolution to improve the lives of animals by providing them with proper food, shelter and a friendly environment is no doubt noble, but one wonders how far the plan is practicable in reality (Pet shop blues, May 17). Even as the fundamental rights of human beings are being violated with impunity, the governments sudden sympathy towards animals seems paradoxical. The State should first ensure that citizens live a dignified life before trying to provide better conditions for pets.          
	Yours faithfully,         Dilip Kumar Kar, Jalpaiguri
        
	More blood          
	Sir  The latest spell of barbarism unleashed by the Maoists  which killed 35 people travelling in a bus in Dantewada  once more affirms the depravity of the insurgents (35 killed in Maoist hit on passenger bus, May 18). The attack not only killed security personnel but also harmless civilians. Moreover, the Maoists have damaged several railway tracks across the country. This has put the lives of hundreds in danger. They have destroyed schools and deprived many children of education. Hence the Maoists should be treated like any other terrorists invading the country. It is high time the government took tougher measures against these insurgents.          
	It is also time to reassess certain perceptions about the Maoists. They do not believe in the democratic State and strive to overthrow it by violent methods. They have declared an open war against the Indian State, despite the government requesting them to abjure violence and start a dialogue. So the State has every right to combat them with full force to protect its citizens. The editorial, State and party lines (May 16), rightly states, Not to counter the terror is synonymous with surrendering the very raison dtre of the State. The argument that Maoists are our people, as espoused by certain intellectuals and civil society groups, is unconvincing. There can be no excuse for being soft on these insurgents. The people killed by the Maoists are also our people, and these premeditated murders must be taken seriously by the State.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The second attack by the Maoists in Dantewada, in which a bus carrying 24 civilians and 11 special police officers was blown up, is the last straw that broke the camels back. The home ministry must immediately take harsh steps to curb the violence perpetrated by this banned outfit. Modern anti-terror techniques should be used to contain them. The home minister should urge the army and intelligence personnel to chalk out more effective offensives against them without delay.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  Even before the dust over the slaughter of 76 jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force in Dantewada had settled, the killing of 35 people, once again at the same location, reaffirmed the rising danger of the Maoist threat. These attacks must be condemned strongly. The repeated strikes by Maoists indicate their growing strength. They use powerful explosives and are far more aggressive than the defence forces.          
	The governments failure to stop the Maoists cannot be tolerated any longer. These days, the Maoists do not even spare civilians. The Centre must quickly swing into action and, if need be, fully deploy its army and air force to fight the rebels before the situation goes completely out of control.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
N.R. Ramachandran, Ooty

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Nothing special about it
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT                          - Does Obama understand the British?        Ashok Ganguly                                                  
	If one happens to be in England at this time of the year, one comes across a few interesting and prominent themes running daily in the print and TV media. These include the BP (British Petroleum for Barack Obama and the Americans) underwater oil-well disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, the struggle of the coalition government of David Cameron and Nick Clegg with the United Kingdoms annual budget and the economy (it is not as bad as Greeces), and the English teams performance in the World Cup football tournament in South Africa.        
	Historically, and especially since World War II, the UK has claimed and the United States of America acknowledged, a special relationship between the two countries compared to the USs relations with other European countries as well as the rest of the world. This special relationship has occasionally been rocked  such as during the Suez misadventure, the UKs attack on the Falkland Islands, and so on  but basically has remained fairly firm. In recent times, the unstinted support of the former British prime minister, Tony Blair, for George Bushs misadventures in Iraq and Afghanistan reinforced the special relationship at a time when the rest of Europe was extremely cautious in its response and, in some cases, cynical about the UKs anxiousness to support America.        
	The UK-US relationship cooled somewhat when Gordon Brown succeeded Tony Blair, but its foundations remained intact and taken for granted. This historic relationship has undergone a change with Obamas entrance to the White House and the recent ascent to power of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition succeeding the Labour government in the UK.              
	While Nato has been fraying at the edges for a while, and Europe and the US are struggling to get out of the killing fields of Afghanistan (this may undergo subtle changes, based on the recent discovery that Afghanistan may have some of the worlds largest deposits of iron ore, bauxite, titanium, platinum and gold), the strains between the allies have become more palpable and open. BPs underwater disaster off the Gulf of Mexico has blown apart any semblance of cordiality between the UK and the US, and has created an atmosphere of full-blown public acrimony between these two countries.        
	The BP disaster, one of the worst in the oil industry, is being compared to the 9/11 bombing of the Twin Towers, and the American Congressmen and senators, led by Obama, have raised the ante of the BP episode (read the UK, Inc.), seeking the highest level of accountability and punishment for its executives (in words like we have our boot on the neck of British Petroleum). Consistently referring to BP as British Petroleum in the US (the companys change of name to BP is more than 10 years old) has served the purpose of defining the common enemy of the crisis  the British, while the CEO of BP is being mauled in the US media and in bruising congressional hearings. Friendly chats to cool the rhetoric between Cameron and Obama have remained just that, without changing the high-decibel American attitude and stance. The US government is in the process of forcing BP to create an escrow account of about $20 billion as potential compensation for damages before the BP board can consider any dividend payments to its shareholders, most of whom are the pension funds.         
	In other words, the US is treating BP as a foreign pariah although 39 per cent of BPs assets, business and shareholders remain in the US. Seeing the way the wind is blowing, in a display of corporate greed, the other major oil companies have now joined the bandwagon of BP-bashing by suggesting that BPs underwater oil-extraction technology was not robust enough and contributed to a disaster waiting to happen. They are behaving like circling vultures waiting to feast on the BP carcass while trying to persuade Obama not to ban underwater exploration and extraction off the coast of Texas, with its negative political and economic consequences. Their holier-than-thou stand has been demolished in another congressional hearing.        
	The high-voltage BP-bashing in the US has begun hugely to infuriate the British public and media. There is also a sense of being let down by an ally on whose side the UK has stood through thick and thin. Letters to editors, and some well-known columnists, now feel that Obama is behaving this way because he does not understand the UK and its special relationship with the US, as well as, say, Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr and Jr and Bill Clinton did, for Obama may not have the same sense of history as his predecessors, his origins being in the Pacific and his early upbringing in Indonesia.        
	Given the USs rhetoric on BP, some are questioning whether Obama would be prepared to set up a Bhopal fund for the 20,000 dead Indians following the Union Carbide gas disaster of 1984. This argument led me to wonder whether the UK government should have set up an India fund on the eve of their departure from India, for the 200 years of plunder and the holocaust following Partition.              
	Be that as it may, these recent events throw into perspective the whole concept of relationships among nations, special or otherwise. This also reminds me of Pervez Musharraf trying to forge a special relationship with the US after 9/11, and the current bonhomie between India and the US.        
	Some important and indelible lessons will emerge from the BP episode in the US. The rest of the world would learn from it how not to be carried away by the assumed competence of companies or the nature of the relationship between countries.        
	As far as the recovery of the British economy is concerned, the jury is likely to be out for a long time. How it got to its present state remains unclear. The Labour Party may not be entirely unhappy to take a back seat while the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats take the blame for the consequences of the mess they have inherited. But that is the nature of the political prize. It is ironic that the government has to reassure its people that the state of the British economy will not get as bad as that of Greece.        
	As far as the football World Cup is concerned, the blame game, a favourite British pastime, has well and truly begun. The 1-1 draw in its first match against the US was blamed on the English goalkeeper, and the coach, Fabio Capello, though thankfully not on the South African weather. The English team has ended its run soon and a new blame game has started all over again.

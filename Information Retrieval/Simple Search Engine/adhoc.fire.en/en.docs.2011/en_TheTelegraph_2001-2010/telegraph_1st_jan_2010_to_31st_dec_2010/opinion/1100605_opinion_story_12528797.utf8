The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Pots, pans, planes and prisons
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        Pots, pans, planes and prisons                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                                                  
	To call an exhibition Progress of Non-Abstract Geometry is to court a double danger. First, there is the risk of putting off the viewer with such a dreary title. Then comes the responsibility of clarifying what such a pedantic phrase may actually mean. The catalogue, in this case, does not do very much to demystify the jargon.        
	So it would have been sensible for Ritendra Roy to choose a less dull name for his solo exhibition at Akriti Art Gallery (ending today). However, the title, in this case, happens to do full justice to the work on display. Paintings as unimaginative as these do not deserve a better title. With their mostly lurid colours, these acrylics are not even properly decorative or particularly elegant. Discerning buyers of art, let alone real connoisseurs, will not want them anywhere near their drawing-room walls.        
	The trouble with geometric shapes is the infinite indulgence they afford to artists. Endless experiments can be done with interlocking planes and grids of colour. Children and wannabe artists are entitled to have a field day with squares and rectangles, light and shade, or criss-crossed lines and fluorescent colours. But the end product is not necessarily worth putting up on public display.        
	Roys architectural approach to interior spaces looks painfully studied. The human and animal forms that appear in silhouette seem to have been inserted as an afterthought. The occasional stonewash finish gives the impression of printmaking but the trick is neither pleasant on the eye nor does it particularly stir the mind. Pots and pans, in all colours and shapes, seem to be the recurring motif of this series. Their insistent presence only adds cosmetic value to the work without enriching the aesthetic content one bit.        
	One discerns echoes of Piranesis prisons in certain works, but without his gestural passion or emotional rigour. There is no harm in going back to books and theories for ideas, or even in revisiting the masters for inspiration, but intellectual debts must be made alive through personal idioms. For this transformation to take place, the artist needs to have an inner life, an intensity of feeling and individual vision of life, all of which seem to be lacking in Roys case.

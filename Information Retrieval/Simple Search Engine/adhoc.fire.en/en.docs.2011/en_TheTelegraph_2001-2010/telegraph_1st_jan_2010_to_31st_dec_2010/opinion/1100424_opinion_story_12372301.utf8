The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Lacking in imagination
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LACKING IN IMAGINATION                                  Uddalak Mukherjee                                                  
	One word that describes Fawzan Husains photographs perfectly is pretty (Faith, Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, till April 27). The exhibition  a series of images meant to portray the myriad links between man and faith  has been enriched by the colour, depth and the interplay of light and shade in the photographs. But the viewers engagement with the images is fleeting, for these photographs, like picture-postcards, lack the inner complexity that can make one think.        
	This particular project took shape when the 40-year-old photographer, goaded by friends and family, embarked on a spiritual quest to ponder the meaning of faith, life and death. The journey took him to different parts of the country, and helped him discover the eccentricities sometimes generated by faith. Thus, the contemplative tone that one often associates with religion has been replaced by a frenzied energy in this body of work.        
	However, what is disappointing to note is Husains inability to explore the theme in a new way. Every photograph  both the idea and the subject  appears clichd. Thus we come across (yet again!) Buddhist lamas in Leh, Rama and Hanuman alighting from a truck during Dusherra, enraptured Krishna devotees in Brindavan and the goddess with ten hands in Calcutta. Husain, given his background in photojournalism, displays an inclination for human drama. The photograph of an old devotee, surrounded by bare-bodied, delirious men hugging the deity in Maharashtras Ellora temple (picture) is good enough to startle a newspaper reader, but is unlikely to interest those who have been exposed to, and appreciate, subtler sensibilities. Husain, inexplicably, documents only the majoritarian communities and their practices. Numerically smaller communities such as Jains and Parsis, as well as the ones that have been least explored  minor sub-sects, followers of animistic cults  remain outside the range of Husains vision. These photographs, at best, are a considerably simplified representation of the complexities and diversity that are part of faith in India.        
	But there are glimpses of Husains skilful technique. Take, for instance, the photograph showing a man jumping into the river behind a priest who has come to wash a banana trunk at the ghat. The manipulation of depth and distance makes the falling man appear within the arc of the trunk. But a sound technique must be complemented by nuanced, complex thinking. Otherwise, the works of photographers like Husain run the risk of being labelled pretty, but unimaginative.

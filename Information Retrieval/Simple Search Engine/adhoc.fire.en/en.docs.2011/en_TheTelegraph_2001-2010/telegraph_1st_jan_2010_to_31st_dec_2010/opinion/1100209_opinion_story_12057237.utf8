	Inner cities                  
	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas article, Learning from America (Jan 30), can only be described as half true. The sweeping comments he makes while comparing India to the United States of America speak of his limited ideas about the latter.          
	With reference to America, he says, Not only does the company boss value the physical labour done by his employees, at home he is happy to work with his hands himself. Americans do their own work at home because it is too expensive to hire domestic helps, even for CEOs. So cleaning dishes or doing laundry at home is more about affordability than about the dignity of labour. And, the CEO of a company addresses the workers on the shop-floor as a fellow human, not (as would be the case in some other countries) as a superior species of being since workers can legally claim damages from the company for the CEOs misbehaviour.           
	In order to illustrate his point that family does not play an important role in America, he cites the example of Bill Gates, who set aside a modest inheritance for his children, and forbade them from working with or taking advantage of Microsoft. Since Gates has a fortune of over $70 billion, one can only wonder how modest the inheritance of his children would be. If one can name N.R. Narayana Murthy, whom Guha mentions, as an Indian figure comparable to Gates, then it should be added that neither his son nor his daughter is involved in any way with Infosys.          
	For Guha, in India, ones life chances are massively determined by the home one is born into, unlike in the US. He talks of parents in upper-caste and upper-class families shamelessly promoting their children, and making them follow their own professions to secure a good life for them. Guha should be told that businesses are inherited in the US as well. Walmart, Ford, Novartis are all family-controlled corporations.           
	Even political families are not an Indian speciality, as Guha thinks them to be. The Kennedys of Massachusetts, Longs of Louisiana, Daleys of Illinois, Tafts of Ohio, to name a few, are all American political families. While I cannot agree more with Guha on the fact that a rot runs deep in Indian politics, due, in large part, to the conversion of political parties into family firms, I can point at Manmohan Singh, Mayavati, Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar or Mamata Banerjee as examples of leaders who have not been introduced to politics by their families.          
	The difference between Barack Obamas situation and that of his Indian counterpart lies in the fact that Obama does not need his council of ministers to win elections. On being elected to the presidents office, he became a CEO who could choose his team members irrespective of their political affiliations. For that to happen in India, we first need to overhaul our political system.          
	Family ties, coupled with the school or college ties, work well everywhere in the world, including in the US. Where you got your degree from is one of the first questions you would be asked in your job interview. College admission can also be influenced by family backgrounds as it is common for American universities to accept students if one or both their parents are their alma mater, donors or sponsors. And, contrary to popular belief, State-run colleges do not come cheap in the US. Most middle-class families often have to take loans to enable their children attend such colleges.           
	The American version of the Indian caste system, which Guha castigates, is called racial profiling. Segregation in America is most visible in the areas dominated by the African-American community. There are no boundaries as such, but ghettos for the coloured people exist all over America. The inner cities, as these areas are called, lack all the basic amenities that most American neighbourhoods would take for granted.          
	Some of the things we could really learn from America are its systems of accountability, and checks and balances, rather than what Guha lists. The American respect for the rule of law is also worthy of emulation. While a lot can be learnt from America, we cannot apply American ways to Indian life indiscriminately, since the two countries represent very different cultures and peoples. We cannot hope to achieve anything by comparing apples to oranges.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Smart choice          
	Sir  As the controversy over the commercial production of the genetically modified Bt brinjal continues in India, I would like to add a few points to the debate (Food for debate, Jan 25). Bt brinjal is aimed at overcoming the problem of combating a pest particular to brinjal, namely leucinodes orbonalis or the Eggplant Borer. Farmers have to spray toxic pesticides on the plants frequently to get healthy and marketable quality of brinjals. The sprayings not only pose health hazards, but also raise the costs of production. Bt brinjals, being genetically modified, do not require pesticides for their growth. Raising the strains of Bt brinjals involves a technique by which the brinjal plant, during its entire lifespan, is impregnated with a bacteria, bacillus thuringiensis, which is harmless to the plant itself but kills all the target pests infesting the crop.           
	The commercial production of Bt brinjal will lessen threats to health by enabling us to eat pesticide-free brinjals. But the following points must be considered before any hasty decision is taken on the matter. First, a resurgence of pests other than the one mentioned may occur, as happened in the case of Bt cotton. Hence sufficient field trials over several generations of the plant must be conducted before starting commercial cultivation. Second, sufficient infrastructure should be developed to enable farmers procure seeds of Bt brinjal at an affordable price.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S.K. Raha, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is evident that the concept of genetically modified brinjals is not going down well with traditionalists. Health problems that come with many GM crops have prompted some European nations to ban such foodstuff. However, in India, where food prices are on the rise and the threat of food shortages is looming large, it seems that GM food is the right solution to the crisis.          
	Of course, the crops should not be cultivated at the cost of poor peasants. The formulation of laws which guarantee that farmers would not be exploited for business gains is necessary. But peoples aversion to Bt brinjals seems to have been caused less by their concerns for farmers than by their lack of belief in science and technology.                    
	Yours faithfully,

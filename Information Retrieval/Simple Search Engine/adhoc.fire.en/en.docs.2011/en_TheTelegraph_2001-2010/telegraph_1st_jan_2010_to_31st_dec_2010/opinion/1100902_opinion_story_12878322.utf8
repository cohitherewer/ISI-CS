The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A bit of this and a bit of that
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A BIT OF THIS AND A BIT OF THAT                                  Neha Sahay                              
	Twenty-year-old Sun Juan is both the epitome of the younger generation and its antithesis. The only daughter of highly educated parents  university graduates  Juan has just graduated from a prestigious university. To get there, she had to sacrifice the fun that goes with being a teenager in a country tuned in to young people. So while her classmates were at karaoke bars in high school, Juan stayed home studying. High school is residential in China, but after finding the atmosphere in the dorm too distracting, Juans mother, a teacher in an international school, got permission for her to stay home on weekends.        
	Juans mother was a schoolgirl during the Cultural Revolution, and remembers that era with fondness. The seriousness with which studies, and life in general, was taken has stayed on in her. Teenagers in uniform cuddling at bus stops are a common sight today, but Juan could have none of it  no boyfriends till you finish your studies was her mothers rule. If Juan had any spare time, it was spent on the piano.                
	Another goal        
	It all paid off. In her very first year, Juan was selected to represent her university in music. She received an invitation to enroll for a six-week music course in France, but gave it up after the promised ticket never came. Now, shes topped the exam for post-graduate admission into an even more prestigious university, one she has always longed to be part of, in her favourite subject: history.        
	But even after having attained this goal all on her own, Juan cant follow her hearts desire. She is such a good student that one of her professors at the university she graduated from just wont let her go. He has decided she should do her post-graduation in International Affairs under him. Is she happy with the decision taken for her? The tall, slim, lady-like Juan, back home for the holidays, shrugs.Hes the best in his field; and I want to be a diplomat. I guess Ill learn a lot, she replies.                
	Unique choice        
	Juans life could have been that of any upper-class Indian student  but for her recent trip to Africa. No one knows about it, not even her professors. Instead of going home to her parents during the Chinese New Year holidays, Juan volunteered to spend her new year in the Congo on a programme that involved teaching villagers. She spent four weeks in a remote mountainous village, a place with no electricity or running water, staying not in any guest house but with an African family. The programme organizers chose a house with an attached toilet, but Juan still cant get over the amazement she felt when she realized that she would have to take a bucket bath.        
	That one factor reveals the gap between India and China. Juan isnt part of Chinas elite; both her parents work, and own an apartment in a small, coastal city. Her grandparents were university professors. Yet, for her, a bucket bath is something that belongs to another world. Thats also what makes Juan so unique. Chinese youth dream of a successful career, preferably in America. Social work, even in their own country where its badly needed, isnt part of their world. Volunteering in Africa is simply unheard of. Perhaps Juan imbibed too much of her mothers memories of life under Chairman Mao, where schooling included working in the field, learning from peasants.        
	The 20-year-old is unique in another way too: true to her mothers admonishments, shes had no boyfriend. Now her grandmother, with whom she spends weekends while at university, wonders whether one so serious will ever find one. Juan wonders too.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Blinding attack
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BLINDING ATTACK                                                    
	The string of suicide-bombings in Kabul may have been one of the most audacious so far planned by the Taliban, but its message was no different from that of the previous attacks. By simultaneously targeting places frequented by the public  shopping centre, bank, cinema, hotel  the bombings sought to rip the veneer of security and normalcy and expose the failings of a government which is already suffering from a credibility crunch. It is not without reason that the first thing the president, Hamid Karzai, thought necessary to announce after the attack had been neutralized is that Kabul was under control. The coordinated mayhem was intended to create a sense of total chaos, and the presidents desperation to counter it shows that the Taliban have largely succeeded in their primary aim. Notwithstanding the heightened security, Kabul, like all seats of government, remains vulnerable to terror attacks that are also smear campaigns of a sort. Since the Karzai government has been contemplating a re-integration plan for the Taliban which is supposed to go under the spotlight in the London conference on Afghanistan next week, it was important for the Taliban to indicate to the world that they remain an integrated force that cannot be splintered by the lure of money, employment or education. In other words, they remain as invincible as before.        
	The suicide attack has undoubtedly humiliated the Karzai government. But a ray of hope in this insurmountable tragedy lies in the fact that the Afghan army, which led the counter-terror operation, found its feet on the ground for the first time. The feat has not gone unnoticed by the allied forces, which have been pinning their hopes of an early withdrawal on the Afghan armys coming of age. This, together with the recent developments in the Afghanistan parliament, creates a picture very different from what the Taliban are hell-bent on painting. Twice in a row, Afghan legislators have forced their president to revise his list of candidates to be included in the cabinet in keeping with his promise of a corruption-free government. The Karzai government is yet to come up with a roadmap on ridding the administration of corruption. But neither this failure nor the frequency of terror attacks should blind the world to Afghanistans signs of recovery, if not good health.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPLITTING HAIRS                                                    
	A woman died in May, 1988, allegedly set on fire by her husband and in-laws after they had poured kerosene over her. Convicted by a lower court of causing a dowry death, they appealed to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which acquitted the parents-in-law but upheld the husbands conviction. The trial court had sentenced the three to 10 years in jail and a fine of Rs 1,000 each. It must be asked, though, if an agonizing dowry death is any different from a cruel murder. The victim is dependent for her welfare on the very people who kill her. It is an inhuman breach of trust that not only annihilates a personal and familial bond but also assails the roots of the social structure. Is 10 years in prison enough?         
	The husband then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that every demand by marital relatives could not be termed a dowry demand under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. The Supreme Court ruled that a demand for money even after marriage is dowry-related cruelty. This ruling cuts through vaguenesses that benefit bullies who hurt and kill in order to extract cash and goods from their wives. But more significant perhaps is the fact that the convicted husband not only split hairs over the law under which he was charged, but also over an earlier ruling that a demand for money to meet a domestic expense could not be a dowry demand. Although the court remained adamant, it is the audacity of a convicted wife-killer that is most notable here. It springs from a deep-rooted cultural blindness: husbands and in-laws have a right to demand money and punish women who fail to get it. Perhaps it is time to consider stricter sentences for crimes of this kind, as well as to review the definition of dowry, if only to add to its technical definition all demands for money and goods that are coercive and exploitative.

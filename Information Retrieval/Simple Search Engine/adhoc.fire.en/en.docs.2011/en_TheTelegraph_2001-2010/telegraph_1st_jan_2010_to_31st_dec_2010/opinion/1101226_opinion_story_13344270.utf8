                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TAKE YOUR PICK                          - A wish-list for the new year        THE THIN EDGE: Ruchir Joshi                          Change is in the air                                              
	Its the time of year when you take a cloth and wipe off the crumbs of the twelve months that have just passed, clearing the table for the next meal, for the approaching series of inevitable disappointments that we call the coming year. Because this is the biggest unit of time that ordinary human beings work with, because most of us are not part of any five-year planning commission or marketing strategy group, we invariably try and knead in some leavening of hope and positive thinking into the mostly dry atta with which we will roll out the rotis of our next 365 days. Perhaps many of us are not even that pessimistic or even concerned. But for those of us who make Calcutta our home base, or home page, looking at what 2011 might have in store for the city is not a choice. Instead of looking at 2011 as an already formed and fated entity, a twelve-monthed monster coming to devour us, let us see it as a blank canvas or  to stick to the rickety food analogy begun above  a clean-ish kitchen with all the ingredients of a reasonable meal laid out on the counter. Lets be cautious and conservative and ask ourselves this: what are the eight things that we would reasonably like to see changed in Calcutta by this time next year? Once youve made your list perhaps the next question to ask is: which one of these eight things can I myself affect and how will I work to change just that one thing?        
	The trick of this game is not to get carried away. Since we are stressing the reasonable and the possible, its best to think of what is within your reach as an individual. So, for example, if youre in the higher echelons of the Trinamul Congress, it would be reasonable for you to think about how you will take over the reins of the state government and try to disappoint the deep scepticism the rest of us feel about your party coming to power. Similarly, if youre a billionaire based partly in this city, you could think about how you will use your CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) more effectively to provide drinking water or healthcare in the poorer areas around your factory or how you will support cultural events in the city. If youre a middle-class person of limited means and power such as this writer, you might want to set your sights a little lower, cast your net in a smaller pond. To contradict myself almost before the computer finishes processing the full-stop on that last sentence, let me now change the rules a bit: say, you make a list of eight things of which four can be as grand and utopian as you like, but which must equally contain four things you can change yourself  and it is from these four that you must pick at least one to make your project for 2011.        
	To set the ball rolling, heres my (inevitably quite middle-class and liberal) list:         
	1. The CPM gone by December 2011. I have one vote, I will try and cast it.        
	2. Calcuttas buses, taxis and autos all on CNG as ordered by the high court and various authorities. Nothing I can do about this except pray really hard to the Green Gods and environmental activists. Maybe if No.1 happens then this will become easier to implement. Maybe.        
	3. The Builders Rampage finally stopped, most of the citys surviving old buildings effectively protected by officials who are not susceptible to currency-barfi. Dream on, compaero  no party, Mamata or Khamata or Pranabata will mess with the money-bags who fund them. But it can be a reasonable dream that the lovely old buildings that give our city its character are restored and put to innovative use rather than being replaced by ugly blocks of glass and plastic. It would mean that we stop treating any and every old building as clutter sitting on a slice of real estate waiting to be devoured by a developer, that we can use the beauty and historical resonance of these buildings and their surroundings to humanize our streets.         
	4. Calcutta traffic massively cuts down on honking and, consequently, psychopathic driving also comes down. Hm. I know people are trying. Ive also been trying. Without worrying that I sound like a proselytizing kaku, I will continue to cajole, lecture, argue with each and every taxi driver I encounter; I will also ask all the people I know who drive their privates to consciously observe horn-free days. If thousands of us do this, we will eventually win it, decibel by cacophonous decibel.        
	5. Nandan cinema is a) free from the grip of the know-nothing Stalinist cine-zombies and b) seriously redesigned and re-equipped as a proper Art Cinema complex. Again, this centres around item No. 1, but theres no guarantee that people who take over the administration will be any better. I will keep track of what happens and lobby and campaign to bring the place alive to good cinema and film-related activities. May not happen, but then, weve all read the Bhagavad Gita so well treat Nandan as our Kurukshetra. So. A complete overhaul of Nandan and surroundings to free it from its Victorian corset of ageing concrete. Decent cinema, regularly programmed with no nepotistic or neolithic prejudice. A couple of bars and restaurants that draw people to the place and give them a venue to discuss the films theyve just seen. Spaces for music and other performances around the main building. A gathering point where the arts can be celebrated with cinema as the main focus.         
	6. Most plastic bags have disappeared from the city; the few that are there are being constantly reused. This seems a small issue but actually isnt. I will continue to take cloth bags to the market, and sealed containers for produce such as meat or fish, refuse plastic when vegetable sellers or shopkeepers offer it to me, return as many plastic bags as I have been forced to use. People may look at me as an eccentric today but in two or three years this will be the norm and not the exception.        
	7. Quirky public art has now begun to proliferate around the city in unusual spaces. Its not overambitious to try and change the mindset where people equate public art with huge monumental statues or murals and to generate work that creates dialogue between the artist and the common man. We can do small surreptitious things, mostly using found materials from the streets, to startle people and invite them to pause and think in settings that have no relation to pristine, walled-off art galleries and museums.        
	8. The massive clean-up of the Hooghly has begun and already we can see a difference in the water and in the relationship people of the city have with their river. Yes, its a huge task and its nowhere near being fully conceptualized, leave alone executed, but one can begin by thinking, wanting and demanding, at least in ones fantasies. A clean river, with spaces available not just for the moneyed and semi-moneyed but for the general public, activities and entertainments that do not exclude the citys working class and rising lower-middle class. Action on both sides of the river, including the river-front at Howrah and not just the shahebs-ghat-side on the east. Not exactly the London of the East the future Madam-CM might want but a vibrant, homegrown riverside that perhaps can match bits of Bangkok? It may take a few years to do, but it would be great if some solid, visible groundwork had happened by the end of 2011.              
	Well, thats my list. Others could have more comprehensive, perhaps less middle-class, itemizations of what they would like for the city by end-Egaro. Perhaps someone more dynamic than this opinionizer could set up a website and ask the public to send in their wish-lists and suggestions?

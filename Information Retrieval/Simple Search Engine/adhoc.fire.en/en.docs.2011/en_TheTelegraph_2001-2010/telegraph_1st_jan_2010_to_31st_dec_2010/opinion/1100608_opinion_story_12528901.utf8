                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WARPED CULTURE                                  Mala Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	We want the Kohinoor back but we cannot even keep our great sculptures in the National Museum happy. Greed always manages to take precedence over effective management of what we have. That is the sad truth about the complete lack of governance of our cultural institutions, repositories of stupendous artefacts representing centuries of civilization. The National Museum of India is headless. There are people who could have turned it around despite it being ruled by babus from the ministry of culture, but instead, there are extraordinary committees indulging in never-ending dialogues about how to do this and that, with no movement forward whatsoever  all this at the cost of India and its incredibly diverse culture.        
	Beautification in the eyes of the average babu means interspersing great sculptures in the gallery with half-dead potted plants! Bad lighting with zero imagination, let alone technical knowhow, makes you want to cry out in shame. The walls have been washed in weird CPWD colours, carelessly slapped on with no respect for quality. Silly windows loom overhead, from the high ceiling down three feet, with filthy, scant curtains hanging from broken pelmets. Our gods and goddesses, chiselled expertly with love and respect, awe and faith, sit on dirty, unkempt pedestals: unacceptable signages. It is the saddest space sitting on the prime axis of Rajpath and Janpath, bang in the centre between India Gate and Rashtrapati Bhavan, representing the worst aspects of an India that disregards its past.        
	Rather than have a ministry of culture mismanage our great bhandar, the government urgently needs to forge a public-private partnership without endless meetings that only elaborate the faulty reality, and never spell out solutions, or get on with preparing a fresh act for Parliament to endorse in the forthcoming monsoon session. Why are we so ineffective and disinterested? Whats the problem with establishing a new mandate and management plan? Who is going to steer this transformation? Self-appointed cultural tzars moan and groan about what needs to be done but do not manage to get anything going. Those with influence protect their access. A great deal of talk and no action. Deterioration continues unabated.                
	Gross neglect        
	The Museum Shop is in distress, the Museum Caf is operating like a dhaba, having got there on the lowest tender. This is no showcase for India. Compared to the Victoria and Albert Museum and The British Museum, both in London, The Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Louvre in Paris, The Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai, and the Mehrangarh Museum in Jodhpur, this national treasure is languishing in abject neglect and there is no excuse for it. Our nationalism is hugely flawed as it is based on wanting that which is being protected elsewhere and not respecting or conserving that which lies with us.        
	Many of our policies towards our material heritage are warped, our monuments degraded and often mutilated, our encroachment unfathomable, our rhetoric false. We need to learn to appreciate our legacy, our many-layered civilization, and evolve immediate strategies to involve civil society in the process of restoration and future conservation. Institutional heads need to be made accountable for allowing the rot to petrify and fossilize. Who is responsible for the conservation and celebration of our past? Have we consciously disowned our heritage?        
	Three strands define culture  the natural environment, a god-given treasure that we have mutilated for personal greed; the man-made reality of palaces and forts, places of worship, forgotten cities, early settlements that have been violated; and the skills that Independent India, in the last few decades, has ignored in the race to ape and clone a declining Western culture.

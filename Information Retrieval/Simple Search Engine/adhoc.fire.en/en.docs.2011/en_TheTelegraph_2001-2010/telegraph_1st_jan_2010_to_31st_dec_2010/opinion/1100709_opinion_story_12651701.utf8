	Unethical practice                  
	Sir  To protect patients from being fleeced by doctors, the government had banned the latter from accepting the largesse doled out by pharmaceutical companies last year (Other gifts, July 5). But who cares about the ban when such gifts have become the rule of law? Pharmaceutical companies are mushrooming all over the country. They push their brands to the patients through the doctors who are given incentives in the form of gifts, foreign tours and the like.           
	The drug companies begin to lure the doctors from the time they begin their internship. Medical representatives of various companies routinely visit government hospitals. They host lavish dinners and cocktail parties in plush restaurants for the interns and house staff. In return, the medicines of their companies are prescribed by the doctors. In this way, the financial burden is passed on to the poor patients ultimately.           
	Also, as the editorial points out, some doctors fear that a total ban on the acceptance of gifts would stop the funds for research that are often extended by pharmaceutical companies. I believe that such an apprehension is unfounded. Doctors should directly approach the Medical Council of India for funding projects, and never any pharmaceutical company.           
	However, it is indeed difficult to have control over private practitioners who are not employed with government hospitals. They are at liberty to randomly prescribe medicines as per the dictates of medical representatives. In Burdwan, private practitioners tend to give medicines with uncommon brand names that are available in a few select shops. These doctors have become so greedy that they are not satisfied only with their exorbitant fees. They would also deprive patients of every penny by stretching the lists of medicines, most of which are actually unnecessary. Nowadays, doctors are so addicted to drug companies that merely awakening a sense of ethical conduct in them will not help. Only strong deterrent action from the government can protect patients from unscrupulous doctors.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Like engineers, chartered accountants and lawyers, doctors are also professionals. But the medical profession demands a greater degree of accountability since it deals with human lives. The tendency of Indian doctors to accept gifts from pharmaceutical companies needs to be restrained to shield the practice of medicine from undue influences. It is also necessary that pharmaceutical companies promote their products in transparent ways. But the onus of ethical conduct rests with the doctors. Unless a doctor is willing to adhere to the fundamentals of his profession, no government ban can ever help patients.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Vanishing land          
	Sir  In the early 1950s, I still had a few relatives living in an old north-Calcutta suburb, Dum Dum Gorabazar, where you had iconic factories such as Jessop amp; Company Limited, the HMV recording station and, of course, the Dum Dum Central Jail. As a young boy, I often used to visit my relatives place, which was near the Dum Dum railway station. I was fascinated by the Barisal Express to the then East Pakistan that passed through this station everyday in the late mornings. Opposite the railway station, in the area known as Subhasnagar, there were vast tracts of land lying mostly vacant, with a few houses thrown in. But it was being filled up fast, largely by refugee families.          
	A few minutes walk into the new colony of Subhasnagar would take you to a Muslim graveyard, where a few of my relatives were buried. Although not much care was taken of the graves, candles were lit every year during the nights of Shab-e-Baraat. There was a large pond next to the graveyard. Soon, a small road was built by its side, and the entire area came to be known as Subhasnagar Maidan, managed by a self-appointed maidan committee. The land began to be used for matches and other social activities, ignoring the sanctity of the graves. Slowly, encroachment began, and the first victim was the pond, presently reduced to a quarter of its original size.          
	After many decades, I went to the area to find the graves of my ancestors. I was shocked to discover that the area looked like an excavation site, with all the graves dug up. A monstrosity has been constructed there that, I was told, was a part of the galleries meant for an upcoming stadium. The pond, or what remains of it, is being cemented on the sides so that it dries up in no time and becomes usable land for further constructions. I was devastated by the sight of the graves of my ancestors vandalized. It seems that para mastans with political clout will not even spare the dead for commercial gain.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Ezaz Ahmed, Calcutta

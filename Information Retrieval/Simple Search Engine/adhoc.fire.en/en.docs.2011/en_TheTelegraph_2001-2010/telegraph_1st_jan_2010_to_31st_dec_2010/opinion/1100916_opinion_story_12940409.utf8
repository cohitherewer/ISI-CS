	It is unfortunate that the withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act is being made the horse to pull forward the political process in Kashmir. So far, it had been one of the many roadblocks in the path towards peace. Given the adoption by Kashmirs mainstream parties of this core separatist agenda, the status of the AFSPA today is being used not only as the sole criterion to judge the Centres commitment to solving the Kashmir riddle, but also as evidence of the extent of its willingness to support the Omar Abdullah regime in the state. Naturally, first the cabinet committee on security and then the all-parties meet were expected to unequivocally proclaim on the revocation of the AFSPA. Although there was nothing to stop participants in either of the meetings from deliberating on the issue, neither could have pronounced on the dilution of the legislation for the simple reason that the power to do so remained with Parliament. There could have been a decision on lifting from Kashmir the disturbed area tag that brings into force the working of the AFSPA, but given that the situation in the valley is nowhere close to being peaceful, such a conclusion would be akin to jumping the gun at a time such daredevilry could be dangerous. The indications on the ground are sufficient to suggest that a partial withdrawal would not do anything to drastically alter the situation in the valley. The separatists want a total revocation  which is impossible at this point of time  as a precondition to dialogue. And a partial withdrawal may achieve nothing more than massage the ego of the state government.         
	There is a need to rescue the dialogue on Kashmir from the clutches of the rhetoric on the AFSPA which is obfuscating the urgency to evolve a political solution. The AFSPAs phased withdrawal has to be made conditional on the speed with which the political impasse is resolved. As for the need to address the peoples anger and sense of alienation, other equally important avenues need to be explored. One is to reorganize, retrain and sensitize the police and paramilitary forces which have, recently, critically undermined political stability. The state administration could also look at the possibility of releasing some of those booked under the Public Safety Act to build public confidence. Nothing, however, should skew Indias avowed stand of zero tolerance to human rights violations, be it by the police or the army.

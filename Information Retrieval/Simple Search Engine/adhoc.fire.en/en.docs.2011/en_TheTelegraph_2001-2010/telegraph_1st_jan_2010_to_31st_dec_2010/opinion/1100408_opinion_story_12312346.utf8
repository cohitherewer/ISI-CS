The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | End of a private universe
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        END OF A PRIVATE UNIVERSE                                  With changing tastes, the cult of the great detective is now on the wane, writes Ipsita Chakravarty                          A scene from the movie, Sherlock Holmes (2009)                                  
	The private eye holds up a magnifying glass. As he surveys, a scene builds up. Heavy furniture, perhaps, and a window inexplicably shut. A smell of bitter almonds, improbable cigarette ash, strands of a womans hair. Maybe a paperweight with a dark stain on one side, or a length of silk cord. We know he will see a body, coshed, strangled, stabbed or poisoned. Then other faces come into view, grieving, frightened or sullen. We know he will settle on one face at last; the face of the murderer. Everyone loves a great detective.        
	The private investigator dreams of the perfect crime. Unburdened by the formalities of the police force, he spots clues that everybody else misses, has information that the authorities dont, and delights in decoding the tangle of events that surround the crime, much to the discomfiture of cloddish policemen. A formidable intellect, the story builds itself around this central figure. Taking the cue from Sherlock Holmes, iconic private investigators have dominated much of 20th-century crime fiction, especially in the period between the two world wars that has come to be known as the golden age of crime fiction. As the character of crime fiction changed over the years, so did that of its investigators. The cult of the great detective is on the wane.        
	When Watson visits 221 Baker Street after a period of time, Holmes instantly deduces that his friend was practising medicine again, had walked in bad weather, and had a clumsy servant-girl. Watson exclaims that had Holmes lived a few centuries earlier, he would probably have been burnt on the stake. A century later, it is possible that his theories would not be believed. Yet when Holmes explains them, pulling at his pipe, surrounded by strange chemical apparatus in his little room in the innards of Victorian London, all the force of his brooding, cocaine-shooting, Paganini-playing personality behind his words, there is no question of doubting him. Holmes has the glamour of a rock star, brought back to life by public demand after his creator, Arthur Conan Doyle, kills him off in The Final Problem. Jeremy Bretts portrayal of the character in the televised series is not without a hint of camp to the modern viewer, a dramatic performance of the act of detection itself.         
	The cult of the great detective, then, is also a cult of personality. Stylized, larger-than-life, they command the story-telling through strategic silences and dramatic denouements. We are interested in the story because of this central figure. Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christies Belgian detective, sits in an armchair and exercises the little grey cells. A little man with an egg-shaped head, a florid moustache and a weakness for sirope, his eyes gleam with the thrill of solving a problem. Dorothy L. Sayerss Lord Peter Wimsey is an aristocrat, a war hero and a blade. He effortlessly solves crimes in swashbuckling public-school speak. Others are less flamboyant. Christies Miss Marple is a fluffy old lady with an unerring nose for killers. G.K. Chestertons Father Brown, a Catholic priest, cracks mysteries armed with an umbrella and an implacable innocence.         
	These super sleuths are often pitted against criminals who are as clever and powerful, almost their darker doubles. Holmes is nearly defeated by Professor Moriarty, and Father Brown meets his match in Flambeau. Both criminal and private investigator share a rocky relationship with the police. Next to Holmes, the likes of Inspector Lestrade are reduced to yapping bloodhounds. While Poirot is on good terms with the hearty Inspector Japp, he regards Giraud, the Parisian detective, with distaste. The gruelling routine of police work is not for the private eye. He deals in elegant solutions to aesthetic crimes.        
	The detectives of the golden age operate within a certain milieu, a romance of country houses and afternoon tea, of fireplaces and bone china, a loving description of a life slipping away after the first world war. Murder strikes in family gatherings, on cruises or during dinner parties. It is often an intimate mystery, tied up with the characters who play a part in it. Sanitized of sex and violence, many of the novels written in this era form the genre of the cosy.        
	Once the canvas of crime fiction expanded, the characters who peopled it seemed to diminish. George Simenons Maigret series explores a hostile Paris. Tired, nondescript killers emerge from its alleys and characters float in and out of the story. Simenons novels have been cited as examples of the police procedural, which pays close attention to the way the force functions. The irritable, insomniac Inspector Maigret signals a new breed of investigators. They belong to the police force and are skilled in their job. The authors often volunteer details about their personal lives; P.D. Jamess Inspector Dalgliesh is also a poet and a widower. Yet they lack the glamour of the earlier detectives.               
	The act of detection is often shared by a team. The focus shifts from individual acumen to a systematized body of technical knowledge that must be applied in solving crimes. Cigarette butts and lipstick stains give way to bank card details. The intimate and the aesthetic are replaced by the forensic and visceral. Television series like CSI (Crime Scene Investigation) and Bones, weaving cases around forensic evidence, are not squeamish about blood and gore. A sense of anonymity has settled on crime. Global terror plots and mass murders dwarf the individual. Audacious rogues have become unknown serial killers at large in a dangerous and enigmatic city. The detective begins to resemble his quarry: faceless, impossible to distinguish in a crowd. Pushed to extremes, this anonymity develops its own nightmares and neuroses. In the TV series, Dexter, the protagonist is a serial killer employed as a forensic expert. He tracks down other killers and murders them. A century after Holmes battled Moriarty at the edge of a precipice, the threat becomes an actuality. The face of the detective is the face of the murderer.

	Message received                  
	Sir  Julian Assanges WikiLeaks has exposed an uncomfortable number of secret diplomatic cables of the United States of America. It would be prudent for the US to try to repair the damage done instead of going after Assange (Hollow core, Dec 10). If the global establishment wants to prosecute Assange for the leaks, it would also have to condemn newspapers such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Guardian  which have worked hand-in-glove with Assange on his mission. One doubts if the US, or any international institution for that matter, would want to earn the wrath of the global media. To look at it differently, all that WikiLeaks has done is expose the inherent flaws in the American governments database management system.          
	But it is true that the documents uncovered by WikiLeaks have done great damage to the USs relationships with other countries. However, if Assange is to be convicted by the US legal authorities, his trial has to be fair. It is doubtful whether any American law can rightfully condemn Assange. He could be charged under the espionage act, but its provisions are ancient and may be insufficient to convict him. The first amendment to the US constitution ensures freedom of speech, and this stipulation could be violated if Assange were prosecuted for disseminating information to the public. Hence, the US is now resorting to dubious tactics, such as blocking the WikiLeaks website, making online payment service providers like Visa and MasterCard prevent WikiLeaks from using their services, and urging Sweden to press rape charges against Assange.          
	But extraditing Assange to Sweden is not going to be easy. Assange has vowed to fight his extradition. The support base for WikiLeaks is swelling all over the world. Supporters of WikiLeaks have already launched cyber attacks on Visa and MasterCard websites and threatened to close them down. On the other hand, some US senators like Mike Huckabee have called for Assanges execution. The ire against him may be counterproductive.          
	The US must be more careful in guarding its secrets and should enact a new law to protect itself against such leaks. An efficient web security system is a must for a nation. It seems that Assange is not alone; he may be the representative of a larger community of cyber activists who have teamed up against the US. Prosecuting Assange will not solve the problem of hackers targeting State secrets. Instead, the US should be more careful henceforth.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I wonder what the motivation behind the WikiLeaks expos is. What is its founder, Julian Assange, trying to achieve through the latest set of revelations? The WikiLeaks disclosures have been praised by many who believe that these will make governments more accountable and foreign policy more transparent. However, most of the leaks are likely to damage the USs diplomatic machinery and its reputation. The disclosure related to Pakistan and nuclear weapons was significant, but the other revelations have only served to jeopardize international ties without doing any real good to the world. However, people now have a clear idea of how American foreign policy works. This may prove to be important in the long run.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Julian Assange seems to be a victim rather than a criminal. The US has now launched a witch-hunt against him, fearing that he may defame it further. The release of the diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks was applauded by critics of the US. The US authorities are terrified of Assange and are desperately trying to silence him. But today, technology has advanced so much that it is difficult to stop people like Assange from carrying on with their cyber-activism. It is ironic that the technology usually used by the State machinery has been subverted to reveal State secrets.          
	Assanges claim that he is only the messenger has a sinister ring. This might mean that cyber assaults against the US would not stop even if Assange were to be prosecuted. Supporters of Assange are likely to continue with their activism even more forcefully after this. One feels that it would be wise for the US to leave Assange alone and concentrate instead on ways to guard itself against cyber attacks. After this debacle, the US would have to work harder on improving its image.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Looking forward to change
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LOOKING FORWARD TO CHANGE                                  THIS ABOVE ALL: Khushwant Singh                          No slips                                        
	On Friday, August 20, all the six newspapers I get were full of advertisements paying tribute to Rajiv Gandhi on his death anniversary (August 20, 1944  May 21, 1991). He was a handsome young man and very photogenic. He deserved to be remembered as he was assassinated by Sinhalese Tamilian terrorists while doing his duty. What baffled me was why this year, page after page was devoted to his memory  which was much more than what had been done in the intervening years. I came to the conclusion that these ads were primarily meant to draw the attention of Sonia Gandhi, as good-looking as her husband, and her son, Rahul, who resembles his parents and has put new life into the Congress, which is in ascendancy while all the opposition parties are in deep decline. These advertisers wanted to ensure they would not be overlooked in the next general elections. They are plain and simple matlabis  patronage seekers.        
	Lets have a look at Rajiv Gandhis record as prime minister. He took over from his mother who was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards on the morning of October 31, 1984. Hindu-Sikh relations had been fouled by the hateful utterances of Bhindranwale and the crimes committed by his gangsters. The situation needed firm handling. But Rajiv was a greenhorn in politics and sought advice on how to act. One of his closest advisers advised him to teach the Sikhs a lesson. So instead of going out onto the streets and pacifying angry mobs of Hindus as his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, had done in 1947 to stop the massacre of Muslims in Delhi, he let the lieutenant governor of Delhi order the police not to intervene with the Hindu mobs thirsting for Sikh blood. The rioters killed several thousand innocent Sikhs and looted their property. Rajiv mishandled the Shah Bano case; he allowed Hindus to install idols in a portion of the Babri Masjid. He sensed that things had gone wrong and worked to mend matters. He called a meeting of about a dozen MPs and asked his home minister, Boota Singh, whether the families of victims of the massacre had been rehabilitated. Boota Singh assured him that all had been rehabilitated. I contradicted him and named Charanjit Singh, who had not yet got compensation. Rajiv ordered his finance minister to look into the matter. The next day, the machines of Charanjits soft drink factory were released and he received full compensation.        
	Rajiv had promised to clean up the Ganga  it is now dirtier than before. He was a failure as prime minister. It was many years later that his wife, Sonia Gandhi, made the Parliament issue an apology to the nation for the massacre of 1984. As opposed to Rajiv, Rahul Gandhi and his mother, Sonia, have not slipped even once. My guess is that after the next general elections, there will be a change of addresses: Sonia and her son will move from 10 Janpath to Race Course Road; Manmohan Singh and Gursharan Kaur from Race Course Road to Rashtrapati Bhavan.                 
	Bit by bit                
	A couple of years ago, I had introduced my readers to Sumita Misra, IAS, now a senior officer in the Haryana government, by publishing her poetry. A collection of her poems is soon to be published in Chandigarh. I take the liberty of publishing a poem entitled Evening Walk to let you judge the quality of her work.
  To assemble lifes jigsaw,
  Slowly, bit by bit,
  With misshapen pieces,
  That dont quite fit;                
	To balance the deadweight
  Of each insistent day.
  With the weight of gossamer
  Dreams that refuse to go away;                
	To stride with the wind
  And breathe in the colours of spring,
  Knowing that you may never
  Like those homing birds take wing;          
	These, or similar are tales untold,
  Each life has a secret story 
  Whose living is courage itself,
  More real than any fable of glory.                
	Four stages                
	Identify the 4 Hs where a person spends his time at one stage or the other of his life.        
	Answer: Home, Hostel, Hotel and Hospital.

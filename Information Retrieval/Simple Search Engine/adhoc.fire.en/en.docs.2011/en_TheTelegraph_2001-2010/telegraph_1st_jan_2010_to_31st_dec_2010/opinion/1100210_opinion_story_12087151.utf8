	Q: I have let out my flat for 11 months on lease and licence basis. Due to financial constraints I want to sell the flat and issued a one-and-a-half-months notice (one months prior notice is required as per the agreement). My tenant had promised to buy the flat within that period. But I gathered from elsewhere that he has no such intention. What should I do if he does not vacate or purchase the flat?         
	S. Gupta, Calcutta                
	A: Since your licensees intentions dont seem to be bona fide, the only option for you (if he doesnt vacate your premises) is to file a suit for eviction against him. However, you cannot compel him to buy the flat unless there is an agreement to that effect. In that case too you would have to file a suit for specific performance if there is a breach of agreement.              
	Q:I have been a tenant of a flat for the past 50 years. The owners  through the holder of a power of attorney (POA)  filed an eviction suit against me, which they lost. Now they have sold a part of the property (not the flat that I reside in). I pay the rent regularly to the rent control office. Recently, the POA holder approached me with an offer to buy a flat for me if I surrender the tenancy. How can I protect my interest and proceed with this offer?        
	Kalyan Kushal Bose, Calcutta                
	A: Please do not surrender the tenancy in haste. Take the assistance of a competent advocate to settle the terms and conditions between you and the flat owner and complete the legal formalities required for registration of any deed in your favour.         
	Q:The multi-storeyed building I live in has 18 flats and three shops. One shop owner is opening a fast food centre here. We opposed his proposal but he paid no heed. We are afraid that our health will be seriously affected if a commercial kitchen operates here. How can we stop him?        
	Name Withheld                
	A: First find out if the shop owner has permission of the municipal commissioner or a municipal licence to run a fast food centre on the premises. Section 421 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1980, provides that an eating house cannot be established without the written permission of the municipal commissioner. Section 435 of the Act makes it mandatory for any trade or business to obtain a municipal licence, the absence of which will attract a punishment of six months imprisonment, a fine of upto Rs 5,000, and also a daily fine.

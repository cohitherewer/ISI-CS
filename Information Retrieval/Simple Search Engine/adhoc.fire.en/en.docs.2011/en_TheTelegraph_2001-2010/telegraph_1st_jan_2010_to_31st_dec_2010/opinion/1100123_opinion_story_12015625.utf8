The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Water on a ducks back
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WATER ON A DUCKS BACK                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Doing their bit                                        
	I get a four-page letter written in longhand from a retired colonel, now permanently settled in Satya Sai Babas township, Puttaparthi. He writes that while on a trip to Kerala very recently, he met my parents enjoying the jungle scenery. My parents have been dead for almost two decades. They told the colonel sahib that they were disturbed by my lack of faith in any religion, and would be grateful if he put me on the right path. Hence his long epistle, with the promise that if I so desired, Sai Baba could bring my parents to see me.         
	To say the least, I was completely bewildered by the mans faith in Sai Baba, whom he evidently believes to be the living incarnation of god. I would have dismissed the retired colonel as a nut case but for the fact that I know many others, whom I hold in esteem, sharing the same point of view.         
	Among them are Nani Palkhivala, perhaps the most distinguished constitutional lawyer of our country and Bhagwati Prasad, retired Chief Justice of India. And then there is O.P. Mehra, retired air chief of staff and governor of Rajasthan, whom I meet regularly at board meetings of Hotel Le Meridien. I am a diehard rationalist, and all this talk of conversing with dead people and miracles goes over me like water on a ducks back. However, I was touched by the colonels concern for my future, and wrote back to him thanking him for the trouble he had taken in writing to me. Was there any other way I could have responded to this gesture?                
	Think about it                
	The number of women who wear saris is rapidly declining. School and college girls prefer to wear skirts or salwar-kameez. So do working women, who, in certain regions, wear ghararas. Fancy ladies and film stars wear long European dresses in which they can better display their curves. In any event, saris are now made in mills, and handloom weaving is dying not-too-slow a death.         
	Millions of handloom weavers are in dire straits. Two years ago, the Planning Commission decided to do something for them. Syeda Hameed hit upon the idea of getting some famous film personalities to promote the cause of weavers. She tried Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan and some others, but without any success. Then through the good offices of Sharmila Tagore, she got in touch with Aamir Khan. He was busy shooting Taare Zameen Par, but promised to get in touch with her later. He did so two months ago, and heard of the sorry plight of handloom weavers. Last month, he and Kareena Kapoor were all over newspapers and television channels trying their hands at weaving in a Madhya Pradesh village. They wove material to make a three-piece suit and a sari which they wore at the premiere of 3 Idiots. They did their little bit to draw the nations attention to the poverty-stricken weavers.        
	Believe it or not, a weaver earns a mere Rs 1,000 for a sari which takes him about 90 days to weave. It is sold for Rs 9,000 to 25,000. What does he live on?        
	There are others involved in ameliorating the condition of weavers. There is Sally Holkar doing her best to keep Maheshwari saris in the market. And then there is Taramati Kulkarni, who is doing her utmost for organizing exhibitions of Warli saris. If we do not do more, our world famous Benarasi and Kanjeevaram saris will become legends from the past.

	One night while sleeping, I was restless as there were a lot of mosquitoes attacking me. My wife was snoring away next to me. When I found too many mosquitoes sucking my blood, I got up in disgust, switched on the light and sat up. One mosquito was bloated after having a full quarter of my blood. I caught it and asked, Why the hell are you sucking only my blood and not my wifes?        
	Because I like O+ and relish that brand. Your wife has B-, which does not agree with me.        
	But you must try B- also, I pleaded.        
	Oh no! You know flying becomes difficult if you mix drinks.

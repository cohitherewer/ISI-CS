	The threat that the Maoist rebels pose is not to any government of the day but ultimately to the Indian State. That was what the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had in mind when he described the Maoist rebellion as the greatest threat to Indias internal security. Any responsible government has a constitutional obligation to fight and defeat such forces in the interest of the rule of law. The Centres decision to launch Operation Green Hunt in tandem with the governments of the four Maoist-infested states of West Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar is, therefore, a welcome move. But the absence of the chief ministers of Jharkhand and Bihar from the meeting with the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, in Calcutta, points to the problems the anti-Maoist operation may face. Both the chief ministers, Nitish Kumar of Bihar and Shibu Soren of Jharkhand, are believed to have put local politics before the question of national security. Their absence can damage the prospects of the operation in two ways. It can embolden the Maoists and help them exploit political differences among the mainstream parties to their own advantage. Worse, their unwillingness to endorse the operation can demoralize the administration and the police in the two states and create major gaps in logistics and strategy. Effective coordination among all the agencies involved will determine how much the operation can achieve.        
	However, the fight against the Maoists has long been embroiled in the debate over the States failure to reach development to the poorest of the population. Nobody can deny that acute poverty and social and economic exploitation have much to do with the spread of the Maoist rebellion, especially in areas inhabited by tribal people. The note that West Bengals chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, submitted at the meeting with Mr Chidambaram is itself an admission of that failure. In Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar too, tribal-majority areas are the Maoists strongest bases. Successive governments, both at the Centre and in the states, have talked about a twin approach to fight Maoism  by using force and speeding up development. But it has mostly been empty rhetoric. If the anti-Maoist operation is a necessity, so is an urgent and realistic development plan to end centuries-old social and economic deprivations that tribal people suffer.

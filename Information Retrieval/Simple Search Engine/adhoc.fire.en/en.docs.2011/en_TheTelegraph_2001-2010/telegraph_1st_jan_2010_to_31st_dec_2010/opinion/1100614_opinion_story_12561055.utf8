                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPOIL THE CHILD                                                    
	As if the cane by itself is not good enough, a school in Assams Lakhimpur district now has an intoxicated headmaster who beats up students with a stick. Seven students were allegedly injured by their reportedly drunk headmaster while they were playing football during recess. This comes soon after a Class VI student died in Azara in Assam after being allegedly caned by two teachers. That death and grave injury caused by corporal punishment so often give rise to discussion and public dismay is in itself a disgraceful indicator of the level of Indias values regarding children and their education. The Supreme Court directed the states in 2000 to ensure that children were not beaten up and were educated in an atmosphere of freedom and dignity. Other courts, too, have condemned corporal punishment. It is now illegal and can call forth severe penalties. All the national plans, policies and charters for childrens education and their rights have prohibited corporal punishment since the Supreme Courts directive. So the far greater disgrace lies in the fact that beatings, kneelings and other forms of hurtful punishment continue to do as much harm as they used to, taking lives sometimes, damaging limbs at other times, and most often destroying trust, confidence, dignity and the desire to go to school.        
	Law does not change reality; it provides a reference point, raises awareness levels and offers the promise of recompense. In the case of corporal punishment, it is clear that the law has not been able to deter physically aggressive teachers or even make them aware of the boundary between disciplining and unchecked cruelty. Confusing matters somewhat, there is a strong current of opinion that children need to be punished or they will run amuck. It is the balance between firmness and violence that is lacking, showing up the inadequate training of the teachers. Their stubborn use of excessive violence shows how serious the latter problem has grown over the years.

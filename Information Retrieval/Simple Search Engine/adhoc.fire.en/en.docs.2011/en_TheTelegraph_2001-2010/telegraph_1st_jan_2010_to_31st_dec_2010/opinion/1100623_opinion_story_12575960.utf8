	In place                  
	Sir  The report, Delhi lobs library book at publishers (June 15), says, The Indian government has riffled through its scriptures to find a quirky law to satiate a rediscovered appetite for free books. It is wrong to suggest that the government has, all of a sudden, brought out the Delivery of Books and Newspapers (Public Libraries) Act 1954 from the archives, as it were, to get free books at the cost of publishers. This act is very much in operation in India, as are similar legal deposit acts in other countries of the world. The fact that during the last year, the National Library of Calcutta received 35,000 books under this act proves that the law is quite alive, and publishers are probably more aware of it than the reporter is.           
	Legal deposit laws are nothing new. Almost all countries across the globe have their own legal deposit laws. The purpose of such laws is to make new publications available to registered readers of national libraries to ensure their preservation for future generations, to make them a part of the national heritage, and to enter their names in the national bibliographies. One of the earliest forms of this act was the Montpellier Ordinance of 1537 enacted by the French government. Under this ordinance, any published book had to be delivered to the kings library for the purpose of conservation. In England, under the Copyright Act 1911, which has now been revised to the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003, six copies are to be submitted by publishers free of cost to designated libraries. When such laws are common in most nations, why should a fuss be made about the delivery of books act in India?           
	The amendment proposal of the delivery books act of 1954 has been drafted after long discussions with the representatives of publishers associations. The law may now have non-printed materials under its ambit. I have been present in many of these meetings, and found only cooperative publishers. It may also be noted that the Indian National Bibliography, an authoritative list of books published in different Indian languages and in English, is compiled in the National Library of Calcutta on receipt of books under the delivery of books act. Needless to say, the national bibliography could not have been compiled had the deposit law not been in place.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I was quite amused on reading the report, Delhi lobs library book at publishers. Many of the well-established publishers of India have been scrupulously following the Delivery of Books and Newspapers (Public Libraries) Act 1954 all these years, and sending all their new publications, expensive or not, to the public libraries. But I doubt whether these libraries have enough space to store and manage the books being sent to them. When libraries across the world are going digital, it seems that some babu in the ministry of culture wanted to safeguard his job, and having found no other way to do so, suddenly thought of threatening all publishers with the quirky law.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
N. Nagarajan, Secunderabad 

                
	All new           
	Sir  The article, Unhappy ark (June 8), paints a very gloomy picture of the Zoological Garden, Calcutta. As the director of the zoo, I am compelled to respond and provide a balanced view.          
	It is no secret that in the past few decades, there has been little development in the infrastructure of the Calcutta zoo. However, the zoo does have its share of success stories. In the recent past, it has successfully conducted breeding programmes for marmosets, white fallow deer, sambar, Manipur dancing deer, swamp deer, tigers, various pheasants, giraffes and so on.           
	Quite a few open-air enclosures have been built for the white tiger, lions, primates, elephants, bears and various species of deer, keeping in mind the well-being of the animals concerned. In August 2009, the management of the zoo was overhauled completely to make things work better. The following new steps were taken: increasing the security arrangements, new and better enclosures as per guidelines of the Central Zoo Authority, improved veterinary care, visitor management facilities, research, providing support to other zoos, and rehabilitation of the Sunderbans tigers in the wild. (The list is not exhaustive, I mention just a few.) In addition to these, high capacity pumps will be fitted in the zoo to remove algal growth from the moats. The kitchen, along with the storeroom for animal food, is being modernized and will be fully functional by mid-July. Three full-time veterinary doctors have been engaged to provide round-the-clock care for the animals.           
	I think that these measures are not primarily aimed at enhancing the commercial gains of the zoo, as hinted in the article. Introduction of boating facilities inside the zoo is not there in the masterplan. However, for a zoo to become successful in the line of the Singapore zoo, there is no harm in finding avenues for generating better income. After all, it is expensive to feed and maintain so many animals, and the abovementioned measures do cost money. The zoo needs the help of well-wishing volunteers and NGOs. I will be happy if interested organizations approach the zoo for providing such help. I acknowledge that the zoo still has a long way to go, but with positive feedback, hard work and support, we can achieve what we are striving for.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Raju Das, Calcutta

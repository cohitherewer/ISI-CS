	Freedom call                  
	Sir  Myanmars military dictators have finally released the pro-democracy crusader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (Walking free, Nov 15). Suu Kyis release should be marked as a day of celebration for the advocates of human rights and democracy. It should also be remembered as the day when democracy and human rights triumphed over dictatorship. We should not forget that Suu Kyi could have been freed years ago had China desisted from supporting the military regime in Myanmar.          
	The joyous moment notwithstanding, let us not forget the other political prisoners who continue to remain incarcerated by the military rulers in Myanmar. Suu Kyi has been freed, but this should not be interpreted as a sign that democratic reform is imminent in Myanmar.          
	There is another question that comes to mind in this respect. Did the junta order Suu Kyis release to get the international community off its back? Who knows, the junta may put Suu Kyi under house arrest again if it failed to draw political advantage from its latest move.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad             
	Sir  Democratic nations are celebrating the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. Statements containing fulsome praise for this iconic leader are pouring in from world leaders such as the American president, the British prime minister, the United Nations secretary-general and the European Unions commissioner. However, Indias response to the momentous event has been rather lukewarm. The minister of external affairs  not the prime minister  described Suu Kyis release as the beginning of the process of reconciliation in Myanmar. What does India mean by reconciliation? If it means a step towards restoring the freedom of speech and expression and an end to human rights abuse, the external affairs ministers statement failed to mention them explicitly. For Indian leaders, reconciliation perhaps means Suu Kyi falling in line.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is heartening to note that Aung San Suu Kyi was set free without any pre-conditions. Suu Kyis courage and determination speak volumes about her fight for democracy. She is an institution in herself, and an inspiration for all those who cherish democracy and self-rule. Suu Kyis imprisonment was an injustice inflicted upon her. The military junta should hold talks with her and the other ethnic groups to establish peace. India and China are Myanmars neighbours, and they should see that peace and stability continue to reign in the region.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir The news of Aung San Suu Kyi gaining freedom from a period of long detention has been hailed as a victory for democracy and civil rights all over the world. This, however, is only a small step towards the bigger goal of dislodging the junta and bringing democracy to Myanmar.          
	The daughter of a Burmese freedom fighter, Suu Kyi studied in Oxford. On returning to Myanmar, she spent a number of years in prison or under house arrest for raising her voice against the military rulers. Suu Kyi always possessed considerable courage and determination and lived in the hope that things would change sooner than later. She boycotted the recently held elections. The people of Myanmar have never deserted her. On the day she was set free, thousands thronged to her residence and chanted slogans in her name.           
	The bold lady will now have to play the role of a crusader to bring about civilian rule in Myanmar at the earliest. This is not going to be an easy task.The entire world will be waiting to see how this gutsy lady goes about restoring democracy in the country. Now that she is free, Suu Kyis voice will be echoed more forcefully and embolden the pro-democratic and anti-autocratic movements all over the world.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, Walking free, was a wonderful exposition on Aung San Suu Kyi  a woman who has been fighting to institute democracy and human rights by ousting Myanmars repressive military regime. Suu Kyi was not well known till she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Suu Kyis battle in favour of freedom and civil rights is unparalleled. The whole world welcomed the news of Suu Kyis release and the jubilation of the people of Myanmar knew no bounds. She is an inspiration for all those who are battling despotic rulers anywhere in the world. It is reported that Suu Kyis release has been unconditional. The world will be hoping that the fiery lady succeeds in her crusade.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Adhip Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Aung San Suu Kyi spent 15 of the last 21 years of her confinement under house arrest. On the expiry of the latest house-arrest term, she was set free by the military rulers of Myanmar. The juntas move actually signifies the victory of the spirit of liberty over tyranny.          
	The supreme sacrifice made by Suu Kyi is on a par with those made by Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi, who had spent long years in jail, succeeded in liberating India from the clutches of the mighty British. Mandela too spent over 20 years in jail and ended white rule in South Africa.          
	Suu Kyis goal is yet to be achieved. But once she is reunited with the people of Myanmar, she will surely succeed in reinstating democracy in her homeland.                    
	Yours faithfully,

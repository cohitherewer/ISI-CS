                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DISORDER AND DESPAIR                                  Malvika Singh                              
	With the revelation of the shameful truths behind the preparation for the prestigious Commonwealth Games, other sad realities come to the fore as well. India, it seems, has been taken over by the real-estate and mining mafiosi because that is where the money lies. Both these sectors, if they can be called that, are in the business of raping the land and causing irreparable environmental and ecological disasters. Rumour has it that in Mumbai, there is a move to take over one of the last remaining green areas, the Turf Club and race track, to build yet another set of expensive, ugly, concrete structures that reach out to the clouds in vain. The governing authority everywhere in this lost land of ours abets such activities and does not enforce the existing laws that lie dormant in our statute books.        
	When the Asian Games happened under the immaculate stewardship of Rajiv Gandhi and his small group of dedicated administrators, there was the usual critical banter by armchair lefties, who continue to cry out the same slogans today, against the event and the fact that the then prime ministers son had been given charge of the Asiad. However, the difference is that those were non-opulent, civilized days in comparison to now, and there wasnt that abiding need to make a quick, unaccounted buck off anything and everything.        
	There was a dignity, self-respect, confidence and style in the personalities of the people involved. They did not have to be on-the-make. The past decades were peopled by men and women who wanted to build institutions we could be proud of.                
	Course correction        
	It is another matter that generations of administrators that followed cared little about anything that deviated from political economics. The deterioration of all socio-cultural institutions ensued. That is when loot replaced corruption and India lay exposed to unthinkable brutality. It is as if we are witnessing the fading away of a civilization. In the past millennia, cities have been buried, rivers have shifted their course, mountain ranges have sprung up as a result of geological churnings, and this may well be the moment when shifts are about to take place and destroy what we have mercilessly assaulted for so long.        
	The acute aesthetic sensibility we had has gone for a toss. Crass, ugly, inflexible, dark and desolate structures dominate our new urban landscape that has become the victim of careless architecture, taking alien elements from this, that and the other, and merging them into a thoughtless and unwieldy mess that defines the modern in present-day India. Trying to be what we are not has polluted our habitats. From the great cities of the past we have diluted ourselves to the level of structures that are small replicas of the worst of Soviet Russia. The horrendous blocks of reinforced concrete that mar skylines wherever development is happening are a reminder of where we are going wrong, and radically so.        
	Can corrections come into play, or is it already too late? As far as the CWG is concerned, the government could appoint a regulator with statutory powers to ensure that processes are conducted with probity and integrity in an effort to salvage the mess. Licenses for reckless mining in certain areas must stop regardless of who wields political power in those regions. Careful mapping should be done and specific areas demarcated for mining activities within sacrosanct boundaries. Real estate operators have offered homes, for nominal sums, to authorities that have permitted deviation from the law. A fearless national leader who believes in India and its civilization, can enforce the change and bell the cat. The time is ripe for the last attempt to shift course.

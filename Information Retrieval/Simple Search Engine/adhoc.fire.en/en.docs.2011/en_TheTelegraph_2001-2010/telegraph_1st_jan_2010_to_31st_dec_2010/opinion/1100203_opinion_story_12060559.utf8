	Q:My son joined a multinational company in July 2008. There was no talk of a bond during his campus interview in May 2007. But before joining, he had to sign a Rs 2-lakh bond covering two years at 18 per cent interest. He quit after a year because he wanted to study further. As I am the guarantor, the company has served me a legal notice to pay back Rs 2 lakh. As is usually the case, the agreement is completely one-sided. What will happen if I dont reply to their letters? Can I try to negotiate for a mutual settlement ? Am I bound to pay the entire amount?        
	Subhas Sengupta, via email                
	A: Reply to the letters at once and negotiate for a settlement with the company. Though agreements such as bonds are one sided (better known as Standard Form contracts), they are legally binding and enforceable in a court of law under Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, which is founded on the principle that one should not gain unjust enrichment at the cost of another. Bonds executed by executives or trainees cover expenses for the training voluntarily enjoyed by them and the same is not intended to be gratuitous.              
	Q:I work in Qatar. My father, who lived in Calcutta, died in a road accident in April 2000. The accident was caused when two vehicles  in one of which my father was riding  collided. At that time, we had filed a complaint with the police, mentioning all details of the vehicles. The police had also seized them. We hired a lawyer to fight the case for us but after two months she told us that as the insurance of one of the vehicles had expired, we could not claim any compensation. Is this true? If not, how and where do I have to file a case to claim compensation?         
	Amalesh Kumar Prasad, Doha, Qatar                
	A: You can still put up a claim for compensation against the owner of the uninsured vehicle or against the insurance company of the other vehicle involved in the accident. Make an application as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and file it before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal that has the appropriate jurisdiction. You can file the case in the tribunal within the jurisdiction of which the accident occurred or within the limits of the jurisdiction of which the claimant resides or carries on business or within the jurisdiction of which the defendant resides. Since you stay in Qatar and this Act is applicable only in India, you could constitute a power of attorney in favour of a person well-versed with the facts of the case.

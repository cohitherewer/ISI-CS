	Aung San Suu Kyi is free. How wonderful  quite unbelievable. When Archbishop Desmond Tutu wrote this in his foreword to the second edition of the Myanmarese leaders autobiography, Freedom From Fear, he had no idea that the celebration would be so short-lived. For most of the next 15 years, she was back under house arrest. As she walks free again, the worlds delight cannot but be mixed with a sense of unease about the military juntas motives. It would be nave to see her release as reflecting a change of heart for Myanmars ruthless rulers. Their motives were indicated by the electoral fraud they perpetrated on the country and its people on the eve of her release. Ms Suu Kyi can now publicly react to the fraud in only one way  by totally rejecting the polls. No matter what democratic masks the generals wear, her rejection of the polls will make the regime look even more illegitimate to the people of Myanmar and the world at large. It is inconceivable that she will not use her freedom in order to carry on the struggle that she has come to symbolize.        
	It is inconceivable too that the generals would stomach this and let her be truly free. But, despite doubts and forebodings, her release carries an overwhelming message of hope for the future of freedom. Ms Suu Kyi has always acknowledged three great influences on her life and work  Mahatma Gandhi, Buddhism and Aung San, her father and leader of her countrys struggle for freedom from British rule. She may have been influenced just as much by Nelson Mandela, who holds the record for serving the longest prison term  28 years  and who, too, learnt his lessons from Gandhi. Ms Suu Kyi has remained an unwavering Gandhian in her total commitment to peace. All this makes her the formidable fighter for freedom that the military rulers are so afraid of.        
	This fear of freedom has been at the heart of tyrannical power throughout history. The former Soviet Union had the same fear about people like Andrei Sakharov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. It was the same feeling that made communist China see red when the Nobel Peace Prize this year was given to Liu Xiaobo, the countrys leading campaigner for democracy and human rights who is serving an 11-year jail term. Ms Suu Kyi has repeatedly said that her struggle for a free, democratic Myanmar must be seen as part of mankinds desire for life without fear and oppression. Her release, therefore, is best seen as a new light that will kindle hope for prisoners of conscience in other places. It should inspire world leaders and freedom-loving people everywhere to speak up against tinpot dictators and oppressors of other varieties. A beginning can be made with a crusade for Mr Lius freedom.

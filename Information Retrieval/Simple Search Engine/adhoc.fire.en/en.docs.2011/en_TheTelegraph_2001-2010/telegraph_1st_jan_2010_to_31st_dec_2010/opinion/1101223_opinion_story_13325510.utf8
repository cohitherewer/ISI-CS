The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Taste buddies                                                              
	On a fine afternoon, on my way to office, I sat with utmost patience in a stationary autorickshaw whose driver simply refused to get started in spite of having got his quota of passengers. I found this strange, since working under the compulsion to make as many trips as possible in a day, Calcuttas autowallas generally shuttle at breakneck speed to and from their destinations. Looking around, I discovered why the driver was suddenly behaving like a lotos-eater.         
	The lotos took the form of sweets of every kind nolen gurer sandesh, kancha golla, kheer kadamb  which my co-passenger, a sweetmeat-seller armed with two huge tiffin-carriers stuffed with the choicest goodies, was serving to the auto-drivers. As the drivers popped the delicacies into their mouths, they forgot how to wrangle  no mean feat given their pronounced talent for squabbling  and an unexpected hush descended upon the auto stand. The spell ended as soon as the seller, a redoubtable lady in a white sari, demanded her due. The drivers dispersed after reluctantly parting with their money, some started quarrelling again, and mine jumped onto his vehicle to fly us to Rashbehari.         
	I learnt that day that one of the Bengali equivalents of two-minutes noodles is mishti. If in the mood for something nonta (salty), Bengalis opt for bhelpuri, jhalmuri, or any of the several preparations made with puffed rice. Indeed, we seem to have a particular attachment to muri. Jhumpa Lahiri acknowledges this fondness when she makes the homesick Ashima crave for it in The Namesake. For this Bengali housewife exiled in America, muri becomes one of the things that preserves the quintessence of the life she has left behind.        
	Ashima had to make do with rice crispies when she couldnt procure muri in Seventies America. She would have been surprised if she knew that in Calcutta today, jhalmuri comes in packets, which have the rather dubious catchline, Makhamakhi, phataphati (mixed and mashed, fabulous), written on them. But one shouldnt be amazed, for packaged jhalmuri is perhaps a sign of Bengal catching up with America at last, by producing street food in factories and making pidgin out of its language, among other methods.         
	Yet there are still certain things that globalization cannot touch, phuchka being one of them. Thoughts turn heavenwards when teeth crunch on the fragile balls with mashed potatoes at their centre  giggling belles forget all about self-consciousness for the moment, naughty schoolboys hatch plans to beat up their teachers, middle-aged men become oblivious to persistent stomach trouble.         
	Every night at Ballygunge Station Road, I watch office-goers gorge on every kind of street food  from phuchka, telebhaja, kachuri to dhoklas and momos  before catching the train home. Almost invariably, there is a surreptitious look in their eyes, as if they must make the most of the last few minutes of freedom they have got to spend away from the two prison-houses called workplace and home staring belligerently from either side. When they leave for the platform, they look like Eve who has just had the forbidden fruit  glorious, satiated and sad, in the knowledge of sin.       ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

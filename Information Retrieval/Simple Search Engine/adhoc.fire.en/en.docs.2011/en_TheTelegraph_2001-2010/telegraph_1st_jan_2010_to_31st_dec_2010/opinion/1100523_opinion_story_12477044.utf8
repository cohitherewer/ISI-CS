The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | to bid or not to bid
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TO BID OR NOT TO BID                                                          
	An unnecessary fuss has been created over 12 paintings by Rabindranath Tagore that are to be auctioned by Sothebys in the middle of June. There are no prizes for guessing the origin of the storm in a teacup. Like most things concerning Tagore, it originates in West Bengal and from no less a person than the chief minister of the state, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who, it is said, knows most of Tagores poems and songs by heart. Mr Bhattacharjee is disturbed by the news of the auction. It is difficult to comprehend the reasons for this disquiet. Common sense would suggest that it is up to the owners of the 12 paintings  the Dartington Hall estate in South Devon  to decide what they want to do with them. The paintings have been in the Dartington Halls collection for nearly 71 years, and no one in India has shown the slightest interest in them. The news of the auction has galvanized Mr Bhattacharjee to write to the prime minister to take steps to get the paintings back to India. It would appear that some people have objections to the idea of an auction of Tagores paintings.        
	Yet, the fact of the matter is that the only way the paintings can find their way back to India is by buying them in an auction. The government of India or some other agency at its behest would have to make a bid at the Sothebys auction. Here a relevant point needs to be raised. If the government of India is serious about acquiring paintings to build up its collection in the National Gallery of Modern Art or in any other museum or gallery, why should it bid only for Tagores paintings or the works of any other Indian master? The government of India, to show its appreciation of art, should also take steps to acquire works of international masters. Why shouldnt museums and galleries in India hold and display paintings of Picasso, Matisse or Rembrandt? Art and its appreciation should not be confined to or determined by national boundaries. No one has ever argued that Matisses paintings should all come back to France and those of Picasso return to Spain. The plea to get back Tagores paintings is based on a vague patriotism that sits uneasily with a genuine appreciation of art. Indian art- lovers and collectors (institutions and individuals) should be enabled to participate in the global art market.        
	A further and inevitable question grows out of the colossal indifference towards art in India. A visit to any government museum/gallery in India will show how badly the Indian masterpieces are displayed and preserved. Nowhere are the best practices of international galleries followed. The works of Tagore are perhaps better off in a gallery abroad. At least they will be looked after there. In India, they would gather dust or even disappear, as did his Nobel Prize.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MISSING VOICES                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Many eulogies have been spoken and written about the life, times and persona of Jyoti Basu. He was of the old and gracious school of intellectuals  educated men and women who entered public life, committed to their ideology and beliefs, lived by their values, and served the nation. You could agree, or agree to disagree with their positions, but you could always engage with them within the democratic processes and norms set by the Constitution. With his passing, the number of respect-worthy politicians has diminished further. Amongst the first tributes, Prakash and Brinda Karats voice and words were missing. Mamata Banerjees voice was there.        
	When I asked a friend why this was so with the Karats, I was told that the politburo would make the rigid, turgid and emotionless condolence statement. Trying to make sense of the sensibilities of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) from the outside, it seemed clear that the days of liberal communists, engaged with a changing world, have nearly ended. An open-minded but committed Jyoti Basu represented that very important ingredient, essential for a healthy democracy. His rhetoric was never abusive or demeaning. Differences were clear, discourse was civilized, and so was the method of opposition to policies, directives and realities on the ground.        
	Unfortunately, there is an in-between generation that has managed to reduce the level of political and social discourse to depths that make one uneasy and uncomfortable. The greed and intellectual weakness that have overwhelmed our political class have become a matter of much shame. They have suffocated the growth and development of India as a progressive, modern nation.                
	Accursed nation        
	The next generation holds promise, and the younger elected representatives appear to be in the mould of the earlier, first lot of post-Independence leaders. This may be wishful thinking but equally, it better be true. India cannot be exploited anymore by its small coterie of politicians and bureaucrats. Their closed ranks have destroyed governance and the rule of law. They must be made accountable, and the top leadership must be made responsible for ensuring that. To dilute the essence and spirit of India and then hand it over to the next in line are unforgivable. Therefore, correctives need to be put in place urgently.        
	Symbols are very important. The one symbol that defines the breaking of the law is the white ambassador car that says government of India, has a beacon on its head, and a driver whose arrogance is worse than that of his master. The driver breaks every road rule, parks where it says no parking, does U-turns where they are banned, drives on the wrong side of the road on a one-way street and gets away with murder. He then pees on a wall and gambles with other drivers while waiting for saab or memsaab who pretends to be oblivious to every contravention of the law. Traffic policemen allow these special cars to break all rules and wave them on  a blatant dereliction of their official duties. But India bungles on, with its top brass breaking the rules, regulations and norms. The curse of one billion people, who have been assaulted by this horrific corruption of the mind, body and soul, is bound to take its toll sooner than later.        
	Our growth trajectory has been good in spite of the faulty policies, the bureaucratic stranglehold, the frightening deterioration of honest governance and the open insult to integrity. We have failed to give ordinary, law-abiding, good citizens a life of dignity. We have been unable to protect the good from the bad, the right from the wrong. We have lost the moral ground as a result. It is for this reason that India does not command respect in the region. This is why Chinese influence is dominating in all our neighbouring countries. This is shameful.

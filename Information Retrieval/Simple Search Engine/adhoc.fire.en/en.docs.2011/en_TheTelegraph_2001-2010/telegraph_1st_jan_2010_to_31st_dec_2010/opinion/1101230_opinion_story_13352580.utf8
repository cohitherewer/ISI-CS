	Last blunder                  
	Sir  The Left Front seems determined to realize its aim of setting up a school education system under the panchayats instead of upgrading the existing rural schools under the state education board (Last throes, Dec 23). A.P.J. Abdul Kalam once said, Small aim is a crime; the crime of the Left Front government began with the elimination of English from primary schools in Bengal. This caused parents to avoid government schools and take their children to private ones in the hope of giving them a better education. The Left has once again failed to fulfil the ambitions of millions of Bengalis. Led by narrow interests, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is misusing the powers of the government in a desperate effort to gain political mileage for the forthcoming assembly elections.          
	Ideas conceived with narrow objectives seldom succeed. It is true that there are many villages in Bengal that need new schools and many schools are overcrowded. Building new schools under the mainstream education board is of utmost importance at this time. What does the government hope to achieve by setting up schools under the panchayats? There is enough reason to be sceptical about the standard of learning in such schools, given the fact that they would be managed by people who have no established qualification to run an education system.           
	In fact, the peoples experience of Bengals panchayats is rather bitter. These bodies are largely controlled by local political leaders. It is likely that when panchayats get to run schools, local party bosses will dictate the administration and recommend the appointment of teachers. Of course, these loyal teachers in panchayat-run schools will help the Left win the polls. The system will also enable party leaders to fill their pockets with bribes and donations. The culture of sycophancy will thrive among young people looking for jobs in these schools.          
	These fears are evidently not baseless. Bengal has, for long, witnessed the biased functioning of panchayats over the issuing of BPL cards and other such matters. There must be public debates over the West Bengal panchayat board of education bill. Scholars and experts must be consulted before it is made a law, so that the education system can be saved from the clutches of the Left.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subrata Pal, Karimpur, Nadia

                
	Sir  The way the controversial West Bengal panchayat board of education bill was pushed through the state assembly is preposterous, given that the combined Opposition had walked out in protest. If the bill is made a law, panchayats will be empowered to run rural schools with more than 18 lakh students. The Left Fronts eagerness to set this bill in motion seems to be fuelled by its desire to regularize the jobs of around 55,000 teachers, who may then feel grateful enough to vote for it.           
	It is evident now that the Left uses the education system as a vote-winning tool. It never had any discussion with experts and academics before introducing random changes in West Bengals education system. This proves its thoughtlessness and obstinacy in dealing with education and other issues related to the well-being of the people.          
	The thought that the inept panchayats of Bengal will now decide the fates of students is horrifying. Of all the Lefts ugly experiments with education, this one is the ugliest. In its desperate attempts to win back lost ground, the Left has displayed a pathetic shamelessness. But its efforts may not able to save it from sinking after all.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Rita Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Left Front is about to commit a huge blunder by passing the West Bengal panchayat board of education bill. This quick-fix solution for students in villages is bound to be a disaster. The governments logic that students who have passed Class VIII do not have access to Madhyamik schools because of lack of seats is ridiculous. The solution it has proffered is equally absurd. It does not answer vital questions about the prospects of students completing Class X from the panchayat-run schools who will face a similar, or graver, problem in gaining admission to Class XI. This foolish step will jeopardize the careers of an entire generation.          
	The West Bengal governments decisions regarding education have promoted an inferior standard of learning rather than excellence. When the state-run education board is in a horrible condition, one can well imagine the fate of a system under the panchayats. The bill will also add to Bengals burden of debt. But the states development or students future is of little importance to the chief minister and his party. Votes are their only concern at this moment. Civil society should protest against the enactment of the new education bill. The governor, who is supposed to take the final call, should wait for the assembly polls to be over before endorsing the bill.           
	Yours faithfully,

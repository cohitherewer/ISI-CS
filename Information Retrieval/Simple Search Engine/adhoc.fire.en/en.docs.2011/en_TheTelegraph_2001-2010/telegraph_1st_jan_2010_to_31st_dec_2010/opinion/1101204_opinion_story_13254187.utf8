	Twenty-two men kicking around a round leather ball could be a Martians description of soccer. What such a crude portrayal would not capture are the skill and athleticism of the 22 players, especially if they are good ones. It is this display of footwork, stamina and overall fitness that makes football the most exciting sport to watch either on the ground or on television screens. The football world cup is thus indisputably the most popular sporting event in the world. A measure of the attraction of the game is the attention given and the tension generated by the awarding of the world cups to be held in 2018 and in 2022. It is entirely possible that many of the individuals involved in making the selection through a bidding process may not be around in either 2018 or 2022. It is also possible that the volatile politics of the contemporary world with its utterly unpredictable currents could alter the present status of Russia (to host the Cup in 2018) and of Qatar (to host it in 2022). The uncertainties of the future in no way diminished the enthusiasm of the present. In a way, the excitement for world cups to be held eight and 12 years later, respectively, has already begun even without a ball being kicked and a goal being scored. This is the scale of the popularity of football.        
	The awarding of the world cups to Russia and Qatar has evoked reactions that are not at all surprising. The English, who at one time taught the world that it was not proper to be a bad loser, reacted in the worst possible way with allegations of corruption and the dire prediction (made by Boris Johnson, the mayor of London) that Fifa cannot last in its present form. One reason for this kind of adverse reaction was probably the fact that England had sent a very powerful team to Zurich, where the bidding was taking place. The team was led by David Cameron, David Beckham and Prince William. The heady blend of power, royalty and sports brought no joy to the English and, therefore, they have taken to showing the red card to Fifa. Sometimes the English find it difficult to accept that the sun set on their empire five decades ago.        
	The voting in Zurich reflects the new and emerging priorities before Fifa. It would be no exaggeration to suggest that these priorities mirror changes that have begun to take place in the global economy and world politics. For a very long time, the West, particularly western Europe, has played host to the world cup. In 2018, it will be the first time that the world cup will be played in eastern Europe. In contrast, it has been played in western Europe 10 times. For Qatar and for West Asia, it will be a debut in 2022 on the stage of world cup soccer. Football is travelling in pace with its growing popularity and fan following. It is true that on the football pitch, the Latin American and the Western European countries and players dominate. This could also change as the talent pool for kicking a leather ball around expands.

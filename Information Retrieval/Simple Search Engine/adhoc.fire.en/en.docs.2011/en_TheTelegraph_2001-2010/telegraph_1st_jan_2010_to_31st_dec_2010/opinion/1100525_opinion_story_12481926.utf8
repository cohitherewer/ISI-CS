The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Poised on a razors edge
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        POISED ON A RAZORS EDGE                                  The spontaneous candlelight gathering for Madan Tamang shows the peoples need for true leadership, writes Gopalkrishna Gandhi                          The people of Darjeeling hold a candlelight vigil on May 22                                  
	The present moment is a razors edge. The words are Nehrus. He said something to that effect to show how, at the heart of the real moment, when a response has to be made, a decision taken, a choice made within that fraction of time, everything except the voltage of that moment is meaningless.         
	We go through such moments all the time. We stand on that edge, over small matters and not-so-small ones. Madan Tamang died on that edge. And by it.        
	The picture showing him slumped and crossing over to the other shore with an incredible smile on his face I will never be able to erase from my minds eye. He is clad, in that picture, like most men in Darjeeling generally are  in a pair of informal trousers and good strong shoes meant for walking on tough roads, slippery roads, rock, reed and root. They lie encasing his dying feet in a pool of dying blood.        
	I did not know Tamang well. He called on me almost each time I went to Darjeeling. He would come unfussily, speak briefly but pointedly, leave with the firm handshake he had greeted me with, placing a well-written and neatly typed memorandum stating his purpose on my desk. You can read this at your leisure, Excellency.              
	His sense of Darjeelings history always impressed me, not just for its sequential integrity but for the way he related it to the present moment. It too had an edge to it. But one that was very different from the edges one is all too familiar with, those of ego, of hubris.        
	It was clear to me that my appreciation of his discussions with me was not quite reciprocated. He would have liked me to have responded faster, better and more visibly to what he perceived was wrong and unjust in Darjeeling. For him the Darjeeling problem was about more than a new geo-political status. It was about how power games are played out, how a peoples aspirations can morph into private ambitions.        
	It is not as if Tamangs political career was exempt from the tactics of alliance and misalliance or the familiar pattern of trust reposed and betrayed. But there was in him a freedom from that bane of Indian politics  short-termism, to call opportunism by a better name.         
	Like all children of those hills, Tamang had courage. But his courage had a distinctive feature. It was the courage of a Gorkha among the rest, but also of a Gorkha among the Gorkhas. It was the courage of the daring bushel on a hill that is used to only one tree at its crest.        
	Ostracized until the other day, gheraoed, ridiculed, abused, threatened, he stood his ground. And on his ground, called it a day. The spontaneous candlelight gathering at Darjeelings Chowrasta to express grief and solidarity with the slain man grew in no time from a mourning handful to a throng. No party had summoned it, no leader orchestrated it. The people of Darjeeling found themselves doing what they did reflexively. This shows more than our peoples ability, so pure and unmotivated, to grieve for a person. It shows our peoples need for true leadership, which is different from playing leader. It shows something even more important than that. It shows how fear and violence, for all their seeming power, are temporary masters and fake ones at that.        
	The Gorkha people and others living there who are not Gorkha but children of the Himalaya no less, and those from the plains who have made the Darjeeling hills their home, need to savour democracy, with its options and opportunities, its scope for free belief and expression, including the option of voluntary silence. That opportunity and that facility has eluded the rainbow population of those hills all these years. It must come to them.              
	The murder, in cold blood, of Darjeelings dissenter has been perpetrated by the politics of intolerance which is inconsistent with democracy. It ought to rouse urgent action to bring the perpetrators of violence to justice. More, it ought to make society and our political class deny vengeance and vendetta any space.         
	The leaders of opinion, of parties and of movements in Darjeeling must now take pause and reflect on the course that democratic articulation must take in their beautiful hills. They must shun the politics of violence and of vengeance, of bandhs and blockages. They must pursue their democratic goals democratically, their constitutional goals constitutionally, through fair and free elections fought without fear and won (or lost) with grace.        
	Paradoxical though it may seem, democracies have to be intolerant of intolerance and disallow the disallowance of political rights. Nowhere is this more important than in areas where democratic processes have encountered resistance and subversion, and in places where strong feelings of identity prevail, with sub-identities also seeking a voice.              
	The swift and unambiguous statement of the governor of West Bengal, in which he described the outrage in Darjeeling as an attack on our democratic process, and one that will not be tolerated any longer, was aimed directly at the perpetrators of the fell deed. It must also be seen as a message to those who choose silence and inaction when one right word spoken at the right time, and one right step taken on the razors edge, can make all the difference.

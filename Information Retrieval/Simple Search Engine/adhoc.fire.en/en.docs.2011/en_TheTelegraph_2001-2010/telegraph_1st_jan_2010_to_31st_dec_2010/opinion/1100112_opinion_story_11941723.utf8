	Due credit                  
	Sir  I have read Chetan Bhagats novel, Five Point Someone, and have seen the movie, 3 Idiots. Truth be told, a good portion of the movie does seem to be adapted from the book, although it cannot be denied that a lot of original input from Rajkumar Hirani and his team has also gone into 3 Idiots. The controversy over the film, with Bhagat alleging that the filmmakers have borrowed the story from his novel without acknowledging him, could have been avoided if Bhagat had been given due credit (Ask Vidhu only if you are an Idiot, Jan 2).          
	The producers and the director admit that they were inspired after reading Five Point Someone, and created a story out of it. It is immaterial to argue now whether two or 80 per cent of the movie has been adapted from the novel. I do not think Bhagat is pursuing the case only for the sake of publicity, since he already has enough of it. At the same time, everyone likes to ride a wave of success, especially of a blockbuster like 3 Idiots. Bhagat is no exception. He never said that he had been paid less than expected. He just wants to be credited prominently for the story, and what is wrong with that? As it is, there are millions who have read Bhagats novel and can easily relate events in the movie with those in the book.           
	I hope that authors are given their dues if their stories are adapted for films. The behaviour of Aamir Khan and Vidhu Vinod Chopra at the news conference was disgraceful. Khan is reputed as one of the more cerebral actors of Bollywood who shuns publicity. Yet he embraced the media when it came to promoting his film, and called Bhagat a publicity seeker. Chopras attitude, asking a journalist to shut up, was sickening. It is not as if 3 Idiots is the best film ever made. Chopra should think twice before giving himself airs.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The story of 3 Idiots is based on Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, as per a written contract between the filmmakers and the novelist. Neither party denies this. But Bhagat is now accusing the filmmakers of not giving him adequate credit. If one is to go by the television interviews of the author and the producers, then it seems that the latter have not done anything contrary to the agreement with the author. Bhagat indeed seems to be hankering after publicity by creating the ruckus.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Authors, much like designers, discoverers and inventors, are, in a way, the fathers of their creations. Is it ever possible to deny parentage rights? The intellectual contributions of authors whose stories have been adapted for films, cannot be wished away by producers by using their clout or by quoting rules out of context. The controversy over 3 Idiots has wider implications than it may seem at first. The ministry of human resource development would do well to ensure that the rights of even less-known writers are protected in future.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Subhuman          
	Sir  On September 11, 2009, somebody had badly beaten up a female stray dog in my locality, probably for fun. Both her forelimbs had multiple fractures as a result. I called up many animal welfare organizations for help but was told that since I live too far from their offices, they could not bring their ambulances. So I rushed to the Animal Shelter cum Hospital and Research Institute to admit the dog. On reaching the place, I was told that the hospital did not have a cage and so could not admit her. I quarrelled with the manager, who finally agreed to give the dog a cage, but only in exchange of money. I myself would have given money for the treatment, and did not expect to be asked for it so openly.          
	After admitting the dog, I visited her a number of times and donated money for her treatment. When I could not go, I used to call the hospital to know the status of her health. I was always told that she was well, and was improving. Then on December 26, I kept calling Ashari to know whether I could go there, but no one took my call. The next day, when I was in my office, I got a call from the hospital informing me that my stray had expired the night before. I was shocked.           
	I pleaded to talk to one of the doctors on call to know the biological cause of the dogs death. One of the doctors, whom I had never met during my visits, came to meet me. Surprisingly, she had the same voice as that of the receptionist who usually took my calls. This doctor insulted me and accused of me of never having come to visit the animal since her admission.           
	I still do not know how my stray died after fighting the fractures for three months. I will ever never take an ailing dog to Ashari because the doctors there abuse people who try to be socially responsible.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Memory loss          
	Sir  I had lost two cell phones at the security desk of the Dum Dum airport on January 7, while travelling to Chennai. I clearly remember switching off the two cell phones, and dropping them into my handbag before going for the security check. After boarding the flight, I realized that my cell phones had not been returned. I informed the flight attendants, who assured me that the cell phones were with the airport authorities and would be given back as soon I get back to Calcutta. On January 9, I reached Calcutta, met the airport manager on duty and briefed him about the incident. After making me wait for about 15 minutes, he came back with the news that no cell phone had been found January 7. When I requested him to show me the CCTV footage of the time when my bags were being searched, he replied that he was not authorized to do so.           
	About half an hour later, I forced him to check again for the cell phones. This time, he said that the cell phones were with him. But there was no need to see the CCTV footage, he added. After getting the cell phones, I realized that the memory card of one was missing. The manager asked me to come back to his office for the card 10 minutes later. But when I did so, he was not there. After waiting for 10 more minutes, I left for home. I did not get back the memory card.          
	After this fiasco, I had to pay the airport authorities Rs 200 as handling charge. I want to claim compensation for harassment. I think what happened to me displays a new way invented by the personnel to extract money from unsuspecting people. If you do not take necessary steps, they can even keep back your valuables, as they did with the memory card.          
	Yours faithfully,

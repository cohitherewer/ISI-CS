                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        VICTIM UNKNOWN                                                    
	There was much turbulence in the structure of capital markets in the 1990s. The Securities and Exchange Board of India, created in the late 1980s, was full of evangelical energy; it went after private stock exchanges with a vengeance. Meanwhile, government financial institutions set up their own National Stock Exchange; with their patronage and with the latest technology, it beat the other stock exchanges to the ground. Only the Bombay Stock Exchange fought and survived. The market situation that emerged has been stable since then; NSE has ruled the roost, while BSE has provided a competent alternative.        
	So it is not clear why Sebi appointed a committee of obvious non-experts under the chairmanship of Bimal Jalan to review ownership and governance of stock exchanges and their satellite organizations. The fact that Sebi placed one of its members on the committee would suggest an agenda, but what the committee was aimed at was unclear. The committee has tried in its report to sustain the mystery. The existing regulations on formation of new stock exchanges were restrictive already; the tightening that the committee has suggested looks trivial to the untrained eye. The committee makes much play with stock exchanges being a public utility, and takes it as granted that the government should let their members make reasonable profits, a term it can interpret as it likes. It has no problem with the current regulations; they limit the equity share of stock exchange owners to modest percentages, to be further reduced within a few years, and their total holdings to 49 per cent  just short of controlling interest. It proposes raising the 15 per cent limit on a single corporate shareholding to 24 per cent, and anoints its holder with the lofty title of anchor institutional investor; even this was hardly worth 10 months of deep deliberation.        
	The answers to its appointment must therefore lie in the new restrictions it proposes on ownership of stock exchanges. The crucial one is slipped in at the end of the report. Just now, Sebi is not explicitly empowered to stop anyone from starting a stock exchange; the committee wants it to be so empowered by law. And the subsidiary one is the change in the restrictions the committee proposes on who can be a stock exchanges initiator or own 15 per cent of its equity: it proposes that stock exchanges, depositories, clearing corporations and insurance companies must be thrown out of strategic ownership. That would leave only banks and approved financial institutions as promoters. While it would be too rude to call it a hatchet job, the Jalan committee cannot avoid the suspicion that it was meant to stop someone or other from starting or running stock exchanges.

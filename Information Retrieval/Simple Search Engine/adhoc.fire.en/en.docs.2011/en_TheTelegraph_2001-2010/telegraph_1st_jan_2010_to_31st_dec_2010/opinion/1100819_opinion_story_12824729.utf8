                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ONE VERSUS MANY                                                    
	In higher education, it is difficult to maintain the crucial distinction between setting standards of excellence and achieving uniformity of practice across a wide range of institutions, private or otherwise, specializing in a particular subject. The former is essential, but the latter, at best, dodgy, resulting in a kind of centralization that comes in the way of institutional autonomy. With the Medical Council of India awaiting the Centres approval of its proposal for a common entrance test for all medical colleges in the country, such misgivings are bound to arise in those who are concerned about the autonomy, and hence freedom and flexibility, of quality institutions of higher education. Centralization inevitably brings in its wake interference from the government, and whatever the apparent neatness of the idea of a single entrance test, the ultimate results are always somewhat alarming. Given the wide variety of such institutions in India, imposing from outside a homogeneous set of standards would end up flattening out the distinctive ethos and merits of individual institutions. Not that the Centre does not understand this, for it remains undecided about whether the common entrance test would also admit students to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.        
	A single test, it is argued by its advocate, not only makes the system more streamlined, but it also relieves students from the stress of having to sit a number of admission tests, usually around the time of their higher secondary examinations. It is also claimed that it would cut down the various kinds of cheating and corruption that happen around admissions. However, if there is just one test all over the country, then tinkering with it becomes that much more easy. Besides, homogenizing the test would have to be accompanied by making syllabi uniform across all institutions, and that way lie the ills of levelling. It is also a mystery why medical colleges should be singled out for a common entrance test. The sensible thing to do, for the sake of academic excellence, is to let each institution conduct its own tests, according to the standards and parameters it sets itself. And this is not true just for medical colleges, but for other institutions as well. Barring certain rudimentary checks, the less the government interferes in the maintenance of academic standards the better.

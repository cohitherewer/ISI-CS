The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From experimentation to exasperation
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FROM EXPERIMENTATION TO EXASPERATION                                  VISUAL ARTS - Soumitra Das                                                  
	The annual series of exhibitions titled GenNext organized by Aakriti Art Gallery, highlighting art work by young artists from all over India and some from other countries as well, has established itself as a platform for fledgling practitioners, innocent of the marketplace. This year, the gallery is holding the fifth edition of this series, and it is, as usual, titled GenNext V (till Oct 24). The series is different because it is in not a commercial venture  not a single big name artist is a participant. And in these hard times it goes to the gallerys credit that it still dares to undertake such an expensive annual venture.        
	Unlike most gallery shows, this series exuded a certain freshness missing from others where tried-and-tested artists are showcased. It attracted artists from abroad as well who gave a new perspective to the exhibition. New names were discovered and the exhibition turned out to be a catalyst of experimentation. Till this year, it seems. Few of the participants of this edition of GenNext have deviated from the beaten track and some of them have resorted to producing thinly veiled imitations of the works of their teachers known for being innovative. New media is conspicuous by its absence.                    
	Here are some of the copy cats. Arindam Sarkars shirt made of net is clearly a carbon copy of similar but infinitely more complex forms created by a well-known practitioner, a generation ahead of this youngster. One need not be an expert to realize that Nabanita Guhas linear figures are straight lifts from the eccentric drawings of a retired teacher of Rabindra Bharati University. Tisha Mandal and Riya Chatterjees works involving textiles, stitches and garments have been done to death. Whatever happened to exciting works like Atul Mahajans mock condom/tongue that became erect or flaccid at the viewers will, featured in GenNext IV, or Jaishri Abichadanis video, Heart of a Drag Queen, in the same show? The viewer feels let down this time, although the display is quite good and there is not an embarrassment of exhibits in a single room.        
	In the fifth edition, the accent is on painting of the figurative kind, and most artists of this region excel in this by virtue of the antediluvian system of art schools. But skill alone does not help. Muktinath Mandals works go little beyond realism. Vinita Dasgupta may have referenced the burning problem of terrorism but clichs like pigeons and bullets are as far as she can go. Meenakshi Sengupta tries to use traditional images in a contemporary context but the crassness of the end product is appalling. Santosh D. Andrades vignettes and Debasree Dass mixed-media works are equally crude.        
	There are some notable exceptions though. Outstanding among them are the two mixed-media works of Buddhadev Mukherjee in which he whips up a typhoon with a whirl of lines circling around an isolated individual (picture, below). The palpable visual energy of both works is missing from most of the other exhibits. Yet Mukherjee achieves this with an economy of lines and colour. D. Dasan builds up his intriguing work with slivers of plywood marked with ink, and the effect is that of a palimpsest, mysterious and abstruse.        
	Of the sculptures, Deepak Kanubhai Khatris fruit and pod assembled with tiny plates of bronze stimulate the viewers imagination as they signify a lot more than they appear to be (picture, top). A touch of humour and disgust in the conception of H.G. Ganesh Uralas nightmare sets apart this fibreglass piece.        
	Some of the contributions from abroad are quite exciting. Among them are the drawings of Laura Gouke from Lithuania, particularly the one of the women clinging together like tumbleweed. The most eye-catching of the exhibits is that of Yu Zhaoyang from China  quite in keeping with the trendy image that country wishes to project. The gallery will have to pull up its socks if it wants to remain on the cutting edge of contemporary art.

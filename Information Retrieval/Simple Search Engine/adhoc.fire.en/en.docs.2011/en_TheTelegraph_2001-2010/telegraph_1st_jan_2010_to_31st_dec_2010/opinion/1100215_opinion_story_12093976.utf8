	Eight months ago (and 10 months before regional elections were due to be held all over France), the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, raised a vital issue before the parliament. Not the financial meltdown that was undermining the world rsquo;s economies, or the threat of climate change, or even the rash of bike thefts in Paris. He wanted to ban the burqa.
    The problem of the burqa is not a religious problem, he told French legislators. This is an issue of a womans freedom and dignity. This is not a religious symbol. It is a sign of subservience..... The next day, the French parliament created a 32-member cross-party committee to investigate whether wearing the burqa violates the principles of the French constitution.  
	The burqa is a shroud-like full-body covering, worn in public by some Muslim women. The wearer sees the world only through a narrow grill of cotton threads sewn into the front of the garment, or, in the case of the variant called the niqab, through an open slit that reveals only the eyes. The parliamentary committee discussed the issue of the burqa for six months, and delivered its conclusions recently. It did not propose to ban the burqa entirely, but recommended that women wearing burqas be forbidden to enter schools, hospitals and government offices, or to use public transportation.        
	What purpose could such a law serve? Some of the women wearing burqas presumably do so of their own free will, while others are forced to do so by their male relatives. An anti-burqa law would violate the rights of the first group, and increase the likelihood that the second group will be entirely confined to their homes.                
	Cynical plan        
	The French parliament cannot move fast enough to pass such a law before the regional elections are held, but the committees report ensures that an ugly debate about immigrants will be raging during the election campaign. It is part of the same disturbing trend in Europe that saw Swiss voters ban minarets in a referendum and Dutch legislators vote in favour of banning the burqa in 2005.        
	It is estimated that between 3 and 6 million of Frances 64 million people are Muslims. It is also estimated that only 1,900 women in France wear burqas, mostly in the immigrant suburbs around Paris and in other big French cities. That is less than one Muslim woman in a thousand. This is not really about burqas. It is about mobilizing right-wing voters  and to energize them even more, Sarkozy declared a great debate on French identity last November. His motives are cynical and his methods are manipulative  but since he has raised the issue, what about it? Is wearing a burqa compatible with being the citizen of a modern democracy?        
	If you have not been accustomed to it since childhood, there is unquestionably something disturbing about encountering masked people in a public space. The wearers gender and your own common sense will tell you that they are not dangerous people, but they are, and will remain, apart, almost alien, rejecting the common society that everyone else shares.         
	That is not ideal, but it must be tolerated in societies that accept and embrace every other kind of diversity. Fadela Amara, a Muslim-born womens rights campaigner and a minister in Sarkozys government, has called the burqa a kind of tomb for women, but she has no right to impose her view on those who freely choose to wear it. That does not take into account the other women who wear it only in obedience to their men, but this is not a matter on which legislation can be effective. Ban the burqa, and those women will simply become full-time prisoners in their own houses. Besides, Sarkozy is not trying to free those women. He is just trying to win the regional elections by stirring up anti-Muslim feeling.

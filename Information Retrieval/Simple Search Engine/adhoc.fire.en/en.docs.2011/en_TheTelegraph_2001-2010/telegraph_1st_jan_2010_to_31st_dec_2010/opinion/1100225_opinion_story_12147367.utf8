                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PROMISES TO KEEP                                                    
	Extravagant promises in a year in which there are no elections are very surprising, but the railway budget of the railway minister, Mamata Banerjee, tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, was full of them. From creating employment through welfare schemes for railway employees to building schools, colleges, management institutions and housing for all railway employees in the next 10 years, the railway budget looked and sounded like a gigantic social welfare programme. There were two announcements of immediate consequence: there would be no increase in freight tariffs and passenger fares, and freight rates for foodgrain and fuel products (like kerosene and diesel) were actually cut. The cut in freight rates is an inflation fighting measure, given that consumer price inflation has been largely driven by food, and by fuel to a lesser extent. Employment  or increasing the size of the railway workforce  would be achieved by creating one job for every family whose land was acquired by the Indian Railways and by manning the thousands of currently unmanned railway crossings across the country over the next five years. Ms Banerjee also announced that 117 of the 120 new trains she promised in her last budget would be flagged off in the next 35 days, that is, roughly four trains a day. In addition, she announced a slew of initiatives as part of the Indian Railways Vision 2020, details about many of which, she said, would be forthcoming later.        
	From the viewpoint of financial prudence, however, the viability of these freight tariff reductions is not clear; a reduction in rates that boosts overall volumes and market share is economically justified, but the current policy of reducing rates year after year even as market share declines is unsustainable. The share of the railways in freight and passenger traffic has been declining steadily over the years; today, railways account for about 39 per cent of all freight traffic  losing out to road, mostly  and about 13 per cent of passengers. Not surprisingly, the minister did speak of a new business and revenue model  as with some of her initiatives, she did not provide much detail about this either.        
	From a capital expenditure perspective, the plan outlay is about Rs 41,430 crore, an amount that the minister may find difficult to raise, even with the help of the Indian Railways Finance Corporation. Instead of building schools and hospitals on it and running them, it may be more sensible to let the private sector build and manage them, while giving railway employees a concessional benefit. Similarly, with long-distance passenger fares, the railways could take a leaf out of the airlines book and have graded booking rates: the earlier one books passage, the lower the price. Perhaps the new models should include effective resource use and efficient service delivery. The minister would do well to remember what the legendary actress, Mae West, said: An ounce of performance is worth pounds of promises.

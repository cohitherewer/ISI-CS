	To be first from the bottom is the most dubious of distinctions. But this is precisely what India has earned for itself in a recent index that measures end-of-life care or the quality of death afforded by 40 countries. The United Kingdom tops the list, while India is at the very bottom  below Mexico, China, Brazil and Uganda. It is also significant that many developed nations like Switzerland, Denmark, Japan and Italy  where more people live longer because of good healthcare  fare rather badly in the index. But Indias shameful position explodes the myth of Indian society being one in which the traditional family provides the template for the care of the dying. If anything, the assumption that the Indian family is the natural provider of palliative care makes it easier for the State to pull out of its responsibilities in building and sustaining a welfare system that would provide or support such care. Although palliative care should not be identified with care for the elderly (even when the latter forms a major part of its concerns), Indian laws that seek to protect senior citizens, when they do exist, tend to criminalize neglectful or uncaring children, kin or potential heirs in a way that deflects public attention from the States indifference or inefficiency in doing its bit for the elderly. The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, only urges governments, without making it mandatory for them, to establish old-age homes in every district with a minimum capacity of 150 per home. But old-age homes as well as hospices, left largely to charity and voluntary services, are either associated with abject poverty, and therefore provide poor services, or evoke a kind of shame and dereliction that makes them taboo as a practical alternative.        
	In some cultures (as in China), the stigmatization of the dead and the dying  the tendency to sweep mortal suffering under the carpet  comes in the way of proper end-of-life care. In India, the other extreme of being supremely at ease with the spectacle of public abandonment, suffering and death is, perhaps, the problem. The art of looking away while somebody else is dying alone has been mastered well, and at all levels of society and State, so that quality of death sounds like a metaphysical or sentimental issue, or something that only a few can afford to worry about.

	On the eve of the Allahabad High Courts judgment on the Ayodhya title suit and 60 years after the Constitution was framed, its worth reviewing the republican principle threatened by the sangh parivars Ram Mandir campaign.        
	Discussions about the constitutional nature of secularism and pluralism in India tend towards an interpretation of Articles 25 to 30 of the Indian Constitution. The first four articles in this sequence spell out the right to freedom of religion and the last two specify cultural and educational rights. Articles 29 and 30 are generally cited as evidence that the founding fathers intended to foster and protect pluralism, especially religious pluralism, in the new republic. If there is a warrant for pluralism in the Indian Constitution, it is Article 29. Explicitly titled, Protection of the interests of Minorities, its first part says: Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same.        
	When read together with Article 30, which gives all minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice and then specifies that the State shall not discriminate against minority-managed institutions in the matter of funding or aid, Article 29 indicates that the State will not just deal equally with people in the matter of faith, but it also will exert itself to sustain the cultural distinctness of minority communities because it implicitly recognizes that in the majoritarian context of democracy, minority rights and minority cultures might be liable to erosion. This isnt a reading of the Constitution that commands universal assent. There are students of the Constitution as well as partisans who argue that the Constitution doesnt actually mandate secularism or pluralism at all, that it is silent on these matters.        
	Its often pointed out that till 1976, when the Constitution was amended in a disreputable context (the Emergency), the word secular barely occurred in the Indian Constitution, far less secularism. And this is true. Till Indira Gandhi amended the Constitution and its preamble to insert secular and socialist, the word secular occurred once in the Constitution and even there it wasnt used to describe the nature of the State that the Constitution had written into existence. And the word plural or pluralist didnt occur at all.        
	Ian Copland has an interesting essay on the absence of the word secular or secularism in the original text of the Constitution. He argues that both B.R. Ambedkar and Jawaharlal Nehru sanctioned this absence deliberately: this omission was quite deliberate and reflected an awareness on the part of the designers of the Constitution, notably Nehru and Ambedkar, that its provisions under freedom of religion did not amount to what they understood to be real secularism, namely the kind of polity famously embodied in the 1791 First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.        
	The First Amendment to the constitution of the United States of America is the first of 10 amendments that make up the Bill of Rights. It says, famously, that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Coplands point is that the Indian Constitution explicitly empowered and instructed the State to interfere in the free exercise of religion for ameliorative reasons. Article 25, 2(b) made it clear that freedom of religion did not prevent the State from providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus.        
	So State interference with religion was allowed for, even mandated, by the Constitution. In his excellent book, The Wheel of Law, the constitutional scholar, Gary Jeffrey Jacobsohn, calls this interventionist secularism ameliorative. By ameliorative, Jacobsohn means a type of secular State that recognizes the need to reform religiously inspired oppression and hierarchy as well as the need to maintain inter-community harmony, a dual task that calls for intelligent caution in the search for abstract justice.        
	Copland might well be right in arguing that Nehru and Ambedkar didnt consider the Indian Constitution secular if the First Amendment was their point of reference. We can either argue that the dominant Indian construction of secularism is just different from its Western meaning or we can agree to drop secularism as a description and use some other word for the Constitutions design for the relationship between the republican State and religious communities.        
	I propose pluralism because it avoids the confusions of a secularism with multiple meanings and also because it is a better, historically truer, characterization of the animating principle of the anti-colonial nationalism that was eventually enshrined in these articles of the Constitution. So while First Amendment fundamentalists might disagree with the full bench of the Supreme Court when, in 1973, it ruled that secularism was a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, for Indians who recognize the beast, this is a problem of naming, not an absence of intent.        
	This reading of the Constitutions commitment to pluralism is contested by both liberals and majoritarian political organizations such as the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Shiv Sena, and the sangh parivar who prefer to emphasize the assimilative clauses in the Constitution such as the Directive Principles, which instruct the Indian State to move towards a uniform civil code. In this view, secularism means subordinating religious injunctions to republican laws whenever they come into conflict. The effort of Hindu majoritarians has been two-pronged: first to generalize the customs and prejudices of the Hindu majority into a national culture and then to frame republican law in terms of that national culture. Minorities would then have to live by those laws because they wouldnt be seen as majoritarian religious encroachments on their freedom of belief, but secular laws derived from a national culture.        
	The impending judgment of the Allahabad High Court on the title suits regarding the site of the Babri Masjid reminds us that even majoritarian vandalism  namely, the razing of the Babri Masjid and the demand for a Ramjanmabhoomi temple built where the mosque once stood  is justified by the argument that Ram is as much a national icon as a Hindu deity, and therefore it is appropriate for the Muslim parties to the dispute to cede their claim because they ought to defer to a nationalist imperative, the building of the mandir.        
	As Jacobsohn argues in The Wheel of Law, the ideologues of Hindutva want to reconstrue the secularism of the Indian Constitution in an Israeli frame of reference. Israel claims to be both a secular State and a Jewish one, a country where freedom of religion is a basic right and yet Judaism is the favoured and constitutive religion. The opinion of an Israeli judge, Justice Elon, states the majoritarian position categorically: The principle that the State of Israel is the state of the Jewish people is Israels foundation and mission, and the principle of the equality of rights and obligations of all citizens of the State of Israel add to the former, not to modify it; (there is nothing in) the principle of the equality of civil rights and obligations to modify the principle that the State of Israel is the State of the Jewish people, and only the Jewish people. The premise of this curious brand of secularism is that religious liberty is protected, but the State can still privilege the standing of true believers in the constitutive faith. Thus the Arab minority is offered equal citizenship rights in certain spheres but full membership of the political or national community is out of question.        
	However, unlike the Israeli constitution that begins by proclaiming Israel as the birthplace of the Jewish people and asserts the right of the Jewish people to national revival in their own country, the Indian Constitution asserts no such thing. And it is unlikely that parties of the Hindu Right are, in the foreseeable future, likely to have the numbers to change the Constitution to achieve that end.              
	So the only way of achieving Israeli-style pre-eminence for a religious majority in India lies either through violent mobilization, which might change the facts on the ground and achieve such irresistible momentum that the supremacy envisaged by Hindutvavadi organizations is established de facto (and this is the case in Gujarat, where the pogrom has consolidated an electoral Hindu majority and segregated a subordinate Muslim minority), or through judgments that strengthen the assimilative aspect of Indian secularism and create precedents for a creatively majoritarian jurisprudence. This is why the imminent high-court verdict isnt just another judgment about a land dispute; its an episode in an argument about the constitutional ground on which our republic is built.       mukulkesavanhotmail.com

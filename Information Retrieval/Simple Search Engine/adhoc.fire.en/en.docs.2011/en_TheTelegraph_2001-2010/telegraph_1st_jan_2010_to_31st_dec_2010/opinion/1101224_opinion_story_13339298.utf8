	School for scandal      
	Jaane bhi do yaaro, Seriously funny since 1983 (HarperCollins, Rs 250) by Jai Arjun Singh claims that this is not a book for those philistines who have not seen the film. This documentary traces the making of the iconic film, from its inception to its release. Fans are treated to anecdotes about shooting the film as well as trivia about various scenes. Gorillas philosophize, dead rats need an air-conditioned room and an actor goes off his food. A wild and exuberant script spins out of control, beyond the pale of logic. Much of Singhs account draws from a bank of shared associations generated by the film and from early memories of watching it on Doordarshan. Sharp, witty and tersely written, the documentary handles serious material with a light touch, rather like the film it deals with. Singhs new book promises to be an immensely enjoyable read, even for philistines.                        
	Dear agony aunt (Rupa, Rs 95) by Aradhika Sharma answers all your questions about online dating, difficult in-laws, perfidious partners and hormonal hell. For those insatiable voyeurs who religiously pore over agony aunt columns in magazines and newspapers, this book is a treasure trove of scandal and tragedy. Sharma compiles letters from various tormented souls and offers sympathetic, if somewhat ineffective, advice. However, the book could have done without long and lurid anecdotes to illustrate these problems.                         
	Unbound, Indian women work (Penguin, Rs 250) by Gita Aravamudan contains interviews of women across the social spectrum. From Dr Vatsala Samant, who completed her degree in medicine in 1938, to the pragmatic Sumathi, who works in a call centre and is the chief breadwinner of her family, most of these women have struggled to unbind themselves from the identities that had been fixed for them. Working women in India have had to battle jealous husbands, lascivious colleagues, loneliness and hostile work environments in order to hold their ground. Although Aravamudan chooses a well-worn subject, she manages to turn it into an interesting, fast-paced read. Indeed, strains of soap opera are never far away; one woman whispers about a failed love affair while others negotiate the importance of the L word in their lives. In the end, the author resorts to myth: the modern Indian woman, she decides, must be Lakshmi Unbound. In a Promethean endeavour, Aravamudan seems to have replaced one set of identities with another.                                  
	Mice in men (HarperCollins, Rs 199) by Anirban Bose is a collection of short stories that ranges from the unexpected to the bizarre. The cast of characters includes Rizwan Sheikh, a romantic 65-year-old, the cantankerous and absurdly named Basuri Lal Chowdhury and Siddharth Kumar, the first backward caste doctor from rural Bihar. The author creates compelling situations in which his characters must play themselves out. Bose, who is also a doctor, keeps returning to hospital rooms, X-rays and other medical procedures in his stories. Magic and medicine are welded together, love becomes a neurosis, and the mysterious workings of the human anatomy generate a potent, dramatic energy. Some of the stories might have bordered on the trite had it not been for a certain nervous intensity that runs through all of them.

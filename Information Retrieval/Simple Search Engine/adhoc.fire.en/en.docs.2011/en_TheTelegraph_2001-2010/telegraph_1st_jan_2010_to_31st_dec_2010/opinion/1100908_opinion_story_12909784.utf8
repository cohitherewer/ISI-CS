The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bonanza in jeopardy
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BONANZA IN JEOPARDY                                  The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Bill seeks a strict oversight of the amount of foreign funds received by organisations and individuals and the use to which they are put. Debaashis Bhattacharya reports                                            
	Receiving foreign contributions will soon become a difficult proposition for voluntary and other organisations in India as the government is taking steps to regulate the funds pouring in from overseas.        
	Legislators and journalists, along with judges and civil servants, will be barred from receiving money from any foreign sources as the Centre replaces the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act of 1976 with legislation that has the same name but more teeth in it.        
	The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Bill, 2010, has been passed in the Rajya Sabha and has now been tabled in the Lok Sabha. Introduced in the Rajya Sabha in 2006 and referred to a standing committee soon after, the bill underwent several changes before it was passed in the upper house recently.        
	Concerned about the impact of unchecked foreign aid or donations on national security, the Union home ministry has suggested that the government be given sweeping powers to crack down on any individual or organisation suspected of concealing or misusing foreign funds.        
	Foreign donations, received chiefly by voluntary or religious organisations, have long been a prickly issue in India. Of the 40,173 organisations that receive foreign contributions, Union home ministry sources say only about 18,000 furnish accounts even though it is mandatory to do so. Fewer show the transfer of foreign funds in their bank accounts or provide any details of how they have utilised the funds.        
	Where is the money going? This requires to be regulated. Hence we need a stricter law, Union home minister P. Chidambaram said during a debate on the bill in Parliament recently.        
	Under Section 14 of the bill, the government will now have the power to suspend and even cancel the registration of organisations if they violate any provision of the law. Whats more, banks will now be required to report to the government the prescribed amount of foreign remittance and the source and manner in which it was received.        
	The bill also lays down that banks will have to inform the authorities if any organisation receives more than Rs 10 lakh at one go from abroad.        
	Clearly, the government has extended the dragnet in order to penalise any organisation that receives and uses foreign funds in an inappropriate manner. If it suspects foul play, the government will now have the power to raid any organisation or individual house, seize documents, and even confiscate the foreign funds received.        
	The punishment for making a false statement regarding foreign contributions or furnishing a false account has also been raised. Whereas earlier any wrongdoing could attract a fine of an unspecified amount and a jail term of six months, the new bill suggests a maximum imprisonment of five years.        
	The way the Centre has framed it, the bill is going to be an effective, purposeful legislation, says Calcutta High Court lawyer Joymalya Bagchi.        
	Union home ministry sources say the enactment will also prevent inimical forces from using foreign funds to split the country along religious lines or trigger sectarian disturbances.        
	This may hit organisations like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which receive a lot of foreign donations. But a senior RSS leader says that they actually welcome the new law. Whatever the RSS receives is fully audited and accounted for, he says. Besides, the law, he says, is to be lauded because it will check the use of foreign donations in carrying out conversions.        
	The bill does indeed bar anyone who has been prosecuted or convicted for indulging in activities aimed at conversion through inducement or force, either directly or indirectly, from one religious faith to another from receiving foreign contributions.        
	It also forbids journalists, both from the print and electronic media, from receiving foreign contributions in any form other than wages or salaries and stipends or scholarships. But the payment that a journalist receives for writing for a foreign publication is deemed to be part of his wages and does not come under the purview of the bill.              
	Besides legislators, political parties and their office-bearers and election candidates have also been barred from seeking or accepting foreign contributions except in certain specified circumstances. Judges and government employees face similar restrictions.        
	India is of course not the only country that has a law to monitor the flow of foreign funds to voluntary and other organisations. After 9/11, the US has also tightened its laws in this regard and keeps a strict vigil on foreign funds coming into the country, mainly to check money laundering by terrorist organisations.        
	However, though the government is tightening the law, it says that this will not hamper legitimate development projects funded by foreign contributions. The legislation will help, not hinder, genuine non governmental organisations (NGOs), says a home ministry source. All the safeguards have been put in place.        
	Nevertheless, some provisions of the bill have already drawn fire from voluntary organisations, which fear the government could use them against those who protest against government moves or projects.        
	Section 5 (1) of the bill, for instance, empowers the Centre to specify an organisation as an organisation of political nature considering its activity, ideology or programmes and thus prohibit it from receiving any foreign contributions.        
	The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, a platform for human rights groups, says the bill, once enacted, would constrict the voluntary sector since the government could easily use some of the provisions to cow NGOs into submission if they do not see eye to eye with it on a given developmental issue. After all, many NGOs rely on foreign contributions to carry out their development work.        
	An Orissa-based NGO feels the new legislation could turn draconian as the government will have unbridled power to raid any organisation and seize anything.        
	But not everyone feels the same way about the bill. A strict law to monitor and curb the misuse of foreign contributions is needed, says a church leader in Thiruvananthapuram, Keralas capital. It is the peoples money and they have the right to know how much you have received in their names, how much you have spent and on what. If the recipients wont disclose the information, the government should make them do so, the pastor says.        
	The government seems to want to do just that.

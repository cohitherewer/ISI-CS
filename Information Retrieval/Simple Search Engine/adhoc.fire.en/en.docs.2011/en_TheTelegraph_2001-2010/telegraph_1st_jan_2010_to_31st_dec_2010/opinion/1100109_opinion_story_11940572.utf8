The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fanny Prices Hindostan
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FANNY PRICES HINDOSTAN                              Aveek Sen      Visual Arts                                                
	A peculiar melancholy  exquisite, yet not untouched by a sense of the ironic, or even the comic  tinges the long view of history afforded by the current exhibition at the Victoria Memorial Hall, Indian Life and Landscape by Western Artists: Paintings and Drawings from the V amp;A, 1790-1927 (until January 31). Sternly overseen by three marble governor-generals, their mission of civilizing the natives taken up by the security guards sitting at their feet and shouting at the waves of winter-afternoon picnickers to switch off their phones and not touch the pictures, this densely curated collection from the Victoria amp; Albert Museum in London  cordoned off by state-of-the-art walls from the Halls own collection of the same artists  becomes part of a marvellous enactment of the Imperial Sublimes curious afterlife.         
	Modern Calcutta surrounds the Hall and mills about the show, its people and places looking at themselves being looked at by Europe in another time. Art and life, ruler and ruled, viewer and viewed, past and present get richly muddled when we confront such a visual history of how we have been observed, surveyed, depicted and archived across a span of around two centuries. We find the recognizable in the midst of the unrecognizable, experiencing change as inseparable from continuity. The Writers Buildings, Tollys Nullah, Taj, Jantar Mantar, a crowded ghat, a woman selling fish, bullocks bathing in the river as crows play on their backs, a snake-charmer, a bridegrooms topor, an ancient banyan tree, a lugubriously servile face, bairagis in rapture, women begging, dogs sleeping, moonlight on an animal skeleton: everything is actual, immediate, familiar, out there close by, as we walk out of the memorial past the carriages and the candy-floss. Yet, they are also figures, places and objects in an elaborately tinted fantasy, as surreal and mythological, and as classical, as a picture by Claude or Poussin, or by Piranesi, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Constable, Turner or Palmer. The details are not just the motifs of Art, but are also part of a vast and ongoing project going far beyond the aesthetic, with immensely high stakes  commercial, political, cultural  for everybody concerned.                        
	From the late 18th century onwards, as fantastical travel-writing started tripping up against real journeys and encounters, opening up real possibilities and kindling real desires, everything that Hindostan confronted the Europeans with had to be recorded and responded to in all its marvellous or menacing difference. These records and responses absorbed this difference into established modes of perception and complicated them. So, the Orient both endorsed and challenged the Burkean dichotomies of the Sublime and the Beautiful or the clichs of the Picturesque, which had begun to bore the later decades of the 18th century. Out of this confrontation between a tired aesthetic and a challenging otherness, the 19th century fashioned its Romanticism, which, buffeted by history and scourged by academicism, eventually found itself at the threshold of the modern. It is this arc of history  as much a history of knowledge and the imagination as of power  that this exhibition presents with a continually modulated scale of vision.         
	There are the grand vistas and panoramas, distances and elevations that make us take it all in at one go, those new-found realms of gold, as if the viewer were a Hannibal or Napoleon standing atop a Turneresque mountain. Limitless views of land, sky and water expand the eye, mind and ego, but also put human achievement in its place. The Sublime could aggrandize as well as humiliate, depending on how we are positioned  physically, optically and politically  in relation to it. (Napoleon, when he was not standing on a mountain, was a little man.) Most of the landscape painters in this show play with this treachery of scale and perspective. As with depictions of the Roman Empire, the grandeur of power coexists with the pathos of ruins or the puniness of the human figure. The grey-wash stillness of the best works by the Daniells, Homes, Carpenter or Simpsons comes from an elegiac understanding of what their predecessor, Samuel Johnson, had called the vanity of human wishes.         
	Yet, the positioning of the eye is never static. The artists entice us to come close and study the minute or unexpected details with a different kind of attention; miniaturize their scale to evoke something like tenderness instead of surprise (Robert Smiths tiny pencil sketches); or give to the human face a peculiarity of expression that turns the subject into an individual rather than a type (Solvynss servants, Smiths musicians). What begins to form is a kind of empathy  the ability to imagine oneself into another existence. It begins to transform difference into visual engagement, opening up new ways of regarding the unknown.         
	In Jane Austens description of the elegancies and ornaments of the East Room in Mansfield Park (1814)  a space of hard-won privacy for her heroine, Fanny Price  three transparencies decorate the panes of a window: Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy, and a moonlight lake in Cumberland. This is exactly the combination of the sublime, the beautiful and the picturesque that provides this shows primary visual language, but projected upon a radically different terrain. Austen  who had an outlandish cousin born in India and rumoured to be Hastingss love-child  could have put any of these 18th- and early-19th-century artists in Fannys room. Let us imagine that she chooses Solvynss Bibaha (1792-96), in which a Bengali bride and groom are being wedded by a huddle of Brahmins in the light of flaming torches. Solvyns had witnessed this scene secretly, for no outsiders were allowed at a traditional wedding. But if Fanny had studied this etching, she would have found her own mousiness reflected back to her in a very different guise: through the windows in the background, the women of the andarmahal peer out with beady eyes. The play of gazes is complex, for it is the moment just before the bride and groom, hands joined but faces covered, take their first look at each other.

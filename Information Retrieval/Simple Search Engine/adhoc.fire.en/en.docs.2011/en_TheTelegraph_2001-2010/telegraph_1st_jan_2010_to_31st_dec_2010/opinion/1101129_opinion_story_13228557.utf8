The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Unfare control
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNFARE CONTROL                                                    
	The minister of aviation is mightily displeased. Airlines have been raising domestic fares. Some of them are so high that it is cheaper to go to Europe than fly within the country. That sounds irrational: why should airlines charge less for longer distances? Praful Patel accused them of predatory pricing, and threatened action against airlines that break the price band. He was extremely quiet last year when airlines were selling tickets at throwaway prices. One would have thought that as a repository of wisdom, he would have warned airlines then about the folly of making losses. But then, he is not in the business of teaching airlines their business; he is only giving expression to the anger of passengers at fleecing. Passengers would like fares to be as low as possible; it is natural for them to consider any increase in fares an assault on their purses. But it is worth asking why domestic fares have started going up and international fares have not. One reason is that domestic airlines face competition from airlines of other countries on international routes; on domestic routes, the aviation minister protects them from foreign airlines competition. The remedy is obvious. Mr Patel should stop lining the pockets of domestic airlines by keeping foreign airlines out. He cannot keep out competition and then complain that domestic airlines are not competing. This sort of nationalism has long gone out of fashion; even in India no one gets terribly worked up about it.         
	There is another reason why international fares have not gone up. Foreigners who fly to India like to leave their countries at decent daytime hours; so do returning foreigners like to arrive at home by day. But since India happens to be eight to 15 hours away from their homelands, their arrivals in and departures from India are mostly at night. That is when domestic pilots and air hostesses like to be fast asleep; so Indian airports are empty, and there is no competition for parking lots and aerobridges. It would be easy for domestic airlines to start flying at night; the aviation minister would be happy to negotiate discounts on airport usage for them. Maybe, instead of trying to frighten and cow them down, he should try and persuade them to use airports at night.         
	The problem has arisen because of the phenomenal rise in passenger traffic. So many Indians are flying that airports have become congested. There are times when flights are taking off from and landing at airports at intervals of five minutes. The interval cannot be reduced much further without increasing the risk of collision. Admittedly, Mr Patel has been energetically building new air terminals and expanding terminal capacity. But he just cannot catch up with demand. There is only one way of matching demand and supply, namely to raise prices. Maybe the minister should look the other way.

	Once again to Zelda: fifty great dedications and their stories By Marlene Wagman-Geller, Picador, 5.75
    If an Indian reader was asked to point to the best known dedication among English books written by Indians, the chances are that most of them will point to the dedication of Jawaharlal Nehrus An Autobiography. The dedication has six brief words, To Kamala, who is no more. But behind those words was the story of a marriage, which had moved from neglect to devotion on Nehrus part, only to be cruelly cut short by illness, leaving Nehru heartbroken and lonely. The six words are an integral part of the autobiography.        
	A dedication is always the bearer of a story  of a relationship, of a belonging, maybe even of loss. Most readers only glance in passing at the dedication page. The more attentive ones pause awhile longer and ponder perhaps at the poignancy of the citation if any and then hurry on to the book. Very few care about the author and the feelings that made him pen the dedication. The author, after all, as post-modern critics have told us, is dead. So his feelings and intentions dont really matter, or so the wise tell us. Marlene Wagman-Geller pays no attention to such avant-garde wisdom.        
	She chooses 50 well-known books and then unearths the stories behind the dedications of those books. Some of the stories are quite startling. For example, Vladimir Nabokov dedicated all his books to the same person, his wife, Vera, who he met at the age of 24 at a charity masquerade ball where Vera came with a mask with a wolfs face. They were inseparable after that and Vera acted as Nabokovs secretary, protector and rescuer of the manuscript of Lolita from flames to which it had been consigned by her husband. The other person who dedicated most of his books, including The Great Gatsby, to his wife, Zelda, was Scott Fitzgerald. But their relationship was tumultuous and tormented. Dostoevskys The Brothers Karamazov and Mark Twains The Adventures of Tom Sawyer were both dedicated to the wives of their authors  and these were marriages made in heaven.        
	One of the dedicatees of Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird was Truman Capote, who in turn dedicated In Cold Blood to Lee. This book narrates the story of their friendship that stretched into their childhood and the sad ending of Capotes life.        
	The oddest dedication in this book is the one in Jane Austens Emma. The book is given in 1815 to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, who was later to become King George III. He was a serial adulterer who Austen detested even though she did not know him. But the prince regent was an admirer of Austens novels and he sent word to her through his librarian that she was at liberty to dedicate her forthcoming novel to the prince regent. Austen was aghast but her practical sense prevailed. She dedicated Emma to him and repeated his title three times in a short dedication. The dedication signals an irony.        
	Wagman-Gellers reading of the books and her research into the lives of the authors are exemplary. Her book will make readers look at dedications with a little more attention and wonder at the stories behind the words.

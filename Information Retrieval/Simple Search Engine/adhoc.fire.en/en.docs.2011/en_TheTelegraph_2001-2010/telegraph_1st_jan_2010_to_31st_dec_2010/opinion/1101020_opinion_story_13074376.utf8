                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MAN IN NATURE                                                    
	Mans conquest of nature to increase production runs the risk of destroying the environment. This could, in fact, lead to the end of the human species which would make production meaningless. Thus the newfound wisdom which says that concern for the environment must temper the ceaseless drive to multiply production. This awareness lies at the heart of the controversies regarding major industrial projects in Orissa and elsewhere. Of immediate concern is the report submitted by a committee set up by the environment ministry in July, 2010, to examine if the project to build a steel plant by the South Korean company, Posco, had followed all the forest, environment and coastal laws. The proposed steel plant will bring in Rs 52,000 crore in foreign direct investment and, thus, its impact and significance are huge and spreading far beyond the borders of Orissa. But the plant needs about 1,620 hectares and in the site that has been allotted, this would include 1,253 hectares of forest land. The environmental concerns arise from the perceived threat to forest land and, therefore, also to those who live in the forest and depend on it for their livelihood. What apparently looks like a confrontation between the forces of industrialization and primordial modes of existence is complicated by the concern for the environment and about the rights of those whose livelihood will be affected.        
	The committee has found serious flaws in the manner forest rights were settled when the project was approved. Three members of the four-member committee have recommended that the Union forests and environment ministry should scrap its approvals. The third member, without disagreeing with the overall thrust of the findings, has suggested that the entire exercise should begin anew. The final decision now lies with the minister, Jairam Ramesh. The future of the Posco project in Orissa appears at the moment to be uncertain. What is equally serious is the conclusion, warranted by the findings of the committee, that the process of approvals did not meet the standards of transparency. Even the most ardent proponents of capitalism can no longer uphold the position that industrialization should override environmental and humanitarian concerns.

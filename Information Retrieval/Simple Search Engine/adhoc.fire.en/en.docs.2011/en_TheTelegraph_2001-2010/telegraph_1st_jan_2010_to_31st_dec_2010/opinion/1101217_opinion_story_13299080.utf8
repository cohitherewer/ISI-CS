The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Tackling demand deficit
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TACKLING DEMAND DEFICIT                          - Abnormal circumstances affect the market in unexpected ways        CUTTING CORNERS: Ashok Mitra                          A deserted playground near Chernobyl in January 2006                                              
	As late as the third decade of the last century, economic science was still a toddler, faith was widely reposed in the so-called Says Law. Supply, it said, creates it own demand, income generated by the production of goods gets spent on buying up those very goods, which results in a state of full employment as well, for there is no dearth of demand for however much is produced by whatever number of people. The Great Depression of the 1930s was a bit of a spoilsport. Says Law, John Maynard Keynes pointed out, was not working  supply was not automatically creating its own demand, there was unemployment, necessitating State intervention to make up for demand deficiency and create jobs. The followers of Keynes and their ideological opponents have been engaged in debating the issue ever since.         
	At least in one area the Keynesians could not be more right. The supply of nuclear reactors does not create its own demand. For quite some while after the Second World War ended, it was a craze in the industrially advanced countries to encourage the generation of nuclear power; nuclear reactors were in great demand. The Chernobyl disaster in 1986, resulting in at least 20,000 deaths and rapidly-spreading pollution, changed the picture. Environmentalists, lying low till then, mobilized themselves. They succeeded spectacularly; the generation of power from nuclear sources became a cultural taboo as much in the United States of America as in Europe. A major problem thereby reared its head in many of the countries with nuclear capability, particularly the US. They had invested heavily in enlarging capacity for building nuclear power units. With the shrinking demand for nuclear energy in both the US and Europe, the stockpile of nuclear reactors rose alarmingly. It was quite a crisis. Americans did not like nuclear energy, Europeans did not like nuclear energy, but what will happen to the advanced capitalist countries, with their huge excess capacity for building nuclear reactors, if nobody likes nuclear energy?         
	The search was on for fall guys  countries which could be lured into buying nuclear reactors. Given the dip in the global economy and the stagnant rate of employment in the industrially advanced countries, heads of government of these countries have of late been compelled to don a new role. The effectiveness of a president or a prime minister is being judged by the extent of success he or she can attain in improving the state of the national economy, for instance, by pushing the sale overseas of goods and services the country produces. If the country happens to have a large excess capacity for manufacturing nuclear reactors, it is the duty of the head of State to try to sell the reactors abroad. One major objective of Barack Obamas visit to India was to line up demand for American nuclear reactors. Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, came exactly on the same mission accompanied by his comely wife: to unload French nuclear reactors on India. Demand had to be created to match the supply of nuclear power units.         
	Please nurse no illusion: persuading India to buy nuclear reactors was no childs play. It was necessary to soften up politicians, bureaucrats, scientists and key individuals within the ranks of the defence forces. Heads of foreign governments apart, lobbyists too had to set themselves furiously to work. Lobbyists are generally a smart bunch, they know the nuances of the various processes by which constituents of the buying party need to be adequately influenced. Indias defence and security budget as well as the budgets for the ministry of power and the atomic energy establishment are by no means of a negligible magnitude. A statistical correlation can be established between the rate of increase in these outlays and the rate of increase of money stashed by Indian citizens in numbered Swiss accounts. Lobbyists for foreign firms, including those based in the US and France, have played a role in cementing this correlation. Needless to add, another statistical relationship too gets established as a corollary: the degree of perception of environmental hazards from nuclear power plants varies inversely with the magnitude of money transmitted through intermediaries.        
	One must try to be fair. It is not just external cajoling and greasing of palms which persuade the powers-that-be of a country such as India to go for the purchase of nuclear reactors. A certain advantage lies in installing nuclear power stations, which tilts the scale in their favour despite the unit cost of nuclear power generation being demonstrably higher than that for thermal or hydro power. Unlike thermal or hydroelectric projects, problems such as displacing people from sizeable tracts of land are also not there in the case of nuclear power plants. Besides, they call for engaging fewer workers than are required in thermal or hydel plants for producing the same unit of power. These factors combine to make Says Law come alive, the demand for nuclear reactors on the part of Indian authorities satisfies the aspiration of foreign supplies.         
	Such striving for supply-demand equilibrium is indeed a most fascinating theme. Other areas, too, exist where Says Law continues to rule the roost, and with great felicity. Consider, for example, the outlay earmarked in the government budget for securing the life and limbs of supposedly very important people in our midst who have to be guarded against possible attack by local agents of global terror. Lobbyists who operate on behalf of firms producing equipment and accessories for security and surveillance operations become active. The supply side is duly tidied up. To match it by demand of sufficient magnitude also presents few problems. The trick lies in expanding the list of very important persons. A kind of keeping-up-with-the-Joneses urge unfolds itself. Every petty politician must have his or her entitlement of security. Those who have been left out till now try hard to be in. Once they are in, the next step is to endeavour to qualify for security of a category superior to what they have been granted. Politicians are not the only species covetous of security cover. Some bureaucrats, too, claim and get it. The craze spreads to other eminent persons in society. Filmstars and front-rank cricketers do not lag behind. One or two academics do not remain unaffected by the security fever either. The demand for security is soon equilibrated with the budgetary appropriations. Says Law once more stands vindicated.         
	Come to think of it, Says Law is broadly operational even in the deployment of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Army and paramilitary personnel pour in in specified areas on the ostensible purpose of controlling insurgency and restoring law and order. The rationale of despatching these forces is often questioned by the local population. The issue, however, soon gets resolved in a manner which has a hint of irony wrapped in it. Once the forces entrench themselves in the supposedly disturbed areas, some of their members tend to be brusque and overzealous. Unpleasant incidents begin to take place on a regular basis, alienating even larger sections of the local populace. The latter start agitating. Agitation leads to violence. After a while, indulgence in violence threatens to slide into insurgency. The forces of law and order along with the army understandably get busy. The supply of police and military bandobast gets matched by the felt need for such bandobast; supply again creates its own demand.               
	Actually demand can match supply in an even more direct manner. The more resources the authorities spend, in the name of fighting terror, the less resources are available for economic development and social welfare. An increase in the outlay on army and security arrangements, therefore, implies a corresponding decline in the allocation for the well-being of the people. This aggravates deprivation. Deprivation gives birth to discontent, discontent in its turn generates the impulse to get mobilized and protest. The protests sooner or later assume the form of an uprising, which immediately provides a justification for the full-scale deployment of security paraphernalia. Keynesians lose their profession in such widely dispersed regions as Kashmir, Chhattisgarh and Manipur.

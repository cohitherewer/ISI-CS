                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	House of discord                  
	Sir  The editorial, Let it work, please (Nov 27), is right to point out that, A functioning parliament is vital to a democracy and to its good health. The Oppositions demand for a joint parliamentary committee on the 2G spectrum scam has stalled parliamentary proceedings since the winter session started on November 9.          
	Given the magnitude of the scam, the government would do well to give in to the demand for a JPC. It is a mystery why the Congress is shying away from doing so. Moreover, as long as the Congress holds out, Parliament cannot function. Every minute lost is a waste of taxpayers money since the expenses of running the Parliament are borne by the public exchequer. It is in the best interests of the nation to institute a JPC to investigate the 2G spectrum scam.          
	Yours faithfully,       
N.R. Ramachandran, Ooty 

                
	Sir  The Opposition has been clamouring for a JPC to investigate the 2G spectrum scam, the allegations of corruption surrounding the Commonwealth Games, and the Adarsh land scam (Lunch cant break House logjam, Nov 17). The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, must now save face for his party and redeem his personal image. He might agree to a JPC on the Games controversy. He may also suggest that the Adarsh housing scam is a state subject and should be handled by the Maharashtra government. However, after taking no action against A. Raja for almost 11 months, it might seem inconsistent to give in to the demand for a JPC on the 2G spectrum at this juncture.           
	It is unreasonable of the Opposition to impede parliamentary proceedings until a JPC for the 2G spectrum scam is set up. Indeed, constituting a JPC may prove to be fruitless. According to reports, four investigative JPCs have been set up in the last 25 years, but none of them yielded significant results. There is no reason to suppose that a fifth JPC will be any different. It is to be hoped that better sense prevails among members of parliament and that both Houses are allowed to function properly. In any case, given the lack of political will, there is little hope that the thousands of crores lost will ever be retrieved.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The report submitted by the comptroller and auditor general indicted A. Raja for his involvement in the 2G spectrum scam. There were serious irregularities in the sale of 2G spectrum and an astronomical sum of Rs 1.76 lakh crore has been quoted as the loss incurred as a result of the scam. A thorough probe headed by a JPC is imperative. All those involved must be brought to book. Corruption has become endemic in the corridors of power. The popular demand that politicians be made accountable for their actions must be heeded.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Sravana Ramachandran, 

      
	Chennai                    
	Sir  A series of corruption scandals has come to light recently, implicating senior ministers and members of the government. But the prime minister seems powerless to address the situation (JPC call left with Singh, Nov 18). Even if a JPC is constituted, many suspect that the Prime Ministers Office will withhold certain vital documents in order to protect those in power.          
	The reports of the 2G spectrum scam and A. Rajas involvement in it have also shaken the nations confidence in Manmohan Singhs abilities as an administrator. After all, it was he who appointed such a corrupt individual as telecom minister. Moreover, it has been said that the Central Bureau of Investigation is under the influence of the government. This means that corruption charges against influential ministers will be hushed up and the guilty parties let off.           
	Manmohan Singh, the architect of the economic reforms of 1991, has always been known to be a honest and efficient politician. However, his failure to handle corruption charges in his government has tarnished his image. The Congress seems to have sold out and is at the mercy of its powerful ally, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Recent pictures of Pranab Mukherjee and P. Chidambaram making merry at a DMK members sons wedding certainly seem to suggest so.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Debasish Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Indian politics remains chaotic and incomprehensible. The Opposition is adamant on a JPC for the 2G spectrum scam and the government refuses to relent to the pressure. As a result, the functioning of the Parliament has ground to a halt. Even though the winter session had started, no work was done in 12 days. The current scenario is reminiscent of another controversy that occurred in 1996. Sukh Ram, who was then communications minister, was charged with taking bribes for awarding a telecom contract. Thirteen years later, in 2009, Sukh Ram was sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment.           
	The Opposition is employing similar pressure tactics now. In a bid to embarrass the government, the House has been disrupted for days. Ironically, the Bharatiya Janata Party is unable to act against its own corrupt members. The chief minister of Karnataka, B.S. Yeddyurappa, has emerged unscathed from the allegations of corruption against him.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

	It would be disastrous if a government were to allow partisan politics to dilute its security strategies. The Maoist rebellion in India, and the strategy to deal with it, are serious security challenges. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has repeatedly described the Maoist revolt as the greatest threat to the countrys internal security. The union home minister, P. Chidambaram, too, has always treated it as such. The Centre, therefore, cannot afford to see the fight against the Maoists in West Bengal the way the states rival politicians tend to do. It cannot be of much consequence to New Delhi how the anti-Maoist operations by the joint security forces affect the political fortunes of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Trinamul Congress. It is generally assumed that the battle has had some success in recent months. But, as Mr Chidambaram has said time and again, it is going to be a long and hard battle. A brief spell of success is thus no reason to either suspend the operations or dilute them in any way. Compulsions of partisan politics should not form any part of the anti-Maoist strategy now or any time in the future. This should be valid for such operations not just in West Bengal but also in any other part of the country where the threat exists.        
	Mamata Banerjees demand for the withdrawal of the joint forces from parts of West Bengal is clearly ill-advised. What she says about the CPI(M) using the operations in order to reclaim lost ground is not without basis. The ruling Marxists are known to have used not only their own cadre but also the police to suit their narrow political agenda. Ms Banerjee should use legitimate political methods to try and counter the CPI(M)s politics. But she should see the flip side of her demand for the withdrawal of the forces. It only reinforces the CPI(M)s charge that she takes the Maoists help in her fight against the former. Also, this is not the first time she has raised such a demand. She has been opposed to the deployment of the Central forces in the area and to the Operation Green Hunt right from its beginning. Her partys successes in recent elections make Ms Banerjee a potential winner in next years state assembly polls. An unfinished battle against the Maoists could be her problem too if she has to rule West Bengal. More important, the rebels, if not defeated, can do to the rest of the state tomorrow what they have done to Jangal Mahal.

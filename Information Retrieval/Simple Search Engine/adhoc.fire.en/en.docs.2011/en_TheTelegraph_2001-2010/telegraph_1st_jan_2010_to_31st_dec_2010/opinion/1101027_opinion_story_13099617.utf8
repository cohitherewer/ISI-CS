	Equally great                  
	Sir  In Cricket and consolation (Oct 23), Ramachandra Guha offers a detailed account of Sachin Tendulkars phenomenal batting against Australia in the second Test match in Bangalore. Guha mentions that while watching the proceedings, he and Suresh Menon enthusiastically compared Tendulkar with Bradman. But was such a comparison necessary? Donald Bradman may not have played in as many countries and grounds as the Little Master has, but he is regarded as the greatest batsman of all time. Bradmans average of 99.99 in Test cricket, in statistical terms, can be considered to be the greatest achievement. Moreover, Bradman belonged to a different time, an era that was shorn of the glitz and glamour that surround the world of cricket today.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ramachandra Guha once again displayed his passion for cricket in his inimitable style in the thoroughly enjoyable article. Instead of watching the proceedings in the state legislature, Guha chose to go to the Chinnaswamy stadium to watch a contest that was more exciting. Guha enjoyed watching Sachin Tendulkar and the young Murali Vijay take on the Australian fast bowler, Mitchell Johnson. There is a vivid description of Tendulkar taming Johnson with delectable shots, including pulls and drives. Tendulkars rise to a legendary status is worth being recounted over and over again. It was not for nothing that Don Bradman got impressed with his Indian counterpart while watching the latter play against Australia. Comparisons between the two greats are common, but Tendulkar himself does not enjoy being compared to either Bradman or Sunil Gavaskar, as he has the highest regards for both. This reflects Tendulkars humble nature, a trait that is admittedly the hallmark of any great man.          
	Guha mentions that two eminent cricket writers, Peter Roebuck and Suresh Menon, have praised Tendulkar highly. Guha concluded his enlightening article with a funny anecdote. The leader of the opposition in the Karnataka assembly, A. Siddaramaiah, had hoped that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party government would be defeated in the trust vote so that he could press his claim to the chief ministers post. After his hopes were dashed, the frustrated leader chose to leave the legislature for the Chinnaswamy stadium and, with Tendulkar still at the crease, he was sure that he would find both pleasure and consolation.           
	A columnist like Guha fills the hearts of cricket lovers and fans with immeasurable delight because of his anecdotal style of writing. This makes it difficult for readers not to heap praise on Guha for his delectable pieces.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The question as to who is the greatest batsman of all time  Donald Bradman or Sachin Tendulkar  continues to haunt cricket lovers. I completely agree with Ramachandra Guhas views in this matter; that Bradman and Tendulkar are on a par with each other. Bradman played during a time when cricket was bereft of any protective gear. There were no restrictions on bouncers or beamers either, making batsmen even more vulnerable.           
	But Guha rightly points out that Bradman played only in England and Australia. One wonders how he would have performed on turning pitches in the subcontinent. Moreover, these days, with the advent of technology, opponents can identify a batsmans weakness far more easily. Tendulkar, on the other hand, might fall short in terms of Bradmans batting average. But the fact that he has scored against all opposition, and on all surfaces, makes him Bradmans equal. Also, Bradman, unlike Tendulkar, did not have to shoulder the expectations of a billion people over the years. The only thing missing from Tendulkars list of achievements is a World Cup win. Tendulkar would dearly want to win the tournament next year. For Tendulkar, winning the World Cup will be the perfect way to bid farewell to cricket.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  After Sachin Tendulkar scored his double century and completed 14,000 runs in Test cricket, the media and experts started to compare him with Donald Bradman. Before comparing the two, one should remember that true legends cannot be weighed against one another. Neither can they fade from collective memory.           
	Without any doubt, Tendulkar has proved his mettle on a number of occasions. Moreover, Tendulkars importance does not lie in his cricketing brilliance only. His presence motivates his teammates and creates panic in the ranks of the opposition. Even Bradman had likened Tendulkars batting style to his own. Nonetheless, the Australian is beyond comparison. Arguably, Tendulkar is in great touch now, but the selectors and the Board of Control for Cricket in India deserve to be thanked for helping Tendulkar when he had been struggling with poor form. It is unlikely that Bradman would have received such support if he were to hit a bad patch. The famous cricketer, Neil Harvey, had once said that had Bradman played on the flat pitches that are available today, his batting average would have been much higher. This may well be true.           
	Yours faithfully,

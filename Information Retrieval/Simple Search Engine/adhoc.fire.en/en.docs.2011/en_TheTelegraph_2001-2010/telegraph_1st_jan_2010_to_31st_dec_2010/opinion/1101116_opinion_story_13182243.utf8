	Ashok Mitras article in the November 5 issue makes telling points. After decades of world economic dominance, the United States of America is in deep economic crisis. As President Barack Obama said in Mumbai, the US is no longer the overwhelming dominant economic power and must defer to others, like the Bric countries, particularly China.         
	The USs current account deficit in the balance of payments is 3.3 per cent, the latest 12-month deficit on trade is over $600 billion, and unemployment is at 9.6 per cent. But the economy appears to have emerged out of recession, with industrial production rising by 6.2 per cent in August and the gross domestic product by three per cent, inflation at a low of around one per cent, though three-month interest rates at 0.26 per cent suggest that the economy is still in need of artificial stimulation. Personal savings declined precipitously over the last three decades, from 12.55 per cent of the GDP in 1980 to one per cent, though post-2008 recession it has risen to six per cent, reflecting the fear of the future among many. With the budget deficit running at nine per cent of the GDP, the US at the individual and national level is running on the savings of other countries.        
	In the US, large government deficits of the last decade created substantial surplus liquidity that was used by banks to create bubbles in real estate and consumer credit. When the bubbles were pricked, recession occurred and spread. The US economy is overextended, with relative wages outstripping productivity in relation to economies like China and, with the economy depending hugely on overseas savings, it has become heavily indebted to China and other countries. For this, I would blame lax regulation of financial markets and institutions and the complacency of top management at the heart of American industry, such as General Motors.        
	The US must raise personal savings, and cut budget deficits. But continuing high unemployment has led the Federal Reserve to release vast extra liquidity which will lead to easier lending, greater consumer expenditures, especially on cheap imported goods, and send money to countries like India where returns are better, further increasing US deficits. There is a case for the US reverting to protectionism and implementing the US Congress legislation imposing import duties on Chinese goods that have the advantage of a devalued currency. To cut the import deficit, the US could manage the dollar value. Both run counter to the decades-old American policy of an open economy.         
	China has far better figures  GDP growth of 10.3 per cent to date, 13.9 per cent growth in industrial production, surplus on current account of 4.9 per cent, surplus trade balance in September of 4182.9 billion, 2.2 per cent budget deficit and foreign exchange reserves (excluding gold) in June 2010 of almost $2.5 billion. The unemployment rate is 9.6 per cent, inflation 3.5 per cent (in August), and three-month interest rates 2.64 per cent. With much of its industry State-owned or controlled, it also has many hidden subsidies which, with low wages and relatively higher productivity in relation to wages, help its goods remain internationally competitive. Chinas openness to imported technology, collaborations and a weak enforcement of intellectual property rights have helped it move up to exporting sophisticated engineered products of high quality and become the worlds largest exporter.         
	China is hostile to pressures to upvalue its currency and to any barriers to its exports. But some American action is inevitable that will reduce American imports. Indias software exports will be hurt by the higher costs of H1-B visas and impending taxes on American companies that outsource. But China has its own problems of high inequalities, urban-rural disparities, high unemployment and so on, and must take urgent steps to stimulate its domestic economy while reducing dependence on exports. Chinas militant (but not military) posture on all issues (borders, the South China sea, the Dalai Lama and so on) suggests that it will make aggressive noises but meekly take the actions necessary to protect the value of its huge dollar holdings and to stimulate its economy.         
	What does all this augur for India? Indias macroeconomic numbers are almost as unsatisfactory as those of the US (except GDP growth, chiefly in services). But India is not as large, as diversified, and the rupee is not the international reserve currency. Indias GDP growth this year will be better since agriculture will make a larger contribution. Industrial production is growing (5.6 per cent in August). But shares of both agriculture and industry are low. Inflation is a serious worry and though there has been some moderation recently, India is not out of the woods. The combined budget and fiscal deficits are high. Recent sales of shares in public sector enterprises and telecoms auctions have brought down the deficits. But inefficiencies in spending and large-scale corruption make government expenditures boost the black economy and not the real economy. More efficient investment in physical and social infrastructures is necessary.               
	The trade balance is in substantial deficit and has been so for some years ($121.8 billion in August). The current account deficit at present is at a reasonable 1.7 per cent but might rise with crude oil prices. Low interest rates in the developed countries and the release of liquidity in the US have led to substantial capital inflows into Indian shares and debts. These volatile inflows (and soon, outflows) lead to sharp rises and falls in stock market indices as well as in the external value of the rupee, aggravating deficits, inflation and trade imbalances. Now stock markets are at record highs, driven almost wholly by these volatile inflows. While foreign direct investments have also shown an upward trend, they are still a small proportion of institutional inflows. They need stimulation by reducing no-go areas and cutting approval times. India must begin a calibrated reduction of these volatile inflows while enabling greater direct investments. There is a good case for a graduated tax on foreign portfolio investments so that they stay invested for a minimum period. Also, administrative procedures must be made more flexible to enable faster flows of direct investments.         
	The American (and other developed countries) thrust on Indian markets will increase. Declines in the external value of the dollar will upvalue the rupee and adversely affect exports. Inflation needs to be controlled. The efficiency of government expenditures must improve quickly.         
	India has to make major policy choices. They are accentuated by the need for larger defence expenditure, as China heats up our borders with Pakistan, gearing up for a larger role in Afghanistan. India has to pick its way through this maze while staying focused on inclusive growth.

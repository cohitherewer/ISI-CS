	Q: Our land was given to a local person for cultivation. Subsequently, he tried to have his name registered as a bargadar (sharecropper), but failed. Then he tried to incorporate his name as part owner of the land. Though the court verdict held that my father was the sole owner of the land, he also transferred a major part of the plot to others, who went on to build houses there. What can I do to evict the illegal occupants and get possession of our property?        
	Chandra Das, via email                
	A: You may file a civil suit for declaration that the property is yours and that the property transfers are void, along with a prayer for restoration of possession. Simultaneously, you could institute criminal proceedings against the person for fraudulent transfers and misappropriation of property.              
	Q:One of our tenants has sold the tenancy rights of a shop on our premises. The buyer is now trying to get us to accept him as a bona fide tenant. Given that ours is a thika tenancy building (where the person pays rent on the land but is the owner of the house constructed on it), how can we evict this person?         
	Jawed Nehal, via email                
	A: The lands in thika tenancies  along with the interests of the landlords  have been vested in the state according to the West Bengal Thika Tenancy (Acquisition and Regulation) Act, 2001. Hence, a case of eviction of a thika tenant is to be disposed by the thika controller once the state government instructs him to do so. However, the controller is not empowered to adjudicate on whether or not a person is a thika tenant, as that comes under the jurisdiction of the civil court.               
	Q: My daughter and I stay in the flat where my deceased parents had lived. The flat was on a 99-year lease holding from 1959. Since April this year, I have been trying to pay the rent but the landlords son has not been meeting me. Finally, I sent the rent through money order but it returned undelivered. What can I do to ensure that he does not evict us before the five-year period is over?         
	Miriam Mukherjee, Calcutta                
	A: Since the flat in question is on a 99-year lease period you, as the natural heir of the deceased lessee, will be governed by the Transfer of Property Act and not The West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act. So the five-year period is not applicable to you.

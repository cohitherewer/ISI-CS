                                                  Letters to Editor
                
	Uncomfortable truths                  
	Sir  The editorial, Leaking truths (Dec 1), correctly analyses the facts behind the supposedly shocking revelations made by WikiLeaks. They have sent shock waves around the world and terribly embarrassed the United States of America. The revelations will have serious consequences for the diplomatic ties of the US.           
	Diplomacy is indeed a game of cunning. The leakage of the information on the internet has proved, however, that even a superpower like the US cannot keep its diplomatic secrets completely safe. Cyber safety is a huge concern, but is not easy to ensure. The USs outrage is understandable, for these revelations have forced it to apologize to its allies and its enemies. The US also has to assure the world that it is capable of guarding confidential diplomatic material.          
	It is true, as the editorial says, that it will be easier to avert such embarrassments if diplomatic proceedings are carried out with transparency and truthfulness. The WikiLeaks revelations should be taken as a warning by nations, which should be more cautious in their future dealings.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Adhip Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  After having been placed in an awkward position by the incriminating evidence put forward by WikiLeaks, the US is now raising strong objections. The documents that have been revealed prove that the US does not practise what it preaches. The list of its violations of human rights and freedom is long. People the world over have the right to know the truth.          
	Be it during the invasion of Iraq or of Afghanistan, a huge number of civilian lives was lost as a result of the USs activities. During the war in Iraq, countless men, women and children were even denied medicines. The US does not have the right to invade any sovereign country. From the information provided by WikiLeaks, it is certain that the US is more interested in commercial profit and benefits than in human rights, freedom and dignity. In spite of mounting evidence of the fact that there are training camps for terrorists in Pakistan, the US is unwilling to take any action against that country. Instead of protesting against the WikiLeaks revelations, it should be ashamed of itself.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

                
	Sir  The WikiLeaks expos is quickly spiralling out of the USs control. The fact that the country keeps leaders round the world under the scanner has been revealed. It is shocking that India was discreetly excluded from a nations meet on Afghanistan. The real feelings of the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, about Indias bid for a permanent seat in the UN security council are now known. India has always been a steadfast supporter of the US but to no avail, as the Wikileaks information proves. One hopes that our national leaders would be less obsequious towards the US in the future.                    
	Yours faithfully,        M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh            
	Sir  I disagree with the view expressed in Leaking truths. Certain vital documents pertaining to government policies and programmes are not meant to be accessed by everyone. Information that is likely to jeopardize relations between nations and their allies should never be made available to the public. I believe that the WikiLeaks expos amounts to a violation of rules.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Gururajan, Ooty

                
	Sir  The WikiLeaks revelations have only confirmed the anti-India stand of the US. However, if one tries to identify the root cause of this problem, one can trace it back to Jawaharlal Nehrus pro-communist foreign policy, which turned the capitalist nations against India from 1955 to 1964, and then again until the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since Nehrus time, successive US presidents have viewed India with suspicion, no matter whether they belonged to the Democratic or the Republican party.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

                
	Sir  It is part of a diplomats job to be tactful and affable towards the country hosting his visit. However, it is sometimes necessary to be frank and brutally honest as well, even if the truth causes discomfort. It is unfortunate that the US has been the nation most embarrassed by the WikiLeaks expos, because no State is completely transparent in all its dealings. It would not be surprising if important confidential papers of other nations are also leaked, and are found to be equally explicit and offensive.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
H.N. Ramakrishna, Bangalore

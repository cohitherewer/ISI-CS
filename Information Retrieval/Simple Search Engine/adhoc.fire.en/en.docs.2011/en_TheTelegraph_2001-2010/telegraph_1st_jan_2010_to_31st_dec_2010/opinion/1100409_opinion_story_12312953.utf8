	THE END OF THE PARTY: THE RISE AND FALL OF NEW LABOUR By Andrew Rawnsley, Viking, 25        
	It is a pity that the pre-publication publicity for Andrew Rawnsleys second book on the New Labour experience, The End of the Party: The Rise and Fall of New Labour, has focused so much on the intemperate raging of our current prime minister. There is, however, much more here; sometimes almost a surreal account of our recent and current political masters that, with or without their regular episodes of impotent and inarticulate mutual fury, can make depressing reading. It is a particularly galling story for anyone swept away in the early avalanche of New Labour excitement.        
	Rawnsley is one of the best connected, most skilled and most readable political journalists, and seems permanently wryly amused by the idiosyncrasies and idiocies of his subject matter. The full Westminster dramatis personae, known to him on a day-to-day basis, have been prepared to sing their hearts out for his interpretation  and our ultimate edification as he picks the meat from the bones. There is a lot of meat to pick over, but in-depth analysis will be a job for more distant historians.        
	This book is journalism through and through, instant history in an involved but unflaggingly immediate narrative of competitive backstabbing and betrayal. It reflects bleakly on the whole New Labour project, its architects and the majority of voters in Britain, who continued to buy into an insubstantial, vanity-driven dream led by a remarkable ringmaster. As Rawnsley says: Blair was unmatched at the theatre of politics. But the dream took on nightmare colours when he hitched his war wagon to George Bushs in Iraq and buried his own head in the sand.        
	Blairs greatest weakness was his inability to face up to the consequences of his own decisions. His actorly abilities allowed him to create a rose-tinted barrier between himself and reality that fooled most people until Iraq. Where old friends were concerned, his constant focus on his own survival and the imperative to come out unsullied in the public eye enabled total brutality when sacking a close friend like Peter Mandelson twice. Perhaps, too, when hanging on to his greatest prop, the spin-doctor, Alastair Campbell, whose manic-depressive state became dangerously fragile during the WMD-Iraq debacle.        
	While Mandelson has been resurrected from the outer darkness to become Gordon Browns prop, the relationship that underpins The End of the Party more than any other is that of Blair and Brown. The former, however vicious the state of enmity with his Downing Street neighbour, was never quite secure enough to rid himself of the nexus that has been the alpha and the omega of New Labour. On June 27, 2007, Blair finally handed the premiership to his Chancellor: Lauded by his opponents, clapped out of the chamber, celebrated as a leader above party, he choreographed himself a very elegant exit. Not so his successors official entrance to Downing Street an hour later under the threat of rain.        
	Browns initial attempts to cement his coronation as prime minister with a government of all the talents and a broad gloss to the new administration that suggested the continuance of New Labour-centrism under a more trustworthy leadership were cosmetically successful. But his staff realized rapidly that he was not only more interested in potential headlines than his predecessor, but was also the control freaks control freak. More frighteningly, they realized that he had come to believe in his own financial omnipotence.        
	The crash of Northern Rock in August, 2007, burst Browns bubble and, followed by the election that never was, reduced his premiership to a limp trunk supported by the most improbable crutch of all, his former ally- turned-bitterest-enemy, Mandelson. Mandelsons regeneration as favoured advisor, supporter and lord-high-everything has added an air of the fairy tale to a story that has no happily-ever-after. It seems likely that, however much he may mourn the final bonfire of his, Blairs and Browns flawed vanities, he will add fuel to the flames out of sheer devilment.        
	The End of the Party has the entertainment value of the political series, The Thick of It, and its spin-off film, In the Loop, and proves them not so much satire as truthful to the recent picture in Britains corridors of power. The characters of New Labour politicians, skewered by themselves, their fellows or the media are, it turns out, stranger than fiction and this book lays them bare. It may be too immediate a story for conclusions on their project, its effects, and what later history will make of it, but it is cracking good journalism and races through the crowded tale heaving with activity and acrimony.        
	As the New Labour years become more blurred, historians will return to the story as it happened, and we will read it again in endless volumes. For those who have watched or lived with the New Labour experiment, The End of the Party has an immediacy that makes for irresistible reading. It breaks down the walls of Westminster offices, winds down car windows, catches conversations and whispers and gives us highly coloured behind-the-scenes pictures that are largely free from the self-serving bias of the diaries and biographies of those most nearly concerned with the New Labour game; the victims, supporters, or those fallen by the wayside who have already rushed into print and will continue to do so for years to come.

Rao                        Well oiled				                                                   
	In infrastructure regulation, the government was forced to set up independent regulators because of the need to attract private and foreign investment. The way in which the bureaucracy managed to retain control was one that they later applied to other areas, like the right to information and competition. They ensured that almost all selections of members and especially chairmen were from the Central services, and, as a small concession, other (usually) retiring officers from different services and from State-owned enterprises. This ensured that governments retained control over important regulatory decisions. Resistance came from the judiciary when this control process was tried with the appellate tribunals. The judiciary felt that the tribunals should be neutral and objective. Ultimately the bureaucracy conceded that the chairmen of these tribunals would be judges (serving or retired).         
	Financial regulators  the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India  were created much earlier, while the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority was created almost at the same time as the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. Particularly after Independence, it was common practice for the governor of the RBI to be a former finance secretary or senior bureaucrat. Rarely, when he was not from the Central services, he would have served in an administrative position earlier. Both Sebi (except once when a Life Insurance Corporation chairman was selected) and Irda have always been chaired by former bureaucrats, and always from the Central government services.               
	Of course, this quiet compliance to the suzerainty of the ministry was sometimes abandoned by the bureaucrat who, when appointed to a regulatory commission, took wings as he tasted the freedom of independence. The best example in the RBI was Y. Venugopal Reddy, who pursued his mandate even when it conflicted with the views of the finance ministry. But it was more common for the finance ministrys views to prevail.         
	Many reasons were cited for appointing bureaucrats to regulatory commissions. One top bureaucrat told me with a straight face that otherwise there would be no qualified candidates. Others said that the remuneration would not attract non-bureaucrats. (The last Pay Commission has substantially raised the remuneration for regulators.) The arrangement incidentally helped to ensure consultation and coordination regarding major policies between the government and the regulator and when there was disagreement between them, the government position would prevail. This has happened repeatedly in decisions on monetary policy, and with infrastructure regulators in holding back justifiable tariff increases. It was no punishment that the practice would also extend the bureaucrats serving life after retirement.         
	One result of this practice, allied to the strong instincts of turf protection of bureaucrats and the ministers advised by them, was the plethora of independent regulatory bodies created after the economy opened up in 1991. Each ministry had to have at least one such body, and in some cases, more than one department in the ministry had its own. Energy has the CERC and the state electricity regulatory commissions; the ports ministry has the Tariff Authority for Major Ports; petroleum and natural gas has the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board; coal is to have one soon; and in some there are appellate tribunals to match, with government officers as members since the judiciary has reserved the chair for judicial officers. There are times when the regulatory jurisdiction of one regulator impinges on that of another.         
	For example, when I was at the CERC as chairman (the only non-bureaucrat or judge so far to hold such a position in a regulatory body, except for a former chairman of the State Bank of India, M.S. Verma, in the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), the Power Grid Corporation of India, holding the national monopoly for interstate transmission at the time, wanted to string fibre optic cables across the country on its towers. I discussed it with the then chairman of Trai (the judge, N.K. Sodhi) and we agreed that the electricity consumer should get credit from the company for using the electricity towers. We left before a decision had to be taken. Many of us have foreseen similar jurisdictional issues between the Competition Commission and the infrastructure regulators. The latter are charged to promote competition in their sectors, and of course there are issues of mergers and acquisitions. The Competition Commission is a new body and has many other things it has to do. When natural monopolies are involved, investments are lumpy and so installations are not in proximity, and there is a shortage, as with electricity. Competition in infrastructure requires the regulator to simulate the effects of competition. This requires some knowledge of the sector. The consensus is that such issues should be left to the sectoral regulator.         
	In the last few years, electricity trading markets and exchanges have been in place and are in considerable use. The exchanges which initially engaged in spot and day-ahead trading obviously saw the need for futures trades as well. The Forward Markets Commission thought all futures trades were in its jurisdiction. The dispute awaits resolution but it is best resolved by discussion or by the appellate tribunal  there is one for electricity. It should certainly not be resolved by the ministries. That would take away the concept of independence that is enshrined in the formation of these bodies.         
	Such a conflict over jurisdiction arose between Sebi and the RBI about the regulation of unit-linked insurance plans. It was set to go to court when the finance ministry decided to intervene and decided in favour of the Irda. This was bad enough, since it brought the executive into resolving a dispute between two regulatory bodies. It has now created the precedent that the executive is the authority over these bodies. The independence that was given them to avoid various forces  political, personal or simply power-related  from influencing their decisions has been violated by bureaucratic and ministerial interference. The only influences in resolving disputes by regulatory bodies must be purely objective ones based on detailed analysis of the facts and the law as it applies to any situation.               
	Now the government has gone much farther by issuing an ordinance which it threatens to get made into legislation by Parliament in six months, that will create a body chaired by the finance minister with representatives of the regulators (RBI, Sebi, Irda), to resolve such jurisdictional disputes. Thus, at least, in such disputes, the executive will be supreme when it should be a judicial body that decides on the solutions to such disagreements between independent regulatory bodies. Unfortunately, politicians and bureaucrats, when they are in power, have delusions of immortality. They think that they are objective, neutral and honest, taking decisions only in the nations interest, and that this will remain so. They might be objective, neutral and honest, but there is no assurance that future appointees will remain so. Once legislation is passed, such powers will be exercised by whoever is holding the office in government. The power it gives the executive makes a mockery of the independence these regulatory bodies are supposed to have.         
	We need to rationalize the plethora of regulatory bodies and such coordination must be within the body itself. Why not the RBI governor as chair of the proposed apex committee to decide on a majority basis? Why not put all energy regulations under one body? Appellate tribunals headed by judges should be few, and might decide jurisdictional issues. Appointments to regulatory bodies should not be only from among current and ex-government servants but be filled on advice from a body of eminent persons who would choose from among academics, lawyers, businessmen, and others they deem suitable. Experienced and respected ministers like Pranab Mukherjee should not take motivated bureaucratic advice aimed to enlarge their turf. They must consider how power might be wielded by successors.

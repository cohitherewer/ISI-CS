	The mindless violence that recently claimed two lives in Hassan and Shimoga in Karnataka is indefensible. Beginning on the day of Holi, successive waves of attacks on bystanders, public property and media houses went on for two days before the administration could restore a semblance of order. The immediate provocation was the publication of a controversial article by Taslima Nasreen in a local newspaper, where she is supposed to have made derogatory remarks on Islam. For some time now, Ms Nasreen seems to have become a red rag for fundamentalists. As in Calcutta  whose image as a liberal and tolerant society lies in a shambles after the violence over Ms Nasreens publications and its handling by the political class  in Shimoga, too, the mention of Ms Nasreen has inspired irrational behaviour among a section of the people that has been led to believe in stereotypical notions about the writer, as also about women and religion. It goes without saying that this sort of behaviour is a violation of the basic freedoms of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution and is freely indulged in by members of all religious communities, often with the endorsement of political parties. None can deny that without adequate political backing, the Bajrang Dal could not have targeted M.F. Husain so systematically and ensured his banishment from the country. The violence in Hassan and Shimoga, together with Mr Husains predicament, shows the expanding girth of an intolerant, reactive India which has no understanding of the meaning of creative freedom and individual space, or of the artists rights against misrepresentation. It is therefore not surprising that Ms Nasreen (who has denied writing the article for the Kannada newspaper) finds her words distorted and her work misused.        
	It is perhaps also not surprising that such incidents, as the ones in Hassan and Shimoga, that encapsulate this dangerous change in India should become increasingly frequent in Karnataka. A weak political leadership, which regards every act of communal violence or atrocity against women as a conspiracy against it, cannot be expected to stand up to such challenges. Be it the burning of churches or the rioting over temples or the burqa, no administration worth its name should allow the usurpation of one fundamental right for the defence of another.

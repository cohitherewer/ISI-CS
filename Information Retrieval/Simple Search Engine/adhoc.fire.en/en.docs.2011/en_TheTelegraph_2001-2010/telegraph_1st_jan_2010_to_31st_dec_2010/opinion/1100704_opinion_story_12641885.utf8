                              Open session      
	 The Union minister for environment and forests is all set to raise a stink again. The indomitable Jairam Ramesh is expected to go to Bhopal next week to try and convince gas survivors and activists why they need to give up their protest against Dow Chemicals. Ramesh is himself convinced that the witch-hunt against the former chief minister, Arjun Singh, and other Congress bigwigs had better stop. He wants to do it all the BT-brinjal-style, and open the floor to a threadbare discussion with the survivors. Earlier this week, Ramesh interacted with students in the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai. When a student asked him why the taxpayers should pay for cleaning the toxic material in the now-defunct factory in Bhopal, the minister replied nonplussed, Why not? I will pay.                      
	 For politicians, changing loyalties comes as easily as changing clothes. Take the case of the Bharatiya Janata Party gen-sec, Anant Kumar. When LK Advani called the shots in the party, Kumar was reputed to be Advanis Hanuman. Now that Advanis fortunes have turned, Kumar has parked himself by the side of Nitin Gadkari. When Gadkari travelled to Europe recently, it was Kumar who was given a free hand to take important decisions. The partys decision to support the controversial liquor baron, Vijay Mallya, was also taken at Kumars behest. Clearly, a new crop of hair is not all that has been added to Kumars appeal.                            
	 Be it cricket or politics, Sharad Pawar leads by example. Now, it seems that Raj Thackeray wants to follow in Pawars footsteps. A section of the Shiv Sena is apparently trying hard to bring Raj and Uddhav together. Recently, in an editorial in Saamna, the Sena mouthpiece, an open appeal was made for the brothers to come together, like the Ambanis had done. But Rajs loyalists believe he can never forget the humiliation of being forced out of the Shiv Sena. Besides, Raj has developed his own identity. However, some say that Raj is not averse to considering a return, provided he is put at the helm of affairs  a condition that is not very different from the one Pawar had placed before the Congress. Pawar did not get his way. Will Raj?                            
	 One wonders if there was ever a duty performed with such dedication and promptness. The Delhi police and the CISF are said to have found Rahul Gandhis stolen mobile in record time. Initially, there was an attempt to suppress the news of the theft. But the CISF is believed to have leaked it once it saw the Delhi police battalion busy itself in watching television. But the force soon made amends.The only other time the Delhi police were found to be proactive was when their chief, YS Dadwal, lost his dog. Then, too, the Delhi police had traced the pet in record time. But then, mobiles do not bark as dogs do.                            
	 Now that the prime minister is back from the G20 summit, there is speculation about an impending cabinet reshuffle. Apart from having a new minister of state in external affairs, Singh and Sonia Gandhi may also show the door to some tainted ministers. The idea is to present a clean Congress team in sharp contrast to the teams fielded by its allies. But the mission may fail if some close family friends manage to have their say. There is a buzz that Satish Sharma, who was recently elected to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, has set his heart on regaining his old portfolio in the petroleum ministry. No matter how many incarnations Sharma has undergone, the mud continues to stick on him. If he is made a minister, some believe that Sharma may well become the Congresss A Raja.                            
	 Sonia Gandhi has her heart in the right place. She may have failed to get the womens reservation bill passed in the Lok Sabha, but that has done nothing to dampen her spirits. She is now keen to get a woman to be the next chief election commissioner after Navin Chawla retires. The names of Shanta Sheela Nair and Sushma Nath are doing the rounds. Nayar is currently mines secretary and Nath the present expenditure secretary. But both of them, apparently, do not have much time before they retire.

	 At the G20 summit in Toronto, Twinkle Khanna was seated at Manmohan Singhs high table while her husband, Akshay Kumar, was performing his duties as master of ceremonies at the gala dinner for the visiting Indian PM. Singh was perhaps entirely unaware of Twinkles star status. His indifference to Bollywood is in sharp contrast to the lively interest his predecessor, AB Vajpayee, took in filmi matters. At a banquet, Vajpayee was reportedly eating more gulab jamuns than his physician would have approved of. So his attendants quickly brought in Madhuri Dixit. While Vajpayee chatted with the actress, his aides cleared the table of the sweets.

	Did Sukumar Ray or Lewis Carroll need a patronizing nod from their governments to write their books for children? Or do their young readers require prescriptions from the State to enjoy these books? All that the latter need are a solid education, in English and in the vernacular, and a quality of life that affords them the time, the health and the environment to read; here the State has an important role to play. But this role does not necessitate the creation of a national book-promotion policy or council of childrens literature. Well-managed primary education, supported by basic welfare systems like health and nutrition, is quite enough. And with these, the function of the Union human resource development ministry is not of paramount importance. This is what Kapil Sibal, in charge of this ministry, tends to forget in his indomitable officiousness. Time and again, the HRD ministry proposes councils and commissions that set out to tell institutions and individuals (usually associated with education) what to do and how to do it, while proclaiming that these new bodies are going to be autonomous and independent. So, a protracted and largely futile interaction between the ministry and these institutions follows, in which the meaning of autonomy is debated, just as futilely, and nobody emerges the wiser from this process.        
	This is about to happen again with Mr Sibal now thinking about how to make children read more books and how to ensure that there are more such books for them to read, particularly in the Indian languages. Mr Sibal is also eager to set up an institute for publishing management and technology and a regulatory body for publishers that would ensure legal controls and support. The usual things about governmental concern as well as autonomy are being said, with no sense at all, on the part of the ministry, of the potential contradictoriness of such well-intentioned noises. If the Central and state governments simply concentrate on implementing their primary education policies, especially on how to teach the first and second languages, and make sure that teachers are properly qualified and compensated, and schools have proper libraries with a constant supply of books in them, and that childrens lives are stable and healthy enough to make room for reading, then everything else should fall into place. The rest is not, and should not be, Mr Sibals concern, or that of a modern State.

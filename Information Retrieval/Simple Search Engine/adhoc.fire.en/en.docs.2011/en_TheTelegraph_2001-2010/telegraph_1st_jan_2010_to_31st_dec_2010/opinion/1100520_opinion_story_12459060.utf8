	Two unrelated news caught the eyes of this author on the morning of March 15, 2010. First was the electronic medias weekly watch informing us about 9.89 per cent inflation, a record high in recent times. And the second was a report about the governments instruction to its bureaucrats to show zero tolerance towards corruption. Hence the day began with the bad news about the rising cost of living, and the good news about the pious wish of an establishment to have no tolerance for grafts.        
	Although the incumbent cabinet secretary has been appointed the head of a high-level group for speedy scrutiny of complaints against government secretaries, one wonders how far the group will succeed when about 95 per cent of all the secretaries to the government, including the cabinet secretary, are officers of the Indian Administrative Service. Corruption is not an issue with the majority of civil servants because it is now part and parcel of the system.        
	Let us go into the basics. All Class I civil servants who join the government through the UPSC examination undergo a two-year probation period when they get full pay, honour, rank, transport and other allowances, and are trained in the ways to discharge their duties and fulfil their responsibilities. Yet, within 10 years, the actual trends emerge loud and clear. Within 20 years, they are famous or notorious and between 29 and 33 years, it is time for the final manipulation of the system to get the prized slots of the additional secretary and secretary.        
	The problem today is that so far the IAS officers had been contemptuously branding the bureaucrats of the Indian Police Service, Indian Revenue Service and Indian Customs and Central Excise Service as corrupt, dishonest and hence unfit to become additional secretary or secretary. It is only now, when top IAS officials are getting caught with property and cash worth hundreds of crores, that the establishment is realizing the gravity of the situation  one suspects, primarily for the sake of foreign investment. But what about officers corruption as revealed in their dealings with Indians in the countryside?                
	Classic cases        
	Today, Indias internal corruption is such that we can easily introduce a subject at the graduate and postgraduate levels called corruption studies to tackle the issue and tap its hidden potential. India has never been serious about the subject since 1947, and we have always addressed the problem with a kid-glove attitude. As a result, even the Central Bureau of Investigation does not inspire confidence today, and the Central Vigilance Commission is considered to be a joke, with its advices being taken mostly as optional and not obligatory. One can mention here two incidents of corruption that are grave enough to shake the conscience of the nation.        
	When the world was asking India to counter the Lashkar-e-Toibas threat to the World Cup hockey tournament in Delhi, a uniformed man belonging to Delhi Police was reportedly selling tickets to the highest bidders outside the stadium. All his colleagues saw this but none dared to intervene. It was a classic case of organized corruption at a time when the nations security was under threat.        
	Then there is another familiar form of gangsterism. Groups of policemen extort money all over Delhi. We are indifferent to this because justice and administration are contradictory in India today. If the government had any conscience, it would have taken at least some measures to clean the rotten system of administration that panders to the needs of foreign investors and crushes the people inside by a conspicuous absence of justice or equity.        
	Let the establishment first identify and give exemplary punishment to the corrupt bureaucrats at the middle and senior levels. But who is to bell the cat?

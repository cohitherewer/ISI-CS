	City without walls      
	The Man with Enormous Wings (Penguin, Rs 199) by Esther David revisits the Godhra carnage in an unusual way. The narrative strings together impressionistic sketches of those shrines and monuments of Ahmedabad that had once been proofs of the citys communal harmony. So there is the Chalte Pir ki Dargah, the Hadkai Mata nu Mandir or the Sidi Saiyyed mosque where anyone from any community could pray and be healed as long as he believed. Then came 2002 and the train and the fire that destroyed all that was good. The feeble spirit of the man with enormous wings, Mahatma Gandhi, hovers over the city, unable to change its destiny. The doodles by the author add to the poignancy of the narrative.                        
	When the Tiger was King: A Book About Tigers (Rupa, Rs 95) edited by Ruskin Bond says in the foreword, Before the tiger vanishes forever from the land which was once synonymous with tigers, let us at least celebrate its former majesty with stories that pay tribute to its fierce splendour and terrible beauty. So this book is an elegy for the fast-disappearing tigers, as well as an appeal to save them. Bond collects for this slim volume tales by the Old Shekarrey, Henry Astbury Leveson, written in 1877, by Frank Buck about the capture of the man-eater of Johore for an American zoo that recalls the travails of Gerald Durrell on similar missions, and Gond fables about a human child brought up by a tigress that might have been the inspiration behind Kiplings The Jungle Book. Then there are Bonds very own When Grandfather Tickled a Tiger and The Tiger in the Tunnel that are as delightful as ever. Most of the stories, belonging to the early 20th century, recall a time when tigers were still plentiful in the wild, unlike today. But as hunting stories, they also point to one of the reasons why tigers are rapidly becoming mythical creatures that might exist only in legends in times to come.                        
	The First Week with My New PC: A Very Basic Guide for Mature Adults and Everyone Else Who Wants to Get Connected (Macmillan, Rs 195) by Pamela R. Lessing can become the bible of the technologically challenged. It was written for the authors 85-year-old mother who is now a PC master, and after reading it from cover to cover, anyone can lay claim to that title. It answers such essential questions as, I tried to give a new file a name and the machine makes a noise and will not let me do it. What is the problem? or How do I know when to use the Alt key and when to use the Cntrl key? It even spares a thought for lefties, who generally have trouble handling the mouse, which is configured keeping right-handed people in mind.                                  
	Rock and Roll Jihad: A Muslim Rock Stars Revolution (Jaico, Rs 395) by Salman Ahmad with Robert Schroeder is the story of the lead singer of the rock band, Junoon, in his own words. When Ahmad first started playing in Pakistan, he had to face stiff opposition from angry mullahs and fanatics who wanted music to be banned in the country. But with the resounding strains of Sufi qawwals in his heart, Ahmad strove on till his songs like Sayonee, Bheegi Yadein and Azadi became chartbusters, bringing Western-style rock and pop music to Pakistani teenagers for the first time. The book comes with a CD of 12 hit songs by Ahmad and Junoon. Although one can understand the importance of Ahmads music, he seems to take himself too seriously at times. Everything is so positive and feel-good that one is tempted to ask for a few pinches of salt.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        REASON NOT THE NEED                                                                  
	Children who run away from home to make their own lives on the street are heady company. Toughened by poverty and violence, they see  and consciously project  their lives as the living out of hard-won adult freedoms outside the limits of respectability. They habitually speak in the active voice. You would think that terrible things must have happened to them. But talk to them, and you will find yourself being persuaded in no time that it is they who made things happen, they who chose to escape their homes and families, they who have taught themselves to make a living  and are the better for it. They give themselves, or one another, a new set of names, which are usually Shah Rukh, Aamir and Salman. (I say children, but you realize I am speaking of boys here. The girls stories are brutally different.)        
	Together with this flaunted independence, you will be faced with dollops of brilliantly manipulative charm. Taking you around their own terrain like a gallant host, be it a big-city railway station or a small-town red-light area, they will talk you through their lives, loves, trials and friendships, stopping to buy you a kulfi or some muri on credit, letting you see how familiar they are with the hawkers, goons, pimps, tramps, madams, whores and policemen, assuring you all the while that you have nothing to fear, for you are with Shah Rukh.        
	NGO-workers, funding-agency dadas, politicians, people from the missions, charities and schools  the boys know them all. But just as you find yourself giving in to this endlessly entertaining cocksureness, and feel vaguely crestfallen about the limitedness of your own existence, something unexpected happens in front of your eyes and you begin to hear their active voice as desperate bravado. You come upon a boy beaten up and weeping in an RPF lock-up, or being rushed to hospital after falling off a running train and losing a leg, or shivering blankly after a hard bout of glue-sniffing, or telling you with a trusting little smile that unsafe sex with his bhai in an abandoned wagon is more enjoyable than safer sex with the mashi in the brothel  and suddenly, watching and intervening in this performance becomes difficult. Everything you wanted to believe, but were afraid to question, about childhood, victimhood and development work, and about your own implicatedness in all this, is stood on its head.        
	As thinking, feeling, sexual beings, afraid of pain, loss of dignity, loneliness and death, desiring to be desired, needing to be needed, given to self-pity more frequently than we like to admit, and to measuring our unhappiness against the happiness of others, why do we come to these children and what do we want from them? We think we know why they come to us, but we resist confronting the fact that we also need them to come to us.        
	This need is not only social and economic, but also inscrutably personal, psychic. And our unwillingness to acknowledge and understand the many forms it might take within us, and in our work with children, has become institutionalized. There is less and less space within child work to reflect on how and why the personal runs into the professional within such a vocation  necessarily, but often perversely, even dangerously.        
	Development work is caught between its origins in charity and moralistic reform on the one hand, and its current transformation into a corporatized profession on the other, with a branch shooting off towards academia. Yet, the habits and jargon of charity or reform are as unwilling or powerless as those of corporate accountability or academic analysis to look into the deep and disinterested heart of caritas and ponder what keeps it beating.                          AVEEK SEN

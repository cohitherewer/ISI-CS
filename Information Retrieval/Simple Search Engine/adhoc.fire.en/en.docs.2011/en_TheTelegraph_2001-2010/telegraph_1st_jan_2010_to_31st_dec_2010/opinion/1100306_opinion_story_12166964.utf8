	Time for a fitness check                  
	Sir  Adequate importance is given to the health of the American president and his ministers so that they can serve the people efficiently (Doctor: Obama fit, should quit smoking, Mar 2). Unfortunately, a majority of the members of the Indian Parliament and state legislative assemblies are physically unfit; many are unable to even walk properly. A bill must be passed in India whereby a medical check-up is made mandatory for those filing nominations to contest elections, so that the worlds largest democracy becomes vibrant and able.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

      
	Outrageous          
	Sir  The article by the dissident Bangladeshi author, Taslima Nasreen, denouncing the burqa, first appeared in an English magazine three years ago (Taslima article fury, Mar 2). However, it is the Kannada translation of this piece in a newspaper called Kannada Prabha that has raised the hackles of fanatics, who have used it as an excuse to indulge in mindless violence. It would do well to remember that bigots do not take to the streets unless they have political patronage. Every riot in this country has tacit political support. Exposing these political links seem to be the only solution to the mayhem that rioters and arsonists indulge in.          
	Yours faithfully,       
K.S. Jayatheertha, Bangalore

                
	Sir  Those offended by Taslima Nasreens comments on the burqa are perhaps expecting immediate deportation of the author from her secret shelter in India to another country, in addition to the deletion of this allegedly derogatory article from the vernacular daily in Karnataka. On the other hand, eminent social activists tend to compare this display of outrage against Nasreen with the vandalism of M.F. Husains paintings by supporters of Bajrang Dal. But it must be kept in mind that in the latter instance, there was no attack on public property owned by the State, as in Hassan and Shimoga.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta

                          
	Too hot          
	Sir  Environmentalists and commuters have welcomed the new fleet of so-called environment-friendly buses introduced in Calcutta under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission scheme. These vehicles have comfortable seats, and numerous windows and roof-hatches. The high and slippery handrails have caused a few minor mishaps, inciting caustic comments from travellers. But such discomfort can be generally overlooked when compared to the advantages these buses offer.          
	However, most of us have not taken note of some major faults these new vehicles have. Their design is quite unsuitable for weather conditions of a tropical, humid place. In the summer months, the large glass windows that run all around the top half of these buses will admit a lot more sunlight than the smaller and fewer windows of the older buses let in. Moreover, the glass will trap solar radiation inside the bus, creating a greenhouse effect. The older buses, with their shiny metallic bodies, also reflected a part of the heat and light.          
	I am not suggesting that the old vehicles be reinstated. But persons with some expertise about travel conditions in tropical regions should be put in charge of approving the designs, rather than bureaucrats and politicians who use air-conditioned cars, and hence have little experience of travelling by public transport.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Susmita Basu, Calcutta

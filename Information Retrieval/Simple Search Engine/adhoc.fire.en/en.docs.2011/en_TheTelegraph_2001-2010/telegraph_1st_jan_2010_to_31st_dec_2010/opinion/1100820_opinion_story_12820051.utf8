	With rapid advances taking place in digital technology, can books be identified with printed paper any longer, especially when countless books and research papers are being posted on the internet? What does print mean these days? Can we use the term in the pre-digital, books in print sense? Can academics use digital editions as citations for their works? What, in short, is the relationship between publication and print? These fundamental questions are being asked while discussing the future of the book as technology comes to play a central role in the publishing industry.        
	Clearly, the use of print in the narrow sense of ink on paper no longer holds. All materials posted on the internet that can be accessed by users fall under the purview of publishing. This trend will continue at a much more frenetic pace for two reasons. First, publishers can no longer accommodate more titles because it requires plenty of time and money. So the philosophy is to encourage authors to use the internet to post their stuff and, if the response is good, consider publication at a later date.        
	Second, distribution costs have gone up considerably. The retail trade has been pressing for better terms that have left smaller margins with publishers. The response has been uniform across the board  stick to sure-shot titles, concentrate on hard-core selling and vacate all peripheral areas that hold little promise of quick returns. For publishers faced with the digital challenge, is it possible to fall back on traditional ways of publishing? More importantly, can writers depend on the old ways of submitting manuscripts for publication? The answer is an emphatic no. This is because digital technology is clean, fast and cost effective. It is clean because no ink is used in preparing the copy for press. It is quicker because computer output is much faster than the traditional methods. Above all, it is cost effective because a much greater volume of work can now be done as composing speeds are so much faster. Authors who havent kept pace with the times can continue to submit their typescripts as in the past. But more and more publishers expect them to submit digital versions of their works because this minimizes composing and proof-reading costs and speeds up the production process.         
	With the rapid expansion of digital technology, the relationship between publication and print has changed. Anything that can be read on paper or screen and can be replicated is being considered published. Books and journals now carry citations from articles that have not been printed on paper but are posted on the web in support of their work. It is only a matter of time before digital versions are accepted as published works by readers.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE                                                      Pettus Bridge                            
	The Bridge: The life and rise of Barack Obama By David Remnick, Picador, 5.99        
	In 2004, while attending a White House event, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Illinois wore the campaign pin of her states candidate for the United States of America Senate. When President George Bush did a double take at the one word on her pin, she assured him that it spelled Obama, not Osama. Bush shrugged: I dont know him. She answered, You will. Not long after, Barack Obama gave the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention and millions suddenly knew him. It happened so fast that he seemed to come out of nowhere. But he was there all along. He was everywhere.        
	The title of the incisive new book by David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker since 1998, refers to the bridge in Selma, Alabama, where civil rights demonstrators were attacked by State troopers on March 7, 1965, in a bloody clash that would galvanize the nation and lead to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Forty four years later, one of the leaders of that march, John Lewis, observed on the eve of Obamas inauguration, Barack Obama is what comes at the end of that bridge in Selma.        
	Obamas story has been told many times  by journalists, by several biographers and, most memorably, by the president himself, who, before he became a politician, wrote a remarkably eloquent and searching memoir, Dreams From My Father, about his youth, his struggle to come to terms with his absent father and his faltering efforts to forge an identity of his own. But if the outlines of the story told in The Bridge are highly familiar, Remnick has filled in those broad contours with insight and nuance. He has used interviews of many of the formative figures in the presidents life  in particular, his relationships with his self-destructive father and his romantic, sometimes nave, mother. Writing with remarkable precision and an enviable knowledge of politics, Remnick describes Obama as cool, charismatic and slightly detached, an autodidact with a lawyers intelligence and a novelists empathetic temperament, an idealist who is also a pragmatist; a politician inclined to be methodical and cautious in his decision-making. Like Richard Wolffe in his 2009 book, Renegade, Remnick also places considerable emphasis on the role community-organizing had in shaping Obamas approach to politics  experience that ratified the future presidents inclination to listen and engage other people; a trait reinforced as the president of the Harvard Law Review and as a professor at the University of Chicago. Remnick also portrays Obama as a son who aspired to be calm, rooted and responsible in all the ways that his volatile and unreliable father was not  an avid student who craved mentors he could learn from, like the constitutional scholar, Laurence H. Tribe, at Harvard, and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois.        
	Step by step, as Obama grew up with his white grandparents in Hawaii, he began immersing himself in an African-American culture that seemed to live thousands of miles from where he was. Remnick adds, He listened to Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, Grover Washington and Miles Davis; he watched Soul Train and Richard Pryor on television. On his own he read Richard Wrights Native Son, the poems of Langston Hughes, The Autobiography of Malcolm X, The Souls of Black Folk, the essays of James Baldwin, Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man. It may appear to some readers that the book attempts to define Obama largely through the prism of race. But the president, on numerous occasions, and others like Colin L. Powell, have resisted this view, arguing that the junior Senator from Illinois ran for presidentship as an American who is black, not as a black American. For Obama, Remnick concludes, the black freedom struggle defines not just the African-American experience, but the American experience itself. Or as Obama has so eloquently observed, we as African-Americans are American, and that our story is Americas story, and that by perfecting our rights we perfect the Union.        
	Remnick recounts a touching story of the re-enactment of the march across The Bridge in 2007. It reveals the compassionate and empathetic side of Obama, that, according to him, came from his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham. Unlike the ritual reenactments of the Battle of Selma, the reenactments of the crossing of the Pettus Bridge involved no mock violence. The skirmishes were limited to the jostling of photographers trying to get a picture of the Clintons and Obama. Would they stand together and link arms? They would not. Along the way, Obama encountered Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, a civil-rights icon in his mid-eighties, who had battled Bull Connor in Birmingham, survived beatings, bombings and years of slanderous attack. Shuttlesworth had recently had a brain tumor removed, but refused to miss the commemoration. On the bridge, he chatted awhile with Obama. And then Obama, who had read so much about the movement, who had dreamed about it, took off his jacket, rolled up his sleeve, popped a piece of Nicorette gum in his mouth and helped push the wheelchair of Fred Shuttlesworth, across the bridge to the other side.        
	As John Lewis said, it was Obama who was on the other side of the bridge, pushing those in need, followed by a large crowd of people of all races, beliefs, and creeds. Why did Lewis cross the bridge? To get to the other side and find Barack Obama. Lewis found hope and change and what they were really fighting for all these countless years: freedom.

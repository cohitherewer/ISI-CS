	It is encouraging to see the young dancer, Arnab Bandopadhyay, set aside time to explore and experiment with various dance styles. Darpani presented Anandasandhya  an evening of classical dance  as part of its annual celebration at Rabindra Sadan on June 7. Conceived and choreographed by Bandopadhyay, the programme featured a wide array of classical dance forms along with some creative presentations.         
	The evening was divided into three parts, and it commenced with mangalacharan, an invocatory number from the Odissi repertoire. The young students of the institution paid their homage to Lord Ganesha through this item. It was followed by batu nritya in which the sculptures on temple walls were brought to life through lyrical movements and bol parhant. This is a presentation that requires taiyaari and command over basic positions like chauk, tribhangi and hand gestures. Although the participants tried to capture its style earnestly, it was evident that the performance was lacking in precision.         
	The following half was devoted to Bharatnatyam, and began with durgastuti, a composition based on Sri Ramachandra Kripalu. This popular bhajan by Tulsidas was characterized by skilful footwork and neat movement. Bandopadhyay also presented a solo number, an abhinaya or expressional dance, from Jaydevs Geetgovinda. This ashtapadi, haririha mugdha was choreographed by Bandopadhyay himself. The experienced dancers mastery over his craft was evident in this presentation from the Bharatnatyam genre.         
	The second part of the programme paid homage to Tagore, and it featured both group and solo choreographies based on Tagore songs. Dui hate kaler mandira je, Pralay nachon nachle jakhon and a few other songs had been selected for the occasion, and it was a relief to come across compositions that were synchronized and thoroughly enjoyable. Those who were involved in the presentation were spontaneous, enthusiastic and supremely talented.         
	The evening concluded with contemporary dance numbers, though the meaning of contemporary, in this case, was not very clear. Was contemporary supposed to indicate a mixture of the myriad dance styles?         
	The programme began with shishu bholanath, which featured excellent narration by Rajesh Karmakar. Matrishakti, a group choreography based on chandi stotram, was performed in keeping with the mood of the evening. The music, arranged by Surajit Das, was melodious. Soumili Biswas was graceful and expressive in Jao pakhi balo. She brought to the fore the lyrical mood of the song. Utilizing the vast stage space in an effective manner, the male dancers succeeded in capturing the emotional content of the different songs. The equally effective light design for the entire programme was organized by Rakesh Barik.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS                                  Neha Sahay                              
	As the ferry from mainland China to Hong Kong set sail on the South China Sea, a fat woman took out her tiny battery-run fan and started fanning herself. First her neck, then her elbow, then down the length of her arms. Back to her neck, then her face. The ferry is air-conditioned; but the woman fanned herself through most of the 70-minute ride.        
	Leaving the mainland every half an hour, these ferries are the quickest means of transport from some of the southern coastal cities to Hong Kong. Their clientele comprise foreigners living on the mainland who go to Hong Kong to catch a flight home, or just to shop  businessmen from both sides; Hong Kong residents visiting relatives on the mainland; mainlanders on a shopping/sightseeing trip to the city, which is Chinas special administrative region but totally unlike it. A one-way economy class ticket costs 165 yuan (Rs 1,320).        
	It is not difficult to find out whos who on the ferry. The Hong Kongers are more stylishly dressed, carry genuine-looking branded briefcases and generally go off to sleep; the mainlanders carry fake brands, talk loudly on their cell phones and eat hearty breakfasts. One young couple, struggling to fill in their forms at the immigration counter at the Hong Kong ferry port, were obviously mainlanders. On the back of the womans trousers was written, Mr Mouse, with a picture of Mickey Mouse. This, however, was way better than the slogan emblazoned across the bottom of another mainlander: teeny-weeny. Of course, being a mainlander, the slogan fitted her to a T.                
	Lonely place        
	Theres also a marked difference between mainlanders travelling with their kids and Hong Kong residents. The little emperors/empresses from the mainland are fussed over by their parents. And then, you have the mother who deposited her three little sons in one row and went off to sleep in another, oblivious to the trouble the kids were having as the ferry heaved on the choppy waves. Even the ferry attendant looked on with concern as one of the boys retched into the sickness bag he himself had asked for, and cast imploring looks at his sleeping mother.        
	For outsiders, as well as mainlanders, Hong Kong is one hedonistic place  eat, drink and, of course, shop till you drop. Everything is on promotion; stay at a particular hotel, even in a room so small you can barely move, and you get a coupon that entitles you to a discount in half-a-dozen fancy shops and even to a free gift in one of them. Shops remain open till late, even till midnight. If you dont want to sit at a noisy bar, you can pick up a sandwich and a drink from a 7/11, a chain of all-purpose shops spread across the island city.         
	Right now, 7/11 is in the limelight for the wrong reason: a survey has found it pays its employees the least, just HK $20 an hour (Rs 120). The demand from unions is to raise the minimum wage to HK $33. Retailers are against it, naturally, predicting that once implemented, this cost will eventually become too much for consumers.        
	Crossing over to the mainland, you meet another world. Here, waitresses at bars  not only the small bars frequented only by the locals but even the high profile ones on the Bar Street that are patronized by Westerners  must get customers to reserve tables in advance. The reservation has to be through the waitress, which means she must give her mobile number to the customer. In one very popular bar, a waitress must get a minimum of five reservations a month, or forfeit one days leave of the three days shes entitled to. Almost all such jobs are filled by migrant labour from villages, girls who have no one in the city to fall back on.

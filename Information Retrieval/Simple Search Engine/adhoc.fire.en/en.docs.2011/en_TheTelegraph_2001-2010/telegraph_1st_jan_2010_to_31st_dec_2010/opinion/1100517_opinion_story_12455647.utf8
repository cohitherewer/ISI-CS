	In India, millions of human beings are bereft of the basic dignity of life that is their fundamental right. So it is time to feel a bit sceptical when the State takes upon itself the task of improving the lives of animals. Although referred to as the Draft Pet Shop Rules 2010, which is expected to be issued by the end of next month, the new legislation intends to bring in sea changes to the way pets are traded and kept in the country. From making licences and death certificates mandatory for pets to ensuring a healthy habitat for them, the draft takes into account factors that crucially affect the well-being of animals. In a revolutionary move, it even forbids trading in animals that are too young or pregnant or with offspring yet to be weaned. For the first time, the Indian State seems to be taking animal rights with the kind of serious attention it has always deserved but never been given. From sheer indifference, the attitude of the State has changed to one of ardent compassion.        
	However, in their zeal to reform, the framers of the draft seem to have forgotten the ground realities. While it is reasonable to stipulate owners and sellers of pets to provide their animals with creature comforts  proper food, shelter and a friendly environment to grow in  it may be excessive to demand that pets be kept in well-regulated temperatures and away from noise and air pollution. In India, these injunctions can only inspire a form of elitism, making way for up-market pet shops and privileging a certain class of people with the exclusive right to keep pets. In this land of the great unwashed, human beings and animals have coexisted in heat and dust in tolerable harmony. There is also a certain ambiguity in the definition of a pet. Indian streets are littered with cats and dogs that live on the kindness of strangers. These animals, often adopted by entire neighbourhoods, could just as well demand to be seen as communal pets. What happens to their rights then?

	Lust for money                  
	Sir  The actions of Prabhu Shankar Agarwal, the owner of Haldiram, provide the best example of how lust for money can make one reckless in business dealings. Agarwal was doing exceptionally well in his confectionery and bhujia business till one fine morning, when he decided to venture into the construction industry. The political connections, which he had carefully developed all this while, came in handy. Politicians, who are always in search of moneybags to fill their coffers, came readily to his aid.          
	The amount that Agarwal had offered to Satyanarayan Thakur to shift his tea stall, which was blocking the entrance of a building Agarwal wanted to construct, was a pittance considering the property prices in the heart of Burrabazar, where Thakur operated. Agarwal would perhaps have benefited if he had offered Thakur more money to compensate for the latters loss. But what use would Agarwals connections in high places have if he were to give Thakur his due? It was with the confidence of a political backing that Agarwal planned Thakurs murder. Agarwals accomplices too were assured that they would escape unhurt after committing the crime.          
	Thankfully, the court has now punished all the five offenders (Bhujia baron gets life, Jan 30). But what is amusing is that all the convicts arranged for good food and other facilities inside the jail immediately after getting their sentences. It seemed as if they were certain that they would come out of prison soon with the help of their money and connections.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I was very pleased with the judgment pronounced on the millionaire owner of Haldiram, although I feel that the punishment should have been harsher. Prabhu Shankar Agarwal wields tremendous influence and power, as a result of which he had managed to evade the law all these years. The corrupt state government has also had a role to play in Agarwals belated punishment. The businessman is known to have flouted fire safety norms at the Haldiram outlet in Exide junction, resulting in outbreaks of fire on several occasions. It is heartening to know that his influence did not get him out of the net this time.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah 

                
	Sir  P for Prabhu and politics (Feb 1) shows the clear connection between promoters and political parties that help perpetrate criminal activities. Prabhu Shankar Agarwal earned the title of Bhujiawala after he made this product famous across the country in a span of just two decades. With the help of the political class, he managed to remove several obstacles that came in the way of his growing business. But the recent court ruling against Agarwal has convicted him of conspiring to uproot a tea-stall owner, Satyanarayan Thakur, from his plot with the help of hired goons. Thakurs only offence was that he was unwilling to sell his teashop to Agarwal.          
	The mercilessness of promoters in West Bengal has come to light even in earlier cases such as that of the Vedic Village in Rajarhat. The administration is only too pleased to serve the promoters interests. Contractors and businessmen, on their part, sing praises of ministers whenever they can. All political parties should evolve a consensus amongst themselves to keep away from the allure of wealth.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Himanish Biswas, Durgapur

                
	Sir  By refusing the owners of Haldiram the four lakh rupees offered to him as compensation, Satyanarayan Thakur has demolished Ashok Mitras opinion that it is money power that rules (Influencing people, Jan 29).          
	Yours faithfully,

	Right to life          
	Sir  The Rohingyas are an ethnic Muslim group settled in Arakan in Myanmar. According to Rohingya history, from the seventh century onwards, merchants from the Middle East began to settle in Arakan. After the British occupation of Arakan in the 19th century, many Bengalis from East Bengal also started moving into the region.          
	There is a long history of anti-Indian and anti-Muslim sentiments in Myanmar that have led to riots ever since the days of the British raj. The first major clash occurred in 1930 as a result of the irresponsible action of a British firm of stevedores that had brought in Burmese workers to replace the Indians who were on strike. The fear of losing their jobs compelled the Indians to end the strike. After this, when the Burmese workers reported to work the next day, they were told that their services were no longer required. The angry Burmese picked up a fight with the Indians, who retaliated. In a couple of days, violence spread across the country. Subsequent history is replete with such instances of riots.          
	Amnesty International has published reports on the Rohingyas, highlighting the sufferings of these people under Myanmars military junta. Their freedom of movement is severely curtailed and most of them have been denied Myanmar citizenship. They are subjected to extortion, arbitrary taxation, land confiscation, forced labour, eviction, and restrictions on marriage.          
	A year has passed since the AIs initiative, but no positive outcome is discernible still. It is time for other international organizations to come forward to play a meaningful role in the solution of the Rohingyas crisis.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Rajesh Khanna, the Bollywood superstar of yore, was never graced with a Padma Shri or any such award, while a not-so-brilliant actor like Saif Ali Khan has been given this honour this year. One wonders what the panel of judges have in mind while selecting winners.          
	Yours faithfully,

	At some point, every professional writer suffers from the pits of despair. It could be a brutally dismissed synopsis, a rejected manuscript, or an editors call to remove slabs of painfully constructed composition. Or it could be pitiful royalties or simply a writers block for no known reason. These and other humiliations make authors wonder whether they ought to move on to another vocation.        
	If there is any comfort, it is in knowing that all writers have gone through these tribulations and emerged stronger, provided they have been able to survive the lean patch. But what should a writer, who is caught in the middle, do? Take a break from the routine of writing, or move on to another publisher, or give up the ghost?        
	None of these is a viable option. Taking time off doesnt really help because whatever the nature of the problem, it will continue to linger on in the mind until a solution is found. Moving to another publisher doesnt mean that the deficiencies will be overlooked. All it would result in is a re-examination of the manuscript which will lead to further delays. And giving it all up is never easy because any author who has taken to full-time writing has done so because of a feeling that it is a vocation he would like to follow.         
	The basic question that authors have to ask themselves is why the manuscript has been rejected or massive revisions asked for. The simple reason is the market: whether the manuscript in its present form would be acceptable to readers at large. Language, style and subject matter are the basic criteria for acceptance, but these are subordinated to the needs of the market as understood by the publisher.        
	Since the market is the sole criterion for selection, authors need to try and fathom it, spending as much time in assessing its needs as in the writing of the book. Sadly, many authors are so carried away by their work that they feel that theirs is the only work of its kind that fulfils a long-felt need of the market. Publishers who have been playing the game for long have now come to realize that the market, once noted for its long-term predictability, is now impossible to anticipate. How much more difficult then it would be for authors to figure out what the market needs?        
	Authors can make themselves more acceptable if they work closely with publishers. They cannot do it themselves because they have not been out in the field as publishers have because it is their bread and butter line. They may not have the scholarly apparatus of learning, but they know through sheer instinct what moves and what doesnt and could teach a thing or two to writers. Both need each other.

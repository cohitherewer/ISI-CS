                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SWITCHING CHANNELS                          - India should think beyond familiar ways of dealing with China        Diplomacy - K.P. Nayar                          Chinese students in Santiniketan                                              
	To judge the outcome of the Chinese premiers visit to India last week, it is first necessary to choose a running mate. In the short run, the results of Wen Jiabaos three-day visit to India are open to debate. But in the long run, Wen and the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, may have laid the foundations for Sino-Indian engagement of a kind that future generations of Indians and Chinese will thank them for.        
	If there is one item in the joint communiqu issued at the end of Wens visit that trumps everything else, it is this: Both sides recognized the importance of educational exchanges, including promoting wider knowledge of each others languages. Few other shortcomings underline the distortions in Indias school curriculum as dramatically as the absence hitherto of Chinese among the 32 languages at the secondary and senior secondary levels that students can choose from. It would be inconceivable for school students in Ukraine not to be able to choose Russian as a foreign language or for schools in Slovakia not to have facilities to teach German, which is the mother tongue of the neighbouring Austrians and of the Germans just beyond them.        
	After the human resource development minister, Kapil Sibal, met his Chinese counterpart, Yuan Guiren, in Beijing in mid-September, Sibal concluded that it was imperative to give his countrymen an opportunity to learn the language of their big neighbour. Sibals ministry is notorious for making grand announcements and then dragging its feet when it comes to follow-up action, which is left to institutions that are autonomous.        
	But in this instance, the exception deserves to be applauded. Maybe because Wens visit was on the anvil, and it was necessary to follow up on what was agreed between Sibal and his Chinese counterpart, an expert committee was set up in only six weeks to finalize the curriculum and prepare textbooks. Taking everyone by surprise, the Central Board of Secondary Education is to introduce the Chinese language as an option in its school curriculum as early as the next academic year beginning in April, 2011.              
	It was a decision that did not come too soon. At Peking University, the number of students learning Hindi has gone up by 2,000 times between Rajiv Gandhis historic visit to China in 1988 and now. Even granted that their number rose from a low base, India would have been daft not to do the reverse by way of creating a balance. It is a reflection of the inability of Peking University to accommodate a surging demand for learning Hindi that in March, this year, the Indian embassy in Beijing began offering free Hindi classes taught by volunteers. The missions cultural centre offers two courses, one for beginners and another for businessmen. That is not the whole story. This year alone, two universities in China, one in Kunming and another in Guangzhou opened Hindi departments. In all, there are nine institutions of higher learning in China that now offer Hindi as a subject of study.        
	Understatements have always been an essential part of Sino-Indian engagement, and this time it was no different. Wen and Singh announced the creation of the India-China Outstanding College Students Exchange Programme. In reality it is an ambitious, long-term initiative that is comparable to exchanges between the Indian institutes of technology and their American counterparts. If the initiative develops the way its authors hope it will, IIT graduates can hope one day to replicate in China the successes of Indian Americans who now run American companies or have created thriving businesses of their own in the United States of America  and vice versa, as China eventually replaces the US as the worlds biggest economy.        
	Why does the joint communiqu not say so explicitly, in that case? Because, believe it or not, China and India do not even recognize each others degrees and diplomas. When a Chinese leader comes visiting, it is tempting for pundits to harp on seemingly intractable issues like the border dispute and Kashmir because they catch the imagination of TV watchers, newspaper readers and similar masses. In the process, significant progress that is incrementally being made on issues like education, culture and people-to-people exchanges, which actually constitute the core of neighbourhood diplomacy, is easily ignored. As a direct sequel to discussions between Wen and Singh last week, the two sides will now start work on an agreement that will lead to mutual recognition of degrees and diplomas. As India and China record continued economic expansion and grow into big powers, the significance of this cannot be overstated.        
	The Chinese, as many Indians from the generation that followed the great proletarian cultural revolution will recall, are fond of catchphrases. The catchphrase in China these days about India is information deficit. Yet, it is revealing of the nature of Chinese society that when they get information about India, it is often not easily digestible. In a recent programme on a Chinese television channel, where the Indian ambassador, S. Jaishankar was a guest, the anchor was absolutely disbelieving that India would allow a film like Slumdog Millionaire not only to be shot in India, but also to be shown in domestic theatres. It wasnt just politics, the Chinese concept of national shame wouldnt allow such a film to see the light of day, the anchor said.        
	What is being missed in the largely sterile debate among pundits about Kashmir and the border dispute is how changes in China are giving India unprecedented opportunities to influence Chinese opinion and shape the evolution of Sino-Indian relations. During the programme in which Slumdog Millionaire came up as an issue, which divides the way China and India look at common problems such as poverty and under-development, Jaishankar made the most of the opportunity of addressing the Chinese people directly through their medium. He said, for instance, that India does not hide its poverty. The ambassador then shocked the hosts by saying that the book on which Slumdog Millionaire is based was written by his colleague in the Indian foreign service, Vikas Swarup. Of course, in China it would not have been possible for a diplomat to write anything remotely like Q amp;A, the book in question, and still remain in government service.         
	Implicit in Jaishankars answer was a suggestion that China window dresses its society and hides its problems while India is an open society where the warts and all can be seen by anyone. Until a few years ago, it would have been inconceivable for an Indian envoy to be able to use a Chinese platform to put across such views. The change is fascinating. While cartographic diplomacy and signals such as the length of the handshake between Rajiv Gandhi and Deng Xiaoping continue to be important, India must learn to use effectively the new avenues outside the strict bounds of the state machinery in order to influence the course of Sino-Indian relations.              
	Appearing on another Chinese TV programme, Jaishankar made the case that while Indian information technology personnel were in China in large numbers, they were all working almost entirely for Western companies and not for Chinese enterprises. In comments that were reminiscent of the ones made by the environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, during a visit to Beijing some months ago, Jaishankar plainly told the Chinese that there was no level playing field for Indian IT professionals when it came to working for Chinese companies. Chinas former ambassador to India, Cheng Ruisheng, who was also on the programme, blandly denied the charge, but he could not offer anything to substantiate his denial. The host quickly changed the subject, but a point had been made.        
	On a third occasion, Jaishankar took to Chinese TV to make the case that non-availability of medicines was an issue in China and yet the Chinese system was baulking at the idea of importing medicines from India despite the capacity of Indian pharmaceutical firms to meet the Chinese demand. All of this points to the need to give a pause to the old and familiar ways of engaging China, and think out of the box, instead, on how to deal differently with the complex neighbour.

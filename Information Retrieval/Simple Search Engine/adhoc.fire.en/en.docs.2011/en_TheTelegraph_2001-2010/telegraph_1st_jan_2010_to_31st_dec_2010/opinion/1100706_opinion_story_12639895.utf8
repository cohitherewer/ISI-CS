	Recipe for disaster                  
	Sir  The article, How disasters happen (June 28), by S.L. Rao, did not come across as an objective analysis of how responsibility for the Bhopal gas tragedy should be apportioned.          
	The authors charge, The American government is adopting double standards, does not seem reasonable. All companies, including multinationals, are governed by the laws of the country within which they operate. In the context of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, British Petroleum is answerable to the laws in place in the United States of America. The British government cannot interfere much, even though the company is a Britain-based global corporation. Similarly, Union Carbide would be under Indian jurisdiction. Those held responsible can be tried in India only.          
	Moreover, if the chief executive officer of Union Carbide is to be held fully responsible, by the same logic, the railways minister should be held accountable for all rail accidents in India. Years ago, when over a hundred people were killed in a rail accident near Mahbubnagar, the then railways minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was not arrested. His resignation from the post was only accepted after another deadly accident in Tamil Nadu that killed scores of people.          
	Those who were responsible for maintaining the safety standards in the factory must be held guilty for the Bhopal gas tragedy, since they failed to monitor the conditions in the plant. Blaming only Union Carbide and no government bodies is, in fact, a double standard exhibited by the Indian government.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  S.L. Rao rightly concludes his article with the following observation  Our governments, instead of passing on blame or being defensive, must put a remedial framework in place. The nuclear liability bill is the first opportunity for comprehensive legislation and implementation mechanisms that will prevent another Bhopal and its subsequent careless handling. Rao goes on to argue that this must also be extended to various other industries. Disasters like Bhopal can be prevented only if factories are controlled and managed in such a manner that they do not compromise on basic safety and security standards in order to cut costs.          
	Let alone factories, there seem to be no measures in place to avoid stampedes in the temples of India. Every now and then, pilgrims flocking to temples are killed in these horrible stampedes. Every time such incidents happen, they are covered up. Some amount of compensation is offered and an inquiry committee is duly set up. Then the dust settles again, until another accident occurs.          
	It is time Indians stopped blaming others and woke up to the poor safety standards and lack of awareness that prevail in the country.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  S.L. Raos article on the Bhopal gas tragedy made for a thought-provoking read. It is an undeniable fact that the global economic recession of 2008 was largely brought about by the greed of large financial firms. It was exacerbated by poor corporate governance and the ineffectiveness of regulatory authorities. Rao is doubtful whether the Bhopal gas disaster has been a lesson to any of the Indian companies and regulatory bodies in operation today.          
	By all accounts, the devastating accident was largely the result of poor monitoring by officials of Union Carbide. It also reflected the failure of the Central and state governments in India to enforce safety regulations. This failure has been attributed to incompetence and corruption. As a result of this, the welfare of the people was sacrificed. To make matters worse, the incident was hushed up as it had become a source of great embarrassment for the worlds largest democracy. As expected, the Bhopal gas verdict has triggered off a blame game among Indias political parties.          
	One of the main causes behind industrial accidents is negligence in repairing machinery and other equipment. As Rao points out, in most companies, there is constant interaction and interface among the various departments. There are regular reports that recommend possible courses of action, and conferences are frequently held. Therefore, it is quite possible that a number of Union Carbide officials were in the know about the decisions that had been taken pertaining to the gas plant. Rao correctly states that if Indian investigators had studied the company records and reports, people could have been singled out and held accountable for the tragedy.          
	Many now feel that it is futile to create a furore 26 years after the tragedy. Nevertheless, it is being said that Arjun Singh, who was chief minister of Madhya Pradesh at the time of the tragedy, is the only person who knows the secret behind the release of Warren Anderson, the then CEO of Union Carbide. Singh, however, could not have acted alone in this matter. Justice has been delayed and thus denied to the victims of the tragedy. It is time the truth is revealed. The Congress cannot be allowed to bury the incident and continue with its usual blame game.           
	Indias antiquated laws have failed to provide a safety valve for a country where industry is expanding rapidly. With industrial development, the threat of accidents and disasters has also grown. The loopholes in the safety system must be plugged immediately. Rao, thus, correctly suggests that Our regulatory agencies must enforce legislation and rules, and publish new and tougher ones, for manufacturing and storage of poisonous gases and other such matters.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Amaan Ali Khan, the elder son of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, played a memorable alap in the raga, Puria Dhanashri, at a sarod recital organized at the Science City auditorium on February 27 by the Rotary Club of Salt Lake Metropolitan in aid of the Institute of Child Health. The 20-minute alap, rich in tone, packed with long and short glides, and with a happy blend of bass and treble strings, virtually brought the raga back to life. For this raga has been practically done to death through oversimplification by average khayal singers and through deliberate distortion by wayward geniuses. Amaans maintenance of the dominance of the pancham (5th) was exemplary, and so was his use of the phrases m G P, m G d P, G P m P and G d P m P.        
	The jod, characteristically started after a burst of taankari, accelerated smoothly with lapets, larlapets, medium-fast ekhara taans (a few) and bolkari into larant and thhok jhala. There were, however, a few cases of fingernails slipping slightly off-pitch, especially above the high tonic.        
	The gatkari started in dhamar tala and was centred on a tricky composition that ended on the 13th beat, leaving the 14th and first beat (the sam) blank. To further intensify the fun, Amaan deliberately varied the endings of his preliminary movements: landing on the 13th according to the structure of the composition at times and landing on the sam on others. This did not seem to be a problem for Bickram Ghosh who was on the tabla as an accompanist for a change. He returned the compliment in his first break that used heavy phrases in the approved manner and finished pat on the 13th beat.        
	Amaan then went in for taan-toda, larant and layakari full of expertise and rhythmic wit and all this drew fitting responses from Bickram Ghosh. The drut teental gatkari was equally well-played with phrase development, gamak taans and lapet- and bolkari-aided fast movements. The ati drut teental gatkari was at a furious pace. This sort of tested the proficiency and stamina of both Amaan and Bickram and both came out with flying colours.        
	The second half started with aochar and drut jhaptal gatkari in Desh. The drut teental gatkari was based on a composition popularized by Ustad Amjad Ali Khan with snatches of a couple of classic compositions coming in from time to time. Next was an aochar in Kirwani followed by gatkari in 9 matras and finally, the paternal dhun that wends its way to Tagores Ekla cholo re. Both Amaan and Bickram were in full flow in this half, but apparently the sound technician was not: there was feedback and minor echo.

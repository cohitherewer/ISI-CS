	Its inevitable, of course. This hybridism you see in contemporary Indian art, this mix of the West and the East that Studio 21 addresses in its current show, Extend Beyond, on till October 12.        
	Ever since modern art, like other things modern, rode piggyback on European merchant-adventurers and missionaries into India, the West has been our point of reference. And though the break in Indias art tradition  the mainstream tradition that obtained in the courts, that is, not folk and tribal creativity  was indeed caused by the colonial experience, theres no doubt that the decline which had already set in by the late-17th century awaited some external stimuli for a resurgence.        
	So its hardly surprising that the Gandhar paradigm  the Gandhar idiom was also a result of the foreign factor  has continued. But 63 years of democracy have certainly propelled artistic activity in this country to new directions, to create what Homi Bhaba  quoted by Studio 21 in its note  has called the third space of enunciation. And it is this third space that the gallery wants to highlight by presenting five young artists who, having inherited Indias fractured legacy, attempt to extend beyond it.         
	But whether the third space negates the dominance of the colonizer that is, broadly, the Westis yet to be seen. True, the West has increasingly been challenged by the rest. But then, its postmodernism that sanctioned, if not initiated, a great shift in concerns and attitudes. And the theoretical framework of cultural and media studies  which have inspired these young artists  still largely originates there, some of it contributed, ironically, by scholars who come from the rest. Hence, the third space is also about subscribing to new parameters evolving in, but yes, the West.        
	Whatever the inspiration may be for this new zeitgeist, some interesting work has come from the artists. The first is Sumantra Mukherjee, who does a mean distortion of faces, with large-sized numbers sewn onto them as contours of features. If these, at times, seem assailed by angst, the artist can also be playfully toxic. You see this in his depiction of a Spanish couple posing in period attire. They could be newly-weds, for Mukherjee impishly adds strings of tuberose buds, common on the suhaag raat of Indians. But there is the feeling that the work parodies portraiture of couples as a genre. Theres a stiffness in their bearing that may bring Grant Woods American Gothic to mind. But instead of prim Protestant righteousness, what the work underscores through the mans proprietorial rather than protective arm and sideways squint is the gender slots the two occupy. Another, of rock singers, is suitably vigorous with rough strokes and chalky paint, using the colours of the American flag, blue and red.        
	Chinmoy Mukherjee summons Rodins Thinker possibly to focus, in a mock-serious tone, on notions of durability and flux. The artist takes care to give the sculpture the body and the textural quality of stone but allows paint to drip in vertical trails for a weathered look, while a seagull that enters the frame will, it is supposed, perch on the statues head. Thus the ideal man, of athletic body and creative mind, that the sculptor wanted to commemorate  Dante Alighieri, actually  cant conquer finitude; because no ideal can transcend the inevitable processes of time. Elsewhere though, the artist is capable of archly yoking contraries  goddess Lakshmi and a skimpily-clad woman, a scream and feminine lips  the hints remain inscrutable.        
	The third artist, Asish Chakravarty, follows surrealist convention in his rather careful delineation of objects but skews reality by assigning them unlikely roles: a bicycle pump or a giant nail clipper lying on bed, for example (picture). Although the delicate brush and the thin paint have a facile appeal, the works seem to be more of the nature of tongue-in-cheek exercises than an attempt to communicate something deeper.         
	Two of Santanu Mitras paintings merit attention. The Bite, with its bleak landscape, rundown buildings, floating tangles of what looks like entrails and a Magritte window, has a kind of eerie silence. More striking, as much for its chilling brevity as for its casual violence, is a work where spare stains of paint depict a vertical column of heads to suggest a firing line. And what you notice about the last artist, Puspen Roy, is the neat layout and the overlap of textured colours against which the wiry resilience of lean silhouettes leaps to the eye.

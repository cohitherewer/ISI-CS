	There is a conception as old as religion that the most benignant powers in the universe seek to bring good out of evil. It is doubtful whether Mayavati qualifies for the benignant powers list, but her allegedly hush-hush manoeuvrings to change the municipal election law in Uttar Pradesh so that candidates for the civic elections are independent individuals, not from political parties, might actually augur some good. The evil in question, that is, the reason for the UP chief ministers eagerness to strip the forthcoming civic elections of colour, seems to be that she foresees the kind of embarrassment that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) recently faced after the civic polls in West Bengal. The Bahujan Samaj Party is willing to neither face nor make an exhibition of its failure on the local urban level. That has suddenly made it open the door to true democracy at the grassroots. For the voice of the people to be heard, representatives have to be chosen to convey their message. The more authentic the representation of the needs of the people the closer to perfection is the democracy. But the immediacy of representation can be sustained on a practical level when the represented groups are comparatively small, as in municipal wards, or village clusters. So this principle is followed in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh in the elections to their local bodies. It may be almost impossible, certainly very difficult, to accommodate a system of this perfect democracy at all levels in the whole of India. But even if it exists at the lowest one, it would strengthen democracy in small but significant ways through all the tiers of the system.        
	That is, of course, the principle of it. Indias politicians have the unique ability to change gold into dross, hence it will be interesting to watch what comes of Ms Mayavatis efforts. As it is, her opponents are being derisive and enraged in turn; the first because she is obviously baulking at possible defeat, and the second because she has been very furtive about the change to the law, barely complying with regulations, so no one hears about it till it is almost too late to object. It will be even more fascinating to watch whether, as some of Ms Mayavatis opponents claim, buying off the apolitical winners will be easier for the ruling party (than winning the elections?)  but that is all part of the game. By then, of course, evil would be coming out of good.

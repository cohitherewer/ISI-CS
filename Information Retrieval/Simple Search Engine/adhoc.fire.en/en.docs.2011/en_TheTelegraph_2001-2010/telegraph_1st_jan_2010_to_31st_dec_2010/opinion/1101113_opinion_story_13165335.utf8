                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SMALL CHANGE                                  VISUAL ARTS: Soumitra Das                                                  
	Big names in different fields of activity have to pay the price for being famous. This is particularly true of those in showbiz. Artists may not attract the kind of frenzied fan following that film stars do, but many admirers are not just happy with a darshan of their favourite painter or sculptor and their work, particularly if he or she happens to be a celebrity as well. Admirers demand nothing short of a memento, some token by which to remember the artist, just as in the case of an actor, a touch, or better still, a piece of the apparel he has on, are desperately sought after. And the former often obliges by quite literally leaving his mark on a piece of paper, a card or a serviette along with his trademark signature, the cachet that adds distinction to his work, the hallmark for which collectors and investors alike are willing to pay a fortune. M.F. Husain, so long as he lived in India, had to contend with hordes of ardent admirers hunting for memorabilia, and the man, who single-handedly turned the international spotlight on Indian contemporary art, was known to have been rather generous in handing these out. A doodle along with his million-dollar autograph were all that would keep his votaries happy.        
	Jogen Chowdhury is another household name in the pantheon of contemporary Indian art, and he is not known to be disinclined to showering largesse on his devotees. It is not difficult to keep them happy. Drawing is his forte and how much effort does it take for a master of lines such as he to whip up a face, a flower, a phantasm or what he will? Jogen Chowdhurys current exhibition at Ganges Art Gallery titled Drawings, Doodles and Sketches (till November 30) is very close to the category of pictures  small change, really  that he and other celebrity artists like him dole out among admirers.        
	Chowdhury has been cloning such tiny drawings for years now, but it is undeniable that he has a way with lines, fluid, undulating and often intricate like the alpana that once adorned the floors of every hutment in Bengal but was pushed aside by the stylized Santiniketani variety. They remind viewers of flowering creepers that grow in abundance in the wild, although they require a tremendously skilled hand to be executed to perfection.        
	Sometimes he gives free rein to his lines and a maze turns out to be a human face, eyes burning with intensity or a firmament where the moon is encircled by stars. These are preliminary drawings that are later expanded into larger works on canvas or paper, providing valuable insight into their composition.

	Spotless white                  
	Sir  The report, Heros welcome for Gogoi (Sept 11), described how, on his return to Guwahati, Tarun Gogoi was greeted outside the airport with banners labelling him the most efficient and cleanest of Assams chief ministers. This made me recall a scene from the early Eighties. One day, while walking past the deputy commissioners office in Kamrup, I had seen an elderly gentleman in spotless white getting down from a rickshaw. As he paid the fare, I realized with a shock that he was Sarat Chandra Sinha, who had been our chief minister from 1972 to 1978. Perhaps such Gandhians can no longer be found today.          
	Yours faithfully,         Milan Lahiri, Guwahati
        
	Pitfalls          
	Sir  The condition of National Highways 31 and 31D is deplorable. Poor bus services on these highways, added to the incessant rainfall, have made our lives miserable. What is even more depressing is the fact that the government has taken no step to improve the roads. The innumerable meetings between government officials and representatives of the National Highways Authority of India or the Public Works Department seem to have come to naught.          
	In the absence of timely repairs, NH 31, which connects Siliguri with the Dooars, has been reduced to a stretch of craters. Some time ago, a landslip occurred near Mongpong, and then huge parts of the road were eaten away by the Teesta. Both incidents received much attention from local news channels and newspapers. But the PWD thought of acting on the peoples complaints several days after the disasters.          
	Even after the repairs, the state of the road is so poor that whoever travels by bus down NH31 risks his life. Many accidents have occurred on this stretch. Recently, an autorickshaw carrying students turned turtle on the road near Oodlabari, killing one of the children.          
	The indefinite strikes called by political and non-political parties on the road issue seem to have achieved nothing positive. But they have caused much inconvenience to the public, especially since autorickshaws and buses are prevented from plying the road during strikes. I hope that the NHAI and the PWD will take some concrete actions instead of just sending officials on surveys.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Janga Bahadur Sunuwar, Jalpaiguri

                
	Sir  There were several pits of the underground sewage system dotting the surface of the footpaths on N.S.C. Bose Road in Ward Number 100 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The area is notorious for water-logging. In the rainy season, the pits were submerged and many pedestrians met with accidents as a result.          
	At long last, the PWD has started covering the pits. It does not require much money to do these patch-ups but they bring great relief to the public.                     
	Yours faithfully,        N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta

    
	Lost and found          
	Sir  Sometime in July this year, I lost my cellphone in an overcrowded Metro compartment. I duly filed a report of the loss with the Hare Street police station although I had little hopes of getting back my phone. Then, on September 8, I got a call from the detective department (watch section), Lalbazar, asking me whether I had lost a cell phone. On confirming my loss, I was summoned to Lalbazar, where I was given back my phone. I do not have words enough to thank the Calcutta police after this.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Anirudha Mukherjee, Calcutta

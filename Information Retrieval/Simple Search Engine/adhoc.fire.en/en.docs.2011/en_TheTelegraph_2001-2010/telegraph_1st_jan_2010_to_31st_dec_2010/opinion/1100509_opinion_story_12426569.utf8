The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fantasy on an art fair
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FANTASY ON AN ART FAIR                          - A vibrant festival of the future        The Thin Edge: Ruchir Joshi                          Ciutat de les Arts i les Cincies, Valencia                                              
	February 2016              
	Well, Calcuttas second international public art mela, Kolkatart-16, is finally over and we can now look back at the festival to assess the good, the bad, the indifferent and the overall effect. Rather than going into a macro analysis of the festival, let me go into describing works that also highlight different underpinnings (or welcome absence thereof) that helped Calcutta at long last re-enter the select club of cities that lead rather than follow in matters of contemporary art and culture.        
	Bamboo Bridge by Cyrus Antia (India): one of the themes of this years K-Art was that of a homage to the great artists who have challenged notions of gallery-art from the early 20th century onwards and Antias salute was to a couple who re-defined the notion of art and public space, Christo Javacheff (better known simply as Christo) and his wife Jeanne-Claude. Taking off from Christo/Jeanne-Claudes obsession with covering huge public buildings with cloth and other material, Antia decided to take Howrah Bridge back to how it might have looked when it was being made and cover the whole thing with a scaffolding of bamboo. For good measure, he also added a third peak in the middle of the two existing ones, again made of bamboo, but with the bamboos in this section painted gold. In its simplicity and brilliant daring Bamboo Bridge managed to do several things at the same time: it transformed one of the best known structures in the city and made the viewer look at it again; in one visual stroke, the material, bamboo, connected the present to the long history of the citys construction; it invoked the whole tradition of celebratory worship of the various pujos; the fragility and absurdity of the golden bamboo peak in the middle alluded to the function of the bridge and all other grand structures  the desire for wealth and the production of wealth. Despite the many surges towards art and radical politics, this is the dream that has propelled this city through the centuries. To look at Antias temporary bridge overlaying the permanent one, to watch the middle peak sway gently in the breeze, the faux gold vibrating in the evening sun as the bracketing grids stay rock-still, is to go into the very core of art and its transformative qualities.        
	Lesson to note for future: what is equally radical in the production of this work is the enthusiasm and co-operation with which local authorities from the citys PWD and the river administration to the fire brigade all participated; equally crucial was the employment provided and recognition given to the karigars who put up and took down the scaffolding. Kudos to the new people in charge of CMC.        
	Mama, ki-Moma? by Jacobina Bannerjee and Uddalak Mandal (UK/India): in a similar vein, in that the piece was made in relation to an existing building and used local craftsmen (from Krishnagar this time) as partners, Bannerjee and Mandal made large pandal-size models of different modern art museums around the world and put them on the grounds of the KMoMA. Using the cheap welded iron and rudimentary electrics we know so well from Pujo pandals, J amp;U (as they are known internationally) pastiched the structures of the Guggenheim in New York, the Tate Modern in London, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Ciutat de les Arts i les Cincies in Valencia.        
	Ei Teski! (for John Cage) by Shanay Banks (USA): moving away from the static, (or, site-specific works, as the critics would have it), perhaps the best piece of K-Art 16 was an aleatory sound project by Banks, the new star on the American art scene. Helped by assistants, Banks spent the best part of two months taking over the horns of 30,000 Calcutta taxis, and replacing them with tiny, heat-proof, music players. Starting from January 1, the first day of K-Art 16, every time one of the drivers hit his horn his player would play out random samplings of music, Hindi, Tamil, traditional Bangla, Indian and African folk, American rock and jazz. As we know, the effect of this alternative cacophony was diversely magical: some drivers avoided hitting their horns all day to avoid hearing the alien sounds, while others were known to hold up traffic, doing impromptu jugalbandis with the drivers stopped next to them. The after-effect (probably completely unintended by Banks herself) is that the impossible seems to have happened  perhaps temporarily, Calcuttas taxis are now showing a massive reduction in the use of horns. Says one taxi driver: The cascading clash of music-clips made us aware of what we were doing to our own ears, not to mention those of our passengers and others.        
	Lesson 1: this homage to American composer and philosopher John Cage and his principle of chance operations did cost a lot of money and it is to the credit of the Obama administrations newly revised arts policy that the US government footed the huge bill, including the hefty payments to the taxi unions and the drivers themselves. This might be reason for cautious optimism that foreign cultural agencies once again see Calcutta as a place in which to invest not only their money but also what one might call their cultural capital.        
	Lesson 2: the US government is confident enough to support a radical young artist like Banks (whose earlier work on the US involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan was highly critical of both the Bush and Obama administrations) and privilege difficult work over the usual, anodyne, soft-jazz group type of cultural exchange that the Yanks used to love sending out. If they can do it, so should the Indian government be able to support Indian artists travelling and working abroad, regardless of the difficult aesthetic or political content of their work.        
	Loose Interventions for Metro Kolkata by Chacko Mathews Dancegroup, Gunther Schrimpf, Kazuo Watanabe, Ameena Khan, Vinay Gulati and others: this was a mixed bag of tricks but perhaps the most interesting pointer to the future of the Kolkatart mela. Working completely independently, a loose coalition of artists and performers made their way to Calcutta for the month of January with the intention of making public art without an umbrella, that is, without any official sponsorship or funding. Some members of the coalition had been present at the first Kolkatart and decided the time and place to intervene was during the second K-Art.        
	Of these unlicensed artists, Watanabe was perhaps the most successful, his fake bonsai replicas of trees in the Botanical Gardens, beautifully made from sholapith, were left in local trains, trams and the Metro carriages for people to make of them what they would. Some were just picked up, some were trampled, some were, amazingly, left alone, people assuming they were part of the official mela. The German neo-happeningist, Schrimpf, with his anarchic tendencies was perhaps the most disastrous: wearing a suit and pretending to be a manager from Germany, he somehow gained entry into the wholesale food market on the Eastern Bypass and commandeered a truckload of GM Eggplants. Telling staff he was conducting an official experiment, he made them help him as he laid out the entire load of eggplants on the highway outside the warehouse and then shot video as traffic drove over the vegetables. It was only after 15 minutes of this that someone smelled a rat and called the real German managers of the market. Similarly, Vinay Gulatis small tightrope walk between the Chowringhee flyover and the balcony above the entrance of the Indian Museum was interrupted by the police, but it took them some time before they could work through the crowds, set up a ladder and arrest Gulati (and Khan who was documenting the whole action).              
	Lesson: mixed bag or not, one of the indicators of a vibrant, successful Arts festival comprises the ancillary acts that spring up outside the official programme, and in this, Kolkatart 16 once again proved to be extremely promising.

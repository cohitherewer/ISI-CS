	Journey to the holy land:A pilgrims diary By Amir Ahmad Alawi, Oxford, Rs 650        
	The hajj, literally effort, is the largest pilgrimage in the world. Written in the form of a daily diary (roznamcha) by scholar-journalist Amir Ahmad Alawi in 1929, Safar-i Saadat (Propitious Journey) is a firsthand account of a quintessentially Muslim journey. It was first published in Urdu in 1931. Eighty years later came the English translation by Mushirul Hasan and Rakhshanda Jalil. Spread across the sea, desert and mountains, the journey was fraught with danger, which the hajjis trivialized in the knowledge that they would soon enter the House of God and stand before the great granite block enveloped in its black veil.        
	The English version contains a long introduction about hajj during the colonial era and the geo-political environment in Hijaz where the holy cities of Mecca and Medina are located. The Introduction also seeks to examine the place of hajj in Islam while attempting to trace its origins and the customs and rituals associated with it.        
	Far from being a personal account of his travails and triumphs, Alawis diary chronicles and comments on the commingling of people from varied cultures, as well as the social, political and economic conditions of the places he passes through. The diary begins with his departure from his home in Kakori, a small town in Lucknow, to the dockyard in Bombay where the Rehmani S.S. that will take him to Mecca is anchored. Booked into the first class, Alawi describes his cabin as comfortable with electric lights, an electric fan, and a basin with sweet tap water, which is in sharp contrast to the plight of the pilgrims travelling second and third class, who were left wanting for water. He compares the chaotic handling of passengers and baggage at the Bombay docks with the efficiency with which baggage is loaded in Karachi. Alawi complains that the passengers were held hostage for an hour or two in a tin shed with electric fans and subjected to intermittent blasts of hot air.        
	The roznamcha also accounts for the time the Rehmani took to cover the 1,450 miles between Karachi and Aden and the 675 miles from Aden to Jiddah and then on to Mecca. Alawi records Id celebrations in Mecca: The roar of the cannons made my heart race and I sensed the might and glory of Islam... Apart from the occasional headache, hunger pangs and exhaustion from the heat, Alawi had not encountered any serious ailment until a donkey-cart he was travelling by overturned. Alawi was the only one hurt because his foot got caught in the iron spokes. Though not fractured, the pain was excruciating.        
	The journey between Rabigh and Medina was harsh, and took the caravans eight days to cover. But Alawi had a car, which enabled him to cover that distance in a day. Medina is described as the home of plenty, where the air is pleasant, the people warm, and the bazaars well stocked, cheaper than their Meccan counterparts, with foreign goods in abundance. But Alawi was disdainful that the Hijaz government floods the markets with British goods, and that the riyal and the qarsh are minted in London.        
	Not every hajji makes it back because of the extreme hardships. Alawi talks about burials at sea and ashore. He also mentions the significance of the namaz-e-janaza to honour the dead, and how fellow travellers try and ensure that funeral rites are properly conducted in the absence of kin. This book is a candid yet poignant portrayal of one mans journey to the Holy Land.

	Ground of faith                  
	Sir  Swapan Dasgupta says that the proponents of the Ground Zero mosque project have claimed that Cordoba House is aimed at promoting inter-faith understanding (Right and wrong, Aug 20). I cannot help but feel sceptical about this assertion. Inter-faith understanding necessitates mutual respect, but this is rarely the case when associations of religious extremism are involved. Are all host cultures equally hospitable to different religions? Even though slavery and white bigotry were prevalent in the United States of America long back, they are not so today. Slavery was abolished, and tolerance and equality before the law are now the landmarks of American culture. President Barack Obamas election, for instance, is an example of that. Temples and mosques are not uncommon in the US, for the people are free to practise their faiths, unlike in many other parts of the world.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I agree with Swapan Dasgupta when he says that the act of building a religious edifice at a spot overlooking the place of the September 11 attacks would be an imprudent move. If the plan is implemented, it is likely to lead to serious consequences. Religious extremists may misconstrue the move as encouragement to escalate their terrorist activities in various parts of the world, India included. The implementation of the ideal of inter-faith understanding in the face of mounting religious terrorism, though a noble thought, is very likely to backfire at a time like this.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
S.K. Raha, Calcutta

      
	Sir  I disagree with some of the views expressed in Swapan Dasguptas article, for it reflects a tendency to tar all the people professing a particular faith with the same brush. Far from turning into a hub for fundamentalist activities, a religious institution founded on the tenets of Sufism will, in all likelihood, be an object of hatred for the extremists. The recent fidayeen attack in Pakistan upon the shrine of a famous Sufi saint, claiming many innocent lives, bears testimony to the difference between chalk and cheese, although these may appear to be of the same colour to people with the wrong ideas about a particular religion.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Damage control          
	Sir  One fails to understand why, despite being in possession of watertight evidence against Suresh Kalmadi and his financial indiscretions, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, is not taking strict action against him (PM puts Kalmadi on Games leash, Aug 15). He is, instead, promising exemplary punishment. Perhaps the prime minister is waiting for the flurry of activity to die down and for the Commonwealth Games fiasco to blow over, by which time all will be forgotten.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  With the prime minister finally intervening in Commonwealth Games organizing committees mess, and shifting the responsibility to the group of ministers, there is hope yet. However, given the enormity of the task at hand, it is almost impossible to expect the Games to be a success. With every passing day, a new scam is being unearthed and flaws in the preparations are coming to light. The construction sites are in a mess, to say nothing of the spiralling costs. Suresh Kalmadis adamant unwillingness to admit to anything being wrong with the preparations will lead to one of the greatest debacles in the history of Indian sports. The merchandise for the 2012 London Olympics is already available on the market, but with the CWG just around the corner, its merchandise is nowhere to be found. What was supposed to be a measure of Indias economic strength and management capabilities has thus far been an example of the countrys rampant corruption and the administrations lackadaisical attitude.          
	The prime ministers proactive move does help in allaying our fears a little bit. His ordering a weekly update to be presented to the Union cabinet, making Pranab Mukherjee the final arbiter in any dispute, and announcing his inspection of certain venues at the end of August, should urge Games officials to attempt to get things in order. With national pride at stake, everyone is, perhaps irrationally, hoping that the GoM can pull off what can only be called a huge rescue mission.                    
	Yours faithfully,

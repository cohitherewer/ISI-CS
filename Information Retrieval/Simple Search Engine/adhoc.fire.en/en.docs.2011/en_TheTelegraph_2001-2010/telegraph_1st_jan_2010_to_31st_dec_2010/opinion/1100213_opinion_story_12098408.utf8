The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | penalty kick
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PENALTY KICK                                                          
	The battle of Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington famously remarked, was won on the playing fields of Eton. The battle to tame Indian politicians might have to emulate what happens on competitive football fields. Organizers of many major soccer tournaments, several years ago, took the step of penalizing the club or the country if its supporters indulged in hooliganism during, prior to, or after a match. The penalty, more often than not, was a ban with the duration varying according to the scale of the offence and the violence. The Election Commission in India could do well to take a leaf out of such regulations. A series of happenings concerning a variety of issues suggest that drastic action needs to be taken against political parties whose supporters take to violence and destruction whenever they get an opportunity.        
	The latest example of this kind of violence is the one perpetrated by the Shiv Sena in Mumbai and Maharashtra against the film, My Name is Khan, and its principal actor, Shah Rukh Khan. The Shiv Sena has nothing against the film but is angry with the actor because he said that players from Pakistan should not have been excluded from the Indian Premier League teams. The violence is no more than a ploy to refurbish the Shiv Senas chauvinistic image. It is also true that the Congress-led government has avoided any form of confrontation with the thugs and goons of the Shiv Sena. Their orgy of destruction has gone unopposed and unpunished by the state government. It is clear that the state administration has, for reasons best known to itself, been unwilling to take action. Similar unwillingness to take action against agents of violence has been displayed by other state administrations. This is the main reason why the EC should step in to ensure that democratic norms are respected even when political parties are showing protest. Any failure of the political parties to stop their supporters from turning violent should be punished by the banning of the party. This will guarantee peaceful protests and prevent political leaders from making speeches and statements that incite violence.        
	There is always space within any democratic polity for protests of all kinds, even those emanating from the loony fringe of society. In fact, the right to protest is a basic condition of democracy. This condition, however, has one caveat. No show of protest can curb or curtail the democratic rights of others. Everyone in a liberal democracy has the right to swing his arm but that right ends where another persons nose begins. The Shiv Senas protests in Mumbai violate this simple principle. The supporters of the Shiv Sena compound this by indulging in violence. It is time the EC took cognizance of this kind of activity carried out under the protective umbrella of a political party. It need look no further than what is done to football clubs when their supporters go berserk.

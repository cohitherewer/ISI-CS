                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FREEDOM TO EXCEL                          - The new Maharatna policy may make a real difference to PSEs         Bhaskar Dutta                                                          
	A couple of weeks ago, the Central government announced a significant policy change that may have far-reaching consequences for large public sector enterprises. The governments new Maharatna policy promises to give greater autonomy to those PSEs which have three-year track records of annual turnovers of Rs 25,000 crore, a net worth of Rs 1,50,000 crore and a net profit of Rs 5,000 crore. Public enterprises which have already earned the label of Navaratnas and which satisfy these additional norms will now be called Maharatnas. They will be allowed to make investment decisions upto Rs 5,000 crore without government approval, and also be permitted greater flexibility in creating joint ventures and floating overseas subsidiaries.        
	With some exceptions, the public sector in India has turned in a pretty shoddy performance. Much of this can be attributed to political interference as well as undue bureaucratic supervision. After all, there is no reason at all why even very competent government officials who are adept at running the bureaucracy should have even a working knowledge of modern management theory. Add to this the lack of adequate incentives for managers and workers, and one gets some idea of the constraints under which PSEs operate.              
	In addition to the constraints mentioned earlier, often the goal for the public sector specified by the government has not been the maximization of profits but some wider target presumably aimed at improving the overall efficiency or competitiveness of the Indian economy. For instance, the government has recently asked the Steel Authority of India Limited to explain why it has increased the price of one of its products. Presumably, SAILs decision to increase the price was based on market forces  it felt it would be able to sell adequate quantities at the higher price and thus increase profits. The governments query is possibly the prelude to a reversal of the price increase. On the other hand, SAILs competitor, Tisco, will typically not face similar pressures to maintain prices which are lower than what the market can bear.        
	An obvious implication of this is that any evaluation of the public sector must be in terms of some notion of productivity or efficiency  say cost minimization  rather than returns to capital employed since the returns are often intangible. Unfortunately, there is a regrettably large number of PSEs which fail to satisfy any reasonable criterion of efficiency, with Air India being a prime example.        
	Of course, even staunch critics of the public sector  and I count myself amongst this group  have to admit that the constraints mentioned earlier have meant that PSEs have not been given a level playing field. Perhaps, the new initiative by the Central government will help level the field to some extent at least for the Maharatnas. Hopefully, the managers of these enterprises will use their new freedom from government interference to emulate the performance of their counterparts in the private sector. After all, there is no inherent reason why public sector managers should be less capable than those in the private sector. Indeed, PSEs exist in virtually every country, and many of them have established quite creditable performances.        
	Public sector enterprises in India have an advantage that is not enjoyed by similar enterprises in many other countries. They derive this advantage from the fact that their counterparts in the private sector are not particularly efficient either, and so, the PSEs only have to earn relatively low marks to pass. This is particularly true of enterprises in the non-tradables sectors  areas of the economy which are not exposed to competition from abroad. In these sectors, consumers seem to have very little effective choice since both public and private sector companies get away with abysmally low quality products.        
	Consider, for instance, the domestic aviation sector, where a large number of private airlines compete with Air India. My familys recent experiences must be quite representative of other travellers. My wife travelled on an Air India flight from Calcutta to Delhi in late December. The flight took off about an hour late. Long past the take-off time, passengers had no information regarding when the flight would take off  no announcements and, of course, no Air-India staff, although this airline has established a record for overstaffing. Finally, my wife managed to get through to some Air India telephone number. Dont you have an obligation to keep passengers informed about flight delays? she asked. No, was the terse answer from Partha Bhattacharyya, the Air India man who answered the phone.        
	Another time, another flight, pretty much the same experience. This time, we were flying from Calcutta to New Delhi on Indigo. We received an SMS that the flight was delayed by 45 minutes  but only when we were queuing at the check-in counter. An Indigo employee (name tag, Rohit) was hovering busily near the queue; I asked him whether the delay was due to fog in Delhi. Give me a minute, sir, he said with a pleasant smile and walked away. Another delay was announced. I ran into Rohit again. I asked him whether he knew the reason for the delay, and received the same response.              
	So, the names are different  Partha instead of Rohit. While private sector employees are typically less surly than their brethren in the public sector, there is often no essential difference in the quality of service provided by them. This must come as a surprise because everyone expected that the increased competition after liberalization would force Indian companies to offer better service.        
	Why has competition not had much effect in raising quality? Perhaps companies in the private sector do not want to compete in the quality space because an increase in quality does entail a higher cost of production. If one company anticipates that its rivals will also raise their quality if it offers better quality, then the company really does not have much of an incentive to improve the quality of its product. At the end of the day, market shares will be pretty much the same but at higher qualities and higher costs. Perhaps this explains why we are stuck in a low-level equilibrium.        
	But the lack of any significant difference in the quality of service offered by the public and private sector enterprises does not mean that we can afford to ignore inefficiencies in the public sector. If a private sector firm is inefficient and runs up losses, then these losses are borne by its shareholders. However, the burden of public sector losses falls on every citizen, and hence is cause for concern for everyone.

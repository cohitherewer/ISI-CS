	Without tact                  
	Sir  Just because freedom of speech is a fundamental right in India, one cannot always say whatever one pleases. However, the author and activist, Arundhati Roy, seems to believe that she can. She recently claimed that Kashmir has never been an integral part of India (Arundhati strikes a defiant note, Oct 27). Now she is trying to provide explanations for this statement. Comments of this sort will only aggravate the already volatile political situation in Kashmir. Roy should know that many countries, including the United States of America, Pakistan and China, are made up of states and fiefdoms, which are bound together by their constitutions. India, too, has a Constitution with specific provisions for the cohesion of states. Winning a number of awards does not authorize an individual to make comments without considering their repercussions.          
	Yours faithfully,      
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh                    
	Sir  I wonder why politicians and the media are accusing Arundhati Roy of sedition. She has only echoed what people all across the country have been saying and writing for years. Her statement is a call for justice for Kashmiris suffering under the brutal military occupation. These people are living in constant terror everyday. In spite of promises of justice, Omar Abdullahs government does not seem to be taking any concrete action. The rest of us, who proudly say that Kashmir is a part of India, are doing nothing for the rights of the people of Kashmir. We should vociferously campaign for an end to their sufferings, and demand a just society in Kashmir.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Farzana Z. Khan, Nagpur

      
	Sir  Arundhati Roys views on Kashmir are unexpected and unjust. Kashmir, like many princely states and territories, joined the Indian Union at the time of Independence. Roy no longer deserves the honours conferred upon her, and should be tried for her thoughtless comments.          
	Yours faithfully,       
N.R. Ramachandran, Chennai

                
	Splendid speech          
	Sir  It is no wonder that the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Prakash Karat, earned such warm accolades for his speech at the University of Cambridge (Politician to teacher? Bit late in day, jokes Karat, Oct 24). Many Left leaders of India come second to none as far as scholarship is concerned. Karat may not have won over the country with his ideology, but this does not render his vision false. He is aware of the limitations he faces in India. He has set a high standard for debates and speeches at Cambridge. This is something our Union railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, would not have been able to do had she accepted the invitation to speak there.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta              
	Sir In his controversial lecture at the Cambridge University, Prakash Karat candidly admitted the Lefts failures, its tendency to adhere to outdated ideals, and its inability to adapt to a changing global scenario. This was embarrassing for his fellow party members, some of whom had opposed his decision to withdraw support from the United Progressive Alliance government. It remains to be seen whether Karats speech will help the Left Front reverse its bleak prospects in West Bengal and recover from the civic-poll debacle in Kerala. The Lefts discomfort can only get worse with the Supreme Courts rebuke to the West Bengal government for its delay in compensating those affected in the police firings in Nandigram in March 2007. Perhaps Karat did not anticipate the possible negative fallout of his well-intentioned speech.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Rita Bose, Calcutta 

                
	Correction          
	Sir  The report, Centre seeks report on fake IIT amp; teacher (Oct 23), includes the following sentence: A senior IIT official said Ghosh had been removed as aeronautical engineering department head following the allegations. This statement is totally untrue. In fact, I have requested the director to relieve me from the post of Head, Aerospace Engineering, on health grounds. I wish to add that the issue of recognition of the Institution of Electrical Engineering is under investigation in a court of law. It will be incorrect to comment on recognition of the IEE before the court passes judgment on this matter.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Amit Kumar Ghosh, Aerospace Engineering,  IIT, Kharagpur

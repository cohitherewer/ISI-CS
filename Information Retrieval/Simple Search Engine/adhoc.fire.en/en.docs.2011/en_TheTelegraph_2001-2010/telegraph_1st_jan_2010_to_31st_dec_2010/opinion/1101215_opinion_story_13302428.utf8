                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LEGAL FAQS                                  Advocate Nibedita Roye answers your queries                              
	Q: I am a senior citizen. I had purchased a piece of land and given it to someone  on verbal agreement  to be used as a kitchen garden. A few years back, a local club with political patronage evicted him and constructed a semi-pucca club house there. Is there any agency or government unit that will provide me with legal assistance in this regard?        
	Birendranath Poddar, Calcutta                
	A: All courts have a legal cell which provides free legal assistance to persons, including women, children and senior citizens, who do not have any source of income. You could take its help but you should also immediately lodge a complaint with the local police station and send a copy of the complaint to the superintendent of police of the area.              
	Q:My father had purchased a G+2 building  along with a tenant on the ground floor  in my name. Due to my fathers failing health, we need to move him to the ground floor. How can we have the floor vacated quickly? The tenant has defaulted on paying the rent to me as well as to the rent control office.        
	Umed Jain, Calcutta                
	A: Legal proceedings relating to eviction suits are time consuming. Though you could send an eviction notice to the tenant and file a suit for eviction on grounds of default of rent and reasonable requirement of the premises, a more prudent move would be to mutually settle the issue. If the tenant does not agree to that, then you can file an eviction suit. Later, you could also file an application before the high court, seeking a direction upon the civil court to complete the trial within a specified time frame.              
	Q:Three decades ago I had constructed a house. At that time our mother and a widowed sister were dependent on my father. All three of them stayed with me. Now both my parents have expired. My widowed sister, who is now better off than me, is still occupying a portion of the house. How can I have her evicted?        
	Sarit Kumar Kar, Calcutta                
	A: Since your sister has been residing with you for the last 30 years, evicting her will not be easy. She can get a restraining order on you from dispossessing her or disturbing her possession. She could also make an application, seeking alternative accommodation under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.

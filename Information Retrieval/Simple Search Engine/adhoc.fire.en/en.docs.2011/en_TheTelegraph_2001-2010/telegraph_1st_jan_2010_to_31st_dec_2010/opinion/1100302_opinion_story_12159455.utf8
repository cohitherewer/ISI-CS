	Track changes                  
	Sir  The Union railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, ensured that her budget covered a large ground (Magic, Feb 25). The aam admis interests have not been overlooked, as concessions on freights and a freeze on passenger fares show. These are indeed boons in such times of inflation. The budget is also distinctly humanitarian, in that it offers full concession to cancer patients, encourages the recruitment of sportsmen into the railways, and supports the building of hospitals and houses for railway staff. The socialist approach is manifest in the non-privatization of the railways and the order to refrain from forcible acquisition of land to be developed by private owners. The plans to modernize the railways are coupled with the introduction of additional trains on congested routes. However, Banerjee does not seem to have focused very much on the replacement and maintenance of existing tracks. With increasing train accidents, these safety measures should have been dwelt on more pointedly.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Although Mamata Banerjee delivered the railway budget with an eye on the 2011 assembly elections in West Bengal, it would be unfair to ignore her efforts to evenly spread the proposed projects and trains among the different states. Her budget certainly sounded like a gigantic social welfare programme. From issuing free tickets to cancer patients to increasing the size of the workforce by creating one job for every family, Banerjee took a number of bold initiatives. Further, her promise to add 1,000 kilometres of railway track this year, against an annual average of 180 km over the past decade, is also welcome. One only hopes that all these initiatives would be implemented in good time.          
	One would have liked the railways minister to emphasize on the punctuality of trains. The standards of cleanliness and the quality of food served on trains also leave a lot to be desired. Train accidents and robberies also continue unabated. The common man can hardly be expected to be satisfied with low fares, no hike in freight tariff and new trains unless these fundamental drawbacks are first addressed.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The railway budget was extremely populist with lots of promises that must remain unfulfilled. In every budget, the railways minister should make an inventory of promises made in the last budget that were fulfilled in the course of the year. Ideally, there should always be enough trains to minimize the rush of passengers. Can any railways minister ensure that successfully?           
	This year, too, the budget raised many good points, though how far they shall be implemented remains another question. Instead of bestowing all the benefits on select states, backward regions must be given more connections so that they can develop economically.          
	Passenger safety and convenience are a must. Unauthorized passengers travelling without the right tickets or even on the roof of coaches is a common experience. These must be severely dealt with. Strict measures are required to increase cleanliness or to prevent the consumption of alcohol on trains. Tatkal tickets should be available at a shorter notice and without hefty charges. It would also be useful if passengers can be persuaded to book heavy luggage in the baggage van, for which concessions may be offered. Pantry cars must be made compulsory on all trains with overnight journeys. There must be printed menu cards listing the price of food to avoid overpricing. The railways could also consider introducing pick-up services for passengers at major stations.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It was amusing to watch the railway budget being presented by Mamata Banerjee. She announced new projects in every sphere, including health, education, culture and sports, in addition to the innumerable others for the railways. Clearly, she wanted to send out a message to voters in West Bengal than to the users of the Indian Railways.           
	Although she was at her eloquent and aggressive best, she remained intentionally silent on the source of funds needed to implement her dreams.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  Mamata Banerjees railway budget offers a welcome respite to daily commuters when prices of all commodities have shot up except for railway tickets. But one feels worried about the introduction of a series of new trains as timely running of existing trains is bound to be affected by them. During winter, fog may be the culprit behind making trains late but such a pretext holds no water for all other seasons. The people of West Bengal expect a visionary approach from Banerjee as she is considered to be the chief-minister-in-waiting. Her rambling railway budget presents a glimpse into her mindset. Although the railways have witnessed a spate of accidents in the last few months because of derailment or human error, Banerjee did not pay much attention to passenger safety. The authorities must constantly monitor if the inspectors are committed to their duty. The revamping of the Commission of Railway Safety should have been given priority while allocating funds. Safety, security and punctuality, not building schools, hospitals or museums, should be the target of the railways. It is difficult to understand whether the compulsions of coalition politics have given Banerjee a free hand to announce plenty of new projects without identifying the source of her funding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A case of false alarm
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A CASE OF FALSE ALARM                                  Gwynne Dyer                              
	Start with the worst-case scenario. What if there really were a war in the Korean peninsula? Even by local standards, the rhetoric has been heated since the South Korean warship, Cheonan, was sunk in an explosion, killing 46 sailors, and it has been white-hot since independent investigators reported that a North-Korean torpedo had struck the vessel.        
	Everybody is on hair-trigger alert, and the only communication between the two sides is by invective. Suppose there is a local clash somewhere along the demilitarized zone, or at sea along the disputed maritime frontier. Suppose it escalates: such things sometimes do. What would a full-scale war between North and South Korea look like?        
	We are always told that North Korea has the fourth-largest army in the world, that it has heavy artillery within range of the South Korean capital, Seoul, and that it probably has nuclear weapons. So would an inter-Korean war be a calamity? Yes, but mainly for the North. Imagine that Kim Jong-il gives the order, and the North Korean guns open up on Seoul. The million-man army heads south, and the bulk of the obsolete air force takes off to support it. Meanwhile, a shower of short-range ballistic missiles, similar to the old Soviet-made Scuds, lands on air bases and command centres throughout South Korea.        
	What happens next depends on whether or not North Korea is using only conventional weapons. If it is, then the attack fails quite fast. The North Korean air force is easily shot out of the sky, counter-battery fire and air strikes destroy the artillery that is firing at Seoul, the Scud clones miss their targets and the North Korean divisions heading south are shredded by air power. No modern army can survive without air cover. The South Korean and US air forces have around 600 modern military aircraft available in South Korea, and the US can reinforce that number almost without limit in very short order.                
	Empty threat        
	A few hundred thousand North Koreans and a few tens of thousands of South Koreans would die in the fighting, but nothing else of great moment would happen. Its not even likely that there would be a major counter-attack into North Korea. Nobody would want to upset the Chinese by invading North Korea: better to leave the Pyongyang regime to fall of its own weight after being humiliated by defeat.        
	But thats what would happen if the North Koreans used only conventional weapons. Whether or not they have working nuclear weapons, they undoubtedly have chemical and biological weapons in profusion. They, almost certainly, would use them. That would make the bombardment of Seoul an uglier affair, since civilians would have little protection against nerve gas or lethal bacteria, but it wouldnt have much effect on the military outcome. The soldiers on both sides would have adequate protection, and their operations would be equally hampered by the presence of such agents.        
	Nuclear weapons are a different matter, but its far from certain that North Korea has any operational ones. More to the point, for North Korea to use such a weapon would be suicidal. The nuclear retaliation by America would be rapid and overwhelming, and would effectively exterminate the entire regime, together, unfortunately, with a lot of other people.        
	But since the North Koreans must know that, they would never act in a way that would bring that fate upon themselves. So why did the North Koreans act so irrationally in sinking the Cheonan, if indeed they did? Nobody really knows, although they have a reputation of doing such things, big enough to be shocking but not so big as to cause an actual war. Barring an accident, this event will not cause one either.

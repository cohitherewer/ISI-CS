	Blood on the tracks                  
	Sir  The stone attack on the Rajdhani Express exposes the vulnerability of passengers (Stone attack on Rajdhani, Aug 22). However, such incidents are common in local trains. The usual weapons are stone chips and glass shards. The danger zones are the slums lining railway tracks where children practise their shooting skills. Country liquor connoisseurs also vent their frustration on railway coaches. Nets on windows can partly solve the problem. But female passengers could still be vulnerable to acid attacks.          
	Yours faithfully,        Jyoti Prakash Basu, Calcutta
        
	Power pinch          
	Sir  The West Bengal state electricity regulatory commission has raised the power tariffs for areas served by the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company and the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation by an average of 45 paise and 16 paise respectively (Third power hike in a year July 31). The third rate hike in the last one year will come into effect retrospectively from April 1, 2010. The authorities are saying that they have been forced to increase the tariff primarily because of the steep hike in coal prices. This is a common excuse that is extended in every case of price rise, be it that of diesel, petrol or kerosene.          
	There will certainly be some sporadic agitations against the hike. But they will die down soon without affecting the power distribution companies in the least. It is curious that the trade unions of the Left parties  which are otherwise prompt in calling strikes whenever fuel prices go up  remain quiet whenever power tariff goes up. The recovery of the arrears from April 1 in instalments will have a dire impact on the common people. Yet customers have no other option but to accept the hike and still suffer power cuts. I feel that the proper maintenance of power plants, greater vigilance on the use of coal and the sacking of redundant workers can help bring down the cost of production. The consequent relief will be passed on to the consumers.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Whenever we suffer from erratic power supply, we do not hesitate to resort to violence inside electric supply offices, damaging government property and manhandling the concerned officials. Yet we will not allow new power stations to come up. If the ruling government attempts to build a new power plant, the Opposition tries its best to foil the initiative. Opposition leaders do not think twice about impairing the functions of existing power stations as well. Eastern Indias major power-generating agency, the Damodar Valley Corporation, frequently faces crises in its Mejia plant because of the turf war between Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Trinamul Congress. Why should power plants be made to suffer because of political uncertainty?           
	The power ministry has allowed West Bengal in general, and DVC in particular, to be associated with an international event like the Commonwealth Games (Job hunger clouds Games power unit, Aug 18). Yet, even as the Games are knocking on the doors, opposition party leaders are trying to halt the DVC expansion project meant to supply power to the Games by backing those who are demanding jobs. On August 17, 1,500 villagers at the DVCs Mejia Thermal Power Station stopped the laying of pipelines for the second phase. However, timely intervention by the law enforcers brought the situation under control. Perhaps the state administration has learnt the art of managing protesters after Singur and Nandigram.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Q: I am a schoolteacher. Recently, the headmaster and the male teachers in the school have begun harassing me almost every day. Please tell me how I can take legal action against them. I am really feeling insulted and unsafe.        
	Name withheld                
	A: You can complain to the governing body of the school and request them to conduct an enquiry. You should also lodge a complaint with the police, keeping the facts on record for future reference.              
	Q:I got married three years ago. My wife, with the help of her brother-in-law, a police officer, has filed a report at the police station that my parents and I torture her. She has also sent a registered letter under certificate of posting, making the same charges. What can my old parents and I do to protect ourselves from such false allegations and malicious threats?        
	Sagar Chakraborty, via email                
	A: Reply to the letter immediately, denying the allegations levelled against you and your parents. Also, take the help of common friends or relatives to sort out your differences.               
	Q:My father and I jointly own a flat. According to the deed, I am the first holder. I also pay the municipal taxes and maintenance charges for the flat. In the event of my fathers death, can my married sister claim our fathers share of the property? If yes, how can I prevent her from staking a claim?        
	Bapi Bhattacharya, Calcutta                
	A: Yes, your married sister and mother can claim your fathers share after his demise unless your father makes a will appointing you as the sole beneficiary to his 50 per cent share in the property.              
	Q:I bought the roof in a G+4 building in 1990. I have the registered deed of conveyance for it. I have been paying property tax to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). I have also purchased the ground floor and first floor. Do the other flat owners have any right to my roof?

	A: According to the provisions of the KMC Building Rules, 1990, a terrace on the topmost floor shall have common access and shall not be subdivided. But this rule is not applicable to residential buildings upto the height of eight and half metres.

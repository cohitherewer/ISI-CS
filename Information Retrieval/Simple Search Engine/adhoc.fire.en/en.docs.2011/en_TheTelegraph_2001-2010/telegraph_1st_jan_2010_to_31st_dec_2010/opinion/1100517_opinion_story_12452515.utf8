The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | forced rescue
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FORCED RESCUE                                                    
	The European Union has marshalled 750 billion euros to rescue its member  roughly four times the size of Indias exchange reserves, and three-quarters as much as Indias gross domestic product. The EU economy is, of course, much larger, especially if price differences are ignored. But its capacity to meet external crises is not greater, for its foreign exchange reserves are only about 500 billion euros. Most of them are owned by member countries; while it may be able to draw upon them, there would be cries of outrage if it did, especially from Britain, which does not even use the euro, and Germany, which amassed its reserves by virtuous policies. So the EU is betting little money of its own  60 billion euros to be precise  from its budget. Loan guarantees from its members will be 440 billion euros; the rest is a promise of loans from the International Monetary Fund. But whoever the money may belong to, wherever it comes from, its repayment will be guaranteed by the European Commission. It has thus placed its own credit on the auction block for the first time, and acted on its own instead of as a mere chairman of independent governments. That is a bigger change for member governments than for the Commission, as the EU was conceived as a union of independent countries, and whilst it has gone far towards unifying their foreign policies, at least some of its member countries are extremely jealous of their national identities.        
	The financing arrangement was not put in place overnight. The Greek fiscal crisis has been brewing for quite some time. Ever since it began, the EU has been faced with the dilemma  should Greece be rescued, or be allowed to go bankrupt? And it would not have gone quietly bankrupt; before it did that, it would have abandoned the euro and reissued the drachma, which it had before it joined the Union. That would have been the first chink in the euros armour. More important, it would have given a message to the Unions other members that the Union was a fair-weather friend  that if they got into financial trouble, it would leave them to sink in the Mediterranean.        
	That message would not be unwelcome to many Germans. They see their country being called upon to rescue Union members as they go bankrupt one by one; they see their money and credit being wasted, and the cost of their governments borrowings going up because they got into bed with other countries of doubtful virtue. But at least for now, the EU is marriage till death do them part. The death may not be that of the member countries; as Pakistan has demonstrated, a country can survive any degree of failure, for these days, annexing other countries has gone out of fashion. But the Union will die unless it keeps rescuing its feckless members.

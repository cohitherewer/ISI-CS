	OUR KIND OF TRAITOR (Penguin)
  By John le Carr                
	Devoid of the moral ambiguities of le Carrs earlier novels, Our Kind of Traitor leaves one in no doubt about the wickedness of the rich, the powerful and the corrupt.                        
	TO THE END OF THE LAND (Cape) 
  By David Grossman                
	A harrowing meditation on the Israel-Palestine conflict. From the Six-Day War of 1967 to the on- going crisis in the Middle East, the novel traces a journey that is at once haunting and poetic.                        
	THE ELEGANCE OF THE HEDGEHOG (Gallic)
  By Muriel Barbery              
	A philosophical novel about two fiercely solitary human beings. Profoundly uplifting.                        
	FREEDOM (Fourth Estate) 
  By Jonathan Franzen                
	An exploration of the temptations and burdens of too much liberty. Psychology and social analysis provide the edge.                        
	THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD (Bloomsbury)
   By Margaret Atwood              
	The future made real in all its bleakness (set in Year 25, Year of the Flood). Atwoods wicked wit avoids the moralistic or alarmist.        
	IN MY BOOK  
	 quot; Daniyal Mueenuddin rsquo;s In Other Rooms, Other Wonders (Random House) is among the best story collections I rsquo;ve read in a long time. Strikingly direct in their telling, Mueenuddin rsquo;s stories open a window on modern life in rural, feudal Pakistan. Thirty and more years ago, I was lucky enough to work for Harold Evans, then Britain rsquo;s most inspirational newspaper editor, and it was a pleasure to see those years relived in his autobiography, My Paper Chase: True   
	Stories of Vanished Times (Little, Brown). Evans, who was born the son of a Manchester locomotive driver in 1928, shows us an England that has largely disappeared. quot;

	WAY TO GO (Hamish Hamilton) 
  By Upamanyu Chatterjee                
	Makes death come alive in all its absurdity, as the protagonist, Jamun, ponders the meaning of loss.                        
	LUKA AND THE FIRE OF LIFE (Cape)
  By Salman Rushdie                
	Childrens fiction of the highest order and strewn with lines of shocking beauty.                
	THE ELEPHANT'S JOURNEY (Harvill Secker)
   By Jos eacute; Saramago                      
	Enchanting and compassionate, this novel proves, yet again, Saramagos love for humanity.                              
	SERIOUS MEN: A NOVEL (HarperCollins) 
  By Manu Joseph        
	Hits back smartly at high-caste men and women who still seem to hold the reins of modern India. There is much anger, but tempered with affection.         
	SOLAR (Cape) 
  By Ian McEwan
                                
	It is not often that one gets to read about a Nobel laureate in physics who is addicted to all the seven deadly sins, but to fornication and gluttony in particular. Great fun at the expense of political correctness.  
	IN MY BOOK  
	 quot; Carl Sandburg rsquo;s gripping   biography (1954) of Abraham Lincoln was an lsquo;old book rsquo; that I read absorbedly and with astonishment. A great book, easily among the greatest biographies ever. Another work from earlier times that came my way was Benjamin Franklin rsquo;s autobiography, published by the Liberal Arts Press, New York, in 1949. quot;
    Gopalkrishna Gandhi

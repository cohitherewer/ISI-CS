	For the last couple of years, the Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture has been organizing exhibitions curated, apparently by professionals, with various degrees of success. The latest one, Besides Paris (till October 3), is of the works of 19 Indian artists based in Paris, including a painting by Amrita Sher-Gil. The exhibition, edited and curated by Shaheen Merali, makes one wonder how these artists, who live in one of the worlds greatest cultural hotspots, could insulate themselves from its exciting art scene and continue to churn out some of the dreariest works produced anywhere. This is not surprising, for even in the early 20th century, when the Modernist movement was at its height, Indian artists who lived in Europe chose to hark back to the Impressionists and post-Impressionists. Some of these Paris residents have become highly successful in their country of origin and their work fetches astronomical sums. Little wonder that they are virtually unknown in the West, except among auctioneers. Most of them have taken the easy way out by exploiting exotic motifs that appeal to a certain kind of Western sensibility. It remains a mystery why Birla Academy took the trouble of organizing what must be an expensive exhibition when most of the ideas of these artists seem to have progressed little beyond the 1980s.

	Rare glimpse        
	The Asian Art II exhibition at the Ahuja Museum for Arts (till September 30) is part of a series of exhibitions being held between 2009 and 2011, the works selected from the personal art collection of S.D. Ahuja. The exhibition offers a rare glimpse of contemporary paintings from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Bangladesh. While some of the works are truly interesting, others seem to be just representing their respective countries.        
	Most striking perhaps are the paintings by Pham Duc Nghia from Vietnam. Painted in bright colours, the figures convey a melancholy mood through their postures; the scenes exude an unexpected simplicity despite the stiff, often curious, geometric shapes used. Tran Xuan Binh is also from Vietnam, and creates a compelling canvas of female figures in black and white, painted in sharp, uneven strokes. Malaysias Michael Tan infuses scenes of domesticity with an elusive tension. The paintings from Thailand, apart from Kitchen by Siripon Sanjan, fail to make an impression. The Bangladeshi artists are disappointing, with a cloying over-romantic aura.

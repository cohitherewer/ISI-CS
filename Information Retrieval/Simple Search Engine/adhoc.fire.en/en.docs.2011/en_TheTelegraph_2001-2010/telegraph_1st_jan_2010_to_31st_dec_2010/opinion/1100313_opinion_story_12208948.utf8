The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Unfamiliar etchings
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNFAMILIAR ETCHINGS                                  Visual Arts - Soumitra Das                                                  
	Printmaker Yashpal Chandrakar was trained at Kala Bhavan in Santiniketan, and is now based in Delhi where he has established a studio and, by all appearances, enjoys a flourishing career. Gallery Sanskriti held Mark of Masters (February 23-March 2), an exhibition of a portfolio of 60 limited-edition etchings produced by Chandrakar himself, using as their matrix drawings by several well-known artists and printmakers from all over the country.        
	In other words, most of the contributors played a limited role of handing over their artwork to Chandrakar without intervening in the printmaking process, which he did all by himself. Thus, this was actually the handiwork of Chandrakar himself, although the contributing artists are present in the background. As a result, though the executors of the drawings are easily identifiable, in these etchings, they look a little unfamiliar as their unmistakable touch is missing.        
	This is most noticeable in the case of Anupam Sud, as Chandrakars version lacks her intensity and eye for detail. Even the lines do not have Suds power and precision. The same holds for the prints attributed to Lalu Prasad Shaw, who had once created some striking calligraphic images, and Suhas Roy, who had done some brilliant prints long before his Radha materialized. Chandrakars own images are rather soppy, nostalgia being their mainstay in a rather mindless manner. This limitation notwithstanding, Jogen Chowdhurys grimacing face is quite remarkable in its play of robust lines and boldness of execution, reminiscent of the unforgettable linocuts of Sahaj Path. His picture of the Bengali beauty has become standard fare. Lalitha Lajmis touching work, Sanat Kars faces and Laxma Gouds tribal beauty are closer to their originals.         
	Sarbari Roy Chowdhurys drawing of a reclining nude (picture) is worthy of a sculptor of his repute. Madhavi Parekhs face, framed with characteristic folk motifs, is strong as a graphic. Dipak Banerjees Prakriti-Purush has his hallmark tantrik imagery. Arpana Caurs shadow of a nude woman is a simple and stark image, quite unlike some of her highfalutin paintings. Paresh Maitys angular portraits are no different from his recent paintings. Nirmalendu Dass print is the only non-figurative one in this series.        
	The exhibition is accompanied by a two-volume catalogue on this portfolio that carries all the images. Along with them are the photographs of the artists at work. The photographs by Chandrakar are nothing to write home about, and the printing quality is also shoddy. What adds value to the exhibition are the weighty essays on the art of printmaking and its history in India by Nirmalendu Das, who heads the graphic department.

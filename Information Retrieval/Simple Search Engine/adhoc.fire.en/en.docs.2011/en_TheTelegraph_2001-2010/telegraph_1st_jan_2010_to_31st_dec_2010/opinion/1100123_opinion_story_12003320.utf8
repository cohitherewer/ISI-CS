	Out of league                  
	Sir  It is quite ridiculous that none of the Pakistani cricketers found bidders at the Indian Premier League this year. Pakistan has several talented players who are fondly watched by cricket-lovers all over the world. Pakistan and India have been in conflict for years, and sub-continental cricket has had to bear the brunt of it. But this should not have been the case. The attitude of the IPL buyers is disgusting, besides being insulting towards the neighbouring country. It might cause more damage to Indo-Pak relations, which are already deteriorating.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Melting point          
	Sir  The report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change about the Himalayan glaciers is an attempt to mislead the world (Glacier row puts UN panel on back foot, Jan 19). The reports alarmist predictions about these glaciers melting down by 2035 reaffirm the belief in what Michael Crichton, the author of State of Fear, said long ago: global warming makes for an ideal topic of discussion.          
	Many a time, scientific conclusions, such as the one the IPCCs fourth assessment report makes, are based on popular opinion rather than on facts. It is really strange that the casual comments of Syed Hasnain on the matter should make their way into this report. If one scientists view is to be considered sacrosanct, then the need for maintaining a panel to discuss such issues becomes redundant.           
	Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the IPCC, has said that the panel is trying to understand the underlying basis of Hasnains prediction. But it must also examine the authenticity of his sources.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is shocking to learn that a Nobel prize-winning body like the IPCC issued a dire warning concerning glacial meltdown without any verification of the scientific data. But such declarations are not uncommon. In the early 1990s, some countries had alleged that methane, a greenhouse gas, was being emitted by wet paddy fields in India, and that these emissions were as high as 38 million tonnes annually. It was later found that this figure was between two and six million tonnes. Again, in 2000, just before the crucial climate negotiations in the Netherlands, some industrialized countries quoted an unverified report which claimed that soot from chullahs was adding to climate change; they called this phenomenon the Asian Brown Haze.           
	It appears that developed nations are reluctant to sacrifice their luxurious lifestyle and so have ganged up against the less developed countries.          
	Undoubtedly, the problem of global warming is a real one. But an average rise in global temperature does not translate into equal rates of glacial meltdown. To arrive at the correct scientific data, monitoring centres should be set up in every country of the world.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The governments decision to withdraw the deemed university status of 44 institutions across the country should be welcomed (Deemed unfit, Jan 21). These institutions are meant for the rich, where students from poor families have no place. Syllabi are prepared and examinations conducted independently by these colleges. There are several other such institutes whose performance should also be evaluated and if found wanting, their autonomy should be withdrawn.          
	Yours faithfully,

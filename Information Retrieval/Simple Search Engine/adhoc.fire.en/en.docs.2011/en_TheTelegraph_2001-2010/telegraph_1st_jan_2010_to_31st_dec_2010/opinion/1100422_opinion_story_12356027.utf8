	Mob menace                  
	Sir  Calcutta witnessed, yet again, vandalism in one of its private hospitals (Peerless vandalised after accident refusal charge, April 14). The action taken so far by the administration is appalling. The police reached the spot much later, and were not even adequately prepared to control the mob. The chief minister, while expressing concern about these attacks, remarked that there might be certain unknown faces behind these incidents. The administration has formed a committee to investigate the attacks. But the members of this committee, as usual, are bureaucrats who are unlikely to have much experience in conducting such investigations.          
	Incidents of hospitals being ransacked are not new in Calcutta. In each case, some standard procedures are followed that hardly lead to remedy. It is time to unearth the root cause that incites such vandalism. A committee of specialists should be formed to look into the matter. Experts in behavioural sciences, as well as specialists in psychology, criminology and medicine, should be included in the committee. Mob attacks are often the effect of various forms of deprivation: poverty, illiteracy, political disempowerment, lack of proper healthcare. It is a disease that may be difficult to cure.

	Sir  It is a matter of great concern that private hospitals and nursing homes are frequently being vandalized on minor pretexts. However, Peerless Hospital allegedly refused treatment to some critically injured accident victims, which infuriated the mob. The doctors should have immediately treated the patients instead of asking for a monetary deposit. As per government directives, all hospitals must treat emergency patients without first asking for money. Moreover, many believe that doctors in private hospitals extort high fees from hapless patients and often force them to buy costly medicines unnecessarily. The government must ensure that private hospitals and doctors behave fairly and transparently.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The recent incident of mob outrage in Peerless Hospital is condemnable, and reiterates the fact that anarchy rules in West Bengal. The people who destroyed the hospital property had little to gain. According to media reports, they were not even related to the victims who were allegedly refused treatment at the hospital. Therefore, the crowd that attacked the hospital seem to have been made up of opportunistic hoodlums who resort to violence at the slightest provocation. Such attitudes are bound to be fostered in the people of a state that has been ruled for 33 years by a government that never hesitates to use violence to serve its own purpose. Today, having created a monster, the government can no longer control its actions.

	Sir  Yet another incident of vandalizing a private hospital by an irate mob has taken place. For a few days, newspapers and television channels will harp on the apathy shown by private hospitals towards the poor, as also on mob violence. The government, apart from mouthing clichs, is likely to remain inactive as usual. This incident, like many others, will be forgotten very soon, and there will hardly be any talk of the matter until the next incident of mob violence takes place.          
	The media, while highlighting gory details of these incidents, often skims over the role that private hospitals and nursing homes are expected to play in extending healthcare to the underprivileged. Every time a new private hospital is inaugurated, promises are made about free beds for the poor. But little is done to ascertain that the promises become reality. It is not clear what the term, free bed, means in the context of a private hospital or a nursing home. Does it mean that only the bed charges will be waived but the patient would be expected to pay for the diagnosis and treatment? If so, it would be of little help to a poor patient. However, if a free bed implies that the hospital will bear the entire cost of the treatment, perhaps there is a need to examine whether private hospitals or nursing homes are capable of delivering on this promise. Most private hospitals and nursing homes merely provide an infrastructure to visiting doctors. These doctors are not employees of the hospitals and charge patients independently. No hospital administration can ask doctors to treat a patient for free. It is therefore apparent that a private hospital or nursing home has to rely on external agencies to render care and treatment to patients. In these circumstances, is it right to expect of these private hospitals and nursing homes to not only offer their medical infrastructure for free but also pay external agencies from their own coffers for treating a free bed patient? Has the government abdicated its responsibility to provide healthcare to the poor and passed the buck to private hospitals and nursing homes without really bothering to find out whether such a proposition is feasible at all?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Idealistic solutions thought up by people in the higher echelons of power do not always fit the ground realities. The mob fury at Peerless Hospital proves this truth yet again. There have been allegations against Peerless that it has refused to treat accident victims without a monetary deposit. The hospital has contested the allegation by saying it did not demand a deposit, and that four of the victims were already dead when brought to the hospital, while a critically injured child died before the doctors could revive him. Even if one assumes that the victims were still alive, and that they would have survived if given emergency treatment, who would have footed the bill for that? Private hospitals like Peerless provide quality healthcare, but for a price. Why did the government make it compulsory for such hospitals to provide emergency treatment without a deposit? Private sector organizations are meant to make profits, not indulge in philanthropy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A very good man
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A VERY GOOD MAN                                                                  
	Climbing the Limitless Ladder: A Life in Chemistry By C.N.R. Rao, World Scientific Publishing, Rs 840        
	This is a remarkable book written by a remarkable man. It covers an extraordinary period that brilliantly captures the enigma of the rapid evolution of science in India.        
	C.N.R. Rao traces his journey through the difficult terrain of research in chemistry, from the days of virtually no-funding for basic science to the generous funding as provided today. What comes across is Raos passion for chemistry. A Life in Chemistry is a unique book, the autobiography of a top-class scientist who, quite unusually, is still very active at the age of 76.        
	The book is not only absorbing but also entertaining. So many characters, some very eminent ones, surface in the narration; so many events, so many ideas have been presented with ease and dedication. Rao never got involved with the machinery of the government. But he was at the helm of many important committees, which eventually helped the government implement major policies formulated by him and his colleagues.        
	I always want to remain a scientist, essentially a scientist, he said to Indira Gandhi. Rao has pursued science with a degree of perseverance that is rare in todays world, obsessed as it is with consumerism and skin-deep celebrity culture.        
	Yet it is not that Rao does not enjoy the good things of life. In fact, he relishes them. The description of his early life in Bangalore is almost serene, with accounts of elephants and tigers roaming the fringes of that sleepy cantonment. It is amazing how simple but disciplined life was in those days  walking was the commonest mode of travel while in extreme cases, the bullock cart was used.        
	Raos continuous search for what he really enjoys doing is the kernel of the narrative. This difficult journey has taken him from Bangalore to Benaras  Kashidham, as he calls it  from Benaras to Kharagpur, to the United States of America, and eventually to Kanpur, where he became one of the earliest teachers and then a professor of the IIT at a very young age.        
	I know Kanpur IIT as it is now. I can well imagine how it must have been in the early Sixties  hot, dusty, a typical suburban town of Uttar Pradesh. A great deal of devotion mixed with an unusual degree of enthusiasm can get you anywhere. When all the odds are stacked against you, it is very easy to give up. But not only did Rao not give up but he also helped in the setting up of IIT Kanpur.        
	His early call to Oxford must have been tempting  his friendship with the best scientists in the world must have caused great anguish as he was unable to join them. But Rao did not leave behind his beloved country. He persevered, and that has made him a truly outstanding Indian scientist of the world.        
	Raja Ramanna, my guru and Raos friend, once told me, You know, C.N.R. talks like a child, always enthusiastic, but dont get alarmed, he is very, very good and a good man. It is not surprising that both of them enjoyed the good things of life. Although the book is wonderful, it would have been even better if the events in Raos life had blended with one another more smoothly. It must have been written in a hurry in his own words, Who knows? Time may run out  well, I sincerely hope not.        
	For me, it has been a treat working with Rao. I recommend the book to the young and the curious. But the book is also for mature readers who find science fascinating.                          BIKASH SINHA

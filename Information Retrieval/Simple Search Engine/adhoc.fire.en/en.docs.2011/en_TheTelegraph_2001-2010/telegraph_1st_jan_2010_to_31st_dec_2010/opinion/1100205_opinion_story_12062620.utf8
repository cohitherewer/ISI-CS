The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | look back in despair
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LOOK BACK IN DESPAIR                              BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                                    
	The Republic Day Parade and Beating Retreat, two highlights of lsquo;life rsquo; and lsquo;activity rsquo; once a year in January, along the central vista of New Delhi, are over, and we are back to square one. It is time we evolved a blueprint whereby Rajpath and the Hexagon around India Gate become vibrant and energetic public spaces for citizens, who keep this city alive and growing. To bar them from this central lsquo;mall rsquo;, cordoning it off for officialdom, is one way of destroying the soul of New Delhi. Chandni Chowk in Shahjahanabad and Rajpath in Lutyens rsquo; Delhi need to be restored, celebrated and used to showcase the best of India. If elected representatives compel civil servants to perform, that could happen easily.
    
	Independent India has added no value to public spaces despite the fact that Indians are very community conscious, use public spaces to celebrate festivals, which take place throughout the year. Processions have been intrinsic to our cultural traditions. Performers, storytellers, acrobats, singers, all manner of itinerants, have resonated along the lanes and alleyways of our habitats. This is the real India: organic, confident and rooted. The bureaucracy, unfortunately, represents an alien class that has deliberately moved away from what Indians are comfortable with, going into a plastic, unaesthetic middle level that the babu considers to be the symbol of modernity as opposed to tradition. This class of people has imposed norms and processes, which leave us cold. The real strengths of India have been diluted, reducing national pride to a low level.  
	We should put pressure on the powers that be to shift gear and energize one part of the town to set an example and trigger the imagination of other state capitals. Revitalizing towns and cities, conserving and growing our tried and tested traditions, creating domains where people can socialize are critical to making citizens feel anchored, committed and proud as legitimate stakeholders. This is one way of putting pressure on the authorities to serve civil society better, participate in cultural activities and reinforce the ethos that makes the subcontinent one of the most mysterious and happening places on the planet.                 
	Start somewhere        
	Corroded, cumbersome, failed bureaucratic processes have halted good ideas, particularly when the ideas have demanded public-private participation and partnership. Administrators have stalled change in a desperate effort to protect their turf from inclusive intervention. This has forced our vibrant community activities into a moribund mode. Historically valuable public spaces have been degraded to dirty, unkempt spots where unsavoury activities take place and individual safety is in question. We must urgently act in unison to save our legacy and heritage.        
	The green banks and water channels that flank Rajpath must be cleared of security tents and all the muck that comes with such settlements. Washing clothes in the channels must be prohibited. Washrooms should be constructed along the other edge of the lawns immediately for the benefit of walkers, joggers and families that come to picnic. I remember going on picnics to the India Gate lawns as a young girl. We would spend hours there, eating ice cream, playing catch, watching snake-charmers: an open space, under the evening stars, away from the horrors of powercuts.        
	Music and folk performances should be organized along Rajpath and around India Gate. Vendors should be given simple but hygienic stalls to sell street foods and handicraft. If Trafalgar Square in London can host such events every so often, why can we not have them as a regular feature to celebrate our cultural realities? This is the first and simplest suggestion. We must start somewhere and then solicit more ideas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From prison camp to stardom
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FROM PRISON CAMP TO STARDOM                                                                  
	OPEN: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY By Andre Agassi, HarperCollins, Rs 599        
	Andre Agassi says in Open that tennis is a lonely game. But the writing of this autobiography was a team effort. This engaging tome was put together by J.R. Moehringer, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and author of The Tender Bar, a highly acclaimed memoir of a boy growing up fatherless in Long Island, New York. The result is that Open is arguably the most passionately anti-sports book written by a superstar athlete  refreshingly devoid of triumphal homily and star-spangled gratitude. Agassis overriding theme is that the game he mastered was a prison he spent some 30 years trying to escape.        
	His first cell was the backyard court his immigrant father, Mike, built behind the familys ramshackle house in the parched outskirts of Las Vegas. Armenian, raised poor in Iran and employed as a captain at a casino on the Strip, Mike Agassi was determined to groom a champion and realized he had hit the jackpot with the youngest offspring who was blessed with preternatural hand-eye coordination, forcing on him daily sessions of swatting as many as 2,500 balls belched forth by a machine at speeds of up to 110 miles per hour, at angles so acute that the seven-year-old Andre had to swing the instant the ball landed, lest it bounced over his head mastering the trick of hitting on the rise that eventually made him the best returner of his time. The next was a glorified prison camp, operated by Nick Bollettieri, a sun-baked entrepreneur paid thousands of dollars by parents who shipped their children off for months, even years, of incessant drilling, lectures on motivational psychology and nights spent in barrack-like dorms.        
	Locked into a career dictated by others, he found escape off-court in a surrogate family he assembled, in particular the company of two father figures  his physical trainer, Gil Reyes, and his coach, Brad Gilbert. Together they reconstructed Agassis body and his game, and made possible his extraordinary, late-career resurgence, when, at last finding joy in tennis, he briefly eclipsed his archrival, Pete Sampras. The numerology of pelt accumulation favours Sampras, with 14 Grand Slam titles to Agassis 8, and a 20-14 advantage in head-to-head matches. But in his prime, Agassi possessed the more complete game, suited to every surface  clay, grass and hardcourt. He is one of only three men in the open era to capture each of the four Grand Slam titles, compiling in one stretch (1999-2000) a record of 27-1 in successive majors  a ho-hum burst of excellence in the brave new world of Roger Federer, though it was the best streak in 30 years dating back to Rod Lavers full cycle of Grand Slam victories in 1969.        
	There is no sexual boasting in Open, but there are full accounts of Agassis two marriages. His first, to the actress, Brooke Shields, tabloid nectar at the time, lasted all of two years. Soon after his divorce in 1999, Agassi began wooing Steffi Graf, his current wife, another former tennis prodigy, who, Agassi says, loathed the game as much as he did but surpassed him in disciplined, competitive fury.        
	Two bullet-point highlights of Open received tabloid treatment ahead of the books launch. The headline grabber was Agassis use of recreational drug in 1997, the worst year of his career, and the other that the frosted locks he displayed on court were part toupee. Agassi does not easily forgive, and his book is loaded with backhanded compliments for those who have crossed him. I envy Petes dullness, the book says of rival Pete Sampras. I wish I could emulate his spectacular lack of inspiration, and his peculiar lack of need for inspiration. And yet Sampras is one of the more highly regarded opponents in Agassis story.        
	Thanks to a combination of Agassis keen memory and Moehringers narrative skills, Open is skillfully bookended by two tennis matches. It begins with the 2006 US Open, Agassis last tournament with a you-are-there tour of the weary champions psyche. At the end of the match, Agassis mind is forcibly spinning into the past, as if it were a whirling tennis ball as the narrative moves into flashback mode. Cut to childhood. Agassi is seven years old and forced into tennis servitude by his father.... The last scene is a love match between the married tennis stars, who have both retired and now have two children. They are playing for fun on a public court. And Open has to end midway, because this game has two winners.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | No such Rule
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO SUCH RULE                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                                 
	Ive just had a shock. I was reading a newspaper article. A short one, yet its punctuation included 13 long dashes: three on their own, ten in pairs, to enclose five interjections. And who was the writer? Me. (Though dont try to pour further shame on my head by declaring that me there should read I: any pedant will agree, but not anyone who cares about real English.)        
	Still, shame I deserve. The article was this very column four weeks ago. True, todays dislike of dashes is enforced mainly by pedants, or at least school teachers, and the occasional dash is fine. But occasional is the word. I could defend every one of my dashes individually, but as a crowd, no. I used, indeed often use, too many.         
	Dashes have their uses. They mark what in speech would be a pause, as commas or semi-colons do. An interjection between a pair of them is a way to add some relevant comment or explanation: as in He stood up sharply  he was fitter than he looked  and hastened away. And these dashes seem less intrusive than a pair of brackets. Theres a case too for the single dash, usually near the end of a sentence, that marks a pause before some unexpected conclusion: as in hes been writing English for 70 years, he even writes a column about it  yet his punctuation can go off the rails. But use these devices in moderation. And never both in one sentence  I hope Ive never been guilty of that unless you want to leave readers confused  as you will.         
	I trust that that last sentence made my point?         
	As for four dashes, or more, in a sentence, forget it. Some bad Victorian novelists revelled in this excess. And they indeed had 18th-century precedents. But leave it to them, unless you want your readers even more confused. In sum, the broad rule is: use dashes sparingly. Thats not hard. A lone dash can often be replaced by a semi-colon, a pair by a pair of commas. Or you can recast the sentence. Oh, and theres a second rule: until I change my ways, which is unlikely, though I could have put three dashes into this one paragraph if Id chosen, do as I say, not as I do.        
	Theres a further point. Should a dash ever be accompanied by some other punctuation mark? A single dash, no: it replaces any other stop. Take he was young, handsome, rich, but a bore; that comma after rich is pointless. But what about this: she went home  so far as she had a home  but soon grew bored there? If there were no interjection, Id certainly put a comma after the first home. Were it in brackets, as it could be, Id put a comma after the closing bracket: she went home (so far as she had a home), but.... So maybe some double dashes do need a further punctuation mark?         
	Again, my answer is no. The great H.W. Fowler thought otherwise. To him the rule was that, if we removed the two dashes and the interjection itself, we ought still to find the sentence completely and rightly punctuated. That is, hed have written she went home, so far as she had a home  but.... The recent editor of his Modern English Usage agrees, though adding that the issue seldom arises.         
	So say two real experts. Yet what evidence had they? Their rule astonished me into looking at books of the past 200 years. I found in Hardy a pair of dashes both with commas  neither of which, in fact, was needed. But rarely a comma where the rule would demand one. Forsters A Passage to India, for instance, opens Except for the Marabar Caves  and they are twenty miles off  the city of Chandrapore.... Were there no interjection, a comma would be normal after Caves; and in other such instances in the novel strictly necessary. Yet Forster ignored the rule.        
	So did many other writers from Dickens, through Conrad and Galsworthy to our own times. In short, there is no such rule. Let your dashes do their work unaided. And on this point you may respectably do what I do, as well as what I say.                    thewordcage@yahoo.co.uk

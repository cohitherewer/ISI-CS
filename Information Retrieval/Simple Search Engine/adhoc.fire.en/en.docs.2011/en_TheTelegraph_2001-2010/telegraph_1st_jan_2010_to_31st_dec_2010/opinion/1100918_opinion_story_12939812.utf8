The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The sleeper in the deep forest
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE SLEEPER IN THE DEEP FOREST                                  THIS ABOVE ALL: Khushwant Singh                          Grisly fate                                        
	If you had asked me last month what I knew of Sankardeva, I would have pleaded forgiveness for my ignorance. Then Satya Brata Saikia, who I had met in Guwahati many years ago, presented me with a copy of the first publication of his publishing house, Orion Publishers, in Jorhat: Srimanta Sankardeva, Vaishnava Saint of Assam by Bimal Phukan. He was one of the Bhakti saints  such as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Kabir and Guru Nanak  of the 15th century. They taught people that the best approach to divinity was prayer and service to humanity. I quote a few lines. Days at School begins with:                
	Bhavadava dahana gahana vana
  saiyana        
	(Thy palm is like the lotus, Thine
  eyes like lotus petals
  Thou art the consumer of worldly 
  afflictions,
  Thou art the sleeper in deep forest.)
  And ends with a prayer of submission:  
						 Jagadsha magoahara bhava bhoya
  tarana,  
	(Thou art the saviour from the
  earthly grief;
  Thou art the giver of the final 
  beatitude;
  O Lotus-eyed Lord! I worship thee.)                
	Dry humour                
	I got a letter from Kamal Singh, the raja of Dumraon and ex-MP from Bihar, on his reactions to the fact that, while the rest of the country has had the heaviest monsoon in ten years, Bihar had had a drought. It has both sarcasm and humour.        
	Drought is quite a relief actually, if one cares to think. Umbrellas, as never before, have remained unopened (excepting for two or three days), Kachhua chhap [mosquito repellent coil] and Hit [spray] remained unused. Mosquitoes, poor devils, never had a chance. The usual hoards of monsoon bugs and insects, have been practically non-existent. Chhipkilis [wall lizards] are disheartened and sluggish. Nights and mornings are delightfully cool. Sleeping in the verandah, fans are hardly needed. The weather is absolutely glorious. Hence why worry about the failure of the monsoons, defying all predictions made by our Met people?        
	Hoisting our national flag, the Independence Day has been celebrated in gay abandon  the governor of Bihar leading the band with the same aplomb (as always) in the state capital of Patna  the city having been spruced up after days of sweat and grind and lavish preparations. The sumptuous iftar parties and dinner diplomacy remain unflagging and most entertaining to read about. As also the music programmes and dance recitals (with photos, of course) held all over the state. We, rich and poor alike, get a free holiday on the day of a bandh (which happens with frightening frequency) called by our netas at the drop of a hat  what a wonderful relaxation it is for all of us!        
	The netas are, of course, very busy, gearing up for the rapidly approaching Bihar elections and the newspapers display their entertaining antics (depending on ups and downs of politics) as well as the detailed reporting (with photos) of the worthy Mir Jafars, Bibhishans and dalbadloos, criss-crossing the political arena. The voter can now sell their votes to the highest bidder. Hooray and three cheers!        
	What fun! What bliss! Good heavens! So I say, To hell with the drought, who cares?        
	But alas! All this fun and games (and bliss) may be short-lived as the monsoon has, after two months of non-cooperation, suddenly decided to wake up, and it is just possible that it might keep awake till the end of the season.                
	Fishy ending                
	There was a young man from Bengal Who was asked to a fancy-dress ball He said he had a wish
  And dressed as a big fish
  But a cat ate him up in the hall.

	Back to hell                
	The people in hell went on a hunger strike. Their demand was to be given accommodation in heaven or be sent back to earth. Out of fear of more unrest, Dharamraj sent them back to earth. After a while they again went on a hunger strike. Dharamraj asked them, What do you want now?        
	They replied, Send us back to hell.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LOST DECADE                                                     
	A new state is much more than a redrawing of political geography; it is essentially a promise of a better future for its people. Ten years ago, three new states  Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttaranchal  came into being. Each of them has its share of social and economic problems. But only in Jharkhand, the promise of a new beginning has been so completely shattered. Nothing illustrated this more starkly than the declaration during the Foundation Day celebrations in Ranchi that 11.44 lakh more have now joined the states list of people living below the poverty line. Jharkhands plight is particularly shocking because its mineral and other natural resources are among the richest in India. Sadder still, it is their own leaders who have let the poor people of Jharkhand so ruthlessly down. Politicians everywhere in India take to corruption as fish to water. But many of Jharkhands leaders have done little else than drain the states coffers in order to amass personal fortunes. In 10 years, the state has had two chief ministers who are now facing legal action on corruption charges. The states unending political instability made corruption the prime mover of its politics. The result is a great betrayal of the dream that inspired the tribal peoples long struggle for a separate state.        
	The chief minister, Arjun Munda, has now made yet another promise of a new beginning. In his Foundation Day speech, he has set new priorities, which include making Jharkhand a power-surplus state and reaching power to all its 32,615 villages. His immediate goal is to complete irrigation projects in order to tackle the challenge thrown up by the current spell of drought. But then, setting priorities or goals was never a problem with Jharkhands successive chief ministers. The problem was that the governments and the politicians showed no real interest in implementing the goals. A real beginning for the states makeover, therefore, has to start with a change in its political culture. If even a semblance of governance returns to Ranchi, Jharkhand can benefit immensely from the countrys new economic regime. Iron ore is currently the rage for investors, domestic or foreign, and few other states can rival Jharkhands stock of the mineral. New Delhis revised mining policy promises to be the cornerstone of a new agenda for development. But the rulers in Ranchi must first clean up their acts.

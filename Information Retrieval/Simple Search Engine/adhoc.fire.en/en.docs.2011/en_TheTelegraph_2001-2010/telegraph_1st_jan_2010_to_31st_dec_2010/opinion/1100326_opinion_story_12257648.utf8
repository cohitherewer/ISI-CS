	THE ELEGANCE OF   THE HEDGEHOG  By Muriel Barbery,   Gallic, Rs 550  
	One of the protagonists of this marvellous novel, the young girl Paloma, soon to turn 13, describes the hedgehog as an animal with a simple refinement that is fiercely solitary and terribly eloquent. The hedgehog entered literary discourse by way of Isaiah Berlins celebrated essay entitled The Hedgehog and the Fox. Drawing from the statement of the ancient Greek poet, Archilochus  the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing  Berlin divided men of ideas between those who pursued many different things (Tolstoy) and those who knew one Truth (Dostoevsky).  
	This novel, without mentioning either Berlin or Archilochus, is about two very unlikely hedgehogs. One is Paloma, a teenage prodigy daughter of rich parents who wants to commit suicide the day she turns 13 because she finds the world to be meaningless. The other is Rene, a 50-year-old widow who is the concierge of the flat in which Paloma lives in a fashionable part of Paris.        
	Rene is an autodidact and a secret reader with a passion for Tolstoy, philosophy and Japanese films. She wants to hide her learning from outsiders, especially from those who occupy the apartments in her building.        
	The novel is structured in two parts. One part consists of the notebooks of Rene, where she puts down her thoughts on life, on what she reads, and the films she watches. Thus there is a long reflection on Husserl and phenomenology. At another level are the reflections of Paloma on the inanity of life around her  her frivolous sister, her fashionable mother, her politician father and her pretentious teachers in school.        
	The lives of both Rene and Paloma are changed with the death of one of the occupants of the building. The flat that is thus made vacant comes to be occupied by a Japanese gentlemen who is quick to discover Renes secret loves. He befriends Rene and Paloma and brings the two of them together. The solitariness of two extraordinary individuals is broken. In Renees life, there is a hint of happiness  all because of a Japanese gentleman. Paloma decides not to commit suicide. Yet it is not a fairy-tale ending.        
	The novel moves between philosophical meditations and poignant narrative. Muriel Barbery has the rare gift to bring these two distinct genres together. The result is a moving and uplifting novel.

	United stand                  
	Sir  The formation of the first-ever coalition government in Britain after the second world war is a historic occurrence (The centre shifts, May 13). The country has also got its youngest prime minister since 1812. The Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats have come together to form the government for the first time in seven decades. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, has said that this is the beginning of a new era in politics. The leader of the Conservatives, David Cameron, is considered to be a man of the people and seems to have a very down-to-earth image. The challenges before this government are many. First and foremost, it has to manage Britains enormous fiscal deficit. The people will watch the new governments policies on immigration and the AfPak situation with great interest. The austerity drive to reduce fiscal deficit may also reduce employment opportunities, creating discontent among the people. The introduction of a cap on immigration will create resentment among Asians, including Indians and Bangladeshis. The shift of the power centre is likely to bring some unanticipated changes in Britain.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  David Cameron is the youngest prime minister that Britain has had in a while. The credit for getting the Conservatives back in power  and thereby ending 13 consecutive years of Labour rule  should go to him. Little is known about Camerons position on foreign policy. However, it is encouraging to note that he has promised to forge a new special relationship with India, and even support New Delhis bid for a permanent seat in the United Nations security council. Time will tell if he will be able to translate his optimism regarding India into appropriate policy to this countrys advantage.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In course of time, more and more political parties will be floated in the United Kingdom and coalition governments will become the order of the day. Such governments are useful as they take a balanced view of things that are important for a country. As of now, an average Briton is taxed rather heavily, and has to grapple with problems such as falling quality of health services and inflation. Once the present coalition comes to power, these issues will be addressed more effectively. Moreover, the move to deploy forces in Afghanistan, where hundreds of soldiers have died, will also be re-examined since the views of the current king-makers, the Liberal Democrats, are radically different from those of the outgoing Labour government.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The UK elections threw up a fractured mandate with the Tories falling short of the required number of seats to form a government on their own. Though the Conservative Party could have run a minority government or joined hands with smaller parties, it decided to share power with the Liberal Democrats in order to provide the country with a stable government. The Conservatives have graciously given the post of the deputy prime minister to the leader of the Liberal Democrats.          
	In 2004, in India, the United Progressive Alliance required the support of the Left Front to form a government. But the Congress was unwilling to accept the terms laid down by the communists. In the absence of consensus on policy matters, the UPA-Left relations became severely jeopardized and the two ultimately parted ways over the Indo-US nuclear deal.          
	Even though the Conservative Party has basic differences with the Lib Dems, it is aiming to form a coalition government in which all the members will operate on equal terms. This is quite different from India where the larger parties want their allies to approve all their decisions. In spite of the existence of coalition governments in India for long, politics has always been about one-upmanship of the largest party. Hardly has the larger party striven towards accommodating the divergent views of its coalition partners.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Without shelter          
	Sir  A number of passenger sheds, erected by private companies on bus stops along the EM Bypass, have been removed. Consequently, those waiting for buses are left facing the sun or the occasional torrential rains. I would like to request the authorities to take immediate steps to put an end to this inconvenience.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Has Great Britain become littler? Watching David Dimbleby anchor the BBCs television coverage of that countrys general election, I thought it had. Part of this impression was unfair to Britain because it was coloured by the difference in scale between their elections and ours. The British have 650 MPs; given Britains population, that works out to one MP for every hundred thousand people. To achieve a ratio of MPs to people as good as this, wed need to rebuild the Lok Sabha to house thirteen thousand MPs. In many British constituencies, fifteen thousand votes sent a candidate to parliament. Now this, as I said, is a good thing; it makes political representation more intimate and therefore more real, but for the Indian viewer it tends to miniaturize proceedings; the British polls sometimes felt like a dolls house election.        
	Perhaps a better explanation for this impression of littleness is that British politics seems defeated, anonymous and unimportant. Thirty years ago, British parliamentary elections meant something because the political parties and their leaders seemed to stand for world-historical systems and ideas: Margaret Thatchers Tory party represented a resurgent capitalism, laissez-faire policy and monetary economics; Labour under Michael Foot stood for a still-credible socialism, Keynes and a still-comprehensive commitment to a welfare state. The Cold War magnified the shadow cast by Britain as it patrolled the outposts of the Free World in concert with America. Post-imperial Britain was already a small nation off north-western Europe, but its leaders had the knack of making sure it was centre stage and on the winning side in the great historical dramas of its time.              
	Those dramas are done, and while Britain hasnt stopped straining to punch above its weight, the theatrical productions it figures in now get poor reviews. Instead of Thatchers little triumph in the Falklands, we have New Labours disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead of saving socialism or reinstating capitalism or fighting collectivist tyranny, David Cameron and Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown used their campaign debates to parse immigration, spending cuts and electoral reform, looking apprehensively over their shoulders all the while at Europes cautionary tale, a bankrupt Greece.        
	It was very different in the heyday of New Labour. At the end of Tony Blairs first term in office, Britain seemed to have leveraged its special relationship with the worlds sole hyperpower brilliantly: in the wake of 9/11, Britain was dining at a top table for two. If the world was Gotham City and radical Islam was the Joker, Bush was Batman and Blair was either Robin or Bruce Waynes butler.        
	At the same time, the booming property market, the new trading in clever derivatives, helped Britain prosper and consolidated Londons claim to being the place where the world did business. As late as the end of 2006, Britains Sunday Times published a long article explaining how London had eclipsed New York to become the worlds money capital. It ended like this:        
	For as far ahead as anyone can see, the boys and girls in black will go on donning their black suits and stepping into their black taxis as they surf the financial breakers around them. Like them or loathe them, they are the new breed of knowledge merchants who are dreaming up and selling the ideas that will make modern, post-industrial cities rise. They are turning the base grey metal of Londons streets, buildings and skies into the golden gateway to the future.        
	The point is not to underline how grotesque this sounds in the context of an election fought over spending cuts; it is to illustrate the context in which Blair placed Britains bets for the new millenium: he bet the house on the unending American imperium inaugurated by the the end of the Cold War and the permanent prosperity betokened by the bulletproof boom of the Noughties.        
	Certain that Wall Streets new capitalism and the Pentagons unmatched power were going to order the world forever, Blair went to bizarre lengths to stake out Britains claim to being Americas most-preferred coat-tail rider. The low point of this abjection was the time he offered to visit Israel to scout out peace prospects in place of the US secretary of State, Condoleeza Rice, just so that American prestige wasnt dented by failure. The idea of the British prime minister being a proxy for Americas foreign minister didnt appal him because the very real power and influence and prosperity derived from being Americas poodle outweighed any abstract loss of dignity or independence.        
	Besides, there was a way of looking at this relationship that made it intellectually respectable. This was a supranational commonwealth of nations  Britain, America, Canada, New Zealand and Australia  that shared a language, a culture and a myth of origin, so much so that they watched and peopled each others movies, plays and sitcoms and fought each others wars. It was the enthusiasm of the Anglosphere, not the West at large, that cheered on Bushs political and economic imperium in the early years of the century.        
	The non-English speaking West was often pointedly excluded from this Anglo communion: recollect the French in their reviled avatar as Cheese-Eating-Surrender-Monkeys or the many invocations of the special virtue of Anglo-American capitalism designed to disparage the more dirigiste economies of France or Germany. If Churchills History of the English-Speaking Peoples was the Anglospheres ur-text, its contemporary hymns and manifestos were supplied by The Economist and, till recently at least, grown men like Niall Ferguson, Michael Ignatieff and Christopher Hitchens were its go-go girls.        
	Unluckily for Britain, Blairs bets went horribly wrong. Britain endured casualties, defeat and humiliation in Iraq and Afghanistan, wars over which it had no strategic control. The economic meltdown of 2008 made French dirigisme look considerably saner than the casino capitalism the Anglosphere had celebrated. And Obamas election forced Britain to deal with an American president who had no sentimental attachment at all to the idea of an Anglosphere given that his paternal grandfather had, metaphorically, been a colonial coolie in Africa.              
	The idea of an Anglosphere was a conceit that was affordable in the face of the nuisance of Muslim extremism, but one that began to seem self-indulgent in the face of a real challenge to the hegemony of the West, the rise of China. Suddenly Germany and France and their leaders became part of an undifferentiated West as Europe and America circled the wagons against China at Copenhagen in the climate change talks. And so Britain found itself a diminished constituent of a defensive West.        
	There are some lessons for India in Britains predicament. Over the last decade we have seen an Indian tilt towards America. In this time America has tried, with some success, to integrate India into its geopolitical designs: the isolation of Iran, for instance, or the counter-balancing of China.        
	At the recent non-proliferation talks hosted by America, it was President Lula of Brazil who staked out an independent position on Iran in particular and non-proliferation in general, one that was contrary to the Western view of these issues. Brazil played the role that should have come naturally to India, given its history of non-aligned contrariness. Instead India today chooses to lurk in Americas geopolitical shadow; we should remember, from Britains experience, that this is a fickle and temporary shade.        
	Our government endows scholarships and professorships to Oxbridge and the Ivy League, we strain to win honorary membership in an alien club by buying shares in the great institutions of the West. Alien, because its clear to everyone except a tiny, deluded anglophone elite, that Indians are not of the West. Not the most fanciful genealogist is going to unearth pedigrees for our prime ministers that make them eighth cousins of the English queen. To bid, despite this, to be seen as honorary Westerners, is nearly as embarrassing as trying to pass as honorary whites.       mukulkesavanhotmail.com

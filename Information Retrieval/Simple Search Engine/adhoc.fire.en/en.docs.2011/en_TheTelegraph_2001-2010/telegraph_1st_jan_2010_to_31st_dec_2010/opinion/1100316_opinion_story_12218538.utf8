	Increasing costs and abysmal inefficiency usually combine to make healthcare systems in India a very dismal affair. The people of Assam should, therefore, derive some comfort from their governments move to make healthcare a fundamental right. The Assam public health bill, 2010, which the government moved in the state assembly last week, is no magic wand that will set the system right overnight. But its provisions do two important things. They make the people legally entitled to healthcare, and they bind the government to its commitment on this score. The bill makes it legally obligatory for all providers of healthcare  government hospitals as well as private nursing homes  to offer free treatment to emergency patients for the first 24 hours after admission. Patients who cannot afford treatment in private nursing homes can be shifted later to a government hospital. The bill also proposes that every patient will have the right to have his or her medical records of at least two years preceding the last date on which the service was used. And it provides for the setting up of public health boards at the state and district levels in order to monitor the working of the new system.        
	However, the absence of good laws was never the crux of the healthcare fiasco in Assam or elsewhere in the country. The lack of funds is also not the real issue in most cases. The main problem is the governments inability and unwillingness to ensure that its own employees do the work for which they are paid. Hospitals obviously cannot be of any use to patients if doctors do not attend work or if the basic infrastructure is lacking. The bill in Assam has some grey areas. What exactly is a medical emergency, and who will define it? And it cannot do the peoples healthcare right any good if an intimidating government forces private hospitals to go out of business. Getting the bill passed in the state legislature should be the least of the Assam governments worries. The Opposition has little room for doubting the bills good intentions. But the government has so much to do before the people can have a realistic chance of enjoying their new right. In a state that has a dense forest cover and plenty of hilly terrains, reaching the hospitals, where one exists, is often a major challenge for the people. It cannot be a nice feeling for any people to have a right and not be able to use it.

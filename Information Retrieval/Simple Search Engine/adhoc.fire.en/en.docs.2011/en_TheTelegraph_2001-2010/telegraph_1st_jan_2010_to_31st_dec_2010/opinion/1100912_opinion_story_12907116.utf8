	Museum piece                  
	Sir  I do not think Malavika R. Banerjee is right when she says, The sari is alive and well (Six yards of grace and elegance, Sept 9). On the streets of any city in India, one will hardly come across a young girl in a sari nowadays. Only married women still seem to prefer saris. The garment is probably dying out because it is not a functional attire. Patriots and sari lovers may beg to differ with this view, but it is a fact that the younger generation is rejecting the sari, which will perhaps become a museum piece in the near future.          
	Yours faithfully,         Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 
        
	Balance it          
	Sir  The advice of the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Duvvuri Subbarao, to state-owned banks to increase the pay packets of their executives is ridiculous (RBI for bank pay parity, Sept 8 ). If the wages of executives working in public and private sector banks are to be made equal, then the other conditions of employment in the two sectors must also become similar. That way, nationalized banks would end up being privatized. Employees of state-owned banks cannot have it both ways: they cannot enjoy the security of a government job and, at the same time, demand the high wages offered by private banks.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The news that the RBI supports pay parity among the employees of public and private banks surprised me. Duvvuri Subbarao says that the pay packets of private sector bank executives are higher than those of the officers of nationalized banks. Even the State Bank of India chairman earned less than the managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank in 2009-10. Why should there be this disparity in their salaries when the responsibilities of both men are more or less the same? Such a gulf in remunerations may well create frustration among executives of state-owned banks, causing them to seek employment in private banks.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Ajit Kumar Guha, Calcutta

                          
	Freedom song          
	Sir  I agree with Krishnan Srinivasan when he says, Nation states that are supposed to be the protectors and custodians of human rights are often the worst offenders (Freedoms on trial, Sept 8). History has proved the truth of this statement again and again. Socrates was sentenced to death for preaching his sceptical philosophy. Galileo met with bitter opposition when he publicly upheld the heliocentric view, which placed the sun at the centre of the universe. In recent times, Taslima Nasreen has been banished from Bangladesh by fundamentalist groups for writing the novel, Lajja. It is true that freedom comes with a price. But the tendency of a few self-serving groups, and sometimes, of the State, to stifle individual freedom needs to be countered with determination.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Debjani Banerjee, Calcutta 

                          
	Nightmare rides          
	Sir  I feel sad when I see how the Metro Railway is in a shambles today. Something must be seriously wrong if, after running almost flawlessly for 25 years, it suddenly starts deteriorating. Place this degradation alongside the recent accidents and robberies plaguing the Indian Railways, and one can guess who has caused the decline. There is nothing wrong in asking for change but the people of West Bengal must think twice before casting their votes.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Pujarini Banerjee, Calcutta

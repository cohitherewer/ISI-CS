	Prose and the prosaic      
	Beautiful stories from Shakespeare (Hachette, Rs 195) by E. Nesbit has a rather querulous introduction by Naseeruddin Shah. This votary of the immortal cadences of Shakespeare has grave doubts about presenting the stories without the original language. But he reluctantly admits the importance of introducing Shakespeare to more people in whatever form. Although Nesbits collection lacks the elegance of Charles Lambs Tales from Shakespeare, it may be more accessible to contemporary young readers. She tells the stories in simple, lucid prose, occasionally stopping to observe that Helena, from A Midsummer Nights Dream, was very silly or that Romeo was twelve times handsomer than anyone else in the room. This edition also packs in quizzes, information on the Elizabethan Age and a range of funny, interesting facts on the plays. Despite Shahs misgivings, young readers stand in serious danger of liking Shakespeares tales.                                      
	Pyre of Queens: The ReTurn of RAVANA (Puffin, Rs 225) by David Hair is a bloodcurdling tale of ghosts, reincarnation and roasting meat . The sorcerer-king, Ravindra-Raj, plans to burn his seven wives on his pyre, a grisly rite that will give him the powers of Ravana. Centuries later, three ghostbusting teenagers return to the site of the carnage. The forts and deserts of Rajasthan provide a glamourous background to the story, which is the first part of a series. The story shifts between past and present, myth and history. Hair, who has spent a few years in India, is obviously enthralled by what he describes as a rich and intoxicating country. Certain clichs about India which might have been jarring are used with such relish that one cannot help enjoying them.                        
	Cant die for size zero (Rupa, Rs 95) by Vrushali Telang is the saga of one big girl, Joyeeta Naik, and her battle with size. A makeover story with shades of Bridget Jones, you can predict how this is going to end even before the first page is over. Joyeetas metamorphosis entails high-pitched phone conversations and long lists that are evidently meant to be quirky. Other literary features include an extravagant use of onomatopoeia; Joyeeta utters psst and glug glug at regular intervals. This usually means shes going to say something naughty, just between the two of you. The storys chief virtue is that it is short.

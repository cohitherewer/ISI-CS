	It is one thing to ask for democracy and quite another to know what to do with it. In Nepal, democracy has long come to mean unstable and short-lived governments. The resignation of the prime minister, Madhav Kumar Nepal, thus came as no surprise to either the politicians or the people of the country. The Maoists made it a condition for agreeing to the extension of the term of the constituent assembly by a year. Even other parties accepted that there was no hope for an end to the political stalemate with Mr Nepal continuing in office. But Mr Nepals exit has not made it any easier for the parties to choose the next prime minister. The Maoists, who threatened to stall the passage of the annual budget in the constituent assembly unless Mr Nepal quit, are not trusted by other parties. These parties cannot, however, do without the former rebels who form the largest group in the interim parliament. The Maoists have used their strength not to bring stability to Nepals politics but to try and impose their will on governments led by other parties.        
	At the heart of Nepals current crisis is the Maoists lack of commitment to democratic politics. They seem to be using parliamentary politics  and the instability that it has brought about  only to expand their own political space. This has been evident in their persistent refusal to disarm the Young Communist League and to come clean on the issue of the integration of their former militants into the Nepal Army. Even when they work within a democratic system, some communist parties never quite give up a half-partisan approach. It is understandable why other parties in Nepal remain deeply suspicious of the Maoists and their ways. However, the important question in Nepal is not who leads the next government but who can best protect the peace process. Whether a national unity government can take office within the deadline set by the president, Ram Baran Yadav, depends primarily on the Maoists. But their numbers alone do not make them the rightful claimant to the next prime ministers job. They have to convince other parties that their commitment to peace and democracy is beyond doubt. For that to happen, the Maoists have to delink their politics completely from arms. International actors involved in Nepals peace process cannot afford to let the former rebels hijack the fledgling democracy.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      VANISHING THIRST                                                                          
	It is strange how, with the metamorphosis of culture, a community starts to get marginalized and begins to vanish. Daaber jal was once a popular thirst-buster for Bengalis. In elegant Bengali households, the drink would be served to guests as a refreshing appetizer. Daabwallahs were a regular sight at social functions. Not many years back, the daabpatti at the College Street Market was a flourishing bazaar.        
	With Coca-Cola and Pepsi entering the scene, the daabwallahs suffered some losses initially, but still managed to be in business. Old habits die hard. Since a little more than two decades, Bengalis have started filling their fridges with soft drinks on a regular basis, and daaber jal has been shown the door, or rather, the footpath. Soft drinks are more attractive, both in packaging and taste, and they come for almost the same price as daaber jal. But this transformation has to be perceived more as a cultural change  daaber jal is no more a sign of sophistication; the drink is rather a sign of the lack of it now. Perhaps it is the trust for what is old, or just nostalgia, that still keeps daaber jal alive as an occasional treat.        
	With the drink going out of fashion, daabwallahs are also getting harder to find. I visited the College Street Market in search of the daabpatti. No such thing exists there now. The market is being renovated, and vegetable sellers have occupied the place where the daabpatti used to be. Determined to find at least one daabwallah (also yearning for a drink of daaber jal), I approached the College Street four-point crossing, where I found a few of them, hardly three or four.        
	Salahuddin, the daabwallah I bought my daaber jal from, said he has been selling green coconuts all his life. His father and uncle were in the trade too. His uncle used to sell green coconuts in Calcutta during the British raj. Salahuddin helped him in his trade as a child. Then, as a teenager, he started selling daab on his own. He would be invited to rich households during parties to supply daaber jal. Salahuddins eyes shone as he recalled those times.        
	In those days, 100 daabs used to be sold for Rs 4. Look how things have changed. Today, one daab costs Rs 10, he said. Surely, Rs 10 is a high price even by current standards. Why has the price of green coconuts shot up like this? The coconuts come from Basirhat. According to Salahuddin, the coconut trees there are giving fewer fruits by the day; some have even become barren. They have been like this ever since mobile phone towers were erected near the trees, Salahuddin sulked.        
	His explanation seemed too close to fiction. Can mobile phone towers harm coconut trees? Or maybe they can, in a way. Perhaps not by their radiation, as Salahuddin suggested, but by the times they have brought with them. A time when a daabwallah like Salahuddin does not know for how many more years he will find buyers for his daaber jal. Or what he will do for a living when he doesnt, since all his life he has only sold daab on the streets of Calcutta.

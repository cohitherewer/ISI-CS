	There is nothing celebratory in the reams of newspapers or on television screens that enter the privacy of our homes. Rape, molestation, protection of erring civil servants, corruption of politicians, blackmail, fasts-unto-death, untenable excuses and explanation for immoral acts indulged in by those who make the laws they break, and the abuse of the mechanisms that ensure civil society overwhelm the citizens of India.        
	A small democratic kingdom, tucked away in the Himalaya, isolated from the ravages of greed, has instituted the mantra of Gross National Happiness as its development barometer. This is an idea that we, in our large and unruly subcontinent, need to adopt. In India, most people in positions of power, across all professions, tend to pooh-pooh innovations that deviate from established methodologies, most of which have failed miserably. In Bhutan, the priorities are clear and carefully mandated. The importance given to culture, education, health, environment and clean, democratic governance is salutary. It is interesting to see and experience how a monarchy has transited to a democratic framework and evolved a working constitution. The king actively sought the intervention of people across his kingdom before finalizing its tenets and formalizing the document. India reacts to this by saying that this country is far too large and over-populated for such experiments in growth and governance. This is the typical, cynical response to any new idea or demand for fresh processes.                
	Make it happen        
	Rajiv Gandhi had understood the need for grassroot governance and put a huge premium on panchayati raj. The babus and politicians realized quickly that their ruthless, often illegitimate, hold on all economic and social activity would be diluted substantially with the devolution of power and resources to the base. They ensured that new processes to empower the panchayats effectively were actively stalled so that there was no transition of power out of their centralized domain. That space now stands hopelessly corrupt.        
	Maybe the Congress needs to celebrate Rajiv Gandhi and reconsider the parameters within which the panchayats function today. It should restructure the system by giving more power to the panchayats and putting in place checks and balances in the form of regular audit to make them accountable. The symbol of the party is the right hand. Four fingers and a thumb: culture, education, health, environment and transparent governance  all of which, if properly and honestly managed and executed, could deliver the Gross National Happiness.        
	Start small at the panchayat level. Define culture, which embodies a wide range of elements intrinsic to life and living, from faith to building techniques, living styles, dress patterns and eating habits. Create new building norms based on traditional styles and the skills of the particular community; identify the craft of the area and showcase it in the haats and larger markets; encourage school-going children to wear the local form of dress as uniform to reinforce a sense of pride; make it mandatory to have a small community museum and a sacred grove in every panchayat area that allow the young and old to remain connected with their cultural ethos; regional languages, dialects, myths and legends should be part of the extra-curricular activities in schools; local cures should be part of the healthcare; all this and more. A collective orchestration of the community, making it responsible for itself, supported by the panchayat.        
	Rural employment based on traditional expertise will grow, and so will pride. Hitherto neglected Indians, ignored by a bureaucracy built on an alien, Western model, will begin to feel empowered. Their dignity, lost in the folds of bad governance, will become a reality.

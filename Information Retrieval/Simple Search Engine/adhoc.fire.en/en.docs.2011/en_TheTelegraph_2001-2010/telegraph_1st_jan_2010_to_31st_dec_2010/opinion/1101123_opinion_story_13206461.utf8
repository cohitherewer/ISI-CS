The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | freedom from the red tape
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FREEDOM FROM THE RED TAPE                                  MALAFIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Why do the Congress Party and the reigning government get proactive and start communicating with democratic India only when they have their backs against the wall, with a gun pointing at them? Manmohan Singh, Kapil Sibal and others could have engaged with the people over the past ten months and answered the many doubts and queries as they have done effectively over the last couple of days. Why do Indian leaders and institutions have this overriding arrogance about sharing information with the public? This closed-door governance presumes corruption and malpractice.        
	By remaining disengaged from the people, a government with a set of competent, intelligent and well-informed members in its council of ministers has only gone on to prove that its leadership is old, tired, and completely out of sync with a changed, energetic and youthful India, brimming with aspirations. Sadly, those who rule us in India are rather different from the men and women in other parts of the world who constantly interact with their constituents on political, economic and social issues in an effort to win support and explain the finer points of policies that affect all citizens. Our elected leaders, on the contrary, tend to behave worse than feudal potentates of yore.        
	On a smaller scale, similar engagement is essential to ensure clean and transparent coalition politics. It is unacceptable for a government to constantly succumb to political blackmail and to use the excuse of running a coalition in order to absolve itself of the guilt of condoning corruption. Such politics is detrimental to the growth trajectory of an emerging power. Dishonest practices are also going to discourage international investment. Alongside this shameful truth is the abject failure of a clean delivery of goods and services that has resulted in huge societal upheaval.                
	Poisoned nexus        
	To administer a radical correction, an unwavering political will is required. The soul of India has been polluted by the political and administrative classes. The privileged men and women belonging to the latter operated within the walls of a steel-frame bureaucracy, a tight and closed club, that curried favour, nurtured favouritism, condoned zero accountability, celebrated greed and corruption and brought our extraordinary civilization to its knees. Will this breed of exploiters be able to turn themselves inside out?        
	The 2G scam, the Commonwealth Games scam, the Satyam scam, the Vedanta scam, and all the numerous projects where rules have been broken with complete abandon, have attracted the worst kind of public abuse. India seems to have moved on and away from its recent past when it condoned and unhappily accepted the all-pervading corruption that bettered the lives and families of politicians and administrators. Today India is sickened. India has had its fill of coalition adjustments based on corruption, exploitation and all the amoral horrors that have been inflicted on its body politic. The country desperately needs a leader to begin the corruption bailout.        
	We have crossed over into a new era where the demand for a clean-up is going to become louder and more aggressive. The politician who sees and feels that particular, and hitherto silent, truth will triumph over those who are comfortable in the status quo as they wallow blindly in self-aggrandizement and therefore fail to read the writing on the wall.        
	The Indian babu and his organization, rules and norms are worse than those of the colonial masters. The nexus between the babu and the elected representatives of India has to be broken. We need azaadi from them and their red tape.

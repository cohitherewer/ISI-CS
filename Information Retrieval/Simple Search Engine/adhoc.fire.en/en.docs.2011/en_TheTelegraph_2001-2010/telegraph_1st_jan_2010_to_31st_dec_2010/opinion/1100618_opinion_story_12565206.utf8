	Written forever: the best of civil lines 
  Edited by Rukun Advani, Viking and Ravi Dayal, Rs 499        
	The story about how Civil Lines began in the mid-1990s is certainly one of the best pieces in Written For Ever: The Best of Civil Lines. If Rukun Advani, the editor of Civil Lines, is to be believed, the journal was planned over scotch in a bungalow in old Delhi. Advani is a delightful raconteur and takes us into the living room of the formidably well-read Dharma Kumar, where she, Advani and Mukul Kesavan work on a journal to showcase new writing as Indias answer to Granta and The New Yorker.        
	However, what has not been documented is why the sixth edition never saw the light of day, the fifth having been published in 2002. In Advanis essay, he has cited reasons as varied as globalization, email, and the demise of Kumar as causes. All this, in many ways, coincided with the end of a small world that Advani calls unusually vibrant and intellectually alive. That is the world Civil Lines showcased to its readers.        
	Written For Ever must have been harder to compile than the five editions of Civil Lines that were published. The introductory essay to each edition has been added to this collection, and these help in giving every edition of the journal a context. All these essays are by Advani, and they provide some of the best moments in the book. He is unapologetic about the fact that such compilations are necessarily subjective and do not have an underlying, unifying theme. It is also interesting to see that with each passing edition, the boundaries are stretching as to what qualifies as Indian writing.        
	The best essays are from the first edition, and that is understandable, because the writers were all established names. It features Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, Ramachandra Guha, I. Allan Sealy and Khushwant Singh. All the pieces in the first edition are based in India, and while Advani would scoff at any search for underlying themes, all the pieces are about changing times in India between Independence and the 1990s. The standout piece in this collection is Mehrotras Partial Recall, which is about his childhood in Bhilai and Allahabad.        
	By the second edition, the diaspora experience begins to make its presence felt. Pieces by Susan Visvanathan, Sunita Thakur and Manjula Padmanabhan are about the Indian experience abroad. Amitav Ghoshs translation of Kshudhita Pashan also features in Volume 2.        
	Civil Lines 3 kicks off in style with OK TATA by Dilip Simeon. It follows the travels of a cleaner, who has leftist leanings and is seen through the eyes of a truck driver. Sheila Dhar, Amit Chaudhuri, Ruchir Joshi and Suketu Mehta all feature in editions 4 and 5. The fifth edition is represented by only three pieces, while the first has six. Whether this is proof of the waning quality or lack of space remains unclear because all three pieces from Civil Lines 5  by Chaudhuri, Mehta and Amitava Kumar  are excellent.        
	Today, when Indian writing fills endless shelves in bookstores across Indian cities, Civil Lines does not exist anymore. There are new publishers hungrily looking around for new writers, and just about everybody who can write is published. There is chick-lit, mom-lit, student-lit and recently, one read about MBA-lit  coming-of-age tales set in business schools and engineering institutes. Whether these attempts at writing would have curried favour with the feisty Kumar and her friends is open to conjecture, but Indian writing in English is more prolific than ever before while Civil Lines lies in indefinite coma.        
	Chaudhuri, Joshi and Mehta possibly represent the last of the writers who can be considered from Advanis generation, and it is significant that two of them are part of the last edition of this enterprise. The editor might not have been ready for the boom in the publishing market where a new writer is born every week. The introductory essays show how Civil Lines was limited to an inner circle, where Advani, Kumar and Kesavan fanned out and wrote off to the writerly people we know, asking them to send us anything fresh they happened to be writing. This should give us a hint about not only the wonderful writing that comprises this anthology, but also why it is not published anymore. Indian writing itself has now fanned out, beyond the environs of Civil Lines, Delhi, or the colleges that are barely 10 minutes away from it. This perhaps makes such a compilation both impossible and irrelevant today. Indian writing in English has outgrown the charmed world of Civil Lines.                          MALAVIKA R.

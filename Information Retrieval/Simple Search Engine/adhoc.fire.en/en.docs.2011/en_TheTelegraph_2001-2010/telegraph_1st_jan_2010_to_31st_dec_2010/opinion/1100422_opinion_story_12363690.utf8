The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The many winding ways to closure
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE MANY WINDING WAYS TO CLOSURE                                  FORGIVE AND FORGET      Can people be recompensed by an apology from a once-hostile nation?                          Katyn, 1943                                        
	Saying sorry can be a great leveller at times. The need to apologize is essentially a personal one, and indicates a feeling of some sort of remorse on the part of one who wishes to apologize. But how do the dynamics of the relationship between the one who apologizes and the one who receives the apology change when a head of State is expected to ask forgiveness of the people of another State on behalf of his government?        
	The crime for which the apology is extended may or may not have been committed during the tenure of the present leader. This was precisely the case when the prime minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, was asked, in 2010, to apologize to the Poles for the Katyn forest killings that took place in 1940. Although Putin expressed deep anguish for the victims of the massacre and their families, he stopped short of offering an official apology.        
	An apology is considered a valid tool for resolving a crisis and bringing amicability in the relations between nations, according to international law. The United Nations International Law Commissions Draft Articles of 2001 on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts are categorical about the occasions when a formal apology from a head of State is desirable. Article 37 of the Draft Articles states that a nation, which has breached international protocol and caused harm to another country, must provide satisfaction to the latter regarding its regret. This satisfaction could be in form of a statement of apology. The question of issuing an apology does not arise if the loss of the injured nation can be monetarily compensated for. Or unless the erring nation is unable to restore to the aggrieved nation the conditions that existed before the wrong was committed. Only then is an apology called for.        
	But the law is ludicrously silent when it comes to the role and the reaction of the so-called injured nation. It is taken for granted that if the people of this country are apologized to (as a last resort on part of the law-breaking State), order will be restored. The possibility of an apology being rejected is not considered, or even conceived of. It also means, effectively, that the offending nation can wash its hands of obligations towards the people of an injured nation once the former has apologized for its mistakes.        
	It is vital to note that States usually issue apologies to people. Alison Dundes Renteln, in Apologies: A Cross-Cultural Analysis, makes a comparison between Japan and America to show how the act of apologizing is culture-specific. For the Japanese, begging forgiveness is part of their behavioural code, and as such, it is expected of anyone who is considered to have given any offence, however slight. But for the Americans, it implies owning responsibility for an act that they, more often than not, wish to shrug off. This is why American lawyers usually advise their clients to refrain from saying sorry when involved, say, in a car accident, as it can be considered an admission of guilt.        
	State apologies remain not only impersonal, but also obliterate the memories of the millions of individual hurts that the people of the injured nation have suffered. In an attempt to seek closure for some heinous crime, the international law expects the aggrieved not only to gracefully forgive, but also to forget.

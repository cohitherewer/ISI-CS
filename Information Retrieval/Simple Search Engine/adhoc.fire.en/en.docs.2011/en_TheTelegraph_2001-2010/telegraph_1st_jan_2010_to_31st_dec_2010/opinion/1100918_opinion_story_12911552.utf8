The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Rich carpet of emotions
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RICH CARPET OF EMOTIONS                                  DANCE: Kathakali Jana                                                  
	It has to be said of Srinwanti Chakraborty, the art director of Srijati dance troupe, that she has considerable talent in composing dances. She successfully devised a vocabulary of her own in the pieces created by her, recently presented as Ahan 2010 at Kalakunj. She displayed a remarkable personal vision in her effort to present Odissi the way she has learnt it from her teachers  the late Kelucharan Mohapatra among them  and in her resourceful improvisation.         
	Srinwantis playful exploration of female bonding in the piece titled Khel, in which women engage in fun and games all by themselves, was compelling. Barsaat, an attempt to capture the moods of monsoon fear, relief, excitement, and longing for the beloved all woven into a rich carpet of emotions  showed her facility with the idiom of her form as well as her innovative ease.         
	In the item, Mudra, she used Odissis expressive eye and hand movements to create a rich visual narrative. However, the piece would have gained from a more consistent performance from some of the younger members of her troupe who seemed to be in various levels of (un)preparedness.        
	In Cadence, however, Srinwanti was able to rise above this shortcoming. Presenting a more mature ensemble of dancers in this section, she set out to experiment with her form. The musical accompaniment to this piece was dynamic, with the dancers themselves chanting their bols live and clashing cymbals. Their vigorous footwork allowed their ankle bells too to make music for them. Live vocals demonstrating mnemonic syllables, graduating to the Gayatri mantra and eventually a prayer from the Upanishad, took the piece to a pleasing crescendo.         
	Srinwanti is obviously a dancer-choreographer of spontaneity who would go a long way if she steered clear of certain clichs such as ending nearly every item with a statuesque freeze. Equally uncalled for was her choice of a fusion version of the famed Ram bhajan, Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, for one of her items titled Ramdhun.         
	And finally, a word of caution for Srinwanti. While it is understandable that Ahan 2010 was an annual showing of the efforts of her institute, Srijati, and required her to present all the students, there was little to recommend in the first part of the show. The little dancers were clearly not ready for what they had to do and pleased only their doting parents who largely comprised the audience.

	Puritanism is bad for the arts. Puritanism endorsed by the State is worse. Puritanism endorsed by the State and trying to pass itself off as aesthetic concern is the worst. The Nandan theatre has begun to embody the bleakness of Calcuttas art-cinema prospects, and the West Bengal governments role as patron of this situation. The situation becomes a little grimmer when a new film, which has already been through the national censors, has to clear another, one-man, censor board before it is shown at Nandan. This man is Nandans director and CEO, Nilanjan Chatterjee, who has decided to watch Kaushik Gangulys Aarekti Premer Galpo very carefully before allowing it to be screened in the institution that he heads. His explanations are confused, swinging between the moralistic and the aesthetic. This film is centred around a pair of men who are attracted to other men, so Mr Chatterjee must look out for whether the films treatment of sexuality is fit for screening at Nandan. But his concern also seems to be about the general quality of the film. The vagueness of the Nandan directors criteria could either be woolly thinking or a kind of hypocrisy that tries to pass homophobia off as something finer.        
	Both tendencies are disastrous for the arts not only cinema, but all of them. And the airing of these tendencies is damaging  for Mr Chatterjees reputation among intelligent people, for the social and cultural life of the city, and for the public image of the state government as guardian of culture. What is most outrageous is how it all seems to depend on the taste and opinions of one person, and the impunity with which he exercises this authority. A national censor board sitting in judgment over what adult Indians may be allowed to watch is irritating enough. But a one-man filter that is partly ideological and partly moral is obnoxious and regressive. It bodes ill for a city that has already allowed its cultural standards to become notoriously parochial.

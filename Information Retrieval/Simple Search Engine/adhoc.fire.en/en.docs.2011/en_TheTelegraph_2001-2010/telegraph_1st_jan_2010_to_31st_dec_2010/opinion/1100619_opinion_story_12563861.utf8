	Ugly practice                  
	Sir  Female foeticide is a common occurrence in Tamil Nadu. Consequently, the men in that state often find it difficult to get brides for themselves, and cross-border marriages are the only option (Foeticide zone taps Kerala for brides, May 31). Indias declining sex ratio is a matter of grave concern. Although female foeticide is a punishable offence, it is widely practised as Indian society looks upon the girl child as a burden. Female foeticide can be checked if pre-natal sex determination tests are stopped. Such a step will put an end to the ugly practice.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Cup of joy          
	Sir  The editorial, In praise of a goal (June 12), is right in saying that apart from the Olympics, the greatest sporting extravaganza in the world is the football world cup. For a whole month, people across the globe  the rich and the poor, religious fundamentalists and secularists, scholars and the unlettered  remain glued to the television to watch the intriguing battle between strikers and defenders.          
	There is no denying that football is uniquely democratic among team sports. In football, it does not matter whether one is a lanky African or a large Dutchman, or whether one is black, white or brown. The world cup  one of the most riveting and colourful sporting events  is now being held in South Africa. It is a special moment because the competition is being held in a country that is riddled with contradictions.          
	Soccer lovers will have to wait till July 11 to greet the team who wins the tournament. It is indeed this embedded egalitarian spirit that accounts for the global popularity of football. After all, a goal is celebrated as boisterously in the alleys of Calcutta as in every other part of the world.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  On behalf of the citizens of Bondel Road, I would like to draw attention to the fact that power supply has become a cause of concern during the world cup. On June 12, there was a power cut in our locality from the afternoon. As a result, the residents of the locality missed the match that was slotted for the evening. A similar thing happened the next day. After returning from school the other day, I found that there was no power at home.This situation is becoming absolutely unbearable, especially during the world cup.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The future of West Bengal will be decided by the voters who will cast their votes in 2011.But do these voters really know what is best for them and for the state? Antipathy towards the ruling dispensation has made a large number of people support the largest Opposition party in the state. Some are of the opinion that an anti-incumbency factor is at work, and it is likely to bring about a mammoth transformation in West Bengals politics.          
	What is evident is that the people want a new alternative after three decades of inaction, stagnation, corruption and violence. They are convinced that things cannot get any worse than what they are at present. Though the people of West Bengal seem to be riding the wave of change, it is equally true that they are caught in two minds. The present rulers have very little to offer and the future rests with a one-woman party. Will her party be able to realize the peoples dreams and take Bengal to new heights?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	If it is October, it must be time for another political crisis to hit Karnataka. The steady corrosion of ideals by greed may not be unique to this state, but the unusual virulence of dissident politics is. Since its formation a little over two years ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Karnataka has been repeatedly compromised by bitter factionalism that has adopted the drive against corruption as its leitmotif to hide baser political instincts. The avowed reason why 19 members of the legislative assembly in the state have withdrawn support to the B.S. Yeddyurappa government, reducing it to a minority in the House, is to oppose its sheltering of corrupt ministers and its hand in dubious land deals. But the genesis of the crisis perhaps lies in the personality clashes and conflict of interests between the party bigwigs that surfaced a year ago when the Reddy brothers from Bellary challenged the authority of Mr Yeddyurappa to head the government. As then  October last year  the high-handedness of the chief minister has been blamed for the crisis. If Mr Yeddyurappa had rubbed the states powerful mining lobby and the partys benefactors the wrong way in 2009, this time he may be said to have repeated his mistake by dropping, in the course of a cabinet reshuffle, most of the independents who had proved to be kingmakers. Together with other disgruntled members of the legislative assembly, the men have hit back at Mr Yeddyurappa for his not-so-innocent game of using a routine procedure to settle scores with his rivals in the party. Quite naturally, the Opposition parties  Congress and Janata Dal (United)  have been busy fishing in the troubled waters.        
	To say that this political game is proving to be dangerous to the concerns of governance is to state the obvious. Karnataka is groaning under the weight of corruption, the magnitude of which was exposed when the lokayukta, N. Santosh Hegde, tried to resign in exasperation a few months ago. The present land scandal and the controversy over the Reddy brothers  in which perpetrators and beneficiaries of corrupt dealings were shown to be the ministers themselves  prove that the situation in Karnataka is desperate. Given the unholy dependence of political parties on the financial clout of the corrupt, it is not difficult to predict that no matter who wins next week, when Mr Yeddyurappa is supposed to prove his majority, it will not be political propriety.

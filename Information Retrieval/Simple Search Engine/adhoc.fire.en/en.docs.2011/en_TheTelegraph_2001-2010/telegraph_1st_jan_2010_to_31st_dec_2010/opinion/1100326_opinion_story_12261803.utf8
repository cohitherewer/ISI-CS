                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HAWK-EYED                                                    
	The term, special relationship, was used at one time to describe the ties between the United States of America and Great Britain. The same words can be used, after the signing of the Indo-US nuclear deal, to describe Indias relationship with the worlds strongest power. Both countries had their own reasons to forge this relationship after overcoming many years of suspicion, if not hostility. In the great ideological divide that ensued after the onset of the Cold War, India  not without justification  was seen by US policy-makers as being too close to the Soviet Union, despite protestations of non-alignment. On the Indian side, the US was seen as pro-Pakistan and also as a supporter of military regimes in Pakistan and elsewhere. But neither country could completely ignore the importance of the other. The attitude of cautious recognition of mutual interests changed to overt recognition in the 1990s after the collapse of communism and the emergence of China as a global economic and political power. The threat of Islamic fundamentalism and the war against terror brought the US and India closer than they had ever been before. But the problem of Pakistan refused to go away.        
	It surprised nobody that the Pakistan establishment  military and civil  was dismayed by the new cosiness between India and the US. One of the driving forces of Indias policy has been to make the US realize that India is a more stable and reliable partner for the US, not only in South Asia but also in the whole of Asia. But the US, for obvious reasons, cannot abandon Pakistan. The latter would also like to have more support from the US in every arena  from more financial aid to more military hardware. New Delhi would naturally like to see less of such aid going towards Islamabad. India and Pakistan are thus contending claimants for the USs attention  India on the basis of the new special relationship, Pakistan on the basis of old ties. The already fraught relationship between India and Pakistan has now an added element of tension. This has acquired some urgency because of the visit to Washington of Pakistans army chief, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, with a wishlist. It is not unreasonable to expect that Pakistan will want to further its own interests and may even try to lobby for a nuclear deal or for the USs involvement in hydro-electricity projects. India cannot be paranoid, but it cannot afford to ignore what is going on between Pakistan and the US.

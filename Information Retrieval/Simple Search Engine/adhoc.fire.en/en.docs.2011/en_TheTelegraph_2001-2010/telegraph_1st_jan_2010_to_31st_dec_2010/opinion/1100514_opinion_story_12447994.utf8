	Words that stood the test of time      
	THE IMAGINARY INSTITUTION OF INDIA: POLITICS AND IDEAS By Sudipta Kaviraj, Permanent Black, Rs 695                
	Sudipta Kaviraj is not an easy writer to read. But those who take the trouble to read him with the attention he deserves will always find themselves enriched with ideas and insights. He is difficult to read because he deals with complex ideas and because he is a self-conscious stylist who is in love with words. All these years, his many essays on contemporary Indian politics and society have been scattered across many journals. This volume brings most of the essays together for the first time. These essays broadly fall into two themes. One is the history of political ideas. And the other is the establishment of certain political institutions. Kaviraj argues that there exists a distinction between the two meanings of the term India  cultural and political. India has a venerable cultural past, but the construction of a political India is more recent and it was enabled by the development of modern techniques of state formation. It is remarkable how these essays, written over a long period of time, have stood the test of time. Even Kavirajs use of Marxism in the early essays does not seem out of date.              
	Paradoxes and anecdotes              
	CHURCHILLS EMPIRE: THE WORLD THAT MADE HIM AND THE WORLD HE MADE By Richard Toye, Macmillan, 14.50                
	Among the many things that Winston Churchill was passionate about, the British Empire would probably top the list. He refused to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire. From the time he came out to India as a young soldier to his last days he remained involved with Britains imperial destiny. Yet, at the beginning of his political career, as Toye points out in this delightfully written book, Churchill, as a young minister in the Colonial Office, was seen by his political opponents as a danger to the Empire. There were other paradoxes that Toye teases out. Churchill was a believer in the intrinsic superiority of the Anglo-Saxons and their civilization but he also believed that the subjects of the Empire should receive humane treatment. Britains civilizing mission, according to Churchill, should be tempered with large doses of feudal paternalism. Toye places Churchill in his context and times and evaluates his position on imperial issues. The book is also rich in anecdotes.              
	Old book, new cover            
	THE SWADESHI MOVEMENT IN BENGAL: 1903-1908 By Sumit Sarkar, Permanent Black, Rs 695        
	This book is a long-awaited new edition of a book that was first published in 1973 and had been hailed immediately as a major work. Within a few years, the first and only edition had become a collectors item as the publisher, Peoples Publishing House (the publication wing of the Communist Party of India), for reasons best known to itself, had not reprinted it. This new edition keeps the original text intact but adds a new preface by the author and tow comments by Dipesh Chakrabarty and Neeladri Bhattacharya. Sarkar offered in this book an analytical narrative of the swadeshi movement in all its dimensions. Permanent Black deserves thanks for reprinting this path-breaking work.

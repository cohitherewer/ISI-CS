The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A lurch towards reform
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A LURCH TOWARDS REFORM                          - There is no sign that the governments conviction has changed					 					      Writing on the Wall      Ashok V.

	The government raised prices of petrol, diesel oil, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas on Friday night. The choice of Friday was explicable. Most offices would be closed for the next two days, and the predictable demonstrations by opposition parties would not cause too much inconvenience to the public. And the stock market too would be closed, and investors would get the weekend to absorb the news. Not that they would react negatively. The rise in the prices would improve the finances of the oil companies, and their stocks would tend to rise. Bus and truck owners, on the other hand, are not important amongst equity issuers. So on balance, the stock market would be quite favourable to the price rise.         
	That explains the choice of the day of the week, but not the decision itself. It does defy explanation; it is so out of character for the United Progressive Alliance government. This alliance does not believe in fiscal probity; ever since it came to power in 2004, it has merrily run enormous deficits. It does not believe in giving public enterprises operational independence. It quite shamelessly puts them to political uses; the otiose advertisements in newspapers with pictures of Congress leaders, financed by various public enterprises, are an obvious but by no means the most important instance of misuse. The government is a sucker for subsidies. It justifies them all in the name of the poor, but is careful not to enquire to whom the real benefits go. Price subsidies invariably create dual prices and hence an opportunity of making money from acquiring the product at a subsidized price and selling it in the unsubsidized market. The profits go to so-called black marketeers, but the term encompasses members of the ruling party and their trader clients. Briefly, subsidies are the mainstay of rackets of great benefit to the party and its friends; it is surprising that the party should cut down the source of its own prosperity. The decision to raise hydrocarbon prices is a departure from the partys normal shady path.              
	The timing of the decision suggests a connection with the meeting of the Group of 20 last Sunday. Let us look back to the Copenhagen summit, where India was a leader of demonstrators. Jairam Ramesh, its hirsute representative, made a big noise there about industrial countries being the villains of the century, finishing off all the oil before India could get to it and warming up the world. He led the chorus asking industrial countries to reduce their energy consumption. It was iconic hooliganism in the best style of Mamata and Mayavati; their antics had at last found an export market.        
	A little known fact is that G20 summits are just ceremonial get-togethers; the real business is done a few weeks before in extended meetings of the so-called financial leaders. This time the meetings took place over May and June. And there our financial leader faced some barracking from his counterparts from industrial countries, in a more sedate and less colourful style than Jairam Ramesh, but nevertheless effective. The point was made there that while India preaches sermons asking industrial countries to raise energy prices and reduce consumption, it is not even taxing energy as much as they; on the contrary, it is subsidizing some of the energy products. There was a disjunction between sermon and practice  nothing new for India, but nevertheless rather uncomfortable for a preacher. Oil is likely to get scarcer and scarcer, and eventually run out by the end of the century at the latest. The world  and that includes India  must prepare for that eventuality; the way to prepare is to increase efficiency of energy use and replace exhaustible with renewable energy. And the instrument for doing so is taxation: exhaustible energy, including especially hydrocarbons, must bear heavy and increasing taxation.         
	This is why the government did not merely announce the cut in subsidies and the rise in prices, but declared its intention to let prices be determined by the market. It implied that it would not give subsidies by stealth by telling the oil refining companies it owns what prices they should charge. This will not happen immediately, but the government promised it would happen some time. Thereafter, the only influence the government would exercise would be in the form of excise duties. It did put in a caveat, that if prices rose inordinately  if oil went over $100 a barrel  it may step in and go back to its old ways of arbitrary subsidies. So it was not announcing a change of faith, only restraint in pursuing expediency.        
	However, the increase in prices was not about the state of State-owned companies only; the ministrys statement also mentioned the private refiners. It will be recalled that Reliance and Essar opened petrol pumps from 2006 onwards, expecting to sell their own petrol and diesel. But the government forced its own companies to sell these products at a loss, and so forced losses upon the private companies. They could not pass on their losses to the taxpayers, and could not afford to bear them themselves. So they closed their pumps. Reliance changed its status to an export undertaking, and exported the bulk of its production, except for fuel oils such as furnace oil and low-sulphur heavy stock. But exports were not nearly so lucrative as the domestic market, where the only competitors were inefficient government companies. Besides, the government subsidized consumers through its own companies, but refused to give the private companies the same subsidy. It was unfair competition. These arguments were undoubtedly made by Reliance; and after Murli Deora became petroleum minister, they were perhaps heard with greater sympathy. So the rise in prices is also passed off as a step towards fairer  or less unfair  competition.               
	The recent camaraderie between the government and Reliance is relevant here. The Ambani brothers entered an agreement to divide up the Reliance empire in 2005. Soon they quarrelled, and their rows ended up in courts. The Central government quite gratuitously asked the courts to allow it to intervene, and did so systematically in favour of Mukeshs Reliance. Such uncalled-for and inappropriate favours are generally not made out of a generosity of heart; interests and influence are usually involved. The governments concern did not confine itself to the fraternal conflict; it spilled over, as will be seen, to the decision on pricing.        
	So the government has not acted out of conviction; no change of ideology should be read into the pricing decision. It would be quite mistaken to assume that the government will not go back to its old arbitrary and opportunistic ways. But before Friday, the probability that the government would allow the hydrocarbon market to function was zero. Now the subjective probability has risen above zero. But it is nowhere close to one.         
	If the government wants to convince the market and the investors that it has changed, it should take on the subsidies into its budget and give them to all companies, private and public. And it should eventually replace all taxes by a constant proportional tax on all crude and products, whether produced at home or imported.

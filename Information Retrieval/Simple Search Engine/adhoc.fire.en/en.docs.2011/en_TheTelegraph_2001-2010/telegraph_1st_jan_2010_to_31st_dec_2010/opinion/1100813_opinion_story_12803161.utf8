	From bees to human beings                
	Making India Work (Penguin, Rs 350) by William Nanda Bissell asks the reader to re-imagine India... to see India as a place where peoples rights translate into real benefits. This might sound navely optimistic at first. But to Bissells credit, he makes the work convincing enough by backing his arguments with solid research. He shows how Indias poverty is not an unchanging, and unchangeable, fact of its being, but a direct product of the way it has been managed by its leaders since Independence. One of the reasons why Bissell can persuasively make his case is that as the managing director of the successful Fabindia chain, he has first-hand experience of working with the countrys rural poor. As he himself says, I have a unique advantage. I belong to the super elite in India with access to government, business, political and media leaders; and yet, I have the perspective of an outsider. Sincere and thought-provoking, Making India Work provides quite a few practical solutions to the problems besetting modern India.                                  
	Classics: From the Iliad to Midnights Children (Orient, Rs 295) by Jane Gleeson-White provides very short write-ups on the 51 great masterpieces you should have read (and probably didnt). Since the book packs information about 51 classics in 253 pages, its pieces are hasty, and say nothing that you do not already know if you happen to be a student of literature. In fact, most of the articles are stuffed with clichs. For instance, it describes Lawrences Women in Love thus: A prophetic masterpiece steeped in eroticism, filled with perception about sexual power and obsession that have proven to be timeless and true. The book would probably be of use to the uninitiated, providing them with facts to memorize and regurgitate.                        
	The Yellow Book: A Parents Guide to Sexuality Education (Zubaan-Tarshi, Rs 295) is a helpful book that goes about its task with minimal fuss, which is what is needed, given the subject. It differentiates between various myths and facts of sex and sexuality with a frankness that is refreshing. The illustrations bring cheer to dull topics. Squeamish parents, who try to stave off reality with one-off lecture[s] about the birds and bees should buy this book.

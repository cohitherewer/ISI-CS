	Pakistan is all set to cross another milestone in its steep climb to the summit of democracy. The 18th amendment to its constitution has been tabled in parliament, and seems ready to be passed with an overwhelming majority. A major part of this success story, however, has been scripted outside parliament  in the bitter, raucous world of Pakistani politics  and that is probably what makes for its stunning effect. No one had expected sworn political rivals to bury the hatchet, or a president, unnervingly forgetful about electoral promises, to remember an inconvenient commitment. Yet, Pakistans politicians seem to have beaten the law of averages by arriving at a surprising consensus to correct a constitutional imbalance, that too at a time the world had been wondering if Pakistan was retracing its steps towards military dictatorship. The proposed amendment caps the discretionary powers of the president and makes the prime minister the fount of executive authority in accordance with the 1973 constitution. The president would no longer have the power to dissolve parliament or to appoint the three service chiefs and governors (without the consultation of the prime minister)  powers that had been used by no less than two of the countrys army chiefs who went on to assume executive authority. The army now has been given limited entry into the plot, unless, of course, its commander suspends the constitution itself. But this act has been labelled as high treason in order to dissuade the ambitious. The mighty judiciary, too, has been somewhat tamed by the inclusion of an executive hand in judicial appointments. This may go as long a way to ensure judicial transparency as acrimony in judicial-executive relations. The other laudable aspect of the amendment is the abolition of the concurrent list that, if taken to its logical limits, would address the grievances of provinces like Baluchistan. But perhaps more effort is needed to restructure the federations financial relations with provinces.        
	The amendment, undoubtedly, tries to bolster the position of the prime minister. The need for this is unquestionable in a democracy, but Pakistan needs to guard against a prime minister who may overreach his authority or become too close to the military command for his own good and that of the country.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BUCK THE TREND                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	I am beginning to sound like a record stuck in a deep groove when I rave and rant about the unforgivable state of our heritage and many legacies. However, it is a crying shame that as an emerging economic power  if that is to be believed  we continue to run our institutions into the ground, leaving them at the mercy of bureaucrats who have neither the sense of nor concern about conservation, preservation and dissemination. To watch a perfectly intelligent leadership preside over this daily destruction is unacceptable. Nowhere in the world is legacy mutilated and dishonoured as it is in India.        
	Our fake nationalism compels us to scream loudly when Indian artefacts are auctioned elsewhere in the world, and the authorities concerned demand that they be returned to the home country. I always wonder about the reasons behind this demand since everything we have  from art in our museums to standing structures as well as our natural environment  have been successfully defaced, encroached upon, and destroyed by us. Why have we not been able to conserve the Taj Mahal and its environs according to international standards? One great national monument, superbly conserved and protected, is the Mehrangarh Fort, run by a trust that is chaired by the former maharaja of Jodhpur.        
	Whichever way you look, there is degradation and decay. The babu feels hugely threatened by any voluntary intervention from experts and professionals from the civil society who want to participate in the larger management in order to contribute to a national cause. Stumbling blocks, delays and non-cooperation are the tools the babus employ to prevent and change what may improve India. Political leaders watch silently, thereby endorsing the degradation. The status quo continues unabated. This terrible truth has taken the spirit out of India. It has made us a dead, dull nation state where pride has no place.                
	Anarchic land        
	Why are we not ashamed about the state of the repository of our heritage? What will it require to overhaul and brighten the museums and archives of India? Why are these domains neglected? Why are these government-run places invariably akin to a snakepit with everyone working against the other, trying to curry favour or attempting to stall development? There is no reason for this abject failure. Someone up there needs to give us an explanation for this carelessness in managing national public institutions that live on public money.         
	It is most embarrassing to watch visitors enter the National Museum. Their expression is one of utter disbelief that India could have such an uninviting, unkempt and tardy national institution. There are strange shades of paint on the walls of the galleries, dirty pedestals on which sit elaborately carved gods and goddesses, plywood cut-outs of arches pretending to be Mughal, fused bulbs in the painting gallery, unwashed curtains, faulty, ugly signage and more. There is no excuse whatsoever for this state of affairs. India has changed. India has a new vibrancy and energy. Even small towns in India are changing rapidly. Shop fronts have become conscious of design. The contrast between entrepreneurship and the attempt to reach a higher scale in the ladder of excellence that is evident in the marketplace, and the complete lack of standards in government-run operations is stark and dramatic. They are like chalk and cheese, oil and water.        
	The world has moved on, India is moving too, but the government of India and its bureaucracy are being left behind. An ingenious people are being insulted by this complete lack of commitment. We have shown ourselves up in 2010 as an anarchic and disconnected emerging power. Who will buck the trend?

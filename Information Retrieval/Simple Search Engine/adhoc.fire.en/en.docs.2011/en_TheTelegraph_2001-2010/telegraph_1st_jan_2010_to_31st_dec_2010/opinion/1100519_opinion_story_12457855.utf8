	The prime minister is no longer the prime minister. Long live the prime minister. The change in British politics promised by both David Cameron and the Conservative Party and Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats has come to pass during the extraordinary and uncertain week since polling day. The election result failed to fulfil any one partys hopes, least of all the Conservatives. The Lib Dems have, in the past days, achieved a great deal more than they may have expected from much less than they hoped for in the ballot box. They now stand to be instant villains if things go wrong, with Clegg, now deputy prime minister, the inevitable fall guy. The New Labour dream, the Blair/Brown knockabout and the great clunking fist are consigned to the dissecting hands of the historians. We aspire to a new political system and a new era of consensus and practical, pragmatic government that will somehow get us to the light at the end of the tunnel of deficit, depression and dystopia.        
	The Labour Party has been left snapping bitterly at the Liberal Democrats for failing to follow the dream of a left-leaning progressive alliance. The former home secretary, David Blunkett, has inelegantly employed the obvious clich for Clegg, calling him a harlot for his inescapable engagement in the horse trading between parties essential to establish the Lib Dem role in future government and his personal standing with his grassroots. Lib Dem activists are as wary of a sellout of their core radical values as the Conservative right are of theirs. The press is unwilling to give up its Iago vocabulary of sly words and innuendo, being unused to a dulling of the sharp weapons of dissent and division. But that is yesterdays news. Times are hard and we must support the new alliance engineered by two young and committed politicians. It may indeed herald a less toxic form of politics and a greater sense of unity beyond party political borders.        
	A strong and elastic coalition could carry this country through present adversity and promote the sense of optimism that electoral reform will provide the politics that works best. New leadership of the Labour Party in due course may, if we are lucky, reinforce consensus rather than undermine it. In less good a case, Labour may find itself well out of present vicissitudes and, once regrouped, be ready and waiting to pick up the baton of power in the event of a slip-up. The new government, after all, stands between a rock and a hard place with little to spare for the populist syrup usually needed to hide bitter economic pills, but we know that, dont we? Theory is not, however, uncomfortable reality.        
	Much of the drama of the last week, even of the whole election campaign since Clegg emerged from the misted vagaries of Lib Dem party politics at the first leaders debate, has grown from the public and press-promoted belief that we are swimming in unknown waters. To some extent this may be so, but far less than we assume. Our main political parties have been so diverse for years as to be to all intents and purposes coalitions, the extremes of belief between Lib Dems and Conservatives no greater in fact than those between left and right of the Conservative or the Labour parties. The Liberal Democrat Party has been less obviously divided in parliament due to its smaller size and lower profile but the party activists now appearing in Westminster embody the spectrum of radical Lib Dem opinion. The vociferous demands of the opinion holders from every party will continue to be a shared problem for their leaders until a new electoral system is in place and future dealings required to form new, more representative, governments become the status quo.        
	Small c conservatism, as expected, pushed many of those temporarily seduced by Cleggs eloquence in the leadership debates back to their long-time roots but local issues and good candidates appear to have impacted strongly on voting percentages. To Conservative disappointment, Scotland remained staunchly Labour, immune to other blandishments including, more surprisingly, those of the Scottish National Party. Young voters felt free to vote according to their views on the issues of the moment as well as the merits of an individual leader or candidate. We are moving towards a situation less vested in long-term party loyalties and where we have all become potential floating voters since party lines and loyalties became blurred by internal party splits, not only over policy but on core belief.        
	Electoral reform and proportional representation, where everyones vote really counts, is so obviously the right step against this background. Like coalition, it has been treated in the last few weeks as a new concept, in this case of mainly Lib Dem purview. The press has run us endlessly through the various accepted systems while the Conservatives have appeared to treat the whole idea as an alien invention. I find this quite bizarre, brought up as I was in a left-of-centre Conservative political family where proportional representation was seen as the best hope for our properly democratic electoral future, a view shared by many of the Conservative grandees of the time. My mother, as national Conservative vice-chair in the 1970s, was part of the then pressure group, Conservative Action for Electoral Reform, with such luminaries as Douglas Hurd and Chris Patten, supported by the party chairman, Lord Carrington. Fashion has ebbed and flowed according to first-past-the-post party successes but, if Cameron is really a one-nation Tory, a move towards proportional representation should hardly be so great a leap.        
	Whether or not that is Camerons natural place, one-nation Toryism may be the platform on which he now finds himself, the right-wing leanings of the Conservative parliamentary party thankfully curbed by an indeterminate election showing that allows little room for the triumphalism of a resurgent right wing. We were not sure of Camerons true colours but his partys truest blue is toned down. He may be a greater prime minister as a result.        
	In the past few days, astonishment has been expressed by outsiders and onlookers that members of opposing parties are able to negotiate successfully at all with political enemies. They are amazed that the casual telephone calls or unannounced meetings discovered by reporters are possible after the sometimes vicious hurly-burly of election rhetoric. People forget that parliament is essentially an office building where people are constantly together in passages, lounges and tea rooms, know one another well and build normal relationships of friendship or enmity that have nothing whatsoever to do with party affiliation. The Labour Party is currently out on a limb, its former leader and prime minister a loser from what is now an older generation of politicians but individual members of parliament will continue to communicate across party lines.        
	Clegg and Cameron, who have much in common outside the party sphere, may have shared ground to build on with a new, younger Labour leader, whether or not the public are aware of such relationships. The new prime minister and his deputy are both young, well educated and committed to their families, their careers and politics. It is perfectly possible, probable in fact, given what has been achieved in the last days in terms of hammering out policy differences, compromises and a full government team, that they get on rather well, understand each other and have, broadly at least, the same goals. We have to hope they will succeed in those for the good of the country.              
	Polling day seems a long time ago. Politics has been the new sport this week, and we have been as glued to our televisions and radios as we will be to the World Cup in a few weeks time. I for one got what I voted for in this election. I have not been a fan of David Cameron, the individual or his apparent beliefs, but I like the idea of this government on the face of it and I hope it is successful. It will be a tragedy if our new coalition fails and we revert to the party tribalism of the past. There is a huge job to be done, election excitement has allowed us to forget some of our problems and the government has to prioritize ruthlessly, at the same time compromising to fulfil manifesto promises across two parties. Cameron is the first prime minister to be younger than me and already I feel like the older generation. Our children are unlikely to have as easy a ride as we now begin to understand we have had, but their discomforts and those of our expectedly poorer old age may be assuaged by a sense of greater engagement and a louder voice, better heard, in our political process.

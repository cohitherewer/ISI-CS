	Just art                  
	Sir  The article, On not being a tree (Oct 26), provided a lucid analysis of the global structures of finance, knowledge and power that create a hegemonic perception of art. Although the article takes photography as its point of reference, the reflections are equally applicable to other forms of art in the modern age. Aveek Sen rightly points out that a large portion of academic writing is structured by the international politics of contextualization. By making European art a transcendental category, such politics belittles the works of other nationalities; in this way, Asian art, for example, is projected as an inferior other tied to its historical and national particularities. Asian artists often fall into the trap of this generalization. Is it at all possible to produce an art that would escape such readymade assumptions? One wonders if art would ever be able to break free of the convenient projections and models created by the dominant academic politics. The article provokes a debate on the very nature of artistic production and its interpretations. Perhaps, nestled deep inside the desire to free art from political strictures and national boundaries is a nostalgia for the pristine sovereignty of art  built upon the notion that good art makes context irrelevant.          
	But the characteristics of modern art and its constant search for radical ideas have made artistic sovereignty impossible. Ever since Marcel Duchamps readymades and Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes came into the scene, international art has been making frantic bids to free itself from conventional ideas of identity, nation and beauty. This, however, has resulted in art creating a vacuum around itself. As Rainer Rochlitz said, The freedom of contemporary art is constantly burning its boats, but the burning of boats is not in itself sufficient to establish a bridgehead in the history of art. Will art, in freeing itself from the tyranny of context, end up being involved in the quest for an impossible freedom?

	Shady business           
	Sir  It is a matter of great concern that nursing homes and doctors are involved, along with touts, in the buying and selling of babies in Calcutta (Babies for sale, Oct 30). It seems that a lot of nefarious activities go on in many of the nursing homes and health centres across the city. It is shameful that the States negligence and inefficiency have resulted in women and children being trafficked and babies being sold. Immediate steps must be taken to curb such illegal practices.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There is another angle to the issue of babies being sold in Calcutta. The system of adoption is so lengthy and uncertain in this country that people are tempted to take a short cut  which is why they get involved in illegal practices. The bureaucratic hurdles that one has to face in adopting a baby are frustrating. The emotional distress of a childless couple has to be understood in this context. One wonders why the procedure for adoption is so gruelling in India. The system lacks transparency and the government does not care. One hopes that the State wakes up to the plight of childless couples and takes steps to improve things.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Clean up           
	Sir  The Commonwealth Games have come and gone, but the lessons learnt from the widespread protest against the pathetic sanitary conditions in the Games Village have all too quickly been forgotten. The dirty toilets of the Games Village were no exceptions. Most cities in India today have swanky skyscrapers, smooth flyovers, trendy restaurants and gigantic malls, but they also suffer from an appalling lack of sanitary facilities in public places. If this is the condition in cities, one can well imagine what it must be like in rural areas. During a recent trip to Himachal Pradesh, I was shocked by the complete lack of decent public toilets on the roads leading to various tourist spots. Some of the famous tourist destinations, which are visited by thousands of people every day, did not have more than one public toilet.          
	Our own irresponsible attitude is also to be blamed for the abysmal state of public hygiene in the country. The general Indian mentality is to cleanse oneself while dirtying the surroundings. While we seek clean sanitary facilities in trains, restrooms, and airports, we do not think twice before leaving them dirty. Unless we change our mindset radically, India will never be able to progress. Building and maintaining public facilities are the governments responsibility, but it is the citizens duty to look after them.           
	Yours faithfully,

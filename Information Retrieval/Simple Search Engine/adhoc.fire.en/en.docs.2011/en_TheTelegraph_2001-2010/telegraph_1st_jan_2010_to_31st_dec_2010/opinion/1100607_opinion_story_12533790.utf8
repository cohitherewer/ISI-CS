	The finance minister missed going to the Busan beach, which created a record of sorts last summer: it had 7,937 parasols, more than any other beach. That was in case it got too hot. If the reverse happened and the bathers felt cold, nature has conveniently located hot geysers not too far away. It was not always such a scene of pleasure; only 50 years ago, Pusan, as it was then known, was encircled by North Korean troops, and was the centre of a prolonged and decisive campaign in the Korean war. No doubt this history was not unrelated to the choice of Busan for the meeting of G20 finance ministers.        
	Fifty years later, Busan was the site of another battle in which the Indian finance minister fired the first volley. He went against the consensus building up around the European Unions proposal and told his compres that he had no intention of imposing a bank tax in India. He told them to improve their regulation of banks instead. He left it unsaid that India had such superior bank regulation that it did not give financial crisis a chance to come anywhere near the Indian shores. Nor did he mention that India would not have a financial crisis even if its banks went bankrupt. For most of them are owned by the government, and the government would only dip into the pockets of taxpayers to rescue them. It has done so before, and it will do so again. If he had mentioned this, some undiplomatic finance minister might have asked him whether it would not be better to tax banks rather than taxpayers to finance the rescue of banks: if banks are responsible for putting entire economies at risk when they fail, should they not pay a tax to meet the cost of rescuing them? Such a question would not have left Pranab Mukherjee at a loss for words, which he never is; but it is not quite certain whether he and his ever-so-confident advisers have really thought out the answer.        
	If they thought about it, they would also hit upon the answer: that when countries rescue bankrupt banks, they usually do it by borrowing on the market; they must then worry about the debt they would pile up, the interest they would have to pay on it, and the burden that would place on their taxpayers. These are not matters that would worry Mr Mukherjee, for if he ran into a crisis, he would spend his way out of it, and run enormous fiscal deficits. If the consequent debt accumulation troubled him, he would issue money and repay it. If that caused inflation, he would take it in his stride; India considers inflation to be a normal state of affairs. The real answer is, Mr Mukherjee has the good fortune to rule a country of meek, uncomplaining citizens.

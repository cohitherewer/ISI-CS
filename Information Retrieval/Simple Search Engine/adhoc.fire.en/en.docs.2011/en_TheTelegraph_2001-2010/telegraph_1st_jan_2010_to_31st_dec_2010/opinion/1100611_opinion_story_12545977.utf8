                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        READ AND LEARN                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The writings on the dreadful condition of our treasure troves attracted much response. More importantly, I came across an interview in one of the newspapers with the secretary of the ministry of culture who claimed that a radical overhaul was being processed because the prime minister, as also the minister of culture, were personally leading the charge in restructuring museums in India. With that kind of support, things should change within months and settle down in a year or two, managed and curated by non-babus, with all the bits and bobs that the world has invented put in place, and operated in an effort to make museums people-friendly. The countdown has begun. Let us hope and pray that this commitment does not languish in the labyrinth of endless committees inherited by a steady stream of ministers who come and go and bring no change.        
	The Indian cultural establishment is parochial, unbending and has no glimmer of creative thinking. In a landscape dotted with countless fragments of gates, palaces, mansions and forts, some more important than others because of their historical significance and level of preservation, we need to urgently begin thinking out of the box. Re-use of carefully selected buildings is essential for conservation and preservation. The world has nurtured such spaces, modified and reinvented them, and an international public has savoured their new avatars. We do just the opposite. We put restrictions through absurd building norms, making allowances for corruption as the rules are ridiculous.         
	Fine eating places, elegant teashops, great Made in India shops housing superb hand-made products, fabrics from the great looms of India, music and dance, theatre and film, could be integrated into some of the monuments that lie ruined around us. The norms that dictate what is permitted and what is not need to be devised with a modern mind, taking the best practices from other parts of the world where such transformations have happened with success.                 
	Redundant rules        
	These enterprises will, undoubtedly, bring in the required revenue to maintain such edifices and become self-sustaining. Advisory bodies need only one ex-officio babu and for the rest, carefully chosen professional practitioners with a wide international experience. Look around and India is exploding with new ideas, but all State-run enterprises in the area of culture are dull, boring and completely out of sync.        
	That horrendous Indian killer virus  lowest tender  has introduced the Worst of India into the realm of the Best of India. The minister of culture knows that the lowest tender has perpetuated an all-time low quality in every sphere where the government runs what should be in the hands of competent, quality professionals. We have a large clutch of innovative entrepreneurs who have started bars, restaurants, shops and products, which celebrate a vibrant India emerging out of the earlier, boxed-in economy. None of these world-class examples is allowed anywhere near institutions governed by the State. Public-private partnership dies before the marriage because the public end is ridden with a deep insecurity and protected by redundant rules and regulations that would drive away the hardiest of entrepreneurs.         
	In Delhi, where roadside eating was a treat, the municipality has banned street food on grounds of hygiene, a complete nonsense considering the filth around us. The MCD and NDMC have failed miserably. Strict norms need to be constituted to govern the presiding officers. Our unthinking, unaesthetic, inexperienced babus are instituting the worst of the West. Hello Mr Babu, do you know that open markets in city squares are becoming fashionable? Do you know that B-grade monuments are being re-used for other activities? Read and you will learn.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The gift of a second life
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE GIFT OF A SECOND LIFE                                  Growing public awareness of the benefits of cadaver transplant may help contain the huge racket in live organ sale, writes Chirosree Basu                          Healthy interest                                  
	At the Mohan Foundation office in Chennai, the girls are just back from an organ donation camp they had helped organize at the Marina beach with the sponsorship of a major bicycle brand. For the workers of the Multi Organ Harvesting Aid Network, a non-governmental organization which has been championing the cause of cadaver organ donation since the late 1990s, this was business as usual, even though it was Sunday. But apart from the heat, what had left them a little flustered was the presence of a man who wanted to see pictures of what organs actually looked like. After looking at the picture of the kidneys, the man had lifted his shirt to show a six-inch stitch mark. Then, directing himself at anyone who cared to listen, he had said, They have taken away my kidney.        
	It is unlikely that the statement was greeted with anything more than an embarrassed silence. Chennai, in fact the whole of Tamil Nadu, has lived with this ugly truth for years. The highly developed medical industry in the state, which has made possible within it the maximum number of organ transplants in the country, has proved to be a curse for a section of the people who have become vulnerable to the organ racket. The man with the scar symbolizes one kind of reality. That now coexists with another reality of which the organ donation camp by the sea was evidence  the new-found enthusiasm to promote cadaver transplants that is giving the state and its people a chance to look away from ugly truths and reach for a moral high never experienced before.         
	Cadaver transplants  the retrieval of all major organs from the bodies of the brain-dead and their transplantation to patients who need them  has picked up in a major way in Chennai over the past two years. In 2008, there were 30 cadaver transplants in the city and 59 in 2009. In February this year, a milestone was reached when five transplantation surgeries were carried out in two government hospitals. What brought these developments to national notice was the transplantation of the kidneys of a five-year-old accident victim on to her father. For the city, however, this was another emotional high point since a donation two years ago helped the state governments cadaver transplant programme get off the ground.        
	In September 2008, Pushpanjali Ashokan and her husband, both doctors, donated the organs of their teenage son, Hithendran, who died in a motorcycle accident. This was in no way a unique case, but somehow it captured the public imagination. Days after they had made their choice, the Ashokans were explaining to others, in schools and clubs in the neighbourhood and in seminars beyond, that it was possible to make this difficult choice in the most difficult time in ones life. Since then, they have had many emulators.        
	The motivation for donor families is to give a second life to others. That is the issue around which all promotion revolves. That this act can also help stop the organ racket is a point still missing in public discourse. But the latter has always been one of the major principles behind pro-cadaver transplant activism. It was initiated and sustained by members of the medical community and promoted by some private hospitals to which cadaver transplantation also made sound business sense. Since the Transplantation of Human Organs Act of 1994 defined brain death, NGOs like Mohan tried to create public awareness and even managed to build a network of hospitals which could carry out cadaver transplantation. When the state government stepped in in 2008, it did so with the precise objective of busting the live organ sale racket. The website of the cadaver transplant programme of Tamil Nadu specifically mentions the tsunami kidney sale scandal of 2007 as being one of the reasons which got the government going and J. Amalorpavanathan, a doctor and the convener of the programme, insists that a growth in cadaver transplant activity would become a disincentive for living donor kidney sale.        
	Yet, despite its enormous possibilities, the cadaver transplant programme in the state has been left almost entirely to be sustained by NGOs like Mohan, the National Network for Organ Sharing and a few others. The governments entry into this sector, of course, has provided a major impetus. A series of government orders in 2008 laid down the procedure for the declaration of brain death. Mohans online registry of patients in need of donation was taken over by the government and made into a central registry for private and public hospitals. It also added transparency to a procedure which has been suspect in the public eye. But despite the creation of special wards in some government hospitals (Stanley Medical College, for example), progress in government hospitals, which get the largest number of brain death cases, has been tardy. Amalorpavanathan reasons, Cadaver transplant is not a widely prevalent activity even in private hospitals. Less than 50 private hospitals have taken approval to do cadaver transplant and only a third of them have done cadaver transplant.        
	One of the reasons for this, apart from the enormous costs involved in maintaining cadavers for retrieval and their transplant (free in public hospitals), is the divide within the medical community. Sunil Shroff, a doctor and managing trustee of Mohan, says that not all doctors would want to wish the cadaver transplant programme good luck. A well-known nephrologist in Chennai who was arrested in 2007 for his alleged role in a Mumbai kidney scandal, sounded more than eager to slam the government initiative as being too obscurantist, expensive and biased in favour of the rich to be sustainable. The NGOs, he believes, are publicity-hungry, wasting money that should have gone into prevention of kidney diseases and dialysis.        
	In a developing country like India with its myriad problems of health and education, there will always be doubts about which programme requires more money than another. The cadaver transplant programme is urban to the core, and will benefit only those who can afford transplant surgery in private hospitals, until cadaver transplants become a routine affair in government hospitals. But there is no doubt that the government-NGO partnership is working wonders in Chennai. If there are doubts, one only needs to see what the Mohan-trained grief counsellor, R. Veena, has accomplished in a little over a month since she took up her post as transplant coordinator at Chennais Government General Hospital. She has been able to convince five families out of eight to donate the organs of their dear ones. The two back to back surgeries in February, which marked the first breakthrough in the government hospitals, and the more recent case of the five-year-old donor, were cases handled by her.        
	Like many of the grief counsellors/transplant coordinators (made mandatory by the government in hospitals conducting cadaver transplants), Veena carries tremendous responsibility. No matter what they have heard or read about organ donation, family members of the deceased  to many of whom the concept is completely alien  make the decision in the hospital in the most trying hour of their lives. Many a time it is the treatment the patient has received in the hospital that decides matters. And many a time, it is the personal interaction they have with counsellors like Veena that helps them decide. No matter how efficient the infrastructure, it is this crucial hour that decides, and will continue to decide, the success of the governments cadaver transplant programme and its success in reducing live organ sale. It will also decide how many stories of the heroism of the ordinary reach the front pages of newspapers and keep public emotions running.              
	Twenty-something Veena was slightly scared by the man at the beach  she thought he would take off all his clothes. She knows that it is people like her who will decide which of the two contending realities in her city  the organ market or the heroism of the ordinary  will push out the other. If the second wins, there will no longer be the need to shut ones eyes.

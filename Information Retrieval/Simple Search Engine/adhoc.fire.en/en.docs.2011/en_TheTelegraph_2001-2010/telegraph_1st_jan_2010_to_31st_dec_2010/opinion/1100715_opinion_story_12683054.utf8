	A surface calm has returned to Kashmir. But more than the army and the police, the administration owes it to the bandh called by the separatists for keeping people off the streets. From here, the valley seems destined to travel the same circuitous path with which it is well acquainted. The all parties meet has concluded with two expected resolutions. One, to hold an independent inquiry into the killing of civilians. Two, to ask the Centre to restart the dialogue process, implement the recommendations of its working groups and consider an employment package for the state. The first resolution, despite mirroring the demands of the state Opposition, is bound to be stonewalled with questions about the independence of the inquiry commission. The second resolution, which firmly throws the entire responsibility of sorting out the Kashmir mess on the Centre, is unlikely to take matters anywhere. It should be obvious that it is impossible to revive any kind of dialogue unless the participants are willing to talk. It may have been beyond the capacity of the all parties meet to resolve the Kashmir imbroglio, but whatever chances it had were defeated by the intransigence of mainstream parties like the Peoples Democratic Party to come to the table. Yet, there is little debate that there is no other way forward than by reinstating the internal dialogue that has been almost snuffed out by the mindless violence of a month.        
	To get things moving in Kashmir, it is imperative that certain responsibilities are owned up to. The state administration of Omar Abdullah has to accept the unpleasant fact that, over the past year-and-a-half, it has failed one crucial test after another to prove that it can address popular grievances, provide effective governance and negotiate the question of azadi. The Opposition has to remember that it is not fulfilling the collective responsibility it has towards the people by merely humiliating the ruling party and refusing to break bread with it. And the Centre has to remember that it cannot let itself fall into the same pattern of playing big brother, sermonizing to bumbling satraps and shielding tyrants in military boots. Unless familiar moulds are broken, the secular democratic revival that the valley had seen not too long ago will be replaced by the religious fundamentalism of hardline secessionists who are happily calling the shots now.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        JUST LIMITS                                                    
	The question of setting limits is seldom tension-free, especially when the issue is one of rights. A person may have the right to move freely, but he may not have the right to trample over anothers body during his morning stroll. The Supreme Court has ruled that a judge need not furnish reasons under the Right to Information Act as to why he decided on one verdict and not another. The judgment itself is the reason, the court reportedly said, indicating that the reasons for the verdict are implicitly disposed in the logic incarnated in the judges sentence, and can require no further explanation. In setting this limit, the Supreme Court has rightly affirmed the place and significance of constitutionally upheld impartial arbitration in society. A judges verdict is the complex outcome of the working of his conscience and wisdom, the intuition gained from his understanding of law, his compliance with the Constitution and the evidence he has before him. Even if he were just to reveal the countable steps by which he arrived at the verdict, he could be placed in the position of having to give out information involving other persons, such as the defendant, the complainant or witnesses, without their consent. Asking for the reasons behind a verdict is a far cry from asking for an account of public expenditure, or a list of a public servants assets, or marked answer-scripts after a public examination.         
	The Supreme Court ruling indirectly points towards a problem within the RTI Act itself, by bringing attention to bear on grey areas where its application is indecisive. The limits the act sets on itself do include anything that is forbidden by the courts or that may lead to contempt, but that is obviously too vague. The enormous importance of the RTI Act should never be underrated, especially in a country where public institutions lean more towards secrecy than transparency. It cannot be denied that inquiries even now occasionally face attempts at muzzling. Such incidents make the citizens empowerment through the act all the more significant. Yet, because of the imbalance inherent in the possession of information on the one side and the need to know on the other, the RTI Act is, willy-nilly, dependent to some extent on the governments discretion and its good faith. This is an inescapable limitation located within the laws engagement with the polity. The freedom to know is, like all other democratic freedoms, structured by the context of democratic dispensation.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Dark days                  
	Sir  The editorial, Let there be light (April 11), is right in saying that Bengals chief minister must bear the blame for the power shortage in the state. But what is also needed is an inquiry into the abysmal power situation in West Bengal. Electricity generation, supply and distribution mainly depend on coal suppliers, the transport network and on government machinery. Media reports reveal that there is a serious lack of coordination among these bodies. Once these organizations get into a sustained process of mutual cooperation, the power situation in the state will improve.          
	In his meeting with the power minister, the chairman of Coal India Limited expressed concerns regarding the dip in coal supply to the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited owing to the inadequate number of rakes. Poor quality of coal, low plant load factor, certain payment issues between WBPDC and Eastern Coalfields Limited and the lack of substantive plans to tackle rising demand during summer are some of the factors that have aggravated the situation.          
	To boost power generation and supply, public and private enterprises must cooperate with the state government and strive to develop a system keeping in mind the basic necessities of citizens. Blaming the Opposition leader, Mamata Banerjee, for disrupting development efforts will not help the Left Front in the long run. Banerjee must also work together with the state government to solve the prevailing crisis. Her continued resistance to the state governments efforts to put up electric poles in Rajarhat is very unfortunate.          
	As pointed out by the editorial, the courage to own responsibility is essential, not only on the part of the chief minister, but also on the part of officials running the concerned departments. The problem of power shortage is not unique to West Bengal; it plagues many other states. The Centre should also undertake necessary measures to solve the problem.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu,

	Sir  It is only April, but the temperature is already on the rise. Power cuts have also started occurring on a regular basis. The power minister of West Bengal never fails to come up with excuses for his inability to tackle power shortage in the state. Although it is true that the citizens have contributed to the shortage by their excessive use of air-conditioners and computers, the power minister cannot absolve himself of the responsibility to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity. Modern cities witness heavy use of air-conditioners and computers, but that should not cause power shortage or impede the citys growth. The West Bengal government is so inept that it has not been able to modernize the system or identify alternative sources to conserve energy. Instead, it pleads helplessness and gives vague excuses to cover up its faults. Its sluggish attitude and apathy towards modernization are the reasons behind the appalling condition prevailing in the state. If the power cuts continue, the months of May and June will become unbearable. The power minister should act immediately to tackle the crisis instead of finding fault with others.          
	Incidentally, Salt Lake is suffering more after the demise of Jyoti Basu. While he was alive, Salt Lake witnessed very few power cuts. Perhaps this is the reason why the residents of Salt Lake now miss Basu badly. Is the government trying to take the city back to the days when electricity had not been invented?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The chief minister has said that the people of West Bengal will have to suffer power cuts for another month since production in power units at Bakreswar and Kolaghat has been adversely affected. The state government has been coming up with excuses of this nature for over three decades now. The Left Front has failed to solve the problem of power shortage that has persisted for many years, thus depriving citizens of favourable conditions for education, development and a healthy life. However, even the Opposition does not seem equipped to solve the problem. One is surprised by the lack of spirit in the students unions of the state. The students suffer the most during power cuts, and they are the ones who should be active in rooting out this menace and the accompanying corruption that have acquired menacing proportions.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Chandan K. Bhattacharjee, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  The news report, Many wrongs add up to inflict power brutality (April 9), could not have had a more apt headline. Power shortage continues unabated in West Bengal, and the government remains powerless to tackle this crisis. There should be a paradigm shift in the governments approach towards solving the power crisis. The Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation should be allowed to generate more electricity on its own to meet the demands in areas that are within its ambit. The West Bengal State Electricity Board should utilize the power it generates for the areas under its control, instead of supplying bulk power to the CESC. The government should also turn to the private sector to meet additional power requirements, as it has done in CESCs case with a measure of success.          
	Why should the people and the industries be made to suffer when there is a way out? The government cannot continue to experiment at the cost of the people for such a long time.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Bhattacharya, Calcutta

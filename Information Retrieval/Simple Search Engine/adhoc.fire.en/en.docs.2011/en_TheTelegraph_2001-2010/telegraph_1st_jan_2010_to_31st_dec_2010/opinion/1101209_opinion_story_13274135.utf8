The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fear of freedom
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FEAR OF FREEDOM                                                    
	Despotic rulers do not love those who love freedom and basic human rights. But such rulers would often end up looking rather comical in trying to stifle the voices of freedom. What China has done to try and dissuade countries from attending the Nobel awards ceremony on Thursday is both farcical and ominous. But the overwhelming impression is one of irony. Beijing had sought to isolate the Nobel committee for its decision to award this years Peace Prize to the jailed Chinese human rights activist, Liu Xiaobo. But it is China itself that now stands ostracized by most of the free world. Its human rights record lies exposed as never before since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. The list of countries that have bowed to Chinese pressure makes the point quite starkly. These countries are not exactly known for their love of democracy and an open society. All democratic nations, on the other hand, have rebuffed Chinas belligerent diplomacy on the issue. Ironically, in trying to garner support for its campaign, Beijing has shown the world the kind of company it keeps. Chinese rulers may have hugely miscalculated the cost of their ill-conceived campaign.         
	However, the real significance of the episode lies in what the free world learns from it. First, it will vindicate those who worry about Chinas rise. It should serve as yet another warning that the world cannot accept the bartering of liberty for economic gains. With the Western economies in deep trouble and the Chinese one booming, Beijings human rights record is often glossed over by the free world. During his visit to Beijing soon after the Nobel committees announcement, the British prime minister, David Cameron, was anxious to not let Mr Lius case spoil his commercial goals. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, also soft-pedalled the issue during the visit to Paris of his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao. The visit resulted in contracts for French firms worth $20 billion, including an agreement by Beijing to buy 66 more Airbus jets. But, sacrificing the values of a free society to economic compulsions will only embolden China to hit such values harder at home and abroad. The Chinese bullying has a simple message for the free world  it is time to take the bull by the horn. The democratic world must act before the fear of a rising China overpowers it.

	It was business as usual on the streets of Yangon on the morning of Friday, February 26, 2010, though it could have turned out to be a historic day for the people of Myanmar. The supreme court was to hear the appeal of Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of Myanmars independence hero and leader of the National League for Democracy, to end her 14-year-long house arrest. Last year, in a suspicious incident, an American man had swum uninvited to her lakeside compound. That resulted in a lower court upholding the decision to extend Ms Suu Kyis house arrest by another 18 months. So, under ordinary circumstances, one would have expected a lot of public anticipation around the hearing. But politics in Myanmar is a foregone conclusion, an unnatural affair that has bred a spirit of natural resignation among its population. In the event, the court settled the matter in five minutes, dismissing Ms Suu Kyis appeal without even a token reasoning. A week later, the ruling was followed up with an injunction from the military government asking the NLD to expel Ms Suu Kyi if it wants to participate in the general elections coming up later this year. The political parties registration law, framed by the notorious military junta, prohibits anyone with a criminal conviction from contesting polls.        
	A peculiar sense of dj vu pervades the prevailing political situation in Myanmar. Since 1990, when the NLD was voted to power but never allowed to assume control by the military general, Than Shwe, the people of Myanmar, as well as the international community, have watched helplessly as things have gone from bad to worse. Along with Ms Suu Kyi, more than 2,000 pro-democracy activists remain imprisoned, as every appeal for clemency and fairness, even from the big Western powers, is scorned with impunity. The military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962, has become unshakably complacent about its invincibility  and perhaps with good reason as well. It is truly amazing, and no less embarrassing, how little has been achieved in spite of sustained agitations by human-rights activists and severe international criticism. Nothing seems to deter the military, let alone defeat its iron will. In fact, a bevy of sanctions (including an arms embargo, suspension of all aid except humanitarian aid, and trade preferences) only seems to have exacerbated the militarys impetuosity  and the peoples misery.

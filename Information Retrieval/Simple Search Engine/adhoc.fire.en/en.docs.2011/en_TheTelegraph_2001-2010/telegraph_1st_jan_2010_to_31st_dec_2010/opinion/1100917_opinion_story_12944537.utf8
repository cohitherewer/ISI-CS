	THE TOP 100 CRICKETERS OF ALL TIME																					 By Christopher  Martin-Jenkins,   Corinthian, Rs 399
    
	Selecting the top 100 cricketers of all time is a thought-provoking and pleasant engagement. But when one announces the list to the world, it becomes a highly controversial statement. How would you compare a player you have seen with someone you have not and only read about? Would it be fair to evaluate players cocooned in protective gear with those who took knocks on their bodies but never flinched?  
	Modern cricket has made a mockery of the statistical achievements of the heroes of the past. Covered pitches, placid tracks and numerous restrictions on bowlers and on field-placement have given inflated egos to mediocre batsmen.         
	Today, the lexicon of cricket is full of terms such as betting, bookies, drugs and the various kinds of fixing. There is an urgent need to give the gentlemans game a new definition. No longer do our English professors say, Its not cricket, because the games ethics and etiquette are now tainted. To compare Aubrey Faulkner or our own Vinoo Mankad  cricketers who barely managed to sustain themselves as professionals  with those who mint crores by bowling four overs in matches that are supposed to entertain is a blatant travesty of justice. The ethos of the game has changed, and there is no point in bringing great players of different eras on the same platform.        
	Nevertheless, Christopher Martin-Jenkins has taken the plunge. He has, however, sensibly acknowledged the difficulty of the task. In self-defence, he mentions that the list was restricted to cricketers who have ... character, class, temperament, the ability to entertain and the capacity, above all, to win matches by personal performance in a team cause....        
	Unfortunately, Martin-Jenkins fails in his task. Of the 100 cricketers, there are no less than 35 from England. In the last three decades, England has not achieved much. Yet, 15 players out of the 35 are from this period. There is every indication that the author has not done justice to the West Indies (only 14 cricketers) and to Australia (second, with 22 players). Both these teams have ruled world cricket for long stretches.         
	The eight Indians in the list are Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Bishen Bedi, Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Vijay Merchant and Anil Kumble. V.V.S. Laxman, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Gundappa Viswanath, Mankad or Vijay Hazare have not made it to the list, even though the likes of Andy Flower, Graham Gooch, Graeme Smith and Shaun Pollock make the cut.        
	There is no place for artists like Bernard Bosanquet and Rohan Kanhai. Bosanquet is the man who discovered the googly. Kanhai perfected the art of hooking the ball to the fence while lying on the ground. No cricketer has been able to replicate this stroke. Martin-Jenkins is not the first person to make such a list. A few others have done it earlier. Lists such as these would be interesting if the author can add a new dimension to the selected players. But Martin-Jenkins has not added anything new by way of research. He has merely mentioned dry statistics and some well known facts. Literary flavour has never been his strength, and there is no evidence to the contrary here. Neither is there any technical analysis, nor any insight into players profiles. There is nothing in the book that has already not been highlighted elsewhere. From a BBC commentator and a renowned cricket columnist, we expected something far more interesting.                    RAJU MUKHERJI

	HOLMES OF THE RAJ By Vithal Rajan, Random House, Rs 295        
	It may be time for a different Holmes. But how different? Vithal Rajans Holmes of the Raj is a curious addition to Sherlockiana, and Arthur Conan Doyle, who did not mind his detective being adopted by different authors, may have been somewhat disconcerted.        
	The first of the six stories in the book has Holmes and Watson sailing for India in 1888, to investigate the murder of an accountant in a mutt in Kanchipuram. The police have arrested the Sankaracharya himself for the murder. The Home Office is jittery: peaceful Hindoo subjects may become violent if a religious head is humiliated. Behind the murder lies money: some donations for victims of the 1883 tsunami from competing German and British missionaries have vanished. Holmes is already investigating this  There is a military power that actively seeks to disturb the tranquillity of the Indian Government  when the call to duty comes.        
	Rajans Holmes is an authority on the Tamil dosa and can chat with the Sankaracharya in Sanskrit. Conan Doyles hints of Holmess service to his sovereign through the discreet disposal of scandalous cases are taken to a new level. Here Holmes serves the Empire, but more by being at the right place at the right time than by any noticeable use of his deductive powers.        
	But what are the times, right or wrong? The first five stories are set in the late 1880s, and are part of the same trip. Holmes and Watson travel from one adventure to another on urgent requests from British officials and Indian royalty, who seem to need their help to keep the peace in an exotic, sinister country. Descriptions of colonial life, excellent food  to which Dr Watson is too partial for his own good, of the intricacies of social interaction and political attitude, of luxurious tents in royal shikars, the air of brooding menace, the changing scenes from Madras and Pondicherry to Hyderabad through the dangerous Central Provinces to Naini Tal and finally the confusion of Calcutta provide a good read, although no one would ever have suspected Watson of the vast knowledgeability he displays.        
	The sixth story is set 25 years later, when Holmes and Watson, in their seventies, are persuaded to travel to India a second time, for the Viceroy of India specifically asks for them to help sort out friends from enemies when the tranquillity of India hangs by a thread.        
	The people Holmes and Watson meet emerge from both history and fiction, and it is a dreary spoilsport who would mix up times in history with meetings in the imagination. In Calcutta, for example, the two heroes are ensnared in Baranagar by a resurrected Moriarty, and are rescued by a young sadhu in ochre robes called Narendra. Lord Ripon, Madame Blavatsky, Rudyard Kipling, as well as a cross-dressed Kim and an enigmatic Krishna who will become Mowgli, Ramanujan, a pre-teen Dhyan Chand, a young Rabindranath (in 1913?), an elegant Motilal Nehru, even an American named Rhett Butler who calls himself Clark Gable, crowd the pages with numerous others in a shimmering universe of unending impossibilities.        
	Dr Watson, about whose interest in research Conan Doyle is rather quiet, discovers the malaria parasite and leaves his papers for Ronald Ross to work on, while Holmes captures Jack the Ripper, and induces Jinnah to shift his views on Hindu-Muslim unity to avert a murderous plot. Together they provide the first two lines of Tagores Where the mind is without fear (in English). The Notes are fun.                            BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

	Choose wisely and well                  
	Sir  With due respect to Kishwar Jahan, the mother of the late Rizwanur Rahman, I would like to say that Trinamul Congresss decision to include her among the list of selected advisors to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is not a healthy one (Did Trinamul ask? 41 say No, June 8). These posts are necessary for the smooth running of the city. Therefore, only those who have experience in holding such offices should occupy them. The TMC should rethink its choice and not confuse politics and emotions with efficient administration.          
	Yours faithfully,        Pinaki Dhara, Calcutta
        
	Uphill task          
	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas Environmental challenge(May 22) was informative and thought-provoking. The subject that Guha dwelt upon has taken the world by storm. But it has remained restricted to academic discourse in India. Due to its limited reach, the public has remained unaware of the responsibility it should shoulder to meet the challenge of ecological imbalance.           
	However, it is heartening that Jairam Ramesh, the minister for environment and forests, possesses a clear idea about the vulnerability of existing models of economic growth. In India, the latter are dependent on scarce fossil fuels. Guha is right in asserting that the primary concern should be to judiciously manage the natural resources available in the country. This can only be done if citizens clearly understand the gravity of the problem and feel inspired to do their bit to create a better environment to live in.          
	Some of the root causes of environmental degradation need to be addressed by the government with a missionary zeal. The masses must be educated about the necessity of preserving environmental homogeneity. To this end, the services of NGOs, volunteer groups and unemployed, educated youth could be hired to spread awareness among the people. Those who depend on forest resources for survival should be encouraged to shift to alternative modes of livelihood. Ramesh has an uphill task ahead of him. But given his sincerity and expertise, one hopes that he gets the necessary support to put the environment back on track.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The World Environment Day on June 5 was a low-key affair in West Bengal. There was hardly any event organized by the government to mark such an important day. Bengal, like most states in the eastern region, is not conscious about the hazards of air pollution. Two-stroke autos, which have been painted green to fool the authorities, continue to ply merrily through the heart of the city. With the assembly elections approaching, one hopes that steps for improving the ecological status of Calcutta will be taken at least for the time being.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Chatterjee, Calcutta

                          
	Worn out          
	Sir  The idea of a dress code in temples, as the one imposed in the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam, contravenes the principle of democracy, freedom of expression and tolerance  some of these ideas are also present in many religious doctrines. The temple authorities decision prohibiting visitors from wearing fashionable western clothes is arbitrary (Dressing down, June 8). Tirumala has a chequered history spanning over a thousand years. Even though people from all over the world have flocked to this place, there has been no problem with regard to dress among devotees in the past. The decision needs to be reviewed.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Saroj Upadhyay, Calcutta

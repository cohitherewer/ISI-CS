	General Stanley McChrystal deserved to be fired as the US commander in Afghanistan because he and his staff were openly contemptuous of their civilian superiors. Its a popular attitude among the dimmer sort of military officers, but for a theatre commander to tolerate and even encourage it among his own senior officers and advisers is reckless and stupid. Such a man is not fit for command.        
	But why was McChrystal in a state of perpetual rage against President Obama, Vice-President Biden, the US ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, and practically every other civilian authority he had contact with? Could it be because they dont really believe that the United States of America can win a decisive military victory in Afghanistan?        
	Eikenberry almost certainly doesnt. Late last year, when McChrystal was pressing for more US troops to be sent to Afghanistan, the ambassador wrote to the White House (in a cable later leaked to The New York Times) saying that, Sending additional forces will... make it difficult ... to bring our people home on a reasonable timetable.        
	McChrystals proposed counterinsurgency strategy assumes an Afghan political leadership that is both able to take responsibility and to exert sovereignty in the furtherance of our goal, Eikenberry wrote. [Afghan president Hamid Karzai] and much of his circle do not want the US to leave and are only too happy to see us invest further. They assume we covet their territory for a never-ending war on terror and for military bases to use against surrounding powers. So dont send any more US troops, he concluded.        
	Biden has also publicly supported Obamas target of beginning the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in July 2011. McChrystal, like any general who believes his task is to win the war, saw that deadline as a terrible mistake.                
	In good time        
	Senator John McCain, still the senior statesman in the grown-up wing of the Republican Party, shares McChrystals view on this. We cant tell the enemy when were leaving, said McCain  because if they know when were leaving, theyll just wait for us to go. No doubt General David Petraeus, who has been pulled out of his (more senior) job to replace McChrystal, thinks the same.        
	But what if Obama, Biden and Eikenberry really think that the war in Afghanistan is unwinnable, and that it isnt important for the US to win it anyway? What if they privately hope that the July 2011 date for the start of the withdrawal will persuade the Taliban to hold back for the next year, which would make it look like the US was winning the war? No matter who is running Afghanistan two or three years later  and it wouldnt necessarily be the Taliban  its highly unlikely that hordes of Afghans would follow the Americans home and blow them up.        
	If Obama and his friends understand this, then they will have realized that the best way to end the Afghan war is simply (as they used to say about Vietnam) to declare a victory and leave. But they cannot say this out loud in the US where most believe that the war on terror must be won in the hills of Afghanistan.        
	It would take more time and political capital than Obama has to persuade the US public that this is arrant nonsense (though it is). So if he wants to extract American troops from an unwinnable and unnecessary war, then he is condemned to do so by subterfuge. He must engineer an apparent but temporary military success in Afghanistan, do a quick hand-over to Karzai and Co. and get out while the goings good. But if thats what Obamas up to, then its understandable that McChrystal was deeply frustrated (though that doesnt excuse his behaviour). Petraeus will be equally frustrated.

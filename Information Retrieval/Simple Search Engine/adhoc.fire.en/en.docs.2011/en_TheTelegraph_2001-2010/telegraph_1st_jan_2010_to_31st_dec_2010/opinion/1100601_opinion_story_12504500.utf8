The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time to clean the House
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME TO CLEAN THE HOUSE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	We have come to a point where the government of India has become much like a porous sponge, which absorbs corruption and illegitimate practices with ease and rejects honesty and morality, the kind of values we were brought up with by our god-fearing mothers and grandmothers, who relentlessly tried to live by the established codes of conduct rooted in integrity of purpose and action. Whether it is the shenanigans of A. Raja or other ministers who are necessary fixtures in the cabinet regardless of their gross malpractices, or the constant demands made by some of the most senior and influential bureaucrats, operating on behalf of businessmen and corporates, to break the statutory environmental laws of the land to promote illegal coal-mining et al, all forms of illegalities confound India even though the leaders are mandated to do just the opposite. The sadness of our plight as a people is overwhelming.        
	One wishes that the prime minister would make a point about this horror that has engulfed us, accept the resignation of ministers perceived to be breaking the established norms, and keep them out of the cabinet till they are proven not guilty. Ordinary citizens are compelled, under strange colonial laws that rule liberated Bharat, to prove themselves not guilty in the national courts in almost all cases that are lodged against them. Therefore, why should politicians and administrators have a different set of parameters that apply to them alone? Are they Indian citizens or not? Or are their wrongs being consciously protected against all tenets of law and civil society?                
	Harsh lessons        
	The prime minister had threatened to resign if there was no support from his party vis--vis the nuclear deal. In this case too, Manmohan Singh needs to lay down his operating manual and share it with India. If there are coalition partners who do not fit into the value- based parameters of governance that demand integrity and complete transparency, the time has come for the prime minister to address the nation and engage with the people, telling them that India is being subjected to the worst kind of corruption and blackmail and, therefore, certain sacrifices will have to be made to trigger a cleansing for the future.        
	Coalition cannot be the excuse trotted out for unmitigated corruption. To give up ones values to remain in power and preside over wrongs sends a signal to the people of India that the State endorses the breaking of the laws and other wrongdoings.         
	Old and doddering minds, full of dull ideas and solutions, both on the domestic and international fronts, need to be replaced for India to grow and regain its moral ground. We have no business to attend international meetings on climate change when the highest authorities are pushing for desertification, all because of some business gain that is defined as growth and development.The ruling coalition is plain lucky that the Opposition is in complete and utter disarray, trying to regroup and rebuild. Instead of establishing a blueprint for the future, the incumbent dispensation is destroying its mandate.         
	Ours are truly fake austerity drives when compared to those in Britain. David Cameron has got rid of all the paraphernalia, perks and frills that precede and then envelop pompous, ineffective leaders. Indian politicians need to cease enjoying perks and learn some real-world lessons from the British who are more democratic today.         
	It is shameful that our civilization is being severely assaulted by our own circa 2010. Our leaders have set all the wrong standards for Indians to follow. This is the reason why India resembles a sponge that soaks in all the corruption.

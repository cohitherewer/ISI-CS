The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From accumulation to apathy
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        From accumulation to apathy                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                          Laxman Aelay, Untitled, acrylic on canvas                                        
	A gallery is usually a room where works of art are displayed. However, not any room with a few random paintings thrown into it is entitled to call itself a gallery.        
	It is ironic that in spite of having a number of fine works on its current show, Hyderabad Hues (till June 19), the Masters Collection Art Gallery falls pitifully short of justifying its rather ostentatious name. At best, it could be described as a storeroom, not even a proper art shop, where works by some of the best-known artists from south India have been dumped with evident disrespect. The works have been hung haphazardly on whatever space is available on the walls  some are even placed on stools  with no concern for basic curatorial courtesies. The lighting is erratic and whimsical. Quantity not quality, and certainly not the comfort of the viewer, appear to be the guiding principle of this gallery. One is bound to come away from this show stirred by the art but also badly shaken by the obvious apathy with which it has been treated.        
	Yet this show could have been a significant one, since many of the artists featured in it are highly acclaimed though not seen too often in Calcutta. For instance, Laxman Aelays untitled group portraits against a tomato red background are striking for their skilled draftsmanship. There are strong resonances of Thota Vaikuntams now all-too-familiar depictions of the Telangana people, who are also on display here, albeit wrapped in cellophane and resting on a footstool close to the floor level. Sreekanth Kurvas designer cows, often gaudily colourful, are a routine affair. K. Srinivasa Charis tempera, with echoes of Ganesh Pynes signature style, looks like a photocopy of one of his own earlier works.        
	Among the figurative artists, one is also struck by the technical elegance of Tailor Srinivas, who experiments with startling chromatic effects by manipulating acrylic on canvas. It feels as if one is looking at blown-up photographic negatives, on which ghostly figures struggle to come to life. Ramesh Gorjalas mythic characters are surrounded by a profusion of figures that owe their origins to traditional temple architecture. These are accomplished works and pleasing to behold, although quite devoid of any individual spark. Fawad Tamkanat, Chippa Sudhakar and Sanjay Asthaputre incline towards more modernist idioms. Cubist cityscapes, fragmented motifs and fauvist faces lead to arresting arrangements, though, once again, not very original ones.        
	Jagdish Chintalas acrylic landscapes are made vivid by the trees cut out of paper and pasted on the canvas to give the impression of relief. Surya Prakash, the other painter focusing on nature, is unmistakably predictable with his pointillist idiom. Sachin Jaltares mixed-media work, showing two faces in close proximity, seems to be dissolving into oblivion. Its smoky hues are in stark contrast with the precise contours of Farhad Tamkanats female figures captured as if in the middle of whispered confidences. Both sets of work depend on a certain inner drama for their intrinsic appeal.        
	The most intriguing work might have been the drawing by K. Laxma Goud had it actually been on display. Unfortunately, though described as a rare museum collection, this pencil sketch on paper, showing a headless woman standing by a goat in the middle of what looks like a wilderness, is printed only in the catalogue. Such a bizarre situation was perhaps not unwarranted. Not many self-respecting artists would allow the fruits of their labour to be treated in a slipshod way by their gallerists.

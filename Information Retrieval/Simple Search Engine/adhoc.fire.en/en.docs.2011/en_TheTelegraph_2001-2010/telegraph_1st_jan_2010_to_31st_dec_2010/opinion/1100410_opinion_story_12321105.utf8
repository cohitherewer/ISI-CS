Douglas, Incommensurable Presence, mixed media on paper				                                       
	Lyrical and lambent in steely grey, touched by a hint of gold, the work of C. Douglas stands out among the four artists from South India currently showing at Galerie 88 (The Metaphor and Beyond, until today). Except for K. Muralidharan, the other three  C. Douglas, P. Gopinath and S. Nandagopal  are part of the famous Cholamandal artists village founded by K.C.S. Paniker. Although each of the participants bears the mark of a distinct sensibility, the influence of indigenous styles and cadences is also palpable.        
	It is evident that all four of them are united in the belief that expert draughtsmanship forms the basis of any meaningful artistic endeavour. Even Nandagopal, whose forte is the sculpture, is guided by drawing in his search for precision and clarity. The severe-looking figures he creates in copper plated with silver look menacing and mechanical. Often ending in spikes and wheels, they defamiliarize established myths and legends. So, Bhismas final moments on the bed of arrows, Krishna taming the fearsome serpent or Jatayu attacking Ravana take on a unique aspect.        
	Muralidharan is a wanderer into a world of dreams and illusions, teeming, again, with gods and goddesses. The interlacing of motifs, miniature bestiaries, and a medley of oversized human and animal forms seduces the viewer to seek out the subtle dramas that are played out simultaneously on his canvases. And in spite of the riotous colours, much of what happens in this topsy-turvy land is dark and sinister, even pestilential. In Kinnara II, for instance, the foreground is taken over by the blackened form of a woman joined with what appears to be part-beetle, part-crow.        
	Colours play a crucial role in Gopinaths work as well. Though mostly in the abstract mode, these images often veer towards half-realized forms. A few bird- and corpse-like forms, suggested by their contours and shorn of every other detail, come up now and then. But the contrast between dull and intense colours tends to be jarring, as the thematic vagueness loses its appeal rather quickly.        
	Murky and melancholic, the inscapes of C. Douglas are inhabited by deaths heads, butterflies, clockwork birds and tumbling torsos (one can discern faint echoes of Atul Dodiya). Washed over by a pallid gloom, broken words and phrases keep recurring in these mixed media works. The dusky elegance and tortured texture of Douglass work are reminiscent of Ganesh Pynes tempera.        
	The sense of fragility, of things falling apart, that pervades Douglass vision is also intrinsic to his favourite medium, paper. Unlike the sturdiness of canvas, paper has impermanence writ all over. The frayed edges of the exquisite small-format works, particularly the one with a skull staring out of a window, carry the suggestion further, on to another chilling plane of mutability.

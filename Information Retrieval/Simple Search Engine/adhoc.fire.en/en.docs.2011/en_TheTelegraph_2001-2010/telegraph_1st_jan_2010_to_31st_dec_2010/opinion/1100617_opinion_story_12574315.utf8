The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Too much control
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TOO MUCH CONTROL                          - There is no reason to hold back the Henderson Brooks report        Srinath Raghavan                                                  
	Responding to a question in Parliament, the defence minister, A.K. Antony, recently reaffirmed the governments stance on the Henderson Brooks report. The report was the outcome of an army inquiry held in 1963 into the military debacle against China the previous year. The defence minister claimed that the report could not be declassified, for its contents are not only extremely sensitive but are of current operational value. Antonys statement was entirely in keeping with the refusal of successive governments to make public the contents of the report. In an egregious ruling issued last year, the Central Information Commission held that no part of the report might at this stage be disclosed under the provisions of the Right to Information Act.         
	This refusal to unwrap the shroud of secrecy is justified on seemingly reasonable but wholly untenable grounds. In its submission to the CIC, the army headquarters contended that reports of internal inquiries are not even submitted to the Government, never mind declassification for public consumption. Furthermore, declassification of the report would be tantamount to disclosure of the armys operational strategy in the North-East. Finally, the contents of the report had a direct bearing on the question of demarcating the line of actual control with China. The CIC agreed after inspecting the report that declassifying it would seriously compromise Indias security and its relationship with China. Would it?        
	For a start, the claim that the findings of a military inquiry are not forwarded to the government is jejune. The Indian military is very much answerable to the political leadership. The government can requisition any such report. Indeed, the Henderson Brooks report was forwarded by the army chief to the defence minister in July 1963, who in turn sent it to the prime minister.               
	The key operational findings of the report have been well known for the last four decades. Neville Maxwells book, Indias China War (published in 1970), tore a gaping hole through the wall of official secrecy. Maxwell was able to access the main body of the report running into 222 pages. In an article published in the Economic and Political Weekly in 2001, he confirmed as much. The operational aspects of the 1962 war have also been discussed threadbare in a host of memoirs and historical studies. Most importantly, the official history of the war commissioned by the ministry of defence draws on the Henderson Brooks report and has been available on the internet for some years now. So much for the secrecy of the armys operational strategy.         
	To be sure, it may be inadvisable to reveal some of the details of tactical deployment. But the government could have adopted a more forthcoming stance. For one thing, it could have released those portions of the report whose contents are already public knowledge. For another, it could have redacted sensitive details and declassified the report  a procedure routinely followed in many Western democracies.         
	The argument about the reports relevance to the demarcation of the LAC is equally specious. The LAC is supposed to divide the areas that have been under Indian and Chinese control since the end of the 1962 war. It was not, however, mutually agreed upon by the two sides. In the Arunachal Pradesh sector, both India and China claim that the LAC follows the McMahon Line. The problem is that since 1959, India and China have differed on just where the McMahon Line actually runs. There are grey areas, which lie north of the McMahon Line as marked in the original treaty maps of 1914, but are actually south of the highest watershed. Indias position  which China does not accept  is that the line was intended to run along the highest range of mountains dividing Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh, and, despite discrepancies, the boundary had to be accordingly interpreted.         
	The fact that prior to 1962 there was discussion on the Indian side of this aspect of the McMahon Line is rather well documented. It is also known that the Indian government decided unilaterally to give effect to its understanding of the line. Jawaharlal Nehru revealed this in Parliament as far back as late 1959. It is not clear how declassification of the Henderson Brooks report can complicate current diplomatic efforts. Whats more, China has made it amply clear over the last many years that it is not interested in demarcating the LAC. It feels that such a step would be prejudicial to its avowed territorial claims and negotiating positions.         
	Declassifying the Henderson Brooks report, then, can hardly impair Indias security or its foreign relations. For the historian, the chief interest of the report is not so much in what it may tell us about the war as in what it reveals about the impact of the war on the Indian security establishment.        
	In the aftermath of the war, the political leadership was vociferously criticized by the Opposition, press and public opinion. In response, the government instituted an inquiry into the armys operational performance. On instructions from the defence minister, the army chief appointed a two-member operations review committee comprising Lieutenant-General Henderson Brooks and Brigadier Prem Singh Bhagat. The inquiry was far from perfect. The committee was unable to access documents from the ministry of defence or the foreign office. Its hearings were unsystematic; key military players like the chief of general staff and IV Corps commander, Lieutenant General B.M. Kaul, were not invited for questioning.         
	The committees approach and findings reflected the dominant view in the military regarding the reasons for the debacle. Among other things, the report told an admonitory tale of meddlesome politicians, a timorous military, and the ensuing but avoidable catastrophe. Determined to trespass beyond its remit, the report concluded that the higher direction of the war was out of touch with reality. This was, it bears emphasizing, a judgment passed by two not-so-senior military officers on the elected political leadership of the country.         
	This narrative, at best radically incomplete and at worst downright false, was congenial to the military and soon became a morality pageant. The central lesson drawn from it was the importance of standing up to politicians who intruded in professional matters. In the loss of nerve induced by the war, civilians too came to believe that the military must be given a free hand. So, following the defeat against China, a convention was established whereby the civilian leadership restricted itself to giving overall directives, leaving operational matters to the military. As the then defence secretary later observed, In the view of the public outcry since the 1962 debacle about the relative role of politicians and the Services and their chiefs, the military leadership was given a long rope. This institutional pattern of civil-military interaction persists to date and has served us ill.               
	The governments stonewalling over the Henderson Brooks report, however, is merely a specific instance of a wider problem: the absence of a system in which the 30-year norm for declassification is scrupulously followed by the ministries. The claim that documents pertaining to a live issue cannot be declassified simply does not wash. The American and British governments have released hundreds of important documents pertaining to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even Israel has followed the 30-year norm for declassification and has opened up records pertaining to past conflicts that have a direct bearing on contemporary issues: the expulsion of Palestinians during the 1948 war, for instance.         
	Robust and well-informed debates on contemporary history are crucial in a democratic system. Unlike States that are self-consciously ideological or religious, democracies do not have the luxury of falling back on abstract principles or systems to guide their behaviour. They can only scrutinize their own history for illumination if not instruction. The greatest strength of a democracy is its capacity for self-correction. But this hinges on its ability both to come to terms with its past and to understand how the present was shaped. Calcified notions of State secrecy should not be allowed to vitiate this vital task of self-understanding.

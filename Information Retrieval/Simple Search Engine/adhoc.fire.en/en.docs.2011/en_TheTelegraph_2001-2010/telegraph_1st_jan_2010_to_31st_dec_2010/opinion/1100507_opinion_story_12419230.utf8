	It is a tricky issue, and the Supreme Court has taken its stand on principle. It has said that suspects cannot be forced to take lie detector tests, or be given the truth serum in narco-analysis, or be made to sit for brain-mapping against their will. The violation of mental privacy is cruel, inhuman and degrading and goes against Article 20(3) of the Constitution or the right to silence. Given the horror of present-day crimes and the threats to security, the temptation to get into the mind of a suspect by fiddling with the brain is almost overwhelming. In India these tests became noticeably regular after Godhra, although most developed countries have either outlawed their open use or are questioning their application. But they remain investigative tools in any case; the results are inadmissible as evidence. The Supreme Court has said that such tests can be used with the subjects consent, and are to be administered by an independent agency under certain strict conditions of surveillance. Again, the results would not be evidence, but could be used with other evidence to build up the case.        
	By banning involuntary tests, the court has tried to prevent certain ills. It has prohibited coercive testing even in the most terrible cases, saying that once the police have this power there would be no way to limit its use. The court has dismissed the argument that these more peaceful methods could replace the notorious third degree techniques; one impropriety cannot be allowed to replace another, it has said. The court is unquestionably right in ideal and principle, yet it has to be asked whether a subject may not be made to consent by third degree methods. Investigation and the production of evidence are carried on in the murky realm where the covert or overt violence of the law-enforcer meets the active or passive violence of the law-breaker. It is as important to impose principles here as it is difficult to make them workable. Even voluntary testing is slippery ground, for it can lead to self-incrimination. Would the subjects willingness neutralize Article 20(3)? Questions also arise because many scientists have shown that all three tests may yield false or misleading answers. Narco-analysis could also endanger health. But none of this takes away from the value of the Supreme Courts ruling, for it prohibits the use of coercion and upholds the individuals right to choose.

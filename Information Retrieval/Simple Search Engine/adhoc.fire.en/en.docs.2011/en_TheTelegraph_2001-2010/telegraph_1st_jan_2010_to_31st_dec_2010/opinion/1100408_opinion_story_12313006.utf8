The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a clean world
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A CLEAN WORLD                                                    
	Barack Obama has set out to realize his vision of a nuclear-weapon-free world with a strange caveat. In the recently released Nuclear Posture Review, the president of the United States of America declared that his country will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states that comply with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty  even if the US were to face a biological or chemical attack. To Iran and North Korea, both of which pulled out of the NPT in 2003, this statement may sound like a veiled threat. And although the US has no reason to fear bio-terrorism from India, Pakistan or Israel  nations that have refused to sign the NPT  the barb is also directed at them, however gently. Yet to become a signatory to the comprehensive test ban treaty, the US itself is in no position to ride a moral high horse. Mr Obama is acutely aware of the moral quandary that his nation finds itself in, and has promised to pursue the US ratification of the CTBT aggressively. But first, he will have to deal with the Republicans, who, already badly stung by his healthcare bill, are now furious by his reversal of George W. Bushs hawkish nuclear policy.        
	There is no reason, however, to hail Mr Obamas strategy as either radical or exemplary. The NPR is a canny document: it struggles to factor in exceptional circumstances and leave a leeway for a possible nuclear retaliation. It is a measure of Mr Obamas progressive thinking that he has woven into his idealism a degree of uncertainty. Last year, speaking in Prague, Mr Obama sounded optimistic about a nuclear-free world; but he did acknowledge that this goal will not be reached quickly  perhaps not in my lifetime. Although the modern world has recognized, at a deadly cost, the dangers of nuclear technology, it has also reaped immense advantages from its constructive potentials. Developing nations like India (which has entered into a civilian nuclear deal with the US) are realizing the importance of becoming nuclear-capable states. In a world of fast-depleting resources, the importance of harnessing nuclear power for peaceful purposes cannot be emphasized enough. At the same time, these supposedly civilian nuclear enrichment programmes can become vulnerable to clandestine missions of terrorists operating out of countries like Pakistan or Syria, and actively supported by strongly anti-US nations like North Korea.

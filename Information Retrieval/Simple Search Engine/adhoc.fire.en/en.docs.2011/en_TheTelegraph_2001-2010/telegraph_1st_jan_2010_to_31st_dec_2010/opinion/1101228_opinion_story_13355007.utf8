                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MAKE A CLEAN BREAK                                  Malvika Singh                              
	As rich and powerful scamsters get away, thanks to long-winded interrogations and delayed justice, protected by the system and its employees who vow to ensure justice for all but do just the opposite, non-government workers and committed social entrepreneurs, who work for the poor, neglected and disempowered, get sentenced to life imprisonment for speaking the truth. That is India at the end of 2010. Gandhiji too, in his time, was treated in a similar fashion by the then rulers of India, for working with the poor, and mobilizing Indians to fight for their rights and the truth. When the baton was passed, there was one generation of bureaucrats committed to building an India entrenched in the fundamentals laid down in the Constitution. It was a challenge, but they were deeply committed to building a modern nation-state.        
	Sadly, post-1950s, this country saw the beginnings of governance with greed. The authorities began to behave like the colonial masters of yore, forgetting that authoritarian and dictatorial stances eventually culminate in a revolt against an insular State, disconnected from its subjects needs. This feudal attitude nurtured nepotism and rapidly corrupted the Central, state and local administrations. With the declaration of the Emergency in 1975, for all the wrong reasons, corruption got legitimized, and when Emergency was lifted, the incoming political dispensation, a conglomerate of parties, did not dismantle the irregularities but, instead, perpetuated the horror that came to stay. We are paying a heavy price today for the failure, back then, to ensure an immediate corrective.                
	Party power        
	Leaders of all hues wallowed in the temporary luxury of supreme power without accountability and misused the patience of an exploited citizenry. The babus jumped onto the bandwagon and forgot that their mandate was to be completely non-partisan. India began to stumble as its rulers built their fortunes. It has been the classic case of watching the Empire in decline and we are now witnessing its possibly violent end. Short-term measures to assuage the anger of the people, as they witness deep-seated corruption among the high and the mighty, are mere veils that Indian citizens can see through. As there is no access to the rule of law for ordinary, honest citizens, the revolt across the land is growing.        
	The system has excelled at corruption and all its myriad delivery channels. Since the babu and the politician understand the prevailing system well, and have learned to operate it with deft efficiency, they need to replace greed and graft with honesty and integrity for a start. Who will lead this revolution? Who will break the vested interest lobby that has held India to ransom? Is there a Gandhi out there who will selflessly lead the renewal, even if the present authorities term the corrective measures sedition? Will we be fortunate to have a leader who will rule with the right priorities for the citizens? Does the elected government have the guts (there is no other word for it) to overhaul the existing configuration and replace the manipulative men and women with people who operate with good sense, intelligent applications of policy, and are capable of listening carefully? Policies clearly established within the democratic framework enshrined in our Constitution must not be subverted by intellectually, morally and emotionally weak people at the helm of governance.        
	The best New Year gift to India would be a definite overhaul of the council of ministers at the Centre that may bring about a renewal of the office bearers of the All India Congress Committee. This is the time to revert the partys state secretaries back to live in the states and restore credibility across India. For these men and women to call the shots from Delhi is detrimental to the rejuvenation of the party.

	Secrecy has magical properties. When WikiLeaks released the Afghan War Logs into the public domain, it managed to dent a certain impenetrability that surrounds the US military and its operations. Although the reports largely substantiated what everyone was already aware of, there was renewed anger about a pointless war. There was also that slightly salacious thrill of reading something classified, something forbidden. All this had not been reported, it was leaked.        
	Thousands of classified military reports were now laid before the public gaze, each report identified with a code. In each, details of the operation are barked out in military-speak. The nature of the operation could be enemy action, friendly action or non-combat event. People are KIA (killed in action) or WIA (wounded in action). The casualties are friendly, host nation, civilian or enemy. The words sting with authenticity. This is no well-crafted news report. This is unmediated raw material reaching thousands all over the world. Here, at last, was an organ of the State, shorn of all secrecy. And WikiLeaks had caught it in a compromising position.        
	Like Bentham, those involved with WikiLeaks seem to believe that the State keeps secrets for its own sinister purposes. There is, of course, a strong argument for greater transparency, for information to be circulated and discussed. The freedom of information is a right recognized by international law. But the law also recognizes the right to privacy and the need to classify information in the interests of national security. The US government has blustered about the threat to security and the fate of Afghan informers named in the leaked files was cited in the argument against WikiLeaks. But no condition of accountability applies to those who work for WikiLeaks. Unlike journalists in mainstream media houses, most contributors work anonymously. Apparently, even WikiLeaks is not aware of their identities.        
	One is faced with a shadow army of vigilantes who gather material, often through questionable means, and make them public, no matter what the consequences. In many ways, WikiLeaks lacks transparency as much as the governments it exposes. It deals not so much in information as in secrets. The leaks are not only about what one does not know but also what, governments and authorities have decided, one is not supposed to know. Operating on the razor-edge of legality, WikiLeaks has continually questioned these boundaries. Yet this subversive source of information has been increasingly legitimized. The warlogs were given to mainstream newspapers, which verified the data before publishing it. The leaks have also acquired a legitimizing power. They give us names, dates and numbers, establishing rumours as facts. The US government has been forced to acknowledge that it is aware of these facts; this acknowledgment will entail massive changes in war policy.        
	Secrets, if used well, can become powerful weapons.																								       Ipsita Chakravarty

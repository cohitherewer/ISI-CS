The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Not exempt from controversy
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT EXEMPT FROM CONTROVERSY                                  The government must ensure that importers do not exploit the Commonwealth Games duty waiver to reap unjust profit, writes Abhijit Bhattacharyya                          Hidden truth                                  
	As a tax-paying Indian citizen, I was concerned by a report in the media which stated that the finance ministry has extended duty waiver to all CWG (Commonwealth Games) importers. The government, according to Section 25 of the Customs Act 1962, has the power to grant exemption from duty. Yet, given the murky situation in which the CWG finds itself at present, doubts remain about the real motive behind this decision.        
	In fact, Section 25(1) of the Customs Act stipulates that if the Central government were to be satisfied that it is necessary to grant exemptions in the public interest, it may do so by notification in the official gazette. The exemptions may be either absolute or subject to such conditions (to be fulfilled before or after clearance) as may be specified in the notification. Exemptions can be of two types: long-term  for ongoing things like military/defence/health sector and so on. On the other hand, short-term exemptions are given by special order in each case exempt from the payment of duty, under circumstances of an exceptional nature. However, the question is that with just a few days to go before the Games, why did the government decide to issue the notification recently? What kind of things need to be imported now? By whom and which type of importers? One sincerely hopes that the ministry of finance will not have to conduct a post-mortem to sort out the mess created by overzealous sports administrators. Significantly, the ministry has been criticized for changing its earlier stand in which it had decided to deny exemptions to importers.              
	Reportedly, the ministry of finance (department of revenue) decided to re-examine its decision after the ministry of youth affairs and sports made a strong pitch to extend such a benefit to the vendors. Why didnt the ministry of youth affairs and sports press for such a demand earlier? Who are these vendors? What are their names? What are they importing, or have imported? What are the description, quantity and the total value of their imports? What is the country of origin of the imported goods?Were these imports necessary?         
	The media report quotes a finance ministry official, and states that the Sports Ministry has asked for Customs duty exemption to suppliers, contractors and vendors importing goods for the Games. They said both the Organising Committee and these vendors were importing for the same purpose and, thus, should get similar exemption. The Revenue Department is positively considering their demand. It is a hilarious situation. Multiple importers already exist, importing goods for the same purpose. Why did the government succumb to the pressure tactic adopted by importers and sports officials?        
	Some critical questions remain unanswered.What is to be exempted and why? Who is to certify that the imported goods deserve to be exempted? Who will get the goods cleared from the various customs stations? The time-tested procedure that was followed during the Asian Games in 1982 could have been adopted. On that occasion, the ministry of finance had issued a notification well in advance which declared that goods imported for the actual use and conduct of the games under Section 25 of the Customs Act would be exempt. In other words, this was an event-specific exemption notification to forego revenue that belonged to the State.         
	Revenue, being public money, requires careful handling. Hence, a certification of the end use of the duty-free goods is the most important and critical aspect of the procedure. In 1982, a designated under-secretary, who was on deputation from the customs department to the special organizing committee secretariat, was the sole authority to certify all imports pertaining to the Games. The main scoreboard of the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium, tracksuits, jerseys, sports equipment, timing devices and the Astro Turf  everything was certified by the said under-secretary.        
	Unlike the CWG, the Asian Games were not held in one city. The event was spread across three venues; Delhi, Jaipur/Ramgarh lake (for rowing) and Mumbai (for yachting/sailing). It was a daunting task that required flawless coordination. The organizing committee had to certify the duty exemption document of the goods. Unlike the present occasion, the dubious demand of importers, vendors or suppliers of claiming financial benefit was not met.        
	As of now, the needle of suspicion points towards a strategy of forcing lucrative fast-moving consumer goods on an unsuspecting market on the eve of the Games. It is highly unlikely that stadium equipment, lighting devices, arena gadgets, sports gear and so on would arrive so late in the day, denying players, organizers and officials the opportunity to test these before the start of the event.        
	The government must also ensure that the liberal act of foregoing public money is not exploited by unscrupulous and greedy importers to garner profit, thereby dragging the State machinery into new controversies after the completion of the event. The Indian legal system and the various acts and regulations under it are well-meaning and comprehensive on paper. The traditional weakness has been in their implementation. More often than not, major irregularities and the consequential loss of revenue have surfaced over the years.              
	The CWG is already embroiled in major controversies and serious allegations. The ideal way to make use of the exemption notification would be to make it transparent in nature. A full list of inventories of the types of goods that are lying at the various ports/airports of India could have been prepared. A cut-off date for all imported material should also be announced and the inventories approved by a designated senior official of the organizing committee, as was the case in 1982. A copy of the clearance certificate should also be sent to all the officials, departments and ministries connected to the Games. This will ensure the sharing of critical information, bring about a notion of collective responsibility and generate coordinated action.         
	All imported goods should be earmarked for actual organization, use and conduct of the games. The actual user should be the organizing committee and not the individual vendor, supplier or importer. By undertaking these measures, the government can reduce the possibility of future embarrassment and safeguard itself from allegations of any wrong- doing that may be hurled at it. Indeed, Indians are sick and tired of frequently accusing and abusing those who rule them.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TAINTED SHINE                                  Naresh Kumar                              
	The cricket genie has exploded out of the bottle. It has morphed into a gigantic volcanic ash cloud, towering over the Indian cricket scene. The nation watches in disbelief as the media throw up scandals every moment. Some of the high-profile promoters and politicians involved have lowered their periscopes and slipped into deeper waters. Their eyes are fixed on the swish and aggressive Lalit Modi.        
	Thrashing about in the shallow waters and threatening to reveal all, Modi is now on the run, seeking advice from Indias best lawyers. The BCCI committee has suspended Modi. It will be a surprise if Modi can survive the charges. Few will dispute the fact that Modi, in spite of his alleged indiscretions, is the brightest visionary and the best organizer and promoter in the history of Indian sport. Modi has piloted IPL 3 into space with a value of four billion dollars. It is now poised for a launch as IPL 4 to challenge the nine-billion-dollar basketball league in America. Till now, the IPL committee and the BCCI bosses had sat blinded by the headlights of the whirling cash machine moving at sonic speed. They were mesmerized by the figures and the tectonic impact of IPL3, which, apart from bringing down a cabinet minister, has created a furore in Parliament.         
	The meteoric rise of the Indian Premier League has changed the parameters of cricket. The reverse sweep, the switch hit, the lofty sixes and instant innovation have altered the game that was known for its classic, straight-batted carpet drives. It is exciting stuff, pushed beyond the limit by deafening music, trumpet blasts, and the roaring crowd. The pom-pom girls and the film stars take the evening past any multi-crore Bollywood extravaganza. It is fantastic stuff, which unveils the awesome power of modern sport.                 
	Heavy damage        
	The promoters are seemingly oblivious of the fact that the responsibility of sport promotion is not limited to entertainment and money-making. Sport promotion is a public responsibility and has the power to destroy the nations image or, if handled astutely, can steer India to great heights. Modis blemished genius may have filled the coffers but it has enhanced the already tarnished image of the nation. It will take years to repair the damage. The government must step in, put stringent laws in place and mete out punishment to ensure financial transparency.         
	The other, equally important, factor is to ensure proper behaviour among the players during and after matches. Sporting behaviour will rub off on the millions of starry-eyed youngsters glued to the television sets. The image and culture of a nation are reflected in the behaviour of the players and of the crowds. Exposure to sport on television has made it one of the dominant forces, which project the image of society, culture and character. Far more important is the impact it has on the youth. Reports of night-long parties featuring models have left many people shattered. The players, who are paid millions, are supposed to do their best on the field. Partying late in the night, followed by travel on the next day, is not the ideal way to prepare for a match 24 hours later.         
	The players are forced to indulge in this kind of behaviour because of the team sponsors and promoters. What an example to set for the youngsters! The owners of the teams must draw a line when it comes to doing anything for the sake of earning money. Their attitude is similar to that of the television monsters who are now shoving in advertisements even during overs. This is indeed a matter of great shame. The headlong pursuit of money will take us over the cliff and destroy our culture and society.         
	The government must ensure that sports promoters toe the line not only to protect the nations global image but also to fire the youth to ride the high tide of Indias spectacular economic growth.

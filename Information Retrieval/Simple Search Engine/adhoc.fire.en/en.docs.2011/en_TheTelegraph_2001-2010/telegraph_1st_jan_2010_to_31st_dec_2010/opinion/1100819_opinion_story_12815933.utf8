	The war within                  
	Sir  The prime ministers address to the people of Kashmir was earnest and sincere. But from another angle, it might appear to have been meant for those in the valley whose intention is to break away from the Indian polity (Voice over, Aug 12). Manmohan Singh talked of reaching out to the Kashmiri youth who have been the victims of violence for many years. But most of these young men have, under the influence of secessionist forces, denounced the Indian State. Kashmirs problem is not just under-development and lack of opportunities. It is, more importantly, the separatist tendency in the people that has been openly induced and supported by Pakistan.          
	Even if adequate education and employment opportunities are made available to the Kashmiris, the jihad against the Indian State would continue in Kashmir. It cannot be denied that better prospects of learning and getting jobs would encourage the majority of Kashmiris to join the mainstream. Yet it is also true that their secessionist tendencies would not fade away soon. Hence Indian leaders need to deal with Kashmir firmly.          
	The prime minister has put a lot of stress on the sentiments of the Kashmiri people. But he did not speak of the people belonging to the minority groups in Kashmir  for example, the Pandits  who were driven out of the region by violent extremists, and who now live as refugees in their own country, far away from their homes. Any measure to improve the situation in Kashmir would be incomplete if it does not consider the welfare of the minorities there who have been victims of continuing hostilities.          
	The argument in favour of granting autonomy to Kashmir is absurd. The clauses under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution offer enough liberty to the region already. Presenting Kashmir with complete autonomy on a platter in order to pacify the separatists would only serve to show up the weaknesses of the Indian State.          
	One also fears that granting autonomy to Kashmir will result in the state trying to merge with Pakistan. There is no reason to give a special status to Kashmir. After all, it is just another constituent of the Indian Union like any other state. The Indian government should firmly dismiss the supercilious demands of the separatists. They should be treated like any other secessionist force engaged in a futile struggle against the State.          
	The editorial ends with a pertinent question: How will the granting of autonomy to Kashmir look from the northeast of India, a region with as tortured a history as that of the valley? There are people and groups with crises of identity craving to break away from the mainstream not only in the Northeast but also in various other parts of the country. These people must not be encouraged in any way if the integrity of the State is to be protected.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The editorial, Voice over, has rightly highlighted certain unpleasant truths about Kashmir. When a part of the human body gets afflicted with disease, it must be cut off in order to save the rest of the body. The same applies for Kashmir. At this point, the only solution to the Kashmir issue seems to lie in redrawing the Indian borders and setting the state free. India should have nothing to do with that state any more.          
	There is a rationale behind this argument. Indian leaders have never allowed Kashmir to fully integrate with the rest of the nation by imposing Article 370 in the valley. Jawaharlal Nehru, with his lopsided ideas, drew a dividing line between the high-caste Kashmiri and the lowly Hindustani. As a result, Kashmiris have seldom considered themselves Indians. Kashmir became a country within a country. Today, the valley has turned into a source of one of Indias biggest internal security threats. What do we gain by accepting Kashmir as a part of India other than a few votes?          
	In all this turmoil, Pakistan has profited the most. It has been cashing in on our political failures by instigating separatist elements in Kashmir and patronizing cross-border terrorism. Why should we let the entire nation suffer for one particular region? We should encourage only those Kashmiris who want to remain a part of India. At the same time, there is no reason to try to hold back those who do not want to stay.          
	Yours faithfully,        Jayanta Kumar Dutt, 
New York            
	Sir  The problems in the Kashmir valley can only be solved through meaningful discussions among the Central government and the people of Kashmir, as well as the political parties operating there. More interaction is needed in India between the common man and his elected representative.          
	It would have been of great help if provisions were made for the people to communicate directly with those who run the country. Unfortunately, the only time we get to interact with politicians is when they are looking for votes. Otherwise, we are kept as far apart as possible from our leaders in the name of security concerns. There should be more frequent meetings between the people and their political leaders. There must be a platform where people can openly voice their concerns.          
	The leaders of the country rarely listen to what the people have to say. The problems we face continue to be ignored till they create serious dissent among the people. This is what has happened in Kashmir. With regard to the valley, one fears that it is already too late to adopt remedial measures.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

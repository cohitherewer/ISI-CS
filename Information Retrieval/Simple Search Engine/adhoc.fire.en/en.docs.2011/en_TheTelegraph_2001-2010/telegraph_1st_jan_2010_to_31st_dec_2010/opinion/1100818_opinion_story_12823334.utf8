	Q: The registration of the sale deed of a plot of land that I had bought was executed by the additional district sub-registrar. The vendors were three brothers of whom two had given the power of attorney (POA) to execute the sale proceedings to the third. The POA was executed by a notary. Recently, I was told by the block land revenue officers office that the mutation of that plot cannot be done as a POA by a notary is not valid. Is this true? How can I get the land mutated legally?        
	Sital Prasad Arya, Ariadaha, Calcutta        
	A: A power of attorney creating an interest in any immovable property requires registration. In your case too the POA should have been registered. However, since the property has already been registered and the title has passed on to you with no one challenging the sale transaction, mutation should not be withheld solely on this ground.        
	Q:I live in a rented flat and am a blood cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy. As it is a painful treatment and I feel more comfortable in an air-conditioned atmosphere, I requested the landlady to permit me to instal a split or a window air conditioner (AC). She refused, threatened legal action and filed an FIR with the police. The latter have instructed me not to instal an air conditioner on the premises. Can I proceed legally? Is there any law that prohibits a tenant from installing appliances such as an AC?        
	P. K. Kapoor, Calcutta        
	A: A tenant is duty-bound to keep the rented premises in good condition. Installing an air conditioner would mean some damage to the walls or windows of the flat. It would also involve applying to the electricity board. Since you are not the owner of the premises, you have no option but to convince your landlady to grant you permission.         
	Q:I had booked a flat in a state government and private joint-venture project. Possession is due soon. I am worried that the registration of the flat may not be completed in my lifetime. I have made a deed that makes my wife liable to handle the property and allied matters in my absence. Will this deed be regarded as valid in case of my demise?        
	Benoy Gupta, Calcutta        
	A: If you want your wife to exclusively inherit a property that you own or may own in the future, you will have to make a will bequeathing it to her.

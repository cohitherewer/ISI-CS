	All about money                  
	Sir  It was painful to see members of Bahujan Samaj Party honour their leader with a huge garland worth lakhs, made of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the party (Moneyed glory, March 18). Kanshi Ram, the founder of the BSP, had formed the party with a view to protect the Dalits and the downtrodden. But the current members of the party appear more interested in impressing Mayavati for personal gains than working for the people. Instead of felicitating Mayavati, they should have used those notes for charity or to mark the beginning of new projects to help the poor on the foundation day of their party.           
	A few months ago, these members were collecting money from the public for a grand celebration of Mayavatis birthday. The government should take strict measures against such shameful acts so that people think twice before honouring someone.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sachin Jhunjhunwala, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is disgraceful that in spite of being the chief minister of a state and the so-called representative of Dalits, Mayavati is busy showing off her power. She has even built her own statues all over Uttar Pradesh. She is least bothered about the abject poverty in which the poor live, the struggle they have to undergo in order to survive. Mayavati exploits the sentiments of the impoverished masses by distributing food and gifts once in a blue moon. At a time when Bareilly was witnessing sectarian clashes, she kept herself busy with celebrating her partys 25th anniversary in Lucknow, where she was greeted with money garlands. By such activities, she is setting a bad example for other politicians. Mayavati seems to have forgotten that she too had once belonged to the have-nots. The Centre should order the Central Bureau of Investigation to carry out an inquiry on her. The time has come for the people of Uttar Pradesh to raise their voices against their power-hungry, corrupt and shameless chief minister.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Paromita Jana, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Greed tramples basic human scruples. The idea of presenting garlands of currency notes stands as testimony to this fact. It is even more of a scandal that despite the roar of criticism, Mayavati was garlanded with currency notes a second time. How is it that BSP workers can get away claiming that they would keep honouring their leader with such garlands? Why does it never occur to them to work towards the mitigation of the sufferings of the poor in the state, of those who are forced to skip several meals a week for want of money? Across Uttar Pradesh, there are thousands of under-nourished children, for whom going to school is a distant dream. The state badly needs leaders with large, not greedy, hearts.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Indira Gandhi did the unthinkable by declaring Emergency. She also won a major war with Pakistan to boot. J. Jayalalithaa, although out of power, still strides around like an empress among docile men, frighteningly unpredictable and vindictive. Vasundhara Raje led the top brass of the Bharatiya Janata Party through a song and dance for many months. Mamata Banerjee is proving more than a handful for the virulent red brigade, and hitting it hard in its own bastion. Sheila Dikshit is ruling Delhi with an iron hand hidden in a velvet glove. Mayavati generously props up more and more garlands that do not fool the bees, which keep stinging her opponents no end. She creates an entire police force to patrol her statues across the state and, at times, leaves the law red in the face. All this when there was not even a whiff of womens reservation. Indian men are indeed a chivalrous and daring lot to go in for a statutory 33 per cent womens quota in a political arena where there are no holds barred.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that Indian political leaders of national stature have the audacity to stoop to new lows. This is the result of ineffective governance, a malaise that is pervasive in this country and threatens to undermine its progress. It is high time the administration verified the undisclosed sources of income, and stamped out the corruption that has fostered this environment of sycophancy, black money and show of muscle power.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Lost cause          
	Sir  Why did Kanu Sanyal commit suicide in his ramshackle house in Naxalbari (Kanu Sanyal found dead, March 24)? The man who, along with Charu Majumdar and Jangal Santhal, spearheaded the peasant uprising in the high noon of 1967, the after-effect of which still reverberates among the dispossessed in the forests of Shining India, was not only a romantic but also a courageous man. Sanyal, upright man that he was, never accepted funds from the West Bengal government for his health expenses. All his life he remained committed to his cause. Charu Majumder died in Lalbazar (due to either state torture or ill health). Jangal Santhal died an abject recluse. Kanu Sanyal was still strong on the morning of his death, still agile but somewhat depressed seeing the meaningless violence of both the Maoists and the State.          
	From his latest thoughts, it appears that Sanyal may have realized in his old age that the violence which begins logically inevitably moves towards the illogical. And being honest and courageous, he did the inevitable.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Nothing new                  
	Sir  One should heartily congratulate Ashok Mitra for boldly denouncing the Indian version of Joan of Arc, Mamata Banerjee, in his article, Beyond debating points (Aug 30). But if truth be told, the political animal he has identified is but a creation of the organized Left, to which Mitra belonged. In fact, Banerjees activities till now are a perfect replica of the actions of the Left. All that the lady has done is steal the thunder from the Left and put her own stamp on it, nicely and neatly. Why then blame her for playing tricks that she has learnt from her opponents?          
	Banerjee is the cat among the pigeons  the cadres of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)  who are now running helter-skelter. Lalgarh, once a stronghold of the CPI(M), is now a lost territory. The CPI(M) had wilfully closed its eyes to the reality, and now complains that it cannot see.           
	Mitra has blamed Banerjee for throwing tantrums, which the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre has to bear, since Banerjees Trinamul Congress is the second-largest constituent of the UPA. Her tactics are ill-conceived indeed. But will Mitra recall how the Left Front too had kept the same government at the Centre on tenterhooks before withdrawing support from it? Is it fair to accuse someone of an offence that you too had committed against the same entity not so long ago? Let us look within ourselves before we blame our neighbours.          
	However, Mitra deserves praise for the sound advice he offers to the Left leaders and their greedy cadres. I fully agree with him when he says that it is never too late to try and recover precious lost ground. But, to be frank, I think that in this case at least, it is too late. Mitras hopes for the Left will remain unfulfilled, it seems.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Hashim, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The CPI(M)s faulty Lalgarh policy has been deftly reviewed by Ashok Mitra in his article. The laid-back attitude of the government was responsible for the erosion of the partys support base. Large-scale corruption in the panchayats and the haughty attitude of the Left leaders at every level had alienated the common people from the CPI(M). Banerjees Lalgarh rally was successful precisely because of the peoples mistrust of the ruling party. If the government had properly implemented the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme or the Indira Awaas Yojana, the economy of the Jangal Mahal would not have been in such a bad shape today. The rebels would not have gained ground in that case.          
	Mitra rightly advises the CPI(M) to retrieve its lost base by mobilizing thousands of dedicated cadres, full of integrity and laden with empathy for the tribal cause with humility. The party can never get back Lalgarh by radical means. If it resorts to violence in Lalgarh, it will be committing another historic blunder.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Saroj Upadhyay, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra has only imitated the CPI(M) politburo member, Sitaram Yechury, in censuring Mamata Banerjee for manipulating the Centre on the Lalgarh issue. His words are but tiresome repetitions of such utterances of CPI(M) big shots. The only new point he offers is his critique of the Left.          
	Although Mitra condemns Banerjee, he should he told that she at least had the guts to offer peace to the people of Jangal Mahal. Does Mitra want Section 144 to remain forever in place in Lalgarh? As long as the joint forces control Lalgarh, the CPI(M) cadres will get away with killing more adivasis and by putting the blame on the army.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asit Roy, Calcutta

                
	Messed up          
	Sir  Those of us who work in Sector V have to undertake a perilous journey every day. The ordeal starts once one leaves the Chingrihata flyover. Due to the recent addition of 11 speedbreakers just before the traffic signal, you will find vehicles piling up in the middle of the flyover during peak hours. To add to the mess, autorickshaws and pool cars merrily take the opposite lane to avoid the heavy traffic. The speedbreakers, which I am sure were built to check the speed of the vehicles, have turned the area into a death trap, with an accident waiting to happen any day.          
	In all this, you will never find a single policeman ready to stop the errant drivers. Homeguards, who are but local youths in florescent uniform, run the show, and drivers just do not care to follow their instructions. Once you take a right-turn from Nicco Park and enter Sector V, there is virtually no traffic management system. Vehicles are at liberty to stop anywhere and take any lane they wish.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ujjal Maitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  We, the residents of Kochpukur and Thakdari, have been suffering a lot due to the lackadaisical attitude of government officials. While the nearby New Town seems to be availing itself of all possible amenities, thanks to the presence of shopping malls and multiplexes, our area has been cursed with a lack of basic transport facilities.          
	Everybody  from school students to elderly men and women  has to walk a distance of four to five kilometres to reach the nearest bus stop. Is the transport ministry of West Bengal aware of how it has neglected our area? We insist that bus services from Howrah to Aquatica (via Sealdah), from Garia to Aquatica (via Science City), and from Dum Dum to Aquatica (via V.I.P. Road) be immediately introduced for the convenience of the residents. Not all of us can afford a car and most of us fear to be part of the crazy adventure that an autorickshaw ride tends to be.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
N. Chattoraj, Calcutta

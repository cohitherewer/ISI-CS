                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOBODY CARES A HOOT                                  Bona Fide -Malvika Singh                              
	Whether some people in the public domain, journalists and politicians, choose to admit it or not, the truth is that at least nine of the stadiums constructed or upgraded in Delhi for the Commonwealth Games are of quality and meet international standards. Unfortunately, the real problem that pulls India into the mire is the financial racketeering, infighting, back-biting and the ridiculous number of points of reference in the decision-making, management and organizational structure of such national and international events. Government agencies are all over the place, and India has not been able to restructure this terribly faulty system that does one thing only: pass the buck and stall the delivery of goods and services. This is the reality in every area of socio-economic activity, thanks to an ineffective bureaucracy and political class that are not accountable. All-invasive corruption and abject neglect have degraded us to the level of an anarchic, third-world nation-state in spite of a healthy rate of growth.        
	No one wants to rock the boat, shake up the lethargy and generate reform and fresh ideas, initiatives and solutions to chronic problems in our corroded and malfunctioning system. Too many comfortable feathers would be ruffled and the club that misrules us today would be exposed for its gross inefficiencies. The tragedy is that no political dispensation seems excited by the possibility of an overhaul of a non-working delivery mechanism and does not have the urge or passion to lead productive change. Once in the protected cocoon of politics and government service, leaders become oblivious of the rigours of working and living in modern India. Nobody cares a hoot.              
	In the wrong place        
	To top all the inept madness, we have to listen to aging, failed politicians, who are given cushy sinecures, insult India. It was shocking to hear a former cabinet minister (a former member of Indian Foreign Service) spout inanities about how happy he will be if the games fail. It did him damage to speak in this immature manner. If Mani Shankar Aiyar was so adamant about not hosting the games in India, he should have made sure during his tenure as minister that they were shelved. If he had other ideas for how to allocate money spent on the games into government-backed, honestly executed projects to make a new generation of sportspeople internationally competitive, he failed to do so. Equally, he failed to restructure and modernize existing sports bodies to cope with challenges and competition in the international arena. He was not proactive about sports. His interest lay elsewhere. The wrong person in the wrong place is the other failure in governance structures. Aiyar should have been allowed to reinvent the panchayati raj system for the delivery of good, grass-root governance. That was his passion.        
	Some questions arise. Why are development and panchayati raj mechanisms still corrupt and unable to serve civil society? It would be rivetting to hear leaders of this sector, erstwhile and present, spell out the experience of failure and the solutions, both radical and simple, that are required. Charity begins at home. It would make a show on television called The Hot Seat, or Prayashchit, where men and women who have ruled, and those who rule today, are grilled about why they failed to deliver the services they were mandated to ensure. Being snide about the failures of others, without addressing those of ones ministerial responsibility to the nation, does not rise above the petty or make a positive impact. Remember, it was Rajiv Gandhi who supported both sports and panchayati raj with vigour, realizing that in a multi-dimensional world, both are imperative, a developing Bharat and an emerging India.

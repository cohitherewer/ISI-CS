	Q: My late husband owned a plot of land. The land was given to someone for cultivation long ago. Subsequently, the person tried to include his name in the hal-parcha but the court ordered that the land would remain in my husbands name. The cultivators request for barga entitlement was also turned down. Yet people have bought portions of the land either from this person (since deceased) or from his family and constructed houses there. Official title search report and documents show my husband as the owner and the cultivator as the dakhaldar. Now I wish to sell the plot. How do I proceed? Is there any agency or government unit that will offer legal aid?        
	Shefali Karmakar, via email                
	A: It is unfortunate that portions of your husbands plot of land are already under the possession of persons who are not the actual owners. Though you (and other heirs of your husband, if any) are entitled to sell the plot, you may face difficulties. To get a good deal you will first have to file eviction suits against the persons in possession of portions of the land. But remember, this will be a time consuming process. If you have no independent source of income, you are entitled to avail of legal aid services  a facility that exists in every court.              
	Q:My younger brother and I jointly own a plot of land. I had tried to get it mutated several times but could not. My brother, a mental patient, has been missing since July, 2006. Recently, I managed to get half the land mutated in my name. My mother is dead and my father is dependent on me. My brother, who is my only other sibling, was also dependent on me. How and when can the remaining portion of the land be mutated and in whose name?        
	Muztarab Hussain, Calcutta                
	A: Since your brother has not yet been declared a lunatic or dead by a court of law, the remaining portions of the land still belong to him legally. However, as per Section 108 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, if a person is not heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive, the burden of proving that he is alive is shifted to the person who affirms it. Hence, on completion of the seventh year, you can file a suit for declaration before the court. Once the court declares your brother to be dead, his legal heirs will inherit his share and be able to get it mutated in their names.

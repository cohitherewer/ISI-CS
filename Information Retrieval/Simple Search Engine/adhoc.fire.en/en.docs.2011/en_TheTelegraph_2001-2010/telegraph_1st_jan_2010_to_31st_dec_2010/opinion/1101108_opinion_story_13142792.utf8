	Seek help                  
	Sir  In the context of the visit of the American president, Barack Obama, to India, I agree with Kanti Bajpai when he says that the United States of America should not expect New Delhi to be able to do much (Dont ask for too much, Nov 4). But America and India are in need of each others cooperation and help. It is important that this visit turns out to be mutually beneficial for both countries.          
	America is currently in a tight spot, trying to deal with international terrorism, and with its own forced involvement in the war in Afghanistan, after the one in Iraq. India is in a difficult situation as well, having to engage itself with hostile neighbouring countries like Pakistan and China. Terrorist activities on Pakistans soil have been plaguing India for a long time now. And while India has almost equalled China in terms of its population, it still has to go a long way before it matches Chinas economic growth and nuclear power.          
	Indias internal conflicts are no less formidable. These have to be dealt with strongly so that the countrys technological and military prowess increases. India needs substantial help from America in these fields. President Obamas waning popularity at home is cause for concern. In the given scenario, the two nations must agree to face their challenges together in order to restore their influence in the global arena.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Hashim, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Indias relationship with the US is not likely to improve as a result of Barack Obamas visit. With the poor performance of the Democrats in the mid-term elections and the American governments growing inability to deal with the countrys economic problems, Obama is hardly in a position to offer anything substantial to India. He is not likely to address issues that are of strategic interest to India, like the instability in Afghanistan, China-Pakistan relations or Indias bid for a permanent seat in the United Nations security council. The US has always advocated free trade and globalization at the cost of transparency. Since it is going through a rough patch now, the American president is visiting India to ensure his countrys economic security. A self-seeking trip to China would not be easy for Obama, as the US is dependent on China for trade, to say nothing of Chinas assertive presence on the global stage. The US is coming to India to hunt for jobs, and will take away more than it will give. India will endure this with the misplaced hope that the US will support its bid for the security council seat.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  President Barack Obamas visit to India will go the way all other US presidential visits have gone. America is concerned about business above all else, and that is what it will focus on this time as well. The US economy is yet to recover fully from the recession. Obama needs to prove that his visit to India will result in more jobs for the US. He has already taken a few steps in that direction by suggesting that the outsourcing of jobs to India will be stopped. With the business opportunities he expects to create in the aviation and military sectors after his visit, there will probably be more jobs for the US.          
	It is important for India to analyse whether all this is in its best interests. Given the current scenario, the US needs India more than India needs the US. India has progressed steadily in its technological weapons and atomic energy programmes, in spite of regular attempts from the US to thwart its growth. India has also been accepted as a responsible player in the field of nuclear energy. We no longer need the US in this regard. If we do require assistance, countries like Russia, France and Japan are more than willing to help.          
	It is, therefore, advisable to glean from this presidential visit only that which serves Indias business and strategic interests. The US has been trying to please India by such acts as bestowing the World Statesman Award on our prime minister, Manmohan Singh. We may have fallen for these ploys in the past, but it is time we stood up for what we believed in. The week ahead will unfold an interesting chapter in Indo-US relations.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The governments well- intentioned but strict law to combat sexual harassment of women at the workplace may prove to be counter-productive (Cabinet nod for wider harass bill, Nov 5). Given the stringent clauses in the law, many employers, especially those in the private sector, may find it safer to hire only men, just to avert any trouble that may arise from having a mixed work force.          
	Yours faithfully,

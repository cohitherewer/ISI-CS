The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An enjoyable pot-pourri of melodies
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AN ENJOYABLE POT-POURRI OF MELODIES                                  MUSIC: Nilaksha Gupta                                                  
	Mackintosh Burn Limited presented a sarod recital by Ustad Amjad Ali Khan as part of the celebrations to mark its 175th anniversary at the Science City auditorium on the evening of April 22. The recital conformed to the Ustads new performance format and started with brief gatkari in jhaptal rather than an alap.        
	The mukhra or head of the composition was minimalist in nature and in the first minute it foxed one into thinking that some kind of tarparan in Raga Shri was being played. Then came a touch of shuddh madhyam (natural 4th) first in conjunction with shuddh gandhar and finally at the end of a phrase using the shuddh dhaivat (natural 6th) and shuddh nishad (natural 7th) in the manner of Raga Bhatiyar. This was thus Kamal Shri, a raga the Ustad had composed to commemorate Rajiv Gandhi soon after his assassination.        
	Starting off with some short ekhara taans, the Ustad went on to play jod-style figures, bolkari and lad-lapet, and finally into a session of antara elaboration and reverse jhala, all with his characteristic musicianship. The whole thing was over in eight minutes and then in about roughly three minutes there was deepchandi tala (14 beats) gatkari in Raga Kamod. The speciality of the composition was that it came to the sam (1st beat) with a figure similar to the mukhra of a classic khayal composition played in duple time with a couple of quick and typically sarod strokes added. The taankari came in during the elaboration of the antara and then came melodic elaboration through meends on a backdrop of rapid strokes.        
	The drut teental gatkari started on the 6th minute. Here the fast composition used the same mukhra but altered the second portion to approximate more to the khayal composition. This section was occasion for some brief but rapid bolkari and the first substantial tabla break by Anubroto Chatterjee.        
	Then came what could be called the pice de rsistance of the recital: a brief alap and jod in Raga Jhinjhoti. There was fetching lyricism in the phrase development and remarkable finesse in the application of the high or tivra komal nishad (flat 7th). The amazing sustained notes and ringing tone of the phrases created a sound aura that appears rarely in any recital. The lyrical artistry picked up rhythmic lilt in the slightly longer jod that went into ladi in its fourth minute and then into dioctave ekhara taankari and thhok jhala.        
	The gatkari was in Raga Durga and in medium tempo teental. It was preceded by an aochar. The composition was the one the Ustad played frequently in 1970s and one that is based on a drut khayal. This was played for about seven minutes and then there was brief gatkari in drut jhaptal and ati drut teental.        
	The brew of ragas thickened from this point and the Ustad, starting with an aochar in Mishra Shivranjani that went into jod and ekhara taankari, went on to play Zilha Kafi and Mishra Pilu with gatkari in deepchandi and drut teental. Gatkari in Shiv Kalyan, the Ustads own raga, Swar Sameer, and ati drut teental gats in Megh followed in rapid succession. Finally, of course, there was the aochar with folk asides leading to the Ustads version of Tagores Ekla cholo re.        
	While it is undeniable that the melodic variety in the Ustads new recital format does its best to rule out chances of boredom for the average listener, it must be pointed out that it also downplays the so-called high seriousness of Hindustani classical music and at times sends it for a six. In fact, I would have definitely preferred a fuller treatment of Jhinjhoti, especially because the Ustad was at his best while playing it, and also perhaps a longer Kamod after the opening spurt in Kamal Shri. In fact, I would have preferred the opening gatkari to have been in Shri raga proper as well.        
	Too much of anything, including variety, has the tendency of leading to monotony and therefore boredom, especially when the items are known and appear in most recitals. I think it would be good if the Ustad, starting with the fast gatkari in his new style, settles down to proper alap, jod, jhala and gatkari in a proper raga in his older style for a change.        
	Some more gatkari in another raga, and then the pot-pourri in the final part would definitely make up a more enjoyable programme.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Lines from a young poet
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LINES FROM A YOUNG POET                                  THIS ABOVE ALL -   KHUSHWANT SINGH      
	Kanwar Preet Singh is only 12 years old. His father, Berjinder Singh, is from the village of my birth, Hadali. The family were among the last of the Hindus and Sikhs to leave Hadali and migrate to India in 1947. Most of them were rehabilitated in and around Ambala in Haryana. Some time later, Kanwar Preet migrated to the United States of America. He sent some of his poems to his uncle, Iqbal Singh, living in Ambala, who passed them on to me. I was impressed that one of such tender age could write so well. I have chosen one entitled Super Mom for the benefit of my readers:                
	Mom, youre a wonderful mother,        
	So gentle, yet so strong.        
	The many ways you show you care,        
	Will make me feel I belong.        
	Youre patient when Im foolish;        
	You give guidance when I ask;        
	It seems you can do almost anything;        
	Youre the master of every task.        
	You are a dependable source of comfort        
	Youre my cushion when I fall.        
	You help me in times of trouble;        
	Youre there whenever I call        
	I love you more than you know;        
	You have my total respect        
	If I had my choice of mother,        
	Youd be the one Id select!                    Easy job       
	Indian hell          
	A man dies and goes to hell. There he finds that there is a different hell for each country. He goes to the German Hell and asks: What do they do here? He is told, First they put you in an electric chair for an hour. Then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. Then the German Devil comes in and beats you for the rest of the day. The man does not like the sound of it at all, so he moves on and checks the US Hell as well as the Russian Hell and many more countries He discovers that they are all more or less the same as the German Hell        
	Then he comes to the Indian Hell and finds a long line of people waiting to get in. Amazed, he asks, What do they do here?         
	He is told, First they put you in an electric chair for an hour. Then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. Then the Indian Devil comes in and beats you for the rest of the day.        
	But that is exactly the same as all the other hells  so why are so many people waiting to get in here? he asks.         
	Because the maintenance is so bad that the electric chair does not work, someone has stolen all the nails from the bed and the Indian Devil is a former government servant, so he comes in and signs the register, then goes to the canteen.

	Mamas boy

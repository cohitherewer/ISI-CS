The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Possessed by the drama
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        POSSESSED BY THE DRAMA                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Until now, curiously enough, Calcutta had never seen The Phantom of the Opera live, though it is among the most enduring images of 20th century performance  from the silent screen classic of 1925, to the over-operatic film of 1943, the subdued British movie of 1962, the campy Phantom of the Paradise (1974) set in the rock-music industry, Ken Hills moderately-successful stage musical in 1976, peaking with Andrew Lloyd Webbers 1986 blockbuster, then back to cinema as the slasher flick of 1989 and even worse turkey of 1998. Phantom allures us triply: as a creepy Gothic story, the genre in which Gaston Leroux wrote the original French novel 100 years ago; the opera-within-the opera double layer of metatheatre that so fascinates modern audiences; and above all, the very real sense of possession by a spirit that every accomplished performer has felt about their stage experiences. The (ironically enough) silent film most memorably captured the first and third levels, actually heightened by its lack of sound and colour. And Webber gave it the most complex musical treatment to date, making La Martinieres choice of it (even if edited) their most ambitious undertaking ever.        
	Full marks, therefore, on the scale of difficulty, to directors Katy Lai Roy and Dana Roy. In implementation, too, they attained fabulous results, from teenagers after all, delivering impeccable musicality right through, a tough ask perfectly served by the principals, Shara Madan (all sweetness and innocence) and Divyamaan Sahoo, as the lovers. Aditya Krishnans gravelly Phantom, as if Bob Dylan had been cast for the part, did not gel with the interpretation that a pure voice should balance his warped mind and deformed face, for he otherwise expressed both vulnerability and malevolence. The real star born in this show, destined for the arc lights, was Ahona Palchoudhuri, commanding attention as the diva, singing chandelier-shattering soprano while acting, always with one eye on public reaction, true to her role. Her beau (Raghav Khullar) catered to her whims in a delightfully deadpan manner. All, even the Laurel and Hardy managers, handled the multipart songs with her excellently, like Prima Donna.        
	Pros took care of backstage (so we can complain about the uneven sound mix), nevertheless, Tom Lais massive yet mobile sets and fluid changes deserve applause. A pity he couldnt fit in the spectacle of the Phantoms boat on the underground lake. The lavish costumes beautifully complemented the scenic impact. The fully-choreographed masquerade and the cemetery with actors as mortuary statues were visual treats. In the end, one could tell from glazed faces that the daemonic phantasm of theatre had grasped many a young performers mind  probably this productions lasting achievement.

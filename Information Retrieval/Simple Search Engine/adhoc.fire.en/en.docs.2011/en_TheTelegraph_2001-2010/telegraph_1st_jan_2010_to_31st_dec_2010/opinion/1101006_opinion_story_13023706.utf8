	Q: How much time should it take to decide a criminal case brought before the judicial magistrate for offences under Sections 420, 406 and 409 of the Indian Penal Code? The plaintiff is an octogenarian. Will this case not be decided under the fast track court?        
	Adimoolam, via email        
	A: The offences may be tried before a judicial magistrate of first class. However, in order to expedite the case, the plaintiff could, on grounds of old age, file an application before the high court, seeking a direction upon the concerned magistrate to complete the trial within a fixed time frame.        
	Q:I had applied to our co-operative society to include my wife as a co-member. The society has refused to do so. What should I do now?        
	B.K. Bose, Calcutta        
	A: You have not disclosed the grounds on which your application was rejected. Nevertheless, the law on co-operatives in West Bengal allows a co-operative society to admit two persons, including spouses, as joint members and issue a single certificate in their joint names. You could refer your dispute to the registrar of co-operatives within two months from the cause of action.         
	Q: How can my mother, the lessee of a flat (owned by the state government), bequeath the leased property to one of her legal heirs?        
	N. Saha, Calcutta        
	A: Being the lessee, your mothers rights to the leased property will automatically be inherited by her legal heirs after her demise.         
	Q: My father acquired a plot of land (on which he built a house) by virtue of a deed of gift executed by the Governor of West Bengal. But the property tax records show the name of my deceased grandfather while my fathers name appears as the person liable. Does this in any way restrict my fathers absolute right, title and interest in the property?        
	S. Dutta, via email        
	A: Clerical errors in ones tax bill or records can be rectified by submitting an application to the municipal commissioner. Such errors do not affect the clear title of your fathers property. But you should get the mistake rectified.

	Although Indira Gandhi nationalized banks to establish her socialist credentials, she did so to buy popularity. Since then, banks have been favouring some borrowers over others. First farmers, then small industrialists, followed by exporters  each group was made eligible for priority lending. But once the government starts discriminating, new claimants start lining up. So a complicated array of interest rates was thought up. By the 1990s, there was a jungle of them, and as banks lost money on priority loans given at low interest rates, they kept raising the rates for those without priority. Industrialists who were out of favour ended up paying over a quarter of their loan in interest every year; high interest costs were a major reason for the uncompetitiveness of Indian industry. This structure became unsupportable when infrastructure became a candidate for priority loans. Its requirements were so huge that it threatened to bankrupt the banking system. The Reserve Bank of India tried to control the situation by making every bank declare a prime lending rate. It expected that banks would take the PLR to be the minimum rate; but it discovered that banks were lending below the PLR to favoured clients. So five years ago, it appointed a working group to investigate bank practice and suggest how it should be changed. On the basis of the groups recommendations, the RBI has ordained the replacement of PLRs by what it calls base rates. Each bank will have to declare its base rate; but unlike the PLR, it will be prevented from lending below the base rate. The RBI has laid down how the base rate would be calculated; it will be a cost-plus rate. So, in theory, banks will earn a positive return on all their loans.        
	The immediate impact of this stipulation will be on earlier favoured sectors, such as small industry and agriculture. This rise in costs has been in the offing for some time. The underpricing of loans meant that banks were reluctant to lend to priority sectors; they never met their lending targets. It also meant that banks loans were often bought with bribes. Perhaps this miasma of favouritism and graft will lift with the new interest regime. But banks remain an oligopoly, and their loans will remain in short supply and hence a favour. The only remedy for this is competition. The RBI must now begin to issue new bank licenses, especially to small and rural banks.

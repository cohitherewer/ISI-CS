                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Do not disturb                  
	Sir  The unwanted calls and SMSes from advertisers on our phones are a nuisance. The National Do Not Call Registry has been a failure. No one likes to attend calls from telemarketing executives as they result in a loss of precious time. A strict law should be enacted to end such harassment. For instance, such calls can only be permitted with government authorization and provisions should be made to pay individuals for receiving them. This way, the government will earn some revenue and harassed customers will be rewarded for their pain.          
	Yours faithfully,         Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi
        
	Still fuming          
	Sir  The recent lathicharge and subsequent firing by the police on the students of Osmania University, who were demanding a separate Telangana, could have been avoided had the agitating students chosen to protest without violence (United clause stirs Andhra embers , Feb 13). The flare up took place after the Centre requested the B.N. Krishna commission to consider the proposal of a united Andhra Pradesh. Instead of instigating students to support their cause, political leaders opposed to this proposal could have discussed the issue with the home minister. Education in Andhra Pradesh is plagued by frequent postponement of examinations. This jeorpardizes the careers of students on whom parents spend a considerable sum of money.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  Even if the Krishna commission alters its recommendations to create the state of Telangana, what is the guarantee that this new state will experience overall development? How can we say for certain whether Telangana will not go the Jharkhand way? Demand for separate small states is nothing but a political ploy. There is no need for the supporters or opponents of Telangana to indulge in violence. The ultimate aim of both these factions is to achieve balanced regional development for the state.           
	There is no use in involving students in this agitation either. The students must also realize that such protests are futile, and they must return to their classes instead. On its part, the government should work to develop the whole of Andhra Pradesh, instead of one particular region.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Ramachandran, Ooty

                
	From the heart          
	Sir  Marketing ones product is certainly not a derogatory thing. However, Bharathi S. Pradhans allegation that Shah Rukh Khans frisking at Newark airport was a ploy to grab headlines is risible (Wheels within wheels, Feb 14). Isnt it incredible that Khan would promote his film six months before its release? Can this be a smart strategy coming from the shrewder mind [that] operates in SRK? Pradhan says that the stand-off between Khan and the Shiv Sena was not meant for publicity. Yet, the writer alleges that Khan deliberately commented about the Pakistani players in the hope that the Gandhi siblings, whom Khan is close to, would bail him out. Smart as Khan is, he would not have risked his only release in two years with such silly stunts.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Moitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is ridiculous to suggest that the Shiv Senas hooliganism in Mumbai was stage-managed by Shah Rukh Khan to publicize My Name is Khan. The response to the film shows the allegation to be false. The film has received exceptional reviews and is set to become the biggest film in recent times.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.Ghosh, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Water does not cleanse the soul
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WATER DOES NOT CLEANSE THE SOUL                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Skin dip                                        
	Hindus and Sikhs must be the only two religious communities in the world which believe that immersing oneself in a river declared holy or a pond (sarovar) declared sacred washes away sins. If it were that easy, we would soon achieve a sinless society. Without meaning to offend the religious sensibilities of millions, I would like to ask all those who believe in bathing as a religious ritual a few questions: why is the sin-cleansing limited to specific times such as the Kumbh Mela or to places such as Har-ki-Pauri in Hardwar? Why is it not for all times? Why is the sarovar of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) specifically marked out for soul and body cleansing? Since childhood I have heard Sikhs recite:                 
	Guru Ram Das sarovar Nahatey        
	Sab utrey paap karraatey        
	Bathe in the pool dug by         
	Guru Ram Das        
	And cleanse yourself of all         
	sins you have committed.                
	Surely, a shower or a few lotas of water splashed on your body with soap is more cleansing than a few dips in water with no soap?        
	There is no logic behind the Hindu-Sikh fetish for snan or ishnaan. Nevertheless, men and women gather in hundreds on special occasions to take this quick and easy path to salvation. These are special occasions for sadhus of different akhras to foregather and extort money from the gullible. In their rivalry, they often come to blows against one another. There are stampedes and dozens of death. Isnt it time for thinking Indians to raise their voice and question the continuance of such meaningless rituals?                
	Myth and reality                
	There are many words whose meaning we vaguely know, but rarely bother to find out what they actually stand for. One of those words is genes. I thought it was just another word for in ones blood. A concept which was drilled into our heads since our days in school is that we Indians belong to five racial groups: Adivasis, Dravidians, Aryans, Mongols and Semites. I am a little more enlightened after reading Invasion of the Genes, Genetic Heritage of India by B.S. Ahloowalia. The author did his doctorate from the University of Chicago and worked for the agriculture and food department of Dublin. He was also with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. He has made his home in Vienna in Austria.        
	I admit I was reluctant to read his book as I thought that the subject was beyond my comprehension. However, the word, genes, in the title made me curious to know what the word really meant. I was in for a very pleasant surprise, as Ahloowalia not only explains it in simple, lucid terms with diagrams to illustrate it but, at the end of every chapter, also gives a glossary of difficult words and their meanings. Ahloowalias work reads like a precisely written high school textbook. I went through it without any difficulty, and learnt much.        
	Another myth he rubbishes is the notion of the origin of life on earth drilled into our minds by teachers of religion. Human being were neither created by the churning of the oceans nor by a god who brought into being all creatures within six days. It all began, as Darwin has proved, with the species of fish coming on dry land and evolving into reptiles, birds, mammals and humans. We have, in fact, descended from monkeys.        
	And finally, Ahloowalia tells us that there is no such thing as a pure race anywhere in the world. There has been much intermingling through conquests and trading that introduced new genes in every country. India had innumerable invaders who came without women. They mated with local women, reared offspring of mixed races. The latest arrivals in India were the Europeans  Portuguese, Dutch, French and English. The earlier immigrants came without their women and were quick to adapt themselves to the life-styles of Indian rajas and nawabs. They acquired harems of Indian women and concubines and bred dozens of children. David Ochterlony, the first British resident in the court of the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, had 13 Indian wives, who bore him dozens of children. His assistant, William Fraser, had over half-a-dozen wives and mistresses and as many children as the Shah of Persia. Maharajah Ranjit Singh had over 30 Europeans to train his soldiers. At his instance, they married Indian women so that he could be sure of their staying in his service.        
	Ahloowalias book is an eye-opener. It removes a lot of cobwebs spun in our minds by religious bigots. If I had my way, I would make it compulsory reading in all high schools.                
	Noble plan                
	Santa was seen standing in the middle of his acre of land under the scorching heat of the midday sun. His friend, Banta, asked him: O Santa! What are you doing at this hour in your farm?        
	I have applied for the Nobel prize, replied Santa.        
	What has this to do with the prize?        
	Banta replied: It says that the Prize is awarded to somebody outstanding in his field.

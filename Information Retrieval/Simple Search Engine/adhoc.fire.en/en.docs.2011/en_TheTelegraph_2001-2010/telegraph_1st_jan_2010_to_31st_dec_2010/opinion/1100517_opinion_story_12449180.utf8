	Shaky home front                  
	Sir  Two issues emerge in the light of the comments made by the minister for environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh, on the alarmist policies of the home ministry. There is the matter of talking out of turn and encroaching on the affairs of other ministries. There is also the question of how senior politicians must conduct themselves on foreign soil. However, Rameshs observation that the home ministry is paranoid about trade ventures with China was partly justified.          
	As K.P. Nayars article, Fear and foreboding (May 12), illustrates, the home minister, P. Chidambaram, is guilty of interfering in the affairs of other ministries himself. Chidambaram recently ruled that special sanctions are needed for scholars from certain countries who want to attend seminars in India. He has also infringed on the duties of the ministry of external affairs. Ironically, the Maoist problem, which is the responsibility of the home ministry, continues to fester, with more jawans being killed only a few days ago.          
	Healthy political discussions are part of a democracy but unrestrained censure of ministers representing other branches of the government is not. The environment and forests minister lashed out at his party colleagues in the public domain and, worse still, in another country. Friction between various sections of the government should be contained within the country. When abroad, the government must present a united front. The prime minster should make this amply clear to his colleagues in the cabinet.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In the wake of the recent fracas between Jairam Ramesh and P. Chidambaram, K. P. Nayars insightful analysis of the episode made for informative reading. Ramesh joins Digvijay Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyar in the ranks of the partys maverick brigade, which is given to prolixity. Singh, for instance, had called Chidambaram intellectually arrogant. Rameshs comment on the home ministrys paranoia about Chinese business ventures in India was disgraceful. It was reminiscent of the controversial and outspoken remark by the former defence minister, George Fernandes, that China was Indias Enemy No. 1.          
	In this case, an incensed Chidambaram made his feelings known to Manmohan Singh in writing and Ramesh was chastised by the prime minister. According to Nayar, this cloud of controversy will only temporarily obfuscate a legitimate issue. While admitting that the environment minister had crossed the bounds of propriety, Nayar asserts that the home minister has also meddled extensively in other ministries.          
	Chidambarams interference, Nayar observes, has crippled the autonomy of the ministry of external affairs so that there is now a logical case to merge the foreign and home ministries. The external affairs minister, S.M. Krishna, had wanted to expedite the process of acquiring passports but Chidambaram would not allow him to do away with the tedious process of police verification. The fear that has gripped the home ministry has also led to a more stringent application of archaic citizenship rules, as Nayar points out. According to such rules, if a person applies for a new passport a year after the old one has lapsed, it becomes a citizenship case. Nayar also mentions that the first Chinese scholar who was approved to visit Sikkim since the states inception in 1973 was held up en route by home ministry officials.          
	Congress leaders tend to be enthusiastic about American investment in Indian markets but are suspicious of the Chinese. While there is a view that considers a powerful China to be a threat to the world order, there are others who feel that a Beijing Consensus should replace the Washington Consensus. Perhaps there needs to be a balance between the two extremes. As Nayar bluntly observes, the home ministry is paranoid not just about China but people with Chinese features. Elsewhere in the world, he says, this would be considered racial profiling. In India, it is called protecting national security.          
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  K.P. Nayar has chosen to severely criticize the home minister for bringing about changes in the way the various ministries function in order to tighten security. Given the current situation, with the threat of Maoists and Islamic terrorism, we need the determination of someone like Chidambaram if the country is to be secured from such dangers. It is earnestly hoped that he will continue with the good work and not be deterred by critics. Few can deny that India is a soft State. The citizens will be free of fear and foreboding only when security measures are beefed up.

	Rabindrasangeet has this intrinsic ability to retain its charm despite insensitive handling and interpretation by performers. However, not all performances are flawed, and it was encouraging to see a large number of singers gather to present Tagore songs at the G.D. Birla Sabhagar on August 29. Time management, discipline and synchronization were the hallmarks of this particular production. Presented by Biswa Bhara Pran, the evening was a colourful collage of songs and creative dance compositions that were interspersed with narrations by the veteran elocutionists, Partho and Gouri Ghosh.        
	The programme commenced with a chorus number  Akash bhara surjo tara. This was followed by the theme song of the group and a group dance. Madhumita Roy, a talented Kathak dancer, combined bol parhant intelligently with the song, Gahono ghano chhailo, which was sung by Gopa Roy. Another brilliant performer in this genre, Ashimbandhu Bhattacharya, demonstrated his taiyaari and understanding of the idiom in his imaginative composition, Jete jete ekla pathe. Subrato Senguptas tuneful rendition brought out the inner pathos of the song. Arkadeb Bhattacharya and Mrittika Bhattacharya excelled in their presentations based on the Bharatnatyam and Odissi styles. Although Arkadeb was lively in Bajro manik diye gatha, Pradip Sarkar failed to do justice to this beautiful song. Polly Guha was soothing and lyrical in Badolo dinero prothomo kadamo phool, and Srabani Sens performance was commendable as well. Sen has developed her own style that succeeded in bringing out the mood of monsoon effectively in her rhythmic rendition of Pagla hawar badol dine.         
	The charm of a cool breeze was captured in Pub hawate day dola, which was sung by Rukma Dakshi. Purnima Ghosh presented a Manipuri dance along with the song. Mono mor meghero sangee,by Samit Roy, was melodious, but the accompanying dance performance was a tad dramatic. This was not expected of Kaushik Chakraborty, who is otherwise an excellent Kathakali dancer.         
	The musical rhythm of Rimjhim ghano ghano remained unexplored in Amita Duttas mediocre presentation. Srabono tumi was neatly composed, and, unlike the other presentations, included aesthetic costumes. Molly Roy, a promising dancer, performed effortlessly in Oi malatilata dole. She was accompanied by Sharmila Basu who sang the song. Kalabati Devi was equally impressive in her presentation.         
	The performers were accompanied by Goutam Chowdhury on the tabla and Subrata Mukherjee on keyboard. The light design, which plays an important role in a production, was ordinary. Abhog, Indian Cultural Troupe, Niharika, Meghdoot Ballet Troupe and Manipuri Nartanalaya performed in the programme that was conducted by Debasish Basu.

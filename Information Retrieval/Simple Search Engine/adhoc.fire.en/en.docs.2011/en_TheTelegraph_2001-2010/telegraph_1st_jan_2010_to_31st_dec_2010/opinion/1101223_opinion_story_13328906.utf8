	We have reached the end of another year and tis the season to be jolly  in theory, at least. The talent shows have had their glittering finals and produced their crop of instant new stars, the vicissitudes of whose further lives will plaster the pages of the gossip magazines for the next year until a new batch takes their places, pushing all but the most talented back into obscurity. The finals of the cleverer quiz shows have winners who are retired doctors and teachers and whose names we fail to remember from week to week. The mantle of celebrity seldom falls on their shoulders. They have achieved their success mainly for their own satisfaction and are probably all the happier for that.        
	Our Christmases these days are all about short-term glitter with little of the deeper feeling attached to a celebration that was once the happy culmination of a year lived according to the natural order of seasons and the feast days and festivals of the faith upon which both spiritual and, to some extent, temporal life depended. I am agnostic and hardly sure of what is needed to gild shallow Christmas festivities with real gold but, detached as we are from the natural cycle of life, crops and seasons, we have removed ourselves even from the pagan celebrations calculated to cheer the darkest hour of the winter at the winter solstice, and the ritual has become largely one of shopping, eating and drinking too much.              
	Nevertheless, my Christmas tree is up in the hall, and I dont much go in for decking with boughs of holly like the old carol suggests. The holly dries up quickly in the central heating and looks far from festive. Out of doors, however, the trees are bowed down under a weight of snow thick enough even on fields and verges not to have turned to the usual grey slush of English snowfalls, and we may have a genuine white Christmas. I imagine that if my children were not now all adults, their excitement would have rubbed off on older members of the family and we would be rushing out on toboggans and wallowing in a sea of wrapping paper and ribbon. As it is, I am cursing the cooking and shopping that has to be done for them to finish work on Christmas Eve and struggle out of London through the snow for a couple of exhausted days before struggling back again. I think small children are a required presence if Scrooge-like tendencies are to be kept at bay and a sense of some magic around the season is to be retained.        
	The snow, as it happens, may look like a Christmas card, but is proving to be a damper to any festive spirit. It has brought the country almost to a standstill. Determined shoppers and those attempting an early break for holiday destinations have been stuck for hours, if not days, on frozen motorways strewn with jack-knifed lorries. Police and travel organizations are at their wits ends, and nobody actually knows whether the country possesses a snow plough  they have seldom been needed since 1963. In those days, people may have been better able to help themselves without expecting the authorities to sort out their problems and without moaning so much. I have a vague childhood recollection of going to the village in a pony and trap, and school never closed because it was cold.        
	Now schools have shut down early for the holidays, children have to be kept at proper temperatures these days. Airports are closed to flights but populated by miserable passengers living in terminals and hoping to leave the country before they have to come back again. My son is en route from Chile and, for the second time this year, likely to get stuck in Madrid. He fell foul of the Icelandic volcano ash cloud earlier in the year, and is debating the merits of travelling by sea in the future. So far, the Kenyan beans and Thai mangoes are still miraculously making their way to the supermarket shelves, but we may shortly have to fall back on good old English cabbages and the autumn apple stores. Nature seems set on forcing her presence back into our well- insulated, plastic-wrapped lives and getting her own back somehow.        
	Everyone knows that the state of the weather is a constant object of conversation among the British and, aside from the aforesaid television competitions, it currently consumes our front pages to the exclusion of student rioters, anyway swept off the streets by the cold and parliamentary recess; the economy, retailers likely to lose out on the usual Christmas throwing-all-caution-to-the-winds spree; even WikiLeaks as Julian Assange, temporarily out of custody, has gone to ground in a supporters country house in snowy Suffolk and the leaking stories have become, for the time being, less headline-grabbing. The chill in the news has even overtaken our cricketers in Australia whose heart-warming performance so far in the Ashes series collapsed under a fast-bowling assault from the home team, resulting in the usual spate of post-mortem gloom that is habitual when our sportspeople fail.        
	We really are a miserable bunch in the UK sometimes  most of the time, at the moment, as austerity bites along with the frost. A sporting triumph is one of the few things that raises the spirits of the nation  pity we didnt do better in the World Cup, we could have done with that lift, and now our chances of carrying off the Ashes are looking bleaker. We still have high expectations in our small country, but they are so often doomed, leaving us to become the imperial complainers of the world. Now I suppose I have got it all off my chest; so, to end this year, what about a few good things?        
	They arent immediately obvious from news and newspapers that, beyond the weather, tell of discontent and potential waves of strikes in protest against austerity measures affecting everyone from students to pensioners. But there are still areas where we can celebrate. For those, one needs to turn to the review pages of end-of-year papers, where our remarkable cultural life  music, art, dance, literature and theatre  somehow continues to triumph over long-term funding problems and will hopefully continue to do so even as they increase, thanks to wealthy individuals prepared to support such endeavours.               
	We are incredibly lucky, too, to retain the enrichment of years of interaction with other cultures through immigration and, it has to be said, less pleasingly, through conquest and pillage throughout our imperial history. For those wishing to escape the cold outside and the freezing economic winds, there is, occasionally laying guilty provenance aside, no greater pleasure than an afternoon in one of our great museums or galleries and an evening, no guilt attached here, at the theatre, the ballet or the opera. Many museums are free and they are usually warm; theatres are hardly cheap, but there are often special rates and less expensive seats available for those determined enough to find them, while constantly greater efforts are being made to reduce the exclusivity and cost of opera and ballet, and bring them to a wider audience.         
	Beyond that, as an Indian friend calling to see if we have frozen yet has just pointed out, we have a multitude of craftspeople in our small towns and villages, making and creating beautiful and collectable pieces. Oddly enough, fewer jobs and the economic downturn have encouraged people to look at their real skills and develop them, and this is certainly something to celebrate. Suddenly, Im beginning to feel a little less gloom-ridden. As children, we always spent a week in London after Christmas going to theatres and exhibitions, times I remember to this day. So, my Christmas presents are going to be theatre tickets and exhibition vouchers: on my own list, the plays I want to see in the next month or two, plus books  always books  to give and to receive and everything parcelled whimsically into a locally-made basket from the town market. I shall revel, then, in anticipation of delicious plays and in reading page after page, forgetting the expected gloom of the darkening winter, the sporting fixtures and the destitute year ahead in an orgy of pleasure for the imagination.        
	Really, I feel quite cheerful. Happy New Year to one and all!

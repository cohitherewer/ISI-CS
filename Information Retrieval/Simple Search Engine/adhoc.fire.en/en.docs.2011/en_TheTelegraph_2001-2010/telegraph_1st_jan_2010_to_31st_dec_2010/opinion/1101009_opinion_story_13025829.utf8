	Cruel shelter                  
	Sir  West Bengals disreputable juvenile homes should be replaced with a system in which the children are placed under the care of foster parents (Home thoughts, Oct 4). However, the scheme may not work unless foster parents are taken into confidence by the government.The State should follow the example set by IT companies and issue coupons that can be redeemed at shopping malls to ensure that the monthly stipend given for the upkeep of the children is spent wisely. A public-private partnership is necessary to rescue these unfortunate children.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Debjani Banerjee, Calcutta 

      
	Very special          
	Sir What a great victory and what a great Test match it was! Team India should be congratulated for this unexpected and thrilling win over Australia (India prevail in tense finish, Oct 6). When the skipper, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Harbhajan Singh were dismissed and the team reduced to 124/8, most cricket fans must have thought that India would lose the match. But cricket is not known as a game of glorious uncertainties for nothing. An 81-run partnership for the ninth wicket between Very Very Special Laxman and Ishant Sharma won the game for India. Sachin Tendulkars contributions of 98 and 38 were valuable. But his performance in the second innings showed, once again, that he lacks match-winning capabilities. Should Tendulkar take a leaf out of Laxmans book on how to win matches from now on?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  It is high time we give V.V.S. Laxman a place in the pantheon of great Indian cricketers. His innings against Australia, one among the many epic knocks that he has played, bears testimony to his greatness.           
	Yours faithfully,       
P. Srivasan Nair, Kerala

      
	Sir  Once again, we were treated to a thrilling game of Test cricket. Even the most ardent Indian fan would not have dreamt of victory when India were tottering in the second innings. At this juncture, Indian crickets greatest unsung hero, V.V.S. Laxman, rose to the occasion and helped his side pull off a miracle win against Australia.           
	Ignoring back pain, which had prevented him from fielding during the Australian innings, Laxman took the battle to his opponents. The Mohali pitch was not an easy one to bat on, especially on the final day. The bounce was uneven and Laxmans back injury prevented him from using his feet effectively. In spite of this, he seemed to be at ease and played shots to all corners of the ground. He also regularly found gaps in the field that was set for him. His sublime strokes bore evidence of his timing and placement. Laxman is undoubtedly one of the best Test batsmen India has ever produced, and his records speak for himself. His performance against Australia is mind-boggling. No wonder the Aussies consider him their nemesis.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Chirag Mandal, Howrah

      
	Girish Ghosh erratum  
	The review of the book, Girish Chandra Ghosh: A Bohemian devotee of Sri Ramakrishna, has an error. The sentence, In a book of nearly 500 pages only about a 100 are concerned with Girishs life with Ramakrishna and his disciples, should correctly read, In a book of nearly 500 pages only about a 100 are concerned with Girishs involvement with the Bengali stage, the rest of the book is concerned with Girishs life with Ramakrishna and his disciples. The error is regretted.

	A culture in transition is a curious creature. Its awareness is fresh and flexible, eager to take on a new world, while it simultaneously holds on to some inherited notions by the tips of its fingers as if not to be swept away. The governments attitude to the protection of women from sexual harassment at the workplace bill, 2010 shows all the symptoms of this turbulence. The bill, expected to turn into a law soon, would give legal grounding to the guidelines defining sexual harassment provided by the Supreme Court in 1997. But in spite of campaigns by mens rights groups and serious reflection in the ministry, the government has decided not to include men in the purview of the bill. The law will only protect women, not only because women are the victims in 99 per cent of sexual harassment cases, but also because no woman in her senses would play with her dignity to settle scores with men.        
	It is actually logical to take the second argument first, for the old notion of womens dignity underlies much of the reasoning behind protective laws of this kind. No one questions the existence of dignity, of whichever gender. But to insert it into the highly competitive environment of the contemporary workplace as a bar against sexual exploitation of men is incongruous for more than one reason. For one, protecting women is not the same as idealizing them. Besides, the thinking here assumes principles other than fairness, and hence dilutes the logic of the proposed legislation. It may be perfectly true that 99 per cent of the victims are women, but why should the law be blind to the remaining one per cent of harassed workers? That is not all. There is also an assumption  old-fashioned again  that sexual harassment is always cross-gender. Yet men can sexually harass men as women can other women  and use their power to extract responses. Indian laws adore repeated amendments: a law with one eye closed will need several to include every possibility.

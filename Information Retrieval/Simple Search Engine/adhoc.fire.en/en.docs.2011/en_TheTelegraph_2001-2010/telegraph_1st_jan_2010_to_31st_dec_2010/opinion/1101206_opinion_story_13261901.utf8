                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STILL WAITING                                                    
	The visit of the French first couple to India began on an exciting note. The first lady, Carla Bruni, eager to see the Taj Mahal, threw officials into a tizzy. The scheduled visit to the monument had to be changed abruptly, and tourists were unceremoniously cleared off the premises by security personnel. Ms Brunis husband, President Nicolas Sarkozy, was more considerate. He introduced a number of major proposals for Indo-French collaboration in the fields of higher education, climate change and satellite research. Apart from pledging support for Indias civil nuclear energy projects, he warmly reiterated his countrys endorsement of Indias bid to gain a permanent seat in the United Nations security council. The same sentiment had been expressed by the president of the United States of America, Barack Obama, during his recent Indian tour. As Frances support for Indias inclusion in the UNSC predates Washingtons, Mr Sarkozys gesture may, at best, be regarded as correct. But expressions of goodwill, especially in the diplomatic world, are never simple, and often turn out to be harbingers of significant events.        
	The import of Mr Sarkozys comments cannot be divested of a larger geopolitical context. For instance, the convergence of a number of opinions on India, offered by both the French and the US presidents, is likely to send out a warning sign to defiant China  the only member of the P-5 in the UNSC that has steadfastly opposed Indias aspirations to become a recognized member of the international high table. Clearly, Indias strategic importance is becoming increasingly obvious to the Western powers, trying their best to fight the menace of terrorism. Mr Sarkozy, like his American counterpart, minced no words in deploring the potentially destabilizing effect of Pakistan on world politics and actively sought Indias help to combat Islamic fundamentalism. However, India cannot allow itself to gloat over what can only be described as polite words from a foreign dignitary. As of now, Mr Sarkozys comment is no more than an overture to a dream that is unlikely to turn into reality overnight. The French president may have also been aware of this truth when he wished for India a fuller role in the G-20 even as he quickly bracketed the country with Brazil, South Africa, Japan, Germany and the Arab world.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From murder to mockery
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FROM MURDER TO MOCKERY                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	We hope Airtel follows up on its inaugural Lifestage festival  not because we need another theatre festival, of which we have plenty, but because of the idea behind it, providing a platform for new or comparatively unknown groups from all cities, whom we never get to see otherwise. Except for one Mumbai production that had already come here (Akvarious awfully misogynistic All about Women), young representatives arrived from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. Besides, Lifestage also encouraged original drama (five out of seven shows), therefore supporting writers too.        
	The best and the worst belonged to Calcutta. It gives me great pleasure to welcome Story Teller (the only non-English participant) into the fold of Bengali theatre, for 221B Baker Street promises to bring a sea change to its visual dimension. Rarely have I seen as elaborate and expensive a set as Saumik-Piyalis for a Bengali play, recreating two levels of a home with aesthetic flair and architectural solidity.        
	The top floor runs from wing to wing, a very difficult structure to erect on stage. Its clutter of piled books (picture) gives the protagonists library great character, while the main actions occur on the lower floor.        
	Arindam Mukherjees debut script and direction entertain unapologetically as a would-be murder mystery, and largely succeed. An internationally famous intellectual loves detective fiction passionately, and begins to think that someone may want to kill him. His admiration for Sherlock Holmes makes him try to prevent the crime himself, with the usual twists that ensue. Two loopholes exist: why do his friends leave without even asking him to see a doctor when he falls violently sick, and how can he possibly suspect someone for her intelligence when she herself displays it quite openly?        
	After a long gap, I felt fully satisfied with a Debshankar Halder performance  no overacting, and just right for the lead part. Among other noteworthy portraits, Surajit Banerjee acts the tipsy doctor zestfully, and Bindia Ghosh the maid with a lackadaisical air. Joy Sens lighting makes the set come alive. If only the discovery of the culprit was not so obvious.        
	Evam, an established outfit in Chennai, dramatized Chetan Bhagats 5 Point Someone faithfully, which means that those who liked the book enjoyed the play, whereas those who did not began to trickle out midway. The production took longer than it should have (a regular complaint about youth drama, as with the other two under review), beginning to look and sound like anyones college past, which has its appealing side, but the commonplace can also become boring in patches. Sunil Vishnu K. directed with a commendably empty set, a stark contrast to 221B Baker Street, placing the full burden on his cast of three friends, who carried off their roles ably.        
	The Actor Factor Theatre Company (Delhi) worked dead seriously on The Leela Tapes, its treatment of a real case from 1980 when Leela Mitra went to meet Adrian Pillai, a prisoner convicted of child abuse, because she wanted revenge on her neighbour who had raped her. Both incidents are disclosed only toward the end to retain the surprise, the play consisting of the conversations as the two get to know each other. Director Sunit Sinha has four men enacting Pillai and two women for Mitra, in an intensely physical style that prolongs the drama perhaps more than the text allows for.        
	But that still proved preferable to its rank opposite, Theatrecians puerilely farcical Indianization of Woody Allens God. Never a major dramatist, Allen gave absurdism a schoolboyish touch in this 1975 skit about two Greeks (shades of Didi and Gogo) futilely attempting to put on a play in which, ultimately, nothing happens and the Zeus ex machina (shades of Godot) simply collapses. Even their names, Diabetes and Hepatitis, indicate the juvenile level of his humour.        
	Kanak Guptas direction turns whatever little existential spark it had into adolescent priapism, fails to find equivalents for Allens few funny sequences like Groucho Marx chasing Blanche DuBois, stretches the one-act slapstick beyond toleration, and wastes Deborshi Barats talent unpardonably  the only genuine laugh arising from Barats expression when, despite his pleas, the smoke machine obscures him completely.

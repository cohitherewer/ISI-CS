	Oh dear. I abandoned the minutiae of English grammar 60 years ago, when my schoolboy brain was redirected to Latin and Greek. But heres a reader asking what distinguishes the present participle of a verb from the gerund, or verbal noun, as some grammarians call it. Its a complex question.        
	The two look identical: running for the train (participle), I tripped and running is good for you (gerund). Thats because English has turned both an old Germanic ending and an old Latin one into a single English -ing. But the meanings differ.        
	We all know the participle: it says what people or things are doing. We often misuse it, however, as in walking down the street, theres a bookshop. Wrong: its you walking, not the bookshop. That hanging participle is now agreed to be an error. But it is centuries old. The ghost of Hamlets father says, sleeping in my orchard, a serpent stung me. And a few participles can stand on their own: talking of trains or seeing the trains jam-packed, why not go by bike?        
	The gerund is just as familiar, though its grammatical name is not. Its a noun formed from the verb, often as a general term like running, thinking or eating. But it is an odd kind of noun: it can be modified by an adverb, and may have an object, as if it were a verb. So not just can we say eating is enjoyable, but also quietly eating mangoes is better still.        
	The gerund began life in Latin, where it ended -andum or -endum. The Romans had a gerundive too, an adjective usually implying that-must-be-done. The orator, Cato, would finish his speeches delenda est Carthago, Carthage must be destroyed (as it duly was: like later superpowers, ancient Rome wasnt too worried what or whom it deleted).        
	This Latin lives on in todays mutatis mutandis (having-been-altered [those things] that-must-be-altered), and in the old private-school play on the trade-name of a popular sharpening stone, illegitimis non Carborundum, dont let the ba****** grind you down. It has also given us agenda, addenda and memorandum, things-to-be-done/added-on/remembered. The gerundive was also used, minus any must idea, in Latins parallel to eating mangoes; as in the Vatican department, de propaganda fide (about spreading the faith), which gave us propaganda.        
	English has no gerundive to complicate life. But we have our own problems. Not just are our gerund and participle spelt alike, but at times its unclear which were using. Eating is enjoyable, thats plainly a gerund. Running to the station, I tripped, a participle. But what about women voting was a new idea or the idea of women voting? Are those participles? Or gerunds, which, as nouns, need womens not women?        
	The great H.W. Fowler insisted on womens in all such phrases. He concocted a crafty sentence, I dislike my best friend violating my privacy. It isnt your friend you dislike, its his busting in on you. So write my best friends. Fair enough, in that case. But move on from the idea of... to the thought of... and then the sight of women voting. At least that third voting is surely a participle.        
	Fowler called it a fused participle, as if the phrase were women-voting, and railed against it. But even in his day other experts disagreed, and the latest revision of his Modern English Usage gives calmer advice. After personal nouns or names, today we mostly treat the -ing word as a gerund; so, eg, the babys crying woke her. After other nouns, its usually a participle: Im tired of trains running late, not trains. As between, say, me walking and my walking (ie, pronoun + participle or possessive + gerund), take your pick. But if that me or my is the first word of the phrase, make it my. Always, Id add, look at the meaning. The sight of him driving away was a relief: a participle. But if youre using the -ing word in a general sense, make it a gerund: my wife admires my driving. Well, lets say.

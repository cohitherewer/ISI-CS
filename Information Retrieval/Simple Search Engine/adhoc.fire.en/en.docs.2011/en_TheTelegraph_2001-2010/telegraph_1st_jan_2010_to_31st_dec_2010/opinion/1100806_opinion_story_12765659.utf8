	The Crimson Throne By Sudhir Kakar, Viking, Rs 450        
	It is good that Sudhir Kakar clarified one of his reasons for writing this book during its launch in New Delhi last month. He said that he likes experimenters in religion, such as Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda  who had occasioned his book, Ecstasy, in 2003  and Dara Shukoh, Emperor Shah Jahans eldest son, who is one of the chief players in The Crimson Throne. If one had not been informed of Kakars penchant for experimenters, it would have been difficult to fathom why he suddenly chose to devote so many pages to Daras rather unremarkable attempts,  la his great-grandfather, Akbar, at creating a syncretic religion that brought together aspects of Muslim and Hindu beliefs.        
	The Crimson Throne attempts to infuse life into historical figures such as Shah Jahan and his sons, mainly Dara and Aurangzeb, by speaking in the voices of two foreign travellers, Franois Bernier and Niccolao Manucci, both of whom visited the Mughal court in the 17th century and witnessed the deadly family intrigues first-hand. But there is perhaps more life in these travellers original accounts than in Kakars imaginative recreation. Evidently, Kakars aim is to make characters of these two writers as well. The incidents on which they comment are essentially the same, but they react to them quite differently, thus creating an interplay of perspectives.        
	From his accounts, Manucci emerges as the man of emotions  he blends easily with hoi polloi, visiting brothels, taking Indian lovers, entering the tutelage of a Hindu medicine man, Vaidraj, to be educated in the secret science of aphrodisiacs that was much in demand in the Mughal court. Predictably, Bernier is his exact opposite. He assumes a lofty pose from the very beginning  My purpose throughout this account... is instruction and elevation rather than amusement and diversion. A follower of Descartes, he uses reason to separate truth from the chaff of fancy produced by the populace, and is dull, as perhaps intended by Kakar. What is presumably inadvertent is that Manucci is as wooden as Bernier is. Manuccis sexual escapades are not enough to make him the voice of passion, just as the unsympathetic analyses of the native ways of life are not sufficient to make Bernier the representative of cold logic.         
	In fact, instead of coming across as separate individuals, Manucci and Bernier both sound like Kakar. They not only describe the same incidents but also seem to speak the same language. As a result, to read The Crimson Throne is to get stuck in a narrative that simply refuses to move forward, as one narrator repeats what the other says with slight variations.         
	Living up to his reputation as a psychoanalyst, Kakar occasionally reflects on psycho-sexual themes such as the politics of torture, the obsession of Hindus with defecation or the unsanitary habits of Westerners. These constitute mini tracts that sit uneasily with the tedious descriptions of Mughal life. After remembering Foucault and Freud, Kakar turns to Eco and The Name of the Rose. So we have Aurangzeb trying to do away with his eldest sister, Jahanara Begum, by sending her a book with poisoned pages. Manuccis friend, the deformed monk and healer, Luigi, is perhaps a tribute to Salvatore  Behind his shy smile and a mouthful of crooked yellowing teeth hid the gentlest of hearts. Kakar could have borrowed some of the thematic complexities of The Name of the Rose rather than its characters and ploys. But, maybe, experimenters in semantics do not interest Kakar as much as experimenters in religion do.                          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

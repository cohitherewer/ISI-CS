                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Beyond the borders                  
	Sir  The Bangladesh prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, is scheduled to pay a visit to India shortly (Great expectations, Jan 5). I hope this opportunity will be utilized by the leaders of both countries to sort out some outstanding issues in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.           
	Bangladesh and India have inseparable cultural and historical links. The governments of both these countries have maintained a healthy and friendly relationship most of the time. However, certain issues continue to remain unresolved.          
	First and foremost, India and Bangladesh must admit to the need for strengthening ties between the two nations. This can be possible only if both sides keep the promises they make to each other. Honouring the 1974 border demarcation agreement, Bangladesh had promptly transferred Berubari to India. India should act in a similar manner, and transfer the Tinbigha corridor to Bangladesh as per the agreement.          
	Next, an urgent solution is needed to stop the killings that take place regularly across the Indo-Bangladesh border. Also, a bilateral meeting should be organized at the highest level to ascertain how badly the Tipaimukh dam project in Manipur will affect Bangladesh and parts of northeastern India. None of this can happen unless both sides are transparent in their dealings and agree to make the relevant data available to each other.           
	Another pressing issue is that of determining the maritime boundaries between the two countries under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.          
	I hope both the governments will rise to the occasion and bring about the necessary changes in their approaches so that bilateral ties between India and Bangladesh can become an inspiration to other parts of the world.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	For justice          
	Sir  The editorial, Just too little (Dec 26), asks a pertinent question: Why did it take 19 years for a molestation case to reach sentencing? Ruchika Girhotra killed herself three years after the former director-general of the Haryana police, S.P.S. Rathore, molested her. Ruchikas friend, Aradhana Prakash, and her parents have been fighting relentlessly for justice for Ruchika. The courage and grit that they have shown through these years deserve applause.           
	The culprit, Rathore, on the other hand, has taken full advantage of his privileged position in the police force to bend the rules. In evading the law, he has received active support from the politicians who were in power when this incident took place.          
	The judiciary too cannot escape blame for its inability to deliver a verdict on the case even after nearly two decades. The law and order mechanism was reduced to a sham as Rathore got away with a mere six months in jail and a paltry fine of Rs 1,000 for molesting a teenager. A democracy in which speedy justice is not available to the common people will one day be responsible for its own downfall. Ruchikas case has highlighted the need for prompt dispensation of justice as well as the protection of the victim and key witnesses. More importantly, it underlines the necessity of drafting legal provisions to treat child abuse as a special case so that offenders can be punished severely. The editorial is right in saying that in India the establishment will go to any lengths to protect a political favourite. As long as this practice continues, tragedies such as Ruchikas will recur.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabhjot K., Chandigarh 

                
	Sir  It is shocking that the Haryana government promoted S.P.S Rathore to the post of director-general of police in 1994 despite the fact that Rathore had been indicted in 1990 by an internal police inquiry on the molestation of 14-year-old Ruchika Girhotra (Father finger at Chautala, Dec 25). The then chief minister of Haryana, Om Prakash Chautala, and his party, the Indian National Lok Dal, are now trying to absolve themselves of charges of complicity with the police in the harassment of the Girhotra family, especially the inhuman torture of Ruchikas brother, Aashu.          
	After years of legal and political dribbling, the punishment awarded by the court to Rathore seems absurdly inadequate.           
	There is no doubt that most of our political leaders are corrupt and that the legal system is largely dysfunctional. It is heartening to see that a large section of the media and the common people still retains a strong sense of justice. They should continue to act together to enforce human rights by asking for punishments befitting the crime of offenders such as Rathore.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As a well-known legal luminary, Abha Rathore, the wife of S.P.S Rathore, is fully justified in defending her husband in the Ruchika Girhotra molestation case (Picture of grace and disgrace, Dec 31). Given the furore that now surrounds the incident, it seems that the media are conducting a trial of their own. There is hardly any need to play up the issue of S.P.S. Rathores lawyer. It is not uncommon for dreaded terrorists, drug peddlers, murderers, rapists and the like to use the services of noted lawyers to defend themselves in court. Abha Rathore is perfectly within her rights in representing her husband. The criticism of her actions by some womens rights activists is unfair and uncalled for.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

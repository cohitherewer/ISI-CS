	Awake, arise                  
	Sir  The observation that the editorial, Bold move (Dec 14), makes about corruption in public life  that everyone talks about it, but few would do anything to fight it  holds true not only for politicians but also for the common man. The reason for this is simple. To protest against corruption is to hit out at a powerful party and its influential leader and become an invariable target of their wrath. Thankfully, Nitish Kumar has made this tough task easier for the people of his state by moving against the quota-raj in his second term as chief minister of Bihar.           
	Unfortunately, what this socialist leader can do, his communist counterpart in neighbouring West Bengal cannot even dream of. Kumar has realized that he needs to start afresh if he has to do something worthwhile in Bihar, and that the first road-block to development is corruption. This realization has not dawned on Bengals chief minister, who continues to pour old wine into a new bottle in all matters of policy. The reason for this is, again, not difficult to fathom. The priority for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is the uplift of his own party. With the administration divided in its loyalty to the party and the people, corruption, naturally, has become supreme. While Kumar has risen above the party to offer apolitical governance to his people, the West Bengal chief minister is still curled up in deep sleep on the lap of his party.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Jiban Krishna Paul, Natna, Nadia 

                
	Sir  Nitish Kumar has set a refreshing example at a time multiple scandals have hit the nation hard. He has decided to put an end to the corruption in Bihar and rejuvenate its moribund administration by abolishing the quota of development funds allotted to legislators. His vision is no less than that of a statesman. The editorial, Bold move, brings out this aspect in a pragmatic manner. There is no doubt that the emphatic poll verdict has emboldened Kumar, who wisely avoided revolutionary ventures in his first innings as chief minister of Bihar.           
	It is well known that most state and parliamentary legislators under-utilize the quota fund owing to their lack of imagination or their lackadaisical attitude. A worse aspect is the misuse of these funds, which are distributed among henchmen for the various favours rendered by them. Kumars brave proposal to do away with the system in his state will make him the forerunner in the crusade against corruption. Public funds can then be utilized more purposefully by a sincere government for development. Whether other states will follow Kumars example is anybodys guess. But his example must have sent a chilling message to corrupt politicians and bureaucrats throughout the nation.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Adhip Kumar Bose, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  By deciding to scrap the quota for development funds and clamp down on corrupt officials, Nitish Kumar has once again proved his mettle. The move will go a long way in instilling confidence in the people of the state. Kumar, certainly, is a man of action and does not believe in hoodwinking the people with cheap gimmicks. I agree with the editorial, Bold move, that Kumars initiative will have a major impact in a state that had become a byword for the worst kind of misrule and corruption.           
	Over the years, Bihar has seen criminals playing the role of political leaders for personal gains. The states politicians have cared little for development or for the welfare of the electorate. Their reign of terror had made it impossible for the people to voice their fears or dissent. Kumars move to abolish the quota for development funds for legislators will make it nearly impossible to misappropriate public money. It will also make it imperative for legislators to work harder.           
	They will have to deliver the goods if they want votes. Kumars latest move to open schools with resources confiscated from corrupt individuals is also laudable. It will not only send the right message to the unscrupulous lot, but will also help spread literacy in the state and give children greater access to education.           
	One can only hope that the chief minister succeeds in his endeavour to eradicate corruption and change the mindset of politicians. However, the cooperation of bureaucrats and other professionals will be crucial to Kumars dream of building a corruption-free Bihar.                     
	Yours faithfully,

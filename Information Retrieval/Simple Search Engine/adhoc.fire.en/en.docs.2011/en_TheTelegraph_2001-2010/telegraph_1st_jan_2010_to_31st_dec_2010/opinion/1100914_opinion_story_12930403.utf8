                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Nothing moves                  
	Sir  Bandhs have become a part of life in West Bengal. As Suhel Seth points out in Blame it on tolerance (Sept 8), bandhs had even been a part of childhood for some. The front-page picture and headline in The Telegraph on September 8 also indicated that it now takes as little as Rs 210 to enforce a bandh. Bandhs serve no effective political purpose although politicians claim that they are proof of public support. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) may be resorting to this strategy more frequently, now that it is facing political reverses. It is important to remember that except for the Centre of Indian Trade Unions in West Bengal, all other trade unions in the country had opted for an industrial strike to protest against the Centres anti-people policies. Instead of taking issues like foreign direct investment, divestment of public sector units and labour-law reforms to the streets, the Left could have debated them in Parliament.           
	The bandh, which inconvenienced common people, was particularly hard on the Muslim community as it fell during the holy month of Ramzan. One hears that certain Muslim-dominated areas in Calcutta were exempt from the bandh on this occasion. But in Burdwan, where there are no such clearly demarcated minority-dominated areas, people were forced to rush to the Ranigunj market for their last-minute shopping prior to Eid. But they were left disappointed as the shops remained shut even there. One shudders to think of the commercial loss that was incurred.           
	Given that the law and order machinery is fully under the control of the ruling Left, the man on the street has nowhere to go. There were scores of reports stating that even those willing to work were prevented from reporting for duty even as the police watched the goings-on silently. This is shameful. We need more judicial activism to control the menace of bandhs.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat, Burdwan 

                
	Sir  I completely agree with Suhel Seths observations. The one thing that Seth overlooks is that the people are also party to the crime in question as they themselves have elected politicians, who, Seth argues, are abunch of jokers. Of course, one can say that there is very little to choose from. Even then, I feel that the lack of education and awareness plays a part. People have become so indifferent to abuses of power that they fail to check those who want to be in power to gather as much money and fame as possible. It is time the Election Commission granted the none-of-the-above option to voters. Only then would politicians stop taking voters for a ride.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Suhel Seth has expressed a common anguish felt against political parties. There is no point in dragging the matter to court or to have more court orders passed against bandhs.We know that nothing can stop politicians from doing what they wish to. Moreover, it does not even require a plastic chair and the red flag to paralyze life in the city. A few bricks can do the same job at no cost at all.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I agree with every word and sentiment expressed by Suhel Seth. Yet another bandh is yet another day lost, and yet another step back for West Bengal. The overuse and misuse of bandhs, which were once a powerful political weapon, have blunted their efficacy. Yet, West Bengals politicians never grow tired of calling bandhs. Seth has termed those who resort to brute force to stop people from going about their business as goons. I would go a step further and call bandh enforcers terrorists. The sway of these people points to the total failure of the constitutional machinery and of the state administration in West Bengal. It is most unfortunate that we have tolerated these terrorists for over three decades, and even now continue to let them ruin our lives. Never have we, the citizens of Calcutta for example, collectively risen in protest against a bandh, a rasta roko or other kinds of disruptions.           
	The consequences of our inaction are there for all of us to see. Calcutta today is the worst place for doing business or for anything meaningful and productive. It is no longer a dying city. It is virtually dead  the cumulative result of putting the interests of self-centred political parties ahead of those of the state and its people. It would take a Herculean effort to turn things around. What has been undone in over three decades cannot be repaired in a decade.           
	But perhaps the most alarming truth about the bandh culture is that the young people of Calcutta who were either born or have grown up in an environment of sloth, inefficiency, disruptions, irresponsible behaviour and a total disregard for the rule of law do not know any better.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Rupnarayan Bose, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Suhel Seth calls the present-day politicians of West Bengal a bunch of jokers who have kept us in captivity. I beg to differ. Far from being spineless, selfish and opportunistic, they work sincerely for the entertainment of the people. People enjoy their acts, and are often compassionate towards them. On a more serious note, I would, however, agree with Seth. We are indeed at the mercy of these pranksters. Bengal will need another renaissance to liberate itself from the tyranny of these men.           
	Yours faithfully,       
B.K. Chakraborty, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is strange that West Bengal alone should be so vulnerable to the call of a bandh. Perhaps the people of this state have reconciled themselves to such an eventuality, and that is why they seldom resist it, especially the salaried class. Can we expect some change from the leaders of the party waiting to come to power?           
	Yours faithfully,

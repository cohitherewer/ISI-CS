                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TECHNOLOGY IS HERE TO STAY                                BOOKWISE                                    
	If you look at the latest editions of the two most authoritative and comprehensive reference books on publishing, the MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing (third edition), and The Chicago Manual of Style (16th edition), usually referred to as the Manual, one point stands out clearly: it is the developments in printing and communications technology that have driven all the changes in the publishing world in the first decade of the 21st century.         
	And the changes are reflected in the choice of titles, in language, style and presentation, which have been made much more user-friendly for a globalized world. Both books have evolved to meet the readers changing requirements, and the latest editions have been significantly revised, reorganized and expanded to reflect the way publishing professionals work in the digital age. The important changes are reflected in guidelines for preparing electronic files: simplified citation format for electronic sources, updated chapters on copyright, fair use, contracts and legal issues that have been turned upside-down because of the internet and information highways, which have no clear ownership and are almost impossible to police. There are expanded sections on electronic rights, an introduction to barcodes and tables with barcode numbers and a thorough overview of their electronic make-up.        
	The sections on the publishing process outline all the standard elements of books and journals, including illustrations and tables and the process of preparing a manuscript for publication. Here the emphasis is on electronic files and the kind of software to use to format the page according to the publishers instructions. Because publishers now expect authors to provide them with both the typed copy and its electronic version, the latter will be especially useful as computer applications become more common in the production process.        
	The second and the longest section in the Manual concerns style and usage; and the third pronounces on such matters as indexing of notes and bibliographies. Preparing indexes and reading lists has always been a tedious process for authors. But with the necessary software, the task has been made easier now. Google Search has also made the preparation of reading lists much simpler.        
	The attention of both the MLA and the Manual has been limited to the fundamentals of publishing as they have changed with the introduction of large-scale computer technology. But there is a note of caution: the knowledge of computer applications has to be acquired  it is not something that can be picked up on the job without trial and error.         
	The MLA has also included a section on copyright and computer networks, defamation and the right of privacy, because hackers have crashed into the most heavily-guarded websites.         
	The new technologies are here to stay and will affect the entire publishing process in years to come. Many more books will come  better designed and laid-out  but whether they will be better informed, with a richer editorial content, will depend on how the old-timers handle the new challenges. The past is never quite past.       RAVI VYAS

	Amrita Sher-gil: A Self-Portrait in Letters and Writings (2 volumes) Tulika, Rs 5,750        
	Too many beautiful photographs, sexual gossip, patrician allure, a mysterious early death, and persistent familial mediation stand in our view of Amrita Sher-Gils art and life. So, when this handsome, two-volume collection of her letters and critical writing  prologued, epilogued, annotated and edited by her sisters son and artist, Vivan Sundaram  calls itself a self-portrait, the ironies of Amritas selfhood, its expressions, effacements and eruptions, become disturbingly poignant. Relentlessly photographed throughout her 28-year-long life by her luxuriously melancholic and self- absorbed father, Umrao Singh Sher-Gil (Your anxious father, USG and Your sinful daughter, Amri were how they signed off sometimes), or by a succession of gentlemen-in-waiting, to be archived by her kin for endless takes and re-takes, Amrita never quite managed to keep her own legendary narcissism for herself. Yet, what does not take long to emerge from this editions heavy brocade of lineage and ancestry, personal communications and scholarship, woven along these letters, is a voice extraordinarily in touch with the vagaries and imperatives of its own quick ripening. Amrita unabashedly enjoyed being looked at. But her letters also show how her own gaze was never less than formidably direct, fearless and unflinching. And this is as true of the practical, or larger moral, questions of her existence as of her continual evaluation of herself as an artist.        
	In September, 1934, after a five-year stay in Paris with her parents and younger sister, Indira, during which Amrita completed her studies at the cole Nationale des Beaux-Arts, she wrote an endless letter from Hungary to Umrao Singh and her Hungarian mother, Marie Antoinette, explaining why she must return to India. Written when she was barely 21, this letter speaks with a clarity and an authority that set the predominant tone of her letters, even when they confront her own frailties, against the tide of which her clearheadedness struggled to keep itself alive and kicking: I wish to return primarily in the interest of my artistic development. I now need new sources of inspiration and here you will perceive Duci [her father], how utterly mistaken you are when you speak of our lack of interest in India [she is also speaking for her sister]... Our long stay in Europe has aided me to discover, as it were, India. Modern Art has led me to the comprehension amp; appreciation of Indian painting amp; sculpture. It seems paradoxical but I know for certain that had we not come away to Europe I should perhaps never have realized that a fresco from Ajanta or a small piece of sculpture in the Muse Guimet [now the Muse Nationale des Arts Asiatiques in Paris] is worth more than the whole Renaissance! In short, now I wish to go back to appreciate India at its worth... I was rather sad to realise that you place the conservation of your good name above your affection for us. I was also disappointed to know what a place of importance you give to the bickering of public opinion... I dont in the least consider myself an immoral person and I am not immoral... Besides, I think you are rather dramatising the situation (a thing you are apt to do at times) when you say that the ruin of your good name is synonymous with our returning to India. Fools amp; mischief-makers will always talk, even if one doesnt give them food for it. And there are narrow-minded prejudiced amp; fanatical people all over the world, in India too (as you found out at your expense), but need one bother about them?         
	This combination of adventurousness, clearly thought through and articulated, with that hard and bitter master, common sense soon becomes an appeal to her fathers higher instincts, but without recourse to self-righteousness or emotional blackmail: Dear Duci, of course you are right about being unselfish, I knew that a long time ago. Even from the selfish point of view it is best to be unselfish, although it is a rather sad symptom that we cant be unselfish for unselfishnesss sake, if even in the one human virtue that is based on disinterestedness one is not disinterested. One begins to understand, at these remarkably wise and mature moments in the letters, what her closest friend in India, Helen Chamanlal, meant when she said that Amritas promiscuity often was a curiously generous impulse.        
	The high-handed refusal to suffer fools and bigots, fear of the triumph of mediocrities or of social, intellectual and sexual boredom in barren Delhi and social Simla paralysing her capacity to work  these co-exist in Amritas letters with the crystal-clear, loving-stern shepherding of parents, sibling, lovers and friends. She takes on her mothers (eventually fatal) depression and deviousness with money, her fathers difficult mix of remoteness and meddling, her sisters hypersensitiveness, and her lovers or Hungarian cousin- husbands resentments and ineffectualities. Alongside all this, there is the challenge, impossible to resolve once and for all, of striking a balance between inspiration and rigour in her own painting, to understand critically how the different schools of Indian art stood in relation to one another or to Indian and Western traditions of art, and to work out how she might position herself in relation to these and what to do with her own legacy of French academicism.        
	So the work of the artist becomes as much the forging of a critical language and style that would revitalize the existing  and, according to Amrita, moribund  ways of viewing and writing about art, as the actual creation of her art itself. She did this through articles and lectures, including one on Indian cinema and a projected lecture she did not live to deliver on how art was affected by the war, which had unsettled and bleakened her own last years. She also worked at a series of friendships  as with the critic and historian of Indian art, Karl Khandalavala  the intensities of which were sustained primarily through the sharing of art, music, writing and travel. As she travelled through India, right down to Cape Comorin, in order to see some of its real places and to show her own work, the revelatory impact of Ajanta, Ellora, Mahabalipuram or the Mattancheri frescos in Cochin became fully meaningful for her only after the experience was written about to Karl or other kindred spirits.        
	One such spirit was Nehru. They discovered, but never quite reached, each other in the course of their respective discoveries of India. I should like to have known you better, she wrote him in 1937, after he sent her his autobiography, I am always attracted to people who are integral enough to be inconsistent without discordancy, and who dont trail viscous threads of regret behind them I dont think you were interested in my painting really, you looked at my pictures without seeing them I like your face, it is sensitive, sensual and detached at the same time.        
	The pleasures and illumination afforded by a life in letters, therefore, arise precisely from this sense of intensities and anxieties realized, or most fully apprehended, when written about to somebody else. This produces a peculiar fusion of sensation and thought, as in Van Goghs letters to his brother Theo, a selection of which Amrita read more than once and treasured. To come upon the silence and desolation of Ellora; to saturate oneself in Beethoven, Bach, Bach, Beethoven; to enjoy the fantastically subtle amp; slow rhythm of Prousts style in a state of complete though receptive void; to create, as one paints, a medley of hot colour with all the desire, the greed almost that comes after a long abstinence  it is only through the compulsion to tell that each of these experiences reaches its most significant form.        
	Writing to her sister in March 1941, a few months before her death, Amrita speaks of being in the grips of disruptive forces that are at once personal, historical and elemental: The chaos amp; darkness of the lives of individuals, the wars, earthquakes, floods, all seem to be indefinably interconnected. We are not alone. I see it everywhere. Her writing had somehow beaten her art to such a vision of things, tragic but strangely consoling too  before they both ran out of time.

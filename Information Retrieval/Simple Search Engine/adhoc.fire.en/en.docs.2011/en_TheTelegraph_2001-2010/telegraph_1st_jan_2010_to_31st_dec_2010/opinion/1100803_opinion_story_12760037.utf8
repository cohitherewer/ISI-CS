	True legend                  
	Sir  I completely agree with Sourav Gangulys comment that Muttiah Muralitharan is more difficult to play than Shane Warne (Murali tougher to face than Warne: Sourav, July 24).           
	The reasons behind Gangulys point of view are not far to seek. First, Muralitharan had fine-tuned his attack against all kinds of batsmen, even against those from the subcontinent who have a reputation for playing spin well. Warne, in this respect, has failed miserably. The Aussie has grabbed most of his wickets against England, but given the number of chances he had, Warne has clearly not been able to mesmerize batsmen from the subcontinent with his wizardry. Second, Warne did not have to face the odds that Muralitharan did. The Australians repeatedly alleged that Muralitharan was a chucker. But the resolute spinner passed the rigorous tests conducted by the International Cricket Council. His bowling career could have been ruined had he not shown the courage and determination to fight the odds. Third, in 133 Tests, Muralitharan claimed as many as 800 wickets, and if one were to add the 515 wickets he took in the shorter version of the game, his final tally would be 1,315, which is higher than the number of wickets Warne has taken in his international career. Thus, statistically speaking, Muralitharan is well ahead of his rival.           
	Stalwarts like Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara have reportedly rated Muralitharan higher than Warne. Given that these two great batsmen have faced both spinners, the prowess of the Sri Lankan bowler should require no further attestation.           
	Yours faithfully, Indranil Sanyal, Calcutta      
n Sir  Trust Muttiah Muralitharan to bowl a doosra after retiring from Test cricket, that too against fellow spin legend, Bishen Singh Bedi (Murali, Bedi in slanging match, July 29). Bedi had said years ago that even if Muralitharan did not chuck, he needed to be shown how to bowl. A similar remark was made by Ted Corbett, who said that all his instincts from half-a-century of experience on the field told him that Muralitharans action was illegal. Years ago, the Australian umpire, Darrell Hair, had no-balled Muralitharan for chucking. But the controversy surrounding Muralis bowling has almost died down since. Agreed that Muralitharans elbow seems to be bent while he bowls, thereby making his deliveries look illegal. But it is his magical wrist that gets the ball to dance to his tunes. We should not forget that constant criticism from cricketers, columnists and umpires had almost killed the career of this versatile cricketer. Muralitharan also went through a correction process, as advised by the ICC, before he was finally cleared. But cricket-lovers may find it difficult to agree with Muralitharans view about Bedi being an ordinary bowler. He may have spoken his mind after a long time, but it would have been better had he chosen to maintain a dignified silence. 

      
	Yours faithfully, Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad             
	Sir  It would be a miracle if any other bowler  slow or fast  ever manages to catch up with Muralitharans haul of 800 Test wickets. It is remarkable that the second highest wicket-taker after him, Shane Warne, has 92 wickets fewer than Muralitharan, while Anil Kumble is almost 200 wickets short of Muralis tally. Muralitharan is the only Asian cricketer to have broken the record of the highest wicket-taker twice  first, by crossing Courtney Walshs 519 Test wickets and then overtaking Warnes record of 708. As the game becomes increasingly batsman-centric, Test cricket remains the only format for an evenly balanced contest between ball and bat. Muralitharan is to cricket what Dhyan Chand is to hockey and Pele to football. Batsmen may not miss him, but the game of cricket surely will.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot           
	Sir  It is common knowledge that after the fodder scandal broke Lalu Prasad quit the chief ministers post, and, in an unprecedented act, thrust his wife, Rabri Devi, to the post of chief minister (Retreat of a relieved Rabri, July 29). That was a black day for the countrys democracy. Thereafter Prasad (mis)ruled Bihar through remote control. The faster the nation can forget this shameful chapter, the better for it because other than bringing disgrace to the nation and promoting corruption, Rabri Devis government did nothing for which it should be remembered.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

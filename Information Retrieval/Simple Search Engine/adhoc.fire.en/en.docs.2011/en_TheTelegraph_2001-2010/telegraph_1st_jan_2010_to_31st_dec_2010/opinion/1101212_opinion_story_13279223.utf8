	Pass through the net                  
	Sir  The nation remains grateful to the Delhi High Court for emphasizing that the National Eligibility Test is essential to maintain uniformity and quality in higher education as different yardsticks are followed by universities while granting degrees of M.Phil or PhD (Crack NET to teach in college: High court, Dec 8). With institutions of learning like the Rayalaseema University, which peddled 2,660 PhD degrees in two years and earned Rs 3 crore, mushrooming all over India, such a ruling had been the need of the hour. India cannot be left in the hands of doctorates from roadside universities.           
	Yours faithfully,         Tapan Pal, Batanagar
        
	Road less travelled          
	Sir  As Abimanyu Nagarajan says in his article, That old road to Burma (Dec 5), a journey down the Stilwell Road, which connects Myanmar, India and China, is no longer a delight these days. This once-famous road is in disrepair because of the negligence of authorities. As a journalist in the Nineties, I have had the opportunity to study the history of the Stilwell Road in some detail. I would like to share some little-known facts about the road.          
	The construction of the Stilwell road is considered to be a rare engineering feat. This is because, till October 1943, the road had barely reached the Pangsau Pass on the India-Myanmar border. Then by January 1945, the road had been laid over a stretch of 427 miles. The workers had made record progress by constructing a mile of the road per day over a route that passes through 102 miles of mountainous terrain. In addition, numerous airfields, feeder roads, pack trails and combat roads were constructed, totalling a distance of several hundred miles.          
	For the first 270 miles, a total of 50,000 cubic yards of earth was excavated. Mud and gravel were hauled to the construction site, sometimes from riverbeds 25 to 30 miles away. From Ledo to Mong-Yu, ten major rivers and 155 secondary streams were bridged (excluding 165 minor streams), averaging one bridge for every three miles of the road length. The total length of the bridges comes to nearly five miles. If the culvert pipes used in the construction are all lined up, they would have a staggering length of 105 miles.          
	There was the Myitkyina Bridge over the Irrawaddy, the longest pontoon bridge in the world. It was constructed by American engineers in 1944, but was dismantled after World War II in 1947. In the swampy plains of Warazup, the road had to be built as high as 15 metres above the mean sea level to save it from floodwaters.          
	The highest point of the road is at Tienatze Miao Po (between Tsuyung and Kunming), which is 9,200 feet above the MSL. The lowest point, the Hwei Tung Bridge over the Salween river (between Lungling and Pao-shan), is 2,900 feet above the MSL.           
	Although not much remains of the historic road today, yet if one drives down the plains of Assams Dibrugarh district, one comes across a dilapidated one-kilometre long airstrip at Ledo and an inspection bungalow of the public works department of Arunachal Pradesh at Margherita (which served as a hospital during World War II).          
	From Jairampur Check Gate to Pangsau Pass in the interiors of Arunachal Pradesh, the notable ruins of the road include a steel Hamilton Bridge and a war cemetery near Jairampur, with graves of soldiers of the Allied Forces. There are also some concrete remains of a massive oil pumping station at Nagmoi point near Jairampur.                    
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TRUE LEGEND                                  Sir Alec Bedser   (1918-2010)                                    
	Adelaide, February 1947. The delivery started from outside the off stump, kept straight for a while, then swerved in and pitched in line with the leg stump and zipped out to smooch the off bail. The off and middle stumps lost their crown. Donald Bradman, the recipient, was astounded and had no answer to the movement. Bradman, ever the gentleman, turned towards the bowler and nodded in appreciation. Alec Bedser, the young bowler, reciprocated the masters gesture with a modest smile.        
	Sydney, December 1954. On the morning of the opening day of the second Test, the English skipper, Len Hutton, took a very difficult decision: he omitted Bedser from the team. None dared to question Huttons decision. Bedser, loyal to the core, did not display any disappointment. As the senior player, he busied himself in motivating the younger bowlers in the dressing room. Bedser, however, had every reason to be upset. Not only was he the worlds premier medium pacer, but he had also helped England wrest the Ashes from the old enemy in the summer of 1953. Neither success nor disappointment seemed to leave a mark on this player who was totally devoted to the team.         
	For a full decade, between 1946 and 1955, Bedser carried Englands bowling attack on his massive frame. He was a medium-pace bowler in the best tradition of English cricket, and he represented the magnificent lineage of Sydney Barnes and Maurice Tate. Cricket-lovers in India would point out correctly that Bedsers variety and canniness resembled Amar Singhs, the magnificent medium pacer from India.        
	Alec Victor Bedser served Surrey from 1939 to 1960. He made his Test debut against India in 1946 and was an immediate success with 11 wickets each in his first two Tests. His glorious career ended after 51 Tests and with 236 wickets at less than 25 runs per wicket. At the time of retirement, he was the highest wicket-taker in Tests, a record that remained unbroken for quite a few years.                
	Gentleman cricketer        
	Bedser was never happy with his own art and craft. Even at the height of his fame, when he helped Surrey to seven consecutive titles, he still never gave the impression of being satisfied. He could swing and cut the ball either way, but his stock delivery was the ball that came in. His mastery over the in-swing was unsurpassed. He also had the ability to make the ball rise to the rib cage for short-leg fieldsmen to pounce on. He had Bradman caught by Hutton in the leg trap no less than three times.        
	The magical delivery that rattled the top of Bradmans off and middle stumps was no accident. Bedser had perfect control over the leg-cutter. He would keep the ball slower than normal so that the batsman could be trapped to turn completely square. He mastered this art, and it presented him with worthy gifts in terms of wickets. Leg-cutters and slow bumpers are not modern-day innovations. Bedser had perfected both deliveries. Bedser relied on change of pace and deviation, but mostly only on his intelligence and tactical execution. He troubled the best of batsmen: Vijay Merchant, Vijay Hazare, Arthur Morris, Lindsay Hassett none could escape Bedsers guile and variety.        
	Bedser was too dignified to resort to gamesmanship. After retirement, he became involved with team selection. For more than two decades, he selected English sides. Once, he even dropped Englands match-winning fast bowler, John Snow, for shoulder-charging Sunil Gavaskar as the latter went for a run. He also served as manager for English teams and administrations. He was closely connected with cricket for more than 50 years. When Bedser was conferred knighthood, people applauded the decision. He was indeed a living legend.

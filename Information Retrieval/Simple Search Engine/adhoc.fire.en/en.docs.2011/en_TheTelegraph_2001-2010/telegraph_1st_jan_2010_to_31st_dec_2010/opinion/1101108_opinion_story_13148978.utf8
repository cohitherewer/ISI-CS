	Children can be victims as well as offenders. And, in the Juvenile Justice Act, anybody under 18 is a child. These two facts give rise to a host of muddled perceptions and practices when it comes to representing children in the media. These muddles, in turn, reflect a societys confusions regarding the nature of childhood, and the unresolved elements in adult moral investments in the idea of a childs innocence and vulnerability. The draft protection of children from sexual offences bill, 2010, prevents reporting on any child involved in an offence without complete and authentic information and without the consent of the child or his or her guardian. This bill also describes a child as an individual under 18. After the Juvenile Justice Acts prohibition of the identification of child offenders by the media, the draft bill gives the media another occasion to reflect on the entire issue of how they could be more sensitive in reporting on and photographing children, victims as well as offenders.        
	It is, for instance, easier to be sensitive and compassionate towards children who are obviously the little victims  that is, when they are evidently pre-pubertal and physically vulnerable. But when it comes to offenders who are closer to the upper age limit  say, a strapping, 17-year-old, male sexual offender and/or murderer, who is still legally a child  the moral responses become more confused. Most laws involving children regulate their relationship to three, necessarily problematic, essentials: sex, labour and education. In each sphere, the adult ethical and legal consciousness looks at the definition of childhood according to a different set of cultural preconceptions. This is reflected in the divergent definitions of childhood in different Indian laws. From the Employment of Children Act, to the various sections of the penal code and code of criminal procedure, to the Child Marriage Restraint Act, the law cannot seem to decide how young or old a person has to be in order to be treated and perceived as a child. The laws indecisiveness and the medias insensitivity are two sides of the same coin.

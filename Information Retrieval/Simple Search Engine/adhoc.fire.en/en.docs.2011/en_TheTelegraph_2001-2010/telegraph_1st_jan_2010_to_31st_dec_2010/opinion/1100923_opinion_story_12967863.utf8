                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DANGER SIGNAL                                                    
	Any system, if abused long enough, will ultimately begin to emit danger signals. Nothing illustrates this better than the embarrassments erupting around the preparations for the Commonwealth Games, heightened recently by the almost symbolic collapse of the hanging footbridge. The claim of Prashant Bhushan, a senior advocate and the son of Shanti Bhushan, the former Union law minister, that half the chief justices in the recent past have been corrupt, is another such danger signal. Only it resonates beyond the fear of international criticism for the upcoming Games; it reflects on the very foundations of democracy. It may be rather dramatic that the former law minister has ranged himself on his sons side, wishing to share the rigours of the contempt case against him. But the aura of slightly filmic drama has not lightened matters. Mr Prashant Bhushan has invoked truth as his defence against the contempt charge, and has submitted an affidavit together with evidence as support. This reportedly mentions impeachment proceedings against two judges that tripped on the want of an adequate number of signatures. And his father has submitted names.        
	Whatever the merits of the charges, they have certainly plunged the judicial institution into an unprecedented situation. Yet it could have been avoided. Transparency in judicial appointments, promotions and transfers has been urged for years. The delay in this reform may perhaps be put down to insufficient judicial will, especially since the higher judiciary tends to protect itself from scrutiny, claiming the privilege of its position. It is precisely this position  of neutrality above politics and vested interests  that should impel openness in order to remove doubt among lesser mortals. Caesars wife has a strenuous existence. That no one is above the law must be demonstrated by the judges themselves: the recent voluntary declaration of assets is a good example. The executive, too, repeatedly passes on the more onerous of its own tasks, such as resolving the Babri Masjid controversy, to the courts, thus drawing the judiciary into the hurly-burly of political interests. Transparency at all levels and firmness on the judiciarys part regarding which cases are acceptable would lessen the scope of corruption charges. The importance of this change in approach cannot be overestimated.

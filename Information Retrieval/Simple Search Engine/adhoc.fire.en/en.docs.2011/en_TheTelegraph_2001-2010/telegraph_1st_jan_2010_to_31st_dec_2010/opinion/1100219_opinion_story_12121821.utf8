	In a case now famous in the history of Indian jurisprudence (Kesavananda Bharti versus State of Kerala, 1973) the Supreme Court propounded the doctrine of basic features of the Constitution. By that hallowed document, which the Indian people gave to themselves, the Indian republic has a federal structure, and law and order was made, and remains, a state subject. Federalism may not exactly be a part of the basic structure of the Constitution in the way it was defined in the context of the above-mentioned case, but it cannot be denied that federalism is fundamental to the Constitution and therefore to the way the Indian political system functions. The idea of federalism may actually be threatened by the Supreme Courts latest pronouncement that constitutional courts can order an enquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation into a serious offence without the consent of the state government. The apex court qualified and restrained its own pronouncement by adding the caveat that such extraordinary powers should be used sparingly and in exceptional circumstances. The caveat does not clarify what would constitute exceptional circumstances and who would decide that such circumstances are actually prevailing. This ambiguity opens up an enormous discretionary space that could prove to be dangerous in less mature hands.        
	There is an even more serious reservation which has been only hinted at above. By striking at the heart of the fact that law and order is a state subject, the Supreme Court, despite all its noble intentions, is posing a threat to democracy. It is suggesting a procedure whose direct implication is a centralization of power in the apex judiciary. The court trails its coat in the admission that it is creating extraordinary powers. This only serves to upset the rather delicate but critical balance that the founding fathers created between the Centre and the states. There is no evident justification for the creation of such extraordinary powers. There is the scope for a public debate on whether this ruling by the Supreme Court is actually in tune with the spirit of the Constitution.        
	In recent years, the Supreme Court has articulated its serious concern about lapses committed by the political class and the executive. It has often, with the best possible intentions, rushed in to compensate for these lapses through suggested guidelines, obiter dicta and so on. These have at times raised the point that the Supreme Court is perhaps going too far and needs to rein itself in by confining its role to the implementation of the laws. Too active a judiciary may not always be the best judiciary in a democracy. There exists a case for reviewing the role and functions of the judiciary. The health of the democracy demands it.

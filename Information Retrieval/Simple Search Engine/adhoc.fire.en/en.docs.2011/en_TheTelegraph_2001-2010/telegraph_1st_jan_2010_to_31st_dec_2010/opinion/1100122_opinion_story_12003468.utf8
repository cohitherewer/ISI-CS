	Armed with greed                  
	Sir  The article, Revealed: What army wont say about Bengal land scam (Jan 13), hides more than it reveals. As a result, the facts about the armys involvement in the land scam remain sketchy. The 72-acre, barren piece of land had been leased to private firms by the Bengal government and was being developed for tea-tourism. This project was stalled due to security concerns: the land, located in the sensitive chickens neck of Bengal, was adjacent to the headquarters of the 33 Corps. The security concerns were well-founded, and the government was in the process of handing over the land to the army. It is therefore baffling that some senior army officers entered into a commercial agreement for the construction of a private school on the site. A large, private educational institution overlooking a corps headquarters provides ample opportunities for security to be compromised. The school could also serve as a base for gathering intelligence and monitoring movements, as well as for espionage.           
	All the available facts indicate deliberate planning and collusion on the part of the erring officers: lieutenant general Avadhesh Prakash and realtor Dilip Agarwal claimed to be family friends, the latter was introduced to other senior officers in the corps in order to facilitate the business venture, a no-objection certificate was signed for the construction of a school under the franchise of Mayo College and, finally, information was suppressed. This makes it evident that security concerns have been knowingly overlooked.           
	Further grounds for suspicion arise from the fact that paragraph 17 was deleted from the draft of the memorandum of understanding that was signed between Agarwal and the 33 Corps headquarters. This paragraph contained the clause that empowered the army to terminate the agreement on security grounds. The elimination of this clause, in effect, gave the carte blanche to the business venture. It is difficult to believe that no favours were granted or promised to the concerned army officers in return for this. The contention, put forward by Agarwal as well as by some sections of the army, that the question of an army land scam does not arise since the army never owned the land to begin with, is a smokescreen to deflect responsibility and escape prosecution. The army headquarters should do more than just issue showcause notices to the offenders.           
	The corruption that has come to light is probably the tip of the iceberg. The rest remains undisclosed, as the defence establishment has always been rather tight-lipped about its dealings. It is only because of the media and certain CAG reports that the public, especially taxpayers, comes to know about such unsavoury episodes in this country.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The feud between the army chief, general Deepak Kapoor, and eastern army commander, V.K. Singh, can do little to improve the latters chances of a promotion (Antony not convinced, Dec 30). Allegations that Singh is taking an undue interest in the case against military secretary and Kapoors top aide, lieutenant-general Avadhesh Prakash, do not hold water. The eastern army commander is deemed to succeed Kapoor, and the ongoing row will not help his case at all.          
	The Rs 300-crore land scam in north Bengal could not have been orchestrated by Prakash alone. It is simply another case of corruption in which army officers have shielded the culprits to prevent other uncomfortable secrets from tumbling out. Singh was only doing his duty when he convened a court of enquiry against Prakash and recommended termination of service on the advice of the judge. Reports on Prakash by another court of enquiry are also being examined. The defence minister, A.K. Antony, must have arrived at a decision about Prakash after careful consideration as it involved the reputation of a very senior officer. In fact, any attempt on Kapoors part to protect his key aide by resisting action against him may raise questions about the army chiefs motives as well.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Sukna land scam has put the armys reputation at stake. High-ranking officers have been implicated in the scam. The episode needs to be investigated thoroughly and the truth of the matter publicized. The last decade has exposed major flaws in the army, in its processes of administration as well as in the character of its personnel.          
	 Corruption seems to be endemic in the army. It has its own method of imposing discipline and dispensing justice which should not be done away with. Accepting its problems will make the army more conscious about correcting its image and facilitating a change for the better.          
	Yours faithfully,

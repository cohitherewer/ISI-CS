	Rape always presents society with a crucial situation against which it must test itself. One manifestation of that in India was the amending of the law against rape in 1983, after the courts had first acquitted two policemen of the charge of raping a minor tribal girl. It was said in extenuation that she was used to sexual intercourse, that she did not cry out, and that her body showed no signs of coercion. The last ignored the possibility that she had been threatened. Since the amendment, the law holds, among other things, that a womans word that she had not consented sufficient as evidence of coercion. Proving innocence thus became largely the job of the accused, a principle that goes against the general thrust of Indian criminal law.        
	It is always difficult to correct an imbalance in a balanced way, and the bias against women in Indian society makes correction even more delicate. In a recent case, the Supreme Court has reportedly said that a woman complaining of rape should be taken at her word and no corroborative evidence need be looked for, because she has to go through great turmoil before making the complaint. The court rejected the appeal by two men charged with the rape of two illiterate women. Their argument was that the women had complained 42 days after the incident, so their testimony could not be accepted without corroborative evidence. The Supreme Courts sensitivity and wisdom, for which true respect is due, may, however, suggest that a woman complaining of rape may not be questioned and that corroborative evidence is unnecessary. Not only would this interpretation of the courts comment suggest that the law is different in the case of raped women, but would also add to the difficulties that rape presents as a crime. Evidence is often elusive, especially if the violated person takes time to complain. Then the police are often unwilling to cooperate, and are slipshod in building up a case. As a result, the rate of conviction is shockingly low. The courts remarks, made in a particular context, may encourage the police to be even more careless, resulting in more undeserving acquittals. No one can be convicted without evidence; else, no innocent person would feel secure. The change in attitude should begin from the ground level of the justice system, where the police should concentrate on seriously investigating each complaint. Imbalances cannot be righted from the top alone.

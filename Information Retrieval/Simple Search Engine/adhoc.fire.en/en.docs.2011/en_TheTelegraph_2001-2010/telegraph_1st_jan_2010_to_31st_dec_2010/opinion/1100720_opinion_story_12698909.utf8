                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT JUST FOR THE FEW                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	If one were to list the horrors that confront us at this moment, the list would make the blood curdle and the mind cringe in disbelief that we have reduced ourselves to this brutalized state. A greedy assault by big business on the land and its wealth, without adherence to any environmental rules, is aided by state governments and the Centre. The people who have our mandate to protect us and enforce the law, as enshrined in the Constitution, are actively condoning deviations from the law.        
	When such a thing happens, society enters the dangerous phase of pure anarchy. Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand are the obvious, profoundly troubled areas. But Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan are simmering too, and could erupt any moment. The issues that have compelled discord and militancy stem from a source of supreme failure: the careless and arrogant administration that ran amok through the many decades post Independence. The same exploitation continues in a different garb.        
	In crossing the line of incompetence of scores of years, the government of India and those of the states are confronted with the truth of their actions and inactions. Nothing in the mindset and attitude of the administrators has changed since Independence. They operate much like petty potentates, all knowing and unable to deliver. They epitomize all that needs to be discarded if clean governance is to replace this overwhelmingly corroded administration that has choked India and virtually destroyed its body and soul. They have merged with the political class, defeating the latters purpose and mandate. The single priority today is to radically reduce and restructure this entity called the Indian Administrative Service. If India is to emerge as a real regional power centre, we need to devise our own model of growth, and not clone the West. We do not need to become a nation of unthinking robots.                
	New model        
	This desperation for a 9 to 10 per cent growth rate, where the means are not important, is a disruptive trajectory to embark upon. Why cannot a serious and definitive plan be constructed where the means are clear, clean and above board, and also lead India to a substantive rate of growth? Why are kickbacks and corruption so apparent in this scheme of growth? Why does the government not change the laws if it is willing to look the other way when the law is broken? Will that demand real and hard work? Why has this government not been able to handle the ridiculous rise in prices of essential commodities, why has the leadership not addressed the nation through the Doordarshan with explanations? In this superficial race to maintain the growth rate, we are, once again, headed towards laying the foundations for another version of the Maoist upheaval and social unrest.        
	Without the basic infrastructure in place or taking root simultaneously with this growth, the government is setting the stage for anarchy and revolt. As a taxi driver said to me the other day, Corruption is not the problem at all since that has become the norm within which people have to live and work. The unsurmountable problem is the loot that is happening openly and by all those who are already privileged behad loot mach raha hai.         
	Our rulers find the words environmental protection and conservation irritating because they stall the march towards a growth rate unencumbered by norms that will protect our future. Surely, the smart economists in our various commissions and advisories should be able to crack a new model for growth that will achieve the same results by being inclusive and not self-serving? Democracy is for all, not for them few.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BEYOND THE REACH OF MUSIC                                  Bad musicians, ignorant of the history and philosophy of the songs they sing, are useless for conflict resolution, writes Mrinal Pande                                            
	It is somewhat oppressive to sit down for a long evening of what is some peoples idea of secular Indian music : a medley of usually indifferently sung sufiyana kalams and nirgun bhajans by mediocre singers, who will try to make up with histrionics what they lack in real sur sadhana. It is true that the poetry of love they sing is timeless, moving and profound. But when all is said and done, it is not the literary text that a great musical experience is all about. When forced to say wah wah to mediocre to bad music largely for its literary qualities, it makes an old-fashioned music lover squirm. As anyone who has heard the greats knows, the inner logic of musical notes and the pleasure it generates are beyond words. They are not rooted in cognitive thought to convey messages to be utilized in promoting socio-political reforms. A musical experience exposes us to an awesome duality of naad (musical sound) and silence  no more, no less. Music, as Julian Barnes wisely wrote, begins where words cease. And while all arts aspire to be music, music will always aspire to and lead towards silence.        
	Todays performing world of music is a noisy one and has many tiers. At its peripheries stand the over-ambitious ones who wish to make it to the top within a year of learning to strum the tanpura. They seem obsessed with the correct dress code and display a pronounced affinity for ethnic chic. Men and women from the peripheries with perfectly matched clothes, made up faces and large kohl-lined eyes, seem to have spent less time in studying music and medieval literary movements and bhasha literature and more on how to look like a perfect musical aficionado. The better musicians usually remain carelessly imperfect in their attire (Kumar Gandharvas blue cashmilon half-sleeved pullovers for example, and Mallikarjun Mansoors mussed up sherwani). But metro patrons of secular music, raised on the petty snobberies of the new patrons of Indian arts, seem to love the musical foreplay that lesser musicians will indulge in: touching their earlobes, making mudras, bowing to the stage and fingering holy beads. Those on stage seem to have spent all their knowledge of Hindi-Urdu as they mouth instructions to the mike man, the light man, and the lissom flower girls and to usher the artists on stage. Thereafter the announcers will invariably use a pidgin of bhasha and English to introduce the artists and the poetry, usually mispronouncing both the names of ragas and of the medieval saint poets. The still appreciative audience nods and murmurs about our Ganga-jamuni tehzeeb and how the discovery of the secular medieval poets has changed lives and the understanding of our musical inheritance. The atmosphere is civilized and politically correct to the point of suffocation as the VIPs begin to arrive.         
	As they sit down and exchange pleasantries with the artists and friends miming Kemon aachhen? Kaisa haal hain? and the accompanists begin to strum the instruments, the dispiriting disconnect between the audience and the musicians is clearly visible: not only physical but also social and linguistic. The musicians are short and too thin or too fat, either underdressed or overdressed. They appear tense facing an audience of VVIPs and some of them will fold their hands in servility and bow to a particular political or bureaucratic patron again and again. Then the music begins and unseen cellphones begin to ring nonstop all over the hall. After many shushings and clearing of throats some semblance of order descends till a VIP has to, sorry, just has to, leave.         
	Later, if you get to sit close and strike up a conversation with the musicians offstage, you find that despite the tremendous subtlety of their musical rendering, most singers do not have any clear sense of the complex history or literature of the period. So far as real intellectual insights into the minds of the poets are concerned, most singers remain curiously vague or try force-feeding you on myths and non-secular mumbo-jumbo about the real religious identity of a Sufi or saint poet who had all along lashed out at organized religion and sectarianism.         
	When your rage cools, sadness and anger still remain. How did this failed union of great poetry and classical music come about? What dim-witted madness prompts the so-called lovers of Indian music to promote the difficult and politically demanding task of healing deep sectarian wounds so crudely through music? How can obviously bad singers be classed as superb presenters because they sing secular poetry? Can music or poetry, the real ones, ever be partisan like political tracts?         
	Perhaps the organizers and audiences have their own secret but firm agendas, prejudices and lust for worldly power, and have come to fear the reality of the lives that remind us of the wordless purity of music. These are the sazindas, accompanists, whose worlds rotate along the axis of nothing but sur and taal. If you hang around our auditoriums long after a concert, you will notice that the smart ones from the musical peripheries leave first in expensive cars with the artists. Then those who have paid for the tickets. The last to leave are a gaggle of accompanists carrying large bags that contain their precious tablas, sarangis and dholaks. They lie waiting in a dim alley for cheap transport past midnight, spitting and swatting the gnats. They have no allies. No patron in a high seat represents their case either among the musical or political circles. Their demands for suitable hikes in remuneration are never met.         
	Perhaps because their very existence puts a question mark on expensive and well publicized musical gatherings for promoting liberty, equality and fraternity and because the stunning purity of notes they play often throws up the off-key singing of some fat wife of a successful man, they put our real musical tastes in question. They are like the much hated and despised Roma gypsies of Europe whom a Europe hit by recession is so keen to expel. Few would recall that the German writer, Heinrich Boll, wanted gypsy musicians near his grave as his body was being lowered into the earth, playing what Gnter Grass describes as their deeply tragic, despairingly gay music. This was Bolls way of reminding post-Hitler Germany that it must learn to love all those that it fears and despises.        
	That is what real music essentially is. It alone is an art form that transports us beyond caste and creed, beyond political doctrines or religious fundamentalism. Why must we, in the name of conflict resolution, promote the garbage that is being propagated in the name of our composite culture?

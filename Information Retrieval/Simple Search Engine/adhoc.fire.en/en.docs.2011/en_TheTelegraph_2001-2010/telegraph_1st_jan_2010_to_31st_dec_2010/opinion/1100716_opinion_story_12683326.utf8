	Magic, mystery, madness      
	The Magicians Apprentice (Orbit, Rs 395) by Trudi Canavan simmers with magic, mystery and madness. Winner of the Aurealis Award 2009 for the best fantasy novel, this tome recounts a grievous battle between Kyralia and Sachaka through the eyes of Tessia, a young woman magician from a countryside village. Readers of Canavans best-selling Black Magician trilogy would be benefited by this much-awaited prequel. For those who tend to nod off over endless tales of weirdly-named magicians engaging in murderous acts of revenge, there is a lot of sex, of all sorts, to stop the yawning. But even that may not be tempting enough to go through 700 pages of doomsday prose.                        
	Alpha Beta (Bantam, 5.10) by John Man explains How Our Alphabet Shaped the Western World. In this fascinating survey, Man takes the readers back by 4,000 years, to ancient Egypt, where the idea of the alphabet first emerged. Tracing the development of the alphabet in various parts of the world, Man unveils a nest of controversies, mysteries and intrigues, as he brings alive historical resonances and spices up his narrative with arresting anecdotes. The Greeks, we learn, needed the alphabet to immortalize their myths, the Israelites needed it to define their god and the Romans to display power. Extensively illustrated, this elegant volume has the flavour of a detective story, with the historian playing the sleuth.                                
	The Tacit Dimension (Penguin, Rs 299) by Michael Polanyi is the scientist-turned-philosophers 1966 classic reissued with a foreword by Amartya Sen. First delivered as the Terry Lectures at Yale University in 1962, this little book is a treasure trove of ideas  complex, provocative, and often eccentric. Hailed as a scholar extraordinaire with a polymathic background by Sen, Polanyi started out as an authority on physical chemistry before embarking on an illustrious career as a social scientist, making sterling contributions to economics and philosophy. Yet, Polanyis shift from the natural to the human sciences did not indicate a break: for him, science and philosophy were harmoniously fused, depending on each other for mutual advancement. In these lectures, Polanyi deals with Menos paradox, discussed by Plato, which reduced the pursuit of knowledge into an absurdity. Polanyi counters it with his own theory of tacit knowledge, asserting that we can know more than we can tell.

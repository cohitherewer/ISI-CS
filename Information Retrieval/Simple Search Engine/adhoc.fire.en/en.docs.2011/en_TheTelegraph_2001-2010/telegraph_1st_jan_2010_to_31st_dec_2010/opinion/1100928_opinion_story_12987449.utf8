The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Good riddance
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GOOD RIDDANCE                                                    
	Ones enemys enemy is not always ones friend, especially in electoral politics. The Asom Gana Parishad has finally learnt this simple lesson and decided to part ways with the Bharatiya Janata Party. The AGP-BJP alliance of the past few polls in Assam was based on the ground that the Congress was the enemy of both the parties. But the realities of Assams politics increasingly proved that the partnership with the BJP could be more a liability than an asset for the AGP. Worse, far from doing any damage to the Congress, the alliance ended up weakening the AGP itself in the last Lok Sabha polls. But then, that was the price the AGP had to pay for its wrong political strategy. It should have realized the risks of its alliance with the BJP much earlier. Assams demographic profile makes any alliance with the BJP a risky business. Assam has the highest percentage of Muslim voters for any state other than Jammu and Kashmir. The BJPs Hindutva politics thus makes it totally unacceptable to nearly one-third of Assams population. It is inexplicable that the AGP took so long to accept this simple truth and mend its ways.        
	But the larger question is why most of its one-time allies find the BJP a burden sooner or later. After just one season of electoral alliance, the Biju Janata Dal dumped the BJP and won the last assembly elections in Orissa handsomely on its own. In Bihar, Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (United) has always had an uneasy relationship with the BJP as a partner. Sections of the JD(U) are unhappy that the party did not part ways with the BJP before the coming assembly polls in the state. In Bengal, Mamata Banerjee had no hope of destabilizing the Left Front as long as she allied with the BJP. Her chances of success improved dramatically the moment she left the company of the saffron brigade and allied herself with the Congress. In Jharkhand, the Jharkhand Mukti Morchas flip-flop with the BJP and the Congress is largely responsible for the states political instability. The BJPs sectarian approach to politics is incompatible with the pluralism that alliance politics demands. At the national level, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has ceased to be a meaningful political force. The break-up of the AGP-BJP alliance in Assam may be good news for the Congress, but it could also help the AGP regain its base and find other, more dependable, allies.

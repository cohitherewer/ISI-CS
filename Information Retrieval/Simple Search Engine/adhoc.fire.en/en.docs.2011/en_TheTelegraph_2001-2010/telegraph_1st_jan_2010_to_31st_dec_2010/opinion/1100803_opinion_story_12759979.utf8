                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        JUST VISITING                                                    
	David Cameron has proved himself to be a model guest. When in India, the British prime minister said exactly what Indians would like to hear. He scolded Pakistan for abetting terrorism, much to the glee of his hosts and to the chagrin of their neighbour. India warmed up to him further when he promised to relax immigration rules for its nationals keen on studying and working in Britain. A deal to buy 50 fighter jets from Britain was also fixed in his presence. The leaders of the British corporate world who accompanied Mr Cameron on this trip deserve a mention as well (although they could have come on their own if they wished to explore business ventures in the country). So far so good. However, as a report on the visit of a head of State, none of the above sounds particularly significant, let alone impressive. Indeed, Mr Cameron could have jolly well achieved all these aims from the comfort of Downing Street. He really need not have taken the trouble of personally flying down to India. This is, of course, not to suggest that the British prime minister is not welcome in India. Rather, the observation merely states the obvious: that the sun has finally sunk on the former rulers of one of the most powerful empires in history.        
	Britains diminishing geopolitical importance has been palpable since the end of World War II, which also ushered in the era of decolonization. It is remarkable that with the rise of the European Union and the United States of America, Britain has allowed itself to be pushed into relative obscurity. Trapped in a haze of nostalgia for its glorious past, Britain has become quietly isolated from the mainstream of Western politics, economics and culture. Even emerging powers such as China and Japan are head and shoulders above Britain in the global financial scene. Perhaps it is a reflection of the sterility that has settled in Britain that the visit of an all-important entourage of British dignitaries to a developing country like India did not succeed in generating much excitement beyond the standard media hype. Over the years, bilateral ties between India and Britain, although amiable, have stayed on an even keel. In contrast, Indias friendship with the US has acquired a special vibrancy, increasing possibilities of mutual advancement. If the British premier managed to warm a few hearts, the US president, in his forthcoming visit, is likely to win millions more.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ISLAND OF IRONIES                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Arriving at Heathrow airport in London was like entering an economy in decline, particularly since I was arriving from an emerging economy with a temporary airport that was smarter and far more efficient than where I had landed. Every Indian hanging in an unpleasant arrival space was secretly delighted that perceptions and realities were clearly reversed. Dare any visitor arriving in India complain about the condition of our airports! They are definitely far superior, and the service cannot be compared to what was meted out to us in London. The fast-track queue took one-and-a-half hours to clear, with two counters remaining unmanned, even though the managers could see the pressure on the one window. India has grown up and Britain seems to be in its disabled dotage.        
	Bumping over potholed avenues, roads and flyovers, I felt I was back in the India of the Eighties when we were struggling to get our infrastructure act together as we came out of years and years of a Left command economy based on the Soviet model. But this was the capital of Britain. I was told that the country had been a victim of severe snow that had corroded the tarmac. Strangely, all this felt good, felt like we could not be dismissed as part of the third world anymore. Expensive shops were full of people shopping madly but they were all foreigners  Indians, Italians, people from the Middle East, China and Japan. They were keeping the high- and medium-end retail alive. In this mood of insecurity and diminishing pride, it is small wonder that the ruling coalition is thinking of putting a cap on immigration.        
	The task of training an entire service sector with the necessary skills to maintain the present level of business and enterprise will require a great deal of effort and resources. Competing with immigrant skills will not be easy. Such competition may well trigger social and ethnic discord in the near future. Immigrant communities in Britain, most of which are economically empowered, tend to owe their allegiance to the Labour Party, not to the Conservatives. The ruling coalition, with an alliance partner that has internal differences on some critical policy issues, will soon have to combat with this hitherto unfamiliar problem in a nation that has, over the decades, taught itself to live with diversity in harmony and respect.                
	Course correction        
	At another level, William Hague wants to draw India into a more profound partnership, and counterpoint the powerful Western bloc that has often compelled positions akin to being a subservient ally. This strategy  to open new political frontiers, to realign with Brazil, Russia and India, and to forge substantive economic relations  makes sense in a changing world that is in the process of shifting the balance on the international stage.         
	India and Britain could add an energetic new dimension to an old, tried-and-tested, albeit volatile, relationship and take the partnership to a stronger, more influential, level. This could have a positive impact on South Asia, diluting the domination of the United States of America in the region, which could most definitely ease existing tensions.        
	Will the coalition, ruling from Westminster, come together to find solutions to the many economic problems that plague this island kingdom? Will the Labour Party elect a young leader, a David Miliband, and will he lead his party to work with the Tories and the Lib Dems to deliver the goods and extricate Britain out of the prevalent mess? This collective of new-generation leaders, both in Britain and in India, where the majority is under 50 years of age, could well change the course of the politics of both the countries as well as of their surrounding regions.

	Q: Some time back the high court ordered that a housing society should not charge any fee of 0.5 per cent from either the seller or the buyer on the sale price of a flat. Is this rule still applicable?        
	Name Withheld                
	A: Yes, the high court decision, passed in 2007 in the case of Dover Co-operative Housing Society Ltd vs Parimal Chandra regarding the restriction of taking the transfer fee of 0.5 per cent on the consideration amount of the sale, is still applicable.              
	Q:I live in a room that my husband, who died 15 years ago, had rented. The landlord used to collect the rent (Rs 70 a month) once in two years and issued receipts accordingly. But he did not collect the rent for the last five years. Now he is asking for rent at Rs 900 per month and has threatened eviction if I dont comply. I have offered to raise the rent as per the latest rent control rules. But the rent due from me cant be paid to the rent control department as it accepts no more than two months arrears. How do I retain the room?        
	Name Withheld                
	A: There have been lapses on your part and your status at present is that of a trespasser. However, you should tactfully request your landlord to give in writing his demand of enhancing the rent to obtain an admission from him that you are his tenant. After this, if he proceeds to file an eviction suit, you have no choice but to contest the same.         
	Q:A factory land was divided into plots and sold. I bought one such plot in 2003, duly registered by the government registrar. I received the deed but the Calcutta Municipal Corporation denied mutation. Is it true that factory land has to be converted to vastu land first? Besides, a litigation has arisen with another party claiming ownership of the premises. Is the registrar not accountable in this case? If the verdict goes in favour of the third party, how do we get legal possession of the land we paid for?        
	S. Chakraborty, Calcutta                
	A: It is true that a factory land has to be converted to vastu land first for the purpose of construction of a residential building. The registrar is not accountable here. Before buying the land you should have conducted a thorough search regarding the ownership of the property. If the verdict goes in favour of the third party you have no option but to the appeal against the judgement before the appellate court or settle for a compromise with the third party.

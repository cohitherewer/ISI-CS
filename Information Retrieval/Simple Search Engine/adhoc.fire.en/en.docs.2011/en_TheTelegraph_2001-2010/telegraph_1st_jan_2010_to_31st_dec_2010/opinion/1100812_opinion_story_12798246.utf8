	A short-term gain can turn into a lasting headache. At the moment, Barack Obama appears to have nothing but the mid-term elections in mind. It is crucial for the president of the United States of America to lead his party to a respectable victory in the polls. But he must tread the populist path with caution. True, the measure to raise visa fees for skilled workers, passed by the Senate, will please many in the US if it eventually becomes law. Two years ago, Americans had chosen Mr Obama as their president, expecting him to save them not only from George W. Bush but also from an economic downturn as bad as the Great Depression of the 1930s. For Mr Obama, in spite of all his rhetoric of fairness, one major way of creating employment is by reducing the number of foreign nationals working in the US. With the steep hike in visa fees, he has finally set out to clear more space for domestic workers.        
	Obviously, Mr Obamas policy would be damaging for Indian information-technology companies that are major players in the US market. These firms temporarily place a section of their employees in the US to offer on-shore services. In the process, they pay nearly $1 billion in social security for their workers. An additional cost of $200-250 million, which is what the increment will entail if it comes into effect, will discourage Indian companies to continue operating out of the US. And ironically, it is the US that will suffer the greater loss. Not only will it have to relinquish access to cheap labour supplied by the Indian IT sector, but also forsake a huge amount that is paid to it as social security, which Indian workers never stay back to reap the benefits of. Indian firms, though facing a bad deal, may carry on business in the same way, given the advantages of this age of super-connectivity  Skype and video-conferencing could replace on-site services. What is worse is the evident discriminatory tilt in Mr Obamas plan. The revised visa rates apply only to companies with less than 50 per cent US workforce. So a US firm meeting the stipulation will be able to bring workers from India at half the cost while Indian companies bear the brunt of the new regulations. A biased policy such as this was least expected of a man who had been globally hailed as a messiah of equality. At any rate, trade cannot flourish, especially in this age of free market, if restrictions on the free movement of labour are not lifted.

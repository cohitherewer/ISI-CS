	The holiday mood is Indias favourite state of mind. And the holiday mood has descended on the Delhi government with trumpets blaring and flags flying. Although the Commonwealth Games are still a few months away, all Delhi can think of is the holiday it will enjoy after all the hard work of getting ready for the event. Nothing else can explain the games organizing committees request to the Supreme Court that it should remain closed between October 2 and 17 to facilitate traffic movement. The court is close to the India Gate and the national stadium, and commands heavy traffic in the mornings and evenings, especially because the Delhi High Court and the New Delhi district courts are also located close by. Lawyers and their clients take up quite a bit of road space. But this may be rationalizing after the event, for the holiday seems to have become an obsession in the capital. The government has already declared all schools closed during that period. It is a rescheduling of the Dussehra vacation, it has reportedly said, so that children can enjoy the games unhindered. Obviously, the organizing committee feels that the whole of Delhi will have little else to do but to watch the games. So it is perfectly logical that the justice system, too, should pause. The Supreme Court has refused, of course, but whether its stand has taught the government a sense of proportion is not clear.        
	The nation may feel grateful to the court for conducting itself with dignity and sense, but that might also prompt it to ask another question. Citizens of India are growing alarmed at the burgeoning backlog of cases that the courts are trying to deal with. The backlog has been the subject of the most concerned comments and advice from senior judges, lawyers and activists for years. But it just keeps growing. The solution does not lie in any one thing, but the courts may be humbly asked in this context whether it is necessary for the judiciary to take so many breaks in a year. One way of beginning to clear the backlog is surely to get more working hours in. The summer vacation, the winter vacation, the autumn vacation, could perhaps be shortened, and some done away with altogether. Hospitals, the fire services, the police, the media do not have any leave. Perhaps the courts too could function like an emergency service as these do. Even a small inroad into the gigantic pile of cases would be useful.

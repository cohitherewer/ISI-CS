The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A unique urban mess
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A UNIQUE URBAN MESS                          - Travels through the Peoples Republic of Berkeley        THE THIN EDGE:   Ruchir Joshi                                                        
	My favourite recent story about the Bay Area and San Francisco has little to do with this location. An NRI couple, old friends from Calcutta, were being visited by some Japanese acquaintances and they took their kids into the back garden. California being what it is and North Berkeley being exceptionally animal-friendly, there were some deer grazing in the back garden. Seeing this, one of the kids turned to his father and spoke excitedly, making some clawing gestures with his fingers. Guess what was he saying? My friend asked me. Tui jiboney guess kortey parbi na (Youll not be able to guess in your life)! Clueless, I shook my head. He was saying, Father, quick get me my remote-control, I want to make these deer jump around!        
	At first hearing, the story seems to tell you a lot more about Japanese children than Californians from the Bay Area. But, as you begin to walk down the streets and look around, you get the sense that there are many people here who carry within themselves some kind of a game-controller that allows and feeds a disconnect with reality.        
	That the word reality is a signifier of the highest subjectivity is brought home every moment you spend in this odd corner of the United States. Smoking is not only banned inside all establishments in the state, it is also banned within 20 feet of any doorway or window. Standing amidst the big SUVs and crowds of hybrid cars, I try and make myself impervious to the dirty looks I get from passers-by as I grab a puff outside a restaurant or bar. Walking into a diner, nominally the most traditional of American eating places, I look at a menu announcing the Soup of the Day: Vegan Chili  even the classic meat-based Mexican gloop is not immune to mutation in this vegetarianism-obsessed zone. On the wall of the same neo-diner is painted a quote from Che Guevara (chain-smoker and champion carnivore) about how the Revolution can never be brought about without Love. Outside India, the Bay Area has to be the World Supermarket of Yoga: driving down Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, you pass competing signs for Bikram Yoga and something called Japanese Yoga; neither Bengals contribution to the Yoga supermarket in the shape of the over-heated Bikram or his Japanese rivals seem to be bothered about any quaint notions of authenticity; all that seems to matter is hitting some marketing sweet-spot in the overcrowded health consciousness of one of the most beautiful ivory-tower neighbourhoods on the planet.        
	In preparation for a self-catering weekend up the Pacific coast, I accompany my hosts into a supermarket called Berkeley Bowl. The range of produce is mind-boggling, even for someone who spends a lot of time in London. The vegetable section has dozens of different kinds of tomatoes and potatoes, each carrying its own nomenclature, plus several kinds of mirchi and, to top it all, not one but two kinds of karela. At the checkout counter, a fit-looking man in his sixties helps me load the bags. As he does so, he engages me and one of my hosts, a high-ranking academic who was once, long ago, a Calcutta girl. Where are you from and what do you do? he asks me in a typical American knock on the front door. I tell him Im a writer and film-maker. He immediately gets into a discussion, first about V.S. Naipaul (he agrees quickly that, despite a few good early books, the man is an asshole) and then about Sat-Yaazhit-Rey. My friend and I say we miss the great man and, again, our bag-packer agrees, suddenly turning vehement, People say they cant watch films like that anymore! You know what I say to anyone who cant watch the Apu Trilogy? I say f*** you!        
	Reeling from this unexpected vote of devotion to Manikbabu, we load the car and a bunch of us head off into the landscape. The driving is beautiful, the mist playing matchmaker between the winding mountain road and the spreading ocean below is entrancing, the constant segue between sharp sunlight and opaque fog is hypnotic  it seems as if weve driven into the climatic equivalent of Berkeley Bowl with all imaginable varieties of weather on display, arranged on the shelf within touching distance. The next day, climbing rocks carved into fantastical formations by the sea-wind, we come across a whole family of seals sunning themselves on bonsai islands covered with moss. Again, this is California, so the seals are cool  they give us an occasional glance while doing their thing and we, too, try not to disturb them too much. I try not to reach for a remote in order to make them flip around and jump in and out of the sea. Behind them is a stretch of water that doesnt find a shore till China, Russia, Korea and Japan. The scale of it seems to give both sets of mammals a sense of quiet.        
	Mark Twain apparently once said, The coldest winter I spent was a summer in San Francisco. Back in the city the temperature seems to bear him out. The day starts chilly and grey, warms up under a post-fog, brilliant blue sky before returning the streets to the icy ocean air at night.        
	Driving out again, north to Petaluma, there is no trace of the famed, super-warm Californian summer. Off the highway, an electronic gate opens and we wind our way up one of those blonde hills so resplendent with gold during the daytime. As we approach the cluster of buildings, a faint buzz comes through the sound-proofed doors of a performance space. Inside, there is aural gold, and the feeling I get is, again, this could only be found in this corner of America. Forty-odd people, young men and women, whites and Sikhs, geeks, hippy-types and accountant-looking types are all sitting on the carpet, each with a pair of tablas, each of them following the man at the centre of the circle who is himself playing and every now and then in a quiet voice calling out a bol. These people have travelled from across America and across the world to attend an intensive five-day workshop with the Master and we have gate-crashed just in time to watch the end of the event. Zakir Hussain is very different while teaching his students; the showmanship and grinning mischief are totally absent; he is light, jokey about himself, but totally focused. The chorus of tablas rises, following him, some failing, others managing to stay in the game, a few right there, beat for beat. Ive heard Zakir play many times but this raw, massed magic is different.        
	A break and then a couple of the students play for a bit. Then the man himself takes over for the last performance of the workshop and plays a long exposition, teasing layers of complex sound out of two shiny, skin-covered bowls. As he ends, people clap, some almost break into tears. There is none of the virtuoso digital-acrobatics that Zakir often displays at concerts, no doppler effect of a train coming and going at the tips of his fingers, just a very concentrated dose of distilled playing. After he ends, his voice sits easy in the American accent, articulate, completely at home with poetic patois.        
	If youre tense and worried about how to play this tihai or that one then maybe this isnt what you should be doing. He says, the students hanging on to every word. Ultimately, you have to play more with your heart than your mind Remember, at the end of the day, this is just a percussion instrument find your way with the tabla and let the tabla find its way with you.              
	A few days later, watching a pair of black guys in their sixties playing blues on a sidewalk just off Haight Street near the legendary Haight-Ashbury crossing, mecca of hippiedom and flower-power in the late 1960s, I remember Zakirs words. Ivory-tower or no, health-obsessed or not, this place is one of the most unique urban messes in the world and you have to find your way with it and let it find its way with you.

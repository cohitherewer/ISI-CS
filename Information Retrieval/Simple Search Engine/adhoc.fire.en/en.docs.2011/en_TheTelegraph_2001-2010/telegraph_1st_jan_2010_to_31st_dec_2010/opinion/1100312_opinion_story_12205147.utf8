	Tradition sanctifies all kinds of subversions on the day of Holi  even that of the relationship between the ruler and the ruled. But the rules of the game are different in Uttar Pradesh, where four teenaged students found themselves behind bars for allegedly defacing a poster of the chief minister, Mayavati. The four were arrested a short distance away from their school hostel in Lucknow, and sent to a home for juveniles after being charged under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. They were released only after the chief minister herself intervened and reprimanded the keepers of law and order for failing to appreciate the pettiness of the crime. What seems like a completely lopsided sense of justice on the part of the police would, of course, take on a different dimension if the schools allegation  that a vengeful officer was seeking retribution for the school ignoring his request for a mid-term admission  were true. Even if that were not the case, the incident would still raise serious questions about the attitude of the police force. Perhaps the chief minister cannot deny that much of this attitude has been formed by the emphasis she herself has placed on the protection of symbols of Dalit power  monuments and statues built to venerate Dalit icons, such as B.R. Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram and herself, many of these guarded by a heavy posse of policemen.        
	Part of the attitude could also have been shaped by experience. Both in UP and Maharashtra, Ambedkar statues have been repeatedly targeted by those who know how useful such acts can be in lighting the divisive fire. The police are, naturally, sensitive to violations of the kind that purportedly happened in Lucknow. But even if one were to ignore the particularities of this case, there is no denying that the overreaction of the police has something to do with an attitude that is peculiarly Indian, and now a valued attribute of the civil servant  mindless surrender to the powers that be. This attitude has been cultivated for the rewards it has fetched in the form of promotions. It is possible that the policemen in Lucknow had acted with this purpose in mind. They could not but have been inspired by this entrenched practice in the civil service, where servility is rewarded, and independence of spirit leads to punishment postings. UP, with its record of transfers under both Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati, has almost institutionalized this system.

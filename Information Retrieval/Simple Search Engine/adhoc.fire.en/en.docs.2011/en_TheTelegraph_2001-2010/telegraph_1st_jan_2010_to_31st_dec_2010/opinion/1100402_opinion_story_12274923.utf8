	Shot in the dark                  
	Sir  The recent shootout on Ballygunge Circular Road highlights how ineffectual our citys police force is and the state of denial that its senior officers live in (Ballygunge firing, March 22). Local residents complain of having to put up with blaring music from cars, loud honking and drunken brawls every night. The reactions of senior police officers have been predictable  they were not aware of such incidents or disturbances but will investigate the matter.          
	Civic authorities will, no doubt, react in a similar manner. The papers of the dhaba and of other outlets, such as the bar on Hazra road, will be scrutinized. Violations of permits and timings will be unearthed. The errant establishments will be fined and things will go back to normal.          
	It is time the Calcutta Police and other authorities are made accountable for such incidents. Senior officers should enforce efficient monitoring of these trouble spots as a matter of procedure, not just as a reaction to unpleasant incidents. They should set an example by patrolling the areas themselves. Our confidence in our police force is so low at this point that any positive action on their part would be welcome.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  A large section of Calcuttas youth, especially those from affluent families, are in the habit of frequenting bars and dhabas at night. This often includes assignations with drug peddlers. The police have not paid much attention to them so far, although similar revellers in Delhi and Mumbai have played havoc with security in the past. Brawls are common and money is no concern. Firearms are used without hesitation by these youth, who have influential connections to bail them out of trouble.          
	The incident at the dhaba on Ballygunge Circular road was reportedly started by a wrangle over a girl. The police should arrest all those involved and get to the bottom of the matter.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Model leader          
	Sir  Eight years after the communal riots in Gujarat, the states chief minister, Narendra Modi, confidently turned up for interrogation before the special investigation team appointed by the Supreme Court (Modi to SIT: may I sit down? March 28). In the intervening years, Godhra has become a household name, used by most parties for gaining political leverage, especially before elections. Even secular parties seemed to be more interested in reaping political benefits from the tragedy instead of pressing for speedy punishment of those guilty of the atrocities. Now that Modi has gained popularity and diatribes against his communal image have lost steam, rival political camps find it more useful to bring him to trial.          
	Communal riots have occurred in almost every decade after Independence and the perpetrators have hardly ever been brought to book in a court of law or by investigative agencies. Modi is yet another example of this corrupt practice. In the last eight years, he has won assembly elections and become a public icon, especially for his efforts to sustain industrial growth in Gujarat. A favourite with industrialists, the chief ministers role in the communal riots, which caused huge losses of life and property, has faded from public memory. Modi seems to have been pardoned by those who were not directly affected by the riots but who had criticized him initially.          
	Justice, in the case of public figures, is tangled in a web of politics and the unwieldy processes of law. The delayed reaction of the judiciary only helps the accused leader build up an alternative heroic image. When the case is brought to trial, they appear before the court unfazed. Reports by investigative bodies are not published and the whole incident is swept under the carpet by the government. It is no wonder that Modi has responded to the court summons with such confidence.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subrata Pal,

      
	Karimpur, Nadia                     
	Sir  Just 11 months after the Supreme Court ordered the SIT to launch a probe on the 2002 riots in Gujarat, Modi did well to appear before the panel in Gandhinagar. The summons were in response to a petition filed by Zakia Jafri, wife of the Congress member of parliament, Ahsan Jafri, who was killed along with 68 others in the Gulbarg housing society massacre. Modi allegedly received a telephone call from Jafri, desperately asking for help as the mobs drew nearer. The chief minister, however, ignored the plea for help. When it comes to his own life, Modi takes care to protect it well. He did not venture out of the SIT office without heavy security. This is the man who is revered by thousands.          
	Media reports seem to project Modi as a model citizen doing his country a favour by appearing before the SIT. It should not be forgotten that Modi is accused of grave crimes and should be treated accordingly. Now that Zakia Jafris petition has received so much attention, it is a golden opportunity to ensure that justice is done at last. If the courts fail the riot victims at this juncture, it will be a victory of the corrupt.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Faridabad

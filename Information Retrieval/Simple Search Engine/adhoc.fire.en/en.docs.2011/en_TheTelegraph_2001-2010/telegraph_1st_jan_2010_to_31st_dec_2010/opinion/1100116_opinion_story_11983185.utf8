	As a one-time ardent watcher of television programmes on pravachans delivered by our godmen and godwomen, I came to the conclusion that most of them support right-wing Hindu political parties such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Their support of Hinduism is understandable, as all of them preach their own versions of this religion. But their right-wing leaning is less comprehensible. Some are outspoken in their support, others more subtle. Amongst the outspoken supporters is Asaram Bapu, now in dire trouble, charged with amassing property and abetting murders of his detractors. I dont know much about his past except that he is a Sindhi settled in Ahmedabad, and at one time ran either a cycle repairing shop or perhaps a chai stall. He found preaching religion and goodness more profitable. He grew a long beard, wore loose white robes and cultivated the benign image of a bapu. He gathered a large number of admirers, built a large ashram with a temple and sponsored educational institutions.        
	I watched Asaram Bapu many times: he attracted huge audiences, composed largely of women, with a sprinkling of men. He could be quite amusing at times with his mimicry. He occasionally broke into songs in a totally unmelodious voice, but it did not seem to matter. Once I noticed the rajmata of Gwalior sitting in the audience, listening to him with rapt attention. Another time, it was Uma Bharti in the front row. At the end of Bapus discourse, Bharti stood up and said loudly in English: Bapu, I love you. Bapu beamed a rapturous thank-you smile. I wonder if Bharti still loves Asaram Bapu as she did a few years ago.                          Love lost       
	Strong bonds                
	I often ask myself, What is a truly integrated society? I put our own society through different tests to see if we, as a secular State, are also integrated. When communal tensions are chronic and periodically break out in violence, claims to be integrated sound hollow. So do our displays of cordiality. We have non-Muslims throwing iftar parties during Ramazan; we see them offering chaddars at dargahs of Muslim saints and embracing one another on Id-ul-Fitr and Bakri Id. We have Muslims celebrating Holi and Diwali by inviting Hindu friends and offering them mithai.        
	I dismiss all these as politically motivated displays of open-mindedness without any substance. I have come to the conclusion that true integration is achieved only when people of different races, religious beliefs, and castes, speaking different languages, marry and there are no tensions created. Using this as criteria, I conclude we are far from being an integrated society; every inter-religious marriage is looked upon as a kind of battle here. If the boy subscribes to one faith, the girl to another, the boys kinsmen regard it as a victory; the girls kinsmen regard it as surrender. I know of dozens of inter-faith marriages: Hindus and Sikhs married to Muslims, Christians or Parsis. And also a large number of Muslim men married to Hindu and Sikh women. In any case, if one or the other party converts to the faith of the spouse, it makes a mockery of religion. I regard conversions as demeaning to the dignity of the person who converts.        
	The worst examples of the refusal to integrate can be witnessed in the khap panchayats of Haryana. They are relics of the past when the elders of a village, mostly illiterate peasants, sat round on their charpoys smoking hookahs, and pronounced sentences against boys and girls of different gotras getting married. Even today, such couples are often exiled from their villages, declared outcasts and occasionally murdered. What should rid society of these self-appointed arbiters of matrimonial affairs? I am not sure if we can abolish them through legal enactments. In any case, many legislators depend on the votes of these rustics. Perhaps the best way to handle them is through a massive media campaign exposing them to ridicule. It will be worth trying because making Indians a truly integrated people is a noble ambition.                
	Honour codes                
	Manjitinder Singh of Ludhiana has written to me of an incident that took place while he was on a pilgrimage to Sikh shrines in Pakistan. He was travelling by bus from Lahore to Panja Sahib near Rawalpindi. At a midway halt, a beggar woman came round asking for alms. He gave her a five-rupee note. The woman looked up at him, saw he was a Sikh, and returned the note. When she came round again, Manjitinder Singh pressed the five-rupee note in her hand. Again she gave it back, saying in Punjabi: Nahin Sardarji, asseen mehmaana toon nahin mangdey  We dont ask for money from our guests.

	Teacher: Ghanta, what is common between Ram, the Buddha, Jesus and Guru Nanak?        
	Ghanta: All were born on holidays.

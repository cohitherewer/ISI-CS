                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ONE POST TOO MANY                                                          
	Hype has an innate tendency to deflect attention from the most critical aspects of any given situation. Very recently, the post of the National Security Advisor has come in for some attention. This was a function of a number of things: the departure of the present incumbent, M.K. Narayanan, for a gubernatorial position in West Bengal, his falling out with the home minister, P. Chidambaram, which might have caused his exit, and finally the appointment of Shiv Shankar Menon to the post. The point that was missed in all this is a fundamental one: should there be a post called the National Security Advisor? The answer, however startling this may sound, is no, since the post bypasses the existing system and, with no rationale, conflates security and strategy.        
	The origins of the NSA lie in the internal squabble within the administration of the United States of America. Henry Kissinger won for himself the real leverages of power as the NSA and became the person who monitored the internal security of the US and also coordinated external intelligence-gathering and operations. Mr Kissinger thus made himself the mastermind of US policy during the Nixon years. This idea was imported into India during the prime ministership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee by his powerful and crafty principal secretary, Brajesh Mishra. Not satisfied with his critical and ubiquitous role in the prime ministers office, Mr Mishra also wanted to run Indias foreign policy. So he got himself appointed as NSA.        
	The post of a NSA has embedded in it an ambiguity. This concerns the second letter in the acronym. Does it stand for security or strategy? If it does stand for security, as it is made to in its present incarnation, then it has no place in the prime ministers office. It should be directly under the home minister and its relationship with the existing security agencies should be clearly defined. The question why there should be a post over and above the existing agencies should also be addressed and clearly answered. In fact, there is no clarity on these issues and the NSA is caught between the prime ministers office and the home ministry. If, on the other hand, the S stands for strategy regarding foreign policy, then it makes redundant the post of the foreign secretary and the foreign minister. It is the responsibility of the foreign minister and the foreign secretary, in consultation with the prime minister of course, to lay down the principles of foreign policy and to ensure its implementation. What need then of the NSA?        
	The simple principle of not multiplying entities and responsibilities is ignored by the creation of posts like the NSA. There already exist within the system positions whose holders should do the job that the NSA does. If those officers are not fulfilling their responsibilities adequately, they should be removed and better people brought in. The creation of additional posts that bypass the system are, in fact, self-defeating.

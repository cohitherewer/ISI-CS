                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TOKYO BOUND                                                    
	When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Japanese counterpart Naoto Kan signed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement in Tokyo this week, it marked an important point that surpassed all previously established levels of economic cooperation between the two countries. The two leaders agreed to institute a ministerial level Economic Dialogue to provide strategic and long-term policy orientation between India and Japan, which already has such a dialogue with China. Most expect the CEPA to expand Indo-Japanese trade significantly; the agreement, which requires ratification by the Japanese Diet, is expected to come into force by the middle of 2011. Under this agreement, tariffs on Indian products will be reduced by 97 per cent, while India will reduce its import tariffs on Japanese products by 90 per cent. Admittedly, the level of trade between the two countries is small: in the first six months of 2010, it was just $7.7 billion, and unequal (in Japans favour). In comparison, Japans trade with China in the same period was $176 billion. Cumulative foreign direct investment by Japanese companies in India is about $5 billion and Japanese foreign institutional investors hold about $12 billion in Indian equities. Even if Indo-Japanese trade goes up to $20 billion by 2011-12 as suggested by officials from both countries, that number amounts to just 1 per cent Japans total trade.         
	Despite the small numbers, the two economies are complementary in several ways and areas: Japans strength lies in capital and technology, Indias in a young and enormous labour force that is inexpensive to boot. Indias rapidly expanding middle classes want to buy high-tech and luxury goods, some of which Japan makes. Japan is already the third-largest investor in India, and brings valuable expertise in manufacturing and infrastructure, which is just what India needs in the coming years. True, there are problems to be overcome; the geographical distance between the two countries is one of them. China is much closer, and the production, information and tradition networks that are an integral part of Japanese companies are much harder to create in India. The differences over nuclear non-proliferation could be a serious irritant.         
	Japan is aware that reducing its dependence on China is important, especially after their spat over some disputed islands. The strategic partnership envisioned by both India and Japan could be the driver of a rapidly growing economic relationship. Vision without action is a daydream, and action without vision is a nightmare, says a Japanese proverb. Both countries are acting now, and need to keep acting on their many issues.

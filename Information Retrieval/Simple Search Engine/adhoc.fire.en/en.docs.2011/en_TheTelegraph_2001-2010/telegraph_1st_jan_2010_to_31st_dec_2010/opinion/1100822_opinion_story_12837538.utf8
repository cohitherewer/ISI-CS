	 A new son is rising on the political horizon. Jaivardhan Singh, son of Digvijay Singh, the general-secretary of the All India Congress Committee, is all set to make his debut in the family profession of politics. A product of Doon School, Jaivardhan was recently introduced to the faithful in the family pocket borough of Raghogarh, which was formerly part of the Gwalior empire. The arrival of a promising newcomer in the scene always creates quite a stir. Jyotiraditya Scindia, for one, who has a stronghold in the neighbouring Guna parliamentary seat, should have cause to worry. And the competition seems to be mounting, with another Scindia scion, Akshay Bhansali, son of Yashodhara Raje Scindia, testing the grounds at the picturesque Shivpuri. Meanwhile, Digvijays politician brother, Laxman, too, has quit the Bharatiya Janata Party and is knocking on the Congresss door. It remains to be seen how Diggy Raja would strike a balance between his son and brother.          
	 The Union environment and forest minister, Jairam Ramesh, must be rueing his dithering on the issue of Bt brinjal. For in a deft move, not quite anticipated by him, the Union cabinet has appointed a regulatory body to ensure that safety standards are followed in the manufacture of genetically-modified crops. However, the regulators have been attached to the ministry of science and technology, headed by Prithviraj Chavan, who, incidentally, has always upheld the cause of Bt brinjal. Jairam, who fancied himself as being both politically and intellectually superior to Chavan, must find himself isolated, if not a bit slighted.          
	 Manmohan Singh seemed extremely pleased with the BJPs cooperation on the nuclear liability bill. The Oppositions support happened to coincide with an iftar party hosted by the BJP leader, Shahnawaz Hussain. Not only did the prime minister attend it, but he was also seen hugging Hussains sons and chatting with the former ministers wife, Renu. Such warmth was in striking contrast to the stoical face that Singh put on recently while sharing a table on another occasion in Canada with the actor, Twinkle Khanna. However, Congressmen from Bihar attending Hussains party could not help wincing at this show of affection, dreading its effect on the poll-bound state.          
	 He may be the longest-serving prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, but Manmohan Singh is yet to get the kind of recognition that the aam admi used to reserve for his illustrious predecessors. A recent incident appeared to underscore this point sharply. A delegation of some 50 women from Alwar and Tonk regions of Rajasthan had come to observe the functioning of the Indian Parliament. The rural belles, resplendent in the brightest of colours, created quite a spectacle outside Parliament. After an audience with the Speaker, Meira Kumar, the popular demand was for a meeting with Sonia Gandhi. Only a lone voice could be heard expressing a wish to see one Jagmohan Singh. The officials, much perplexed, discovered after some prodding that the lady in question had meant none other than the person running the country  the prime minister, Manmohan Singh.          
	 Sitaram Yechury is certainly a man of many parts. Like a seasoned politician, this veteran of the politburo revealed himself as quite media-savvy at the recent party convention in Vijaywada. In the absence of an official spokesperson, Yechury handled the journalists confidently, even switching between languages as and when the context demanded. He briefed the scribes on the situation in Lalgarh in Bengali, moved to Telugu while addressing the issue of Telangana, then went on to speak to the national media in Hindi and English. Looks like Yechury is at least being useful in some way, compared to his other colleagues in the Communist Party of India (Marxist).          
	 After the recent incident of being offered a bank loan in the middle of a crucial meeting, one had expected Pranab Mukherjee to stay away from the cell phone for good. But the word is on that the Union finance minister is now learning to read text messages, thanks to patient coaching by his grandson. Way to go Pranabda!

	 Amir Khan, however good his intentions may have been, is in a fix over Peepli Live. Apparently, Kunjilal Malviya, an astrologer who predicted his own death five years ago but obviously failed to bring it about, has threatened the actor-producer with legal action, accusing him of plagiarizing his bright, albeit failed, idea. The 80-year-old is convinced that Khan will, sooner or later, have to give in to his demand of a 50 per cent share of the profits. But given the embarrassing way in which Malviya was let down by his own predictions, can he be sure of the outcome?

	RABINDRANATH TAGORE: THREE NOVELLAS Oxford, Rs 295        
	A translation is a matter of hard decisions. Of which time is the story and when was it written, and should that be reflected in the translation, are questions the translator cannot avoid. These are intimately connected to the issue of the authors distinctive tone or the register of the dialogue. And looming over all are the plot and the theme of the story and the culture and manners in which they are embedded.        
	There is an obvious similarity in the theme of the three stories of Tagore that Sukhendu Ray translates. Although separated by three decades, the emotions at the centre of each narrative surge around characters struggling with the realities of extramarital love. Nashtanir (1901) has been translated as The broken home, while Dui Bon (1933) and Malancha (1934), have been translated respectively as Two sisters and The garden and the gardener. Bharati Rays introduction places and discusses the tales. Tagores incisive analysis of the drama of transgressive attraction, its intoxicating pull, the delayed self-awakening, the piercing pain of the excluded partner are tempting for the translator. What is even more tempting perhaps is the writers empathy with womens desires and hurts, his acute sense of a womans being, whether she is housebound or active, traditional or new. Little could be more contemporary, or more familiar.        
	But allure does not make translation any easier. Translations per se are not an easy task, Ray says in the translators note, particularly of literature. And the prospect of translating Tagore, he adds, seems daunting. In no way are the translations literal (for that would make them unintelligible) but Ray feels he has been reasonably faithful. Some excisions were necessary where, for example, a telling metaphor in Bengali sounded ridiculous in English. As Alberto Manguel remarks, a phoenix imagined in one language may turn out to be a barnyard chicken in another.        
	Tagores language, always bewilderingly protean, shows distinct differences between Nashtanir and the two other tales. It seems as though Ray is far more comfortable with the two later stories. His decisions about the register to strike in The broken home were not hard enough. That translation seems poised in a vacuum, unsure of its place in the history of either the original or the contemporary rendering. What makes the richest Bengali text elusive to the translator is the secret irony that underlies the most lyrical or intense passages. Tagores tone in Nashtanir is probably inimitable. What one misses most are the sharply hidden depths in the teasing exchanges between Charulata and Amal. Yet Ray achieves some surpassing moments too, as when Charu wonders what to say to Bhupati when he asks her what is wrong, for she does not know why she feels so hurt that Amal should be reading out his new work to Mandakini first. Again, when Charu carves out a secret mental niche to worship the absent Amal, Ray is almost flawless, if only he could have eschewed the word substructure.        
	Indecisiveness also haunts Rays use of the tenses in all three tales. But firm editing with, maybe, discussions with the translator, could have easily cleared this up. It is a pity this was not done. A constant panic would assail her, runs a sentence in Two sisters, she knew it is irrational, but cannot get rid of her phobia. Such confusion dogs the book, damaging the clarity of the language Ray strives for. Certain terms too needed more attention, where again an editor could have helped. Can, for example, Kalakantha be Musical notes? And Asru Shikal, the novel Neeraja wants to read in The garden and the gardener (one may question the rendering of the title too), just cannot be Chains of tear.                          BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

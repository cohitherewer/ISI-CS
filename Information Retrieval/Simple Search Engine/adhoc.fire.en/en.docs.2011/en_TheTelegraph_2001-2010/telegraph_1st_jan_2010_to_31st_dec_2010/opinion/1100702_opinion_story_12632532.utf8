	The draft legislation against sexual harassment in the workplace is now ready to appear before the cabinet before being tabled in Parliament. That it has taken a while to be formulated is not surprising. Although sexual harassment in the workplace is deeply unpleasant, often traumatic, it can be difficult to pin down and, more frequently, frightening to complain about. The bill could, however, take advantage of the experience of committees against sexual harassment set up in various institutions according to Supreme Court guidelines. That experience has been mixed, even though it has brought about a heightening of awareness regarding sexual harassment in the workplace, which should be acknowledged as an important achievement. But it has also highlighted difficulties, ranging from the need to discern genuine misunderstandings arising from the starkly different cultural backgrounds of the persons involved to the real problem at the root of all trouble  the abuse of power.        
	The protection of women against sexual harassment at workplace bill attempts to neutralize the most obvious of these problems. There is to be absolute confidentiality regarding the complainant and the complaint in each case, which would not even be accessible by the right to information. This is one way of protecting the complainant, as well as the accused, for the complaint could turn out to be false or mistaken. False complaints would be penalized. All organizations with more than 10 employees must have a committee against sexual harassment, and any employer ignoring this would be heavily fined. However, in the unorganized sector, the district collector has been made the court of appeal for sexual harassment. It is far from clear how this would work, if at all the sexually harassed were to risk losing their temporary jobs by complaining. Moreover, the bill seems to assume that the harasser is always male and the harassed female. But in harassment that is chiefly a manifestation of power, the reverse may be perfectly possible. It may even happen within the same sex. Then, would gender discrimination as a form of harassment be addressed by this law? What happens if a complainant is tortured further because of the complaint? Power works in strange ways. The new law must be tough enough, and far-seeing enough, to neutralize its corrupting reach.

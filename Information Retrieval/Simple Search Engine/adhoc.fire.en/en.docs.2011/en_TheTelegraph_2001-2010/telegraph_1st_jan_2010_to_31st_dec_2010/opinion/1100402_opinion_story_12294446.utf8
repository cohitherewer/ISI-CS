	The gradual rise of India and China as major economic and political powers could be the greatest geopolitical challenge facing the international system in the twenty-first century. So said Ronald Findlay and Kevin ORourke in their 2008 book, Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium. Even before the global financial crisis, others wrote about the shift in economic power from the West to the East. Some of that has been through the acquisition of natural resources globally. China has been acquiring natural resources in Africa, apart from an attempt to buy Rio Tinto, a minerals conglomerate; it is even acquiring what are predominantly Western brands, from IBMs personal computer business to the iconic American sport utility vehicle, the Hummer.        
	India is, too, even if it has been a late starter. Its companies have acquired coal mines in Indonesia, and also brands: Tata Motors owns Jaguar Land Rover, for instance. Other companies, including large information technology firms, have acquired smaller ones in the United States of America as a way of accessing Western markets. They have been less fortunate with European companies, but even that may be a matter of time. In the last few years, Suzlon acquired REpower, a wind turbine company based in Germany. Vedanta Resources is a minerals company operating out of the United Kingdom, but its principal assets and ownership are Indian.        
	But all this may be inadequate as proof that a shift in the centre of gravity of economic power has taken place. For one thing, both the Indian and the Chinese economies are a fraction of the US in gross domestic product terms: $1 and $4 trillion (nearly) compared to nearly $15 trillion for the US. The purchasing power of the American public  measured as consumption  is 70 per cent of GDP. That is, 300 million Americans spend $10 trillion a year compared to over a billion Chinese spending just over $1 trillion and one billion Indians spending $650 billion. The comparison to Europe provides similar results. Most projections say that China will catch up with the US by 2040; India could take much longer, of course, but could get there. But most of these projections tend to bypass the challenges both countries face internally. China will have to balance its heavily export-driven economy towards domestic consumption, and that involves dealing with sensitive political and structural issues. In 2020, Indias working-age population will be 900 million, according to the United Nations. Given Indias labour market conditions, where will the jobs for that many people come from? Western economies may yet bounce back to their earlier glory, and the Asian century may have to wait. The idea of an economic centre of gravity  what the US is now  is probably pass. It is only the first among equals  for now.

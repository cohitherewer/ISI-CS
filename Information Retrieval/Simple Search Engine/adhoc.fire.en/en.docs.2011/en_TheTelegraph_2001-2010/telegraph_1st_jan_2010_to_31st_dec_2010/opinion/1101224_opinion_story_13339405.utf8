                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO CAUSE FOR CHEER                                  BONAFIDE: MALVIKA SINGH                              
	What can we celebrate this season? Where is the creative energy of this special country and its people, who have unbounded resilience and patience? If we stop being obsessed with the faulty governance and bizarre politics of India, there is a palpable change happening. Indians, who get even the slightest opportunity to follow their dreams, are moving on, despite the horrors of a nation besieged by corruption, greed and malice at the high table of the powerful few who have become disconnected from the despair that ordinary citizens, betrayed by the leadership, feel. Cumbersome rules dominate every start-up small business, endless silly paperwork needs to be gone through before any productive step can be taken, unpleasant government officers have to be dealt with. All the paraphernalia that makes India virtually unliveable, if one is honest, has been circumvented.        
	World-class resorts exist, but the joy of raising the benchmark with every passing year gets diluted to the point where frustration suffocates the entrepreneur from reaching greater heights because of the ridiculous and archaic system of permissions for obvious aspects of a business. It merely gives space to many levels of bribery and corruption, with government representatives stalling legitimate permissions till they are paid off to do their mandatory jobs. Such is the case with the entertainment and fashion industries as well. In restaurants, bar licences are not given till some absurd signages are put in place, such as Exit above the stairway  such requirements kill aesthetics for no real and necessary reason. It is babudom at its worst, stuck in the hands of inexperienced men and women who know no better and are uninformed and unaware of a changed world beyond their confines.                
	Fairness and fun        
	It is this contrast  between middle-level babus being made to regulate a changing reality (where their lack of intellectual outreach disables them from adding value to a new and lively India) and a generation that will not allow itself to be shackled by norms of an age gone by  that is starkly unambiguous. Is our political leadership blind to all this? Is it incapable of restructuring the laws and policies that govern the service sector? Why does it permit the babu to indulge in rampant small- and large-scale corruption? Why is government endorsing the killing of revenue-generation in this sector of the economy that is the backbone of India?        
	Happily, heroic human endeavour and passion do not die at the hands of a moribund set of rules and norms that dominate our lives. Entrepreneurs continue to create world-class products, leaving behind the nightmare of government and its babu. Kingdom of Dreams, an entertainment world, in a walled-in area in Gurgaon, symbolizes that energy. That Broadway-style musical show is comparable to anything anywhere in the world in design, technology and performance  600 viewers on a weekday, included young and old, families and couples, all out for an evening of fun and laughter, good food and drink. For those few hours, away from television-screens and the sick-making truths about our leaders and their cohorts, one relaxed in the thought that India is on the move.        
	Anonymous non-Page-Three people, hardworking and earning well in this new age, were out there sharing a contemporary experience, secure in their skin. It is these Indians that governments have betrayed by not delivering their end of the deal. The public road leading to the venue is potholed, badly lit, broken down; but once you enter the gates of the Kingdom of Dreams, it all works like clockwork. There were no babus expecting freebies. People were paying for the fun  and fun it was.

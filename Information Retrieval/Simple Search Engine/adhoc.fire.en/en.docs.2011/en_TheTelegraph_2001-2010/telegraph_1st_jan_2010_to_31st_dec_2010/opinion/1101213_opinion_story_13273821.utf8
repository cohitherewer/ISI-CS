Commentarao -   S.L. RAO                                                            
	It is an adage that prices influence behaviour, whether for goods and services, employment, tax revenues, currency inflows, investment, savings, or any other factor for which there is a price. It may be called a wage, incentive, bonus, stock option, or by any other name, but these are all prices.        
	With our long legacy of command and control by the government, we have suffered many times by the governments interference in pricing. Here are two examples of misguided price signals given by the government. The government procures grains for subsidized sale to the poor under the public distribution system. Separately, the government also has a policy of buying these grains from farmers at minimum-support prices offered to farmers who cannot find a market at remunerative prices. For some years, when these two government-determined prices were different, a farmer wanting support could not expect a higher procurement price.        
	The government procuring grains for public distribution had to compete with private procurers of grains. In recent years, these two government prices have become the same. As a result, the government buys far more grains than it needs for public distribution, and lack of adequate storage rots the grains, locking up government funds. When the two prices are different, corrupt procurement officers pay the lower, minimum-support prices even when procuring for distribution and pocket the difference. Instead, the government could enter into purchase contracts in advance of crops at a minimum-support price. The stock so purchased can be used for distribution. If the procurement is inadequate, the government may, later in the season, offer an additional incentive price for the purpose. Additionally, for distribution, if the government gave cash or coupons to the poor as subsidy instead of physical grains, it could avoid having to procure, transport and handle large stocks.              
	Similarly, the national rural employment guarantee scheme guarantees 100 days of employment at a specified wage to one member of each rural household. There is a suggestion that this should be the same as the minimum agricultural wage. This will further divert labour to government-guaranteed work. Already a labour shortage has developed in some states  farm labour and industrial labour in towns like Ludhiana, dependent on migrant Bihar labour. Instead, the NREGA labour rate should be lower than the market wage.        
	Despite liberalization, some sectors of the economy continue to be insulated from influences of markets. Their prices are not market-determined. Over the last decade, telecommunications benefited the Indian consumer with both deep penetration and the cheapest telephone tariffs in the world. It happened because of competition in markets with reasonably light-handed regulation. Electricity, in present technology unable to have competition at all stages, remains short in supply and inefficient in distribution, generation and transmission. Dominant government ownership and a sizeable section of consumers given free or cheap electricity make it less possible.        
	For over 30 years, the Indian economy was under a command and control regime. A key characteristic from the 1950s to the late 1980s was the disbelief in the influence of prices on supply and demand. Instead, governments tried to predetermine market outcomes. Decisions on supply and demand were made by licensing producers and approving the quantities they could make, how and to whom they should be distributed, at what prices and margins, to demand forecasted by the government, with limits on prices, ceilings on salaries, and so on. Labour markets were rigid. Workers could not be retrenched even when demand was depressed or competition was severe and margins eroded. But the same level of wages had to be paid even when the employer was short of funds. Profit-sharing was compulsory even when there were losses. Cost reduction and efficiency improvement were limited because skills, technology and equipment to achieve them were rationed by the government.        
	The economy stagnated and, for almost three decades, India was stuck at the Hindu rate of growth of around 3 per cent per year. Consumer demands were not satisfied either in quantity or quality of goods and services. There was little innovation in products and processes. Profits were taxed at marginal rates of income tax of almost 99 per cent, removing incentive to improve profits. A manufacturer or trader could increase incomes by concealing production, so it was off the books, not taxed and earning black money. The cornering and hoarding of goods and services, and selling scarce goods and services at higher prices were ways of satisfying urgent demands. Whether it was railway tickets, airline tickets, synthetic textiles, sugar and other scarce goods and services, getting extra or out-of-turn supplies required that an agent be paid. Illegal incomes so earned went into purchases of luxuries, usually imported goods in the black or smugglers markets, and concealing larger sums under the bed in currency notes or in (illegal) foreign bank accounts.        
	The market and profit-making were abominations to policy-makers. So were the principal instruments for making markets work  namely, competition, consumer choice and prices as incentives. Our rulers could not appreciate that a freely market-determined price acted as a stimulus to behaviour among both suppliers and consumers. A ruling political, bureaucratic and business class, together with the intelligentsia, brought up for decades on this philosophy, has not yet discarded this mindset.        
	Markets must be open, fair and not manipulated by groups of suppliers and customers. The extortionate increase in air fares in India and the steep fall in telecom tariffs are converse examples. Airlines raised prices sharply in concert when demand rose after two years of losses and very low fares. In telecom, entry of many players has brought suicidal price competition. Especially with high investment sectors like these, cartels or excessive competition result in poor outcomes. Both sectors are natural monopolies: cost of entry for the infrastructure required makes for a natural monopoly. With telecom, poor market estimations led to multiple infrastructures. Natural monopoly characteristics demand independent, objective and transparent regulatory jurisdiction over tariffs. Otherwise, there are price cartels, profiteering and suicidal price competition.              
	Regulators must look at the total market scenario before trying to induce competition. Electricity supply in Mumbai is an example of overzealous regulators introducing choice between electricity suppliers for consumers without ensuring supply and that consumers will not resist market tariffs. When generating companies diverted electricity that was supplied to Mumbai for feeding consumers outside Mumbai for extra profits, Mumbai became short, supplies had to be procured at higher prices, and consumer tariffs rose. When the government wants prices that cross-subsidize poor consumers by the rich, market-determined prices are not possible.        
	Prices not determined by fair and transparent markets distort the market-induced equilibrium between supply and demand. However, when there are natural monopolies, regulated tariffs are inevitable. Independent and informed regulation is essential. Similarly, when support is given by the government to needy farmers who may not have a market for their produce, or social schemes provide employment (among other things) through subsidies and cross-subsidies, prices (including wages) must be openly set.        
	Such price-setting must be by independent expert regulators who must also intervene when shortages or gluts develop. The Competition Commission must also be vigilant and intervene on a suo moto basis when price-gouging of consumers takes place as it began to happen with airline fares. Regulators must also not allow a situation to develop when providers teeter on the verge of closing down because of unremunerative prices, as is happening in telecommunications.

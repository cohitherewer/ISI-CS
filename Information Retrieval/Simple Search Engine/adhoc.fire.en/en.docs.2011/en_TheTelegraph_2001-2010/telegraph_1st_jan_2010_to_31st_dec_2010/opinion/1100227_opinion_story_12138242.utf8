	Lost melodies                  
	Sir  This is an era that is fast losing touch with its roots. Recently, we lost yet another connection  good music on the radio. The All India Radio shifted its Vividh Bharati service from 1539 kilohertz to 828 kHz a few months back. The reception at 828 kHz is unclear and weak. This has spoilt the pleasure of listening to music on AIR. We understand that there may have been business compulsions that forced AIR to make this change. But it is a great disservice to the countless lovers of pure melody.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranadhir Mukhopadhyay, Dona Paula, Goa 

                
	In shame          
	Sir  It was shocking to see a police officer, and an inspector-general at that, addressing the media with his face covered out of fear of the Maoists, whom he is supposed to fight (Courage, thy name is IG, Feb 21). This IG reportedly spoke from his office, which presumably has a nameplate on its door. The report too identifies this officer as Benoy Chakraborty. Then what did he manage to achieve by veiling his face, except to make the affair ludicrous? So far, the Maoists have been the ones who have appeared before the media with their faces covered. Seeing a police officer following in their footsteps, the Maoists are perhaps laughing their heads off.          
	A few months back, the Maoists had abducted a police officer, Atindranath Dutta, who, upon his release, gave press interviews stating that the government should talk to the Maoists. Unlike Dutta, officers like Chakraborty seem to be concerned more about their own safety than about the peoples welfare, which can be achieved by solving the Maoist problem.           
	A rot seems to have set in the system. Intelligence reports are not acted upon, and serious communication gaps exist within the higher echelons of the police forces. There is a glaring lack of competence and credibility among the political and administrative classes when it comes to matters of security.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It must have been demoralizing for Indian public servants to see an IG of the Eastern Frontier Rifles addressing the media in a veil. Benoy Chakrabortys complaints against the superintendent of the Midnapore police and the state administration might be genuine. But he had no business airing his differences in public. Such actions serve only to discourage the forces that are in the thick of the battle against the Maoists. The chief minister must take strict action against this IG and institute a commission to investigate why the camp in Shilda was not shifted.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                          
	Same story          
	Sir  Reports in the media tend to give one a sinking feeling. George Orwells novella, Animal Farm, comes to mind in this context. In that work, animals take over a farm by throwing out human beings, and draw a constitution that says that all animals are equal. But later, some animals give themselves special privileges to oppress others. This allegory holds true for India. After throwing the colonizers out, we formulated a Constitution giving everyone equal opportunities irrespective of caste, creed, sex or religion. We held that it was the British who had adopted the policy of divide and rule by doling out favours to select groups. But our present establishment is no different. It continues to favour one group over the other to serve its own interests, as the erstwhile colonizers did.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Chakraborty, Calcutta

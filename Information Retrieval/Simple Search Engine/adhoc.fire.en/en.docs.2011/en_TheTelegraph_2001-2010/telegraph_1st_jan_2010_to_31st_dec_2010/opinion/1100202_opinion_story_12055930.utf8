	Swapna Gayen had said she would meet me in front of the Bowbazar Shibmandir and escort me to her room inside Haarkata. Swapna is a sex worker, and the Durbar Mahila Samannay Committee had helped in arranging an interview with her. I wanted to know her reaction to the Supreme Courts directive to legalize prostitution. We sat on Swapnas bed, and I noticed that she was in tears. A client had almost been beaten to death the night before. He is someones son, someones husband a young lad why hurt a person like this? she lamented.         
	Swapna had first started as a sex worker in Tollygunge. But she had to leave after being brutally beaten up and gang raped by hooligans when she protested against injustice towards a fellow sex worker. Then she took refuge in Haarkata. But the situation isnt any better. Burglary is a regular occurrence here, and there have been murders too  a sex worker killed by a client, or vice versa. Any attempt to speak up is met with threats.         
	Swapna hopes that things might improve if sex work were legalized. It will at least give us the right to protest against injustice. Our profession is illegal, which is why when we go to the police they often shoo us off. Some of them dont take down our FIRs, she said. Swapna also said that the police have become more cooperative after sex workers have come together in the DMSC.         
	Why has sex work not been legalized so far? She smiled ruefully: Some people like you come and talk to us nicely, but society thinks we are dirty. People will not accept us easily. I dont know why. When an artisan makes a plastic flower, he uses both his body and mind. In exchange, he gets money. We do the same thing. We provide sexual services using our body and mind. How are we different from other professionals?         
	She said an author had once told her that a sex worker was nothing but a sex toy. Swapna had asked if a woman who sleeps with many men just to enjoy sex is a sex toy too. If not, how did Swapnas taking money from her clients make her any different? We enjoy, and we also earn money. And we are happy about it, she said.        
	She told me that the DMSC has made them aware of the talk of legalization. It is obvious that we will want it. We want to stop under-age girls from coming into the profession, and also to send back those unwilling. We want to make this a clean business. Once we are legalized, doing all this will be easier, she said. So are the present sex workers in the profession by choice? According to Swapna, most of them are. They come here owing to extreme poverty; some want to escape getting beaten up by their husbands. They want to earn money and live a better life. Sometimes their husbands come here and beg them to go back, but they dont want to.         
	Swapna has two sons. They go to school and live in a hostel. Her elder son is 15. Once he was asked whether his mothers profession was wrong. Who decides what is right and wrong? How is my mothers profession wrong, if yours is right? Swapnas son, Rocky, had replied.                    ADHEESHA SARKAR

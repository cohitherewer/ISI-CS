	A four-year-old HIV+ orphan abandoned by her larger family and unable to find a foster home is a terrible story. The child is from Assam, and a look at the larger picture in the state provides the frame for this girls situation. First, there are nearly 70 other orphaned children in Assam who are either HIV+ or have AIDS, and whose parents have died of AIDS. But these children are all living with other members of family. So, obviously, the awareness-raising programmes in the state and throughout India have started to work at one level. This abandoned girls fate, being almost an exception in Assam, is, in a sense, doubly unfortunate. Of course, there are other questions that come up in relation to these 70, more fortunate, children. How many of them are old enough to go to school, and are able to do so? And, in school, what sort of attitudes and behaviour do they face? Have the awareness drives made a difference there? What if they have to be hospitalized? Would they be barred admission on disclosure of their HIV+ status?        
	To come back to the abandoned child, what seems to have failed, over and above the attitude of her surviving family, is the governments part of the responsibility to accommodate her in a suitable institution. So, even if a change in attitude seems to be happening, relatively speaking, the governments failure to build proper homes for children whose parents have died of AIDS and who are themselves infected or ill prevents children like this girl to be cared for properly. So this, among others, is one area where the state government and other non-government agencies have to pull up their socks urgently. It is, so to speak, easier to work with attitude change without taking too much help from the government. And, at a superficial level, more members of civil society, ordinary citizens, are interested in this sort of work. But the more material and infrastructural work is difficult to do because, at every stage, the governments co-operation is actively required. So, providing free treatment facilities, building homes and hospices and arranging for foster care become more challenging problems with less obvious rewards for those who do them. Thus, this aspect of HIV/AIDS gets neglected, both by the State and by civil society. It needs a different kind of political will. The story of this child requires more than a sentimental response.

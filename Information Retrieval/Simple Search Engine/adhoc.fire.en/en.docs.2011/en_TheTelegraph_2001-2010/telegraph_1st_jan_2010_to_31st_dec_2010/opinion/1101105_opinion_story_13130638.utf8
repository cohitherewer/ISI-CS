	DR. B.R. AMBEDKAR: THE MESSIAH OF THE DOWNTRODDEN By Janak Singh, Kalpaz, Rs 650        
	The grand narrative of history is a terrain of contested ideas, and any valid historical narrative is characterized by fissures, incompatibilities and discontinuities. Indias struggle for independence, considered by some to have been an elitist movement, contains many other histories of struggle  one of them being the movement against untouchability. This struggle witnessed the diametrically opposite views of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar.        
	Janak Singhs biography chronicles events in Ambedkars life, including the cruelty and humiliation he suffered for being born in the untouchable Mahar community. Singhs ideas on the issue of untouchability offer insights into Indian history. This sets his biography apart from those that narrativize only the representative actions of peoples lives. Singhs analysis of Ambedkars threadbare criticism of the British economic policy dispels the popular notion that he was a British stooge. His discussion on the Buddhas life in the chapter titled Embracing Buddhism explains Ambedkars abiding veneration for some Buddhist tenets.        
	But the pivotal sections of the book, like the chapter titled Clash of Titans, understandably concern untouchability. Both Gandhi and Ambedkar considered untouchability a social menace but their methods of dealing with it differed radically. Gandhi, a reformist, advocated what was not exactly a caste system, but varnashram, deeming untouchability an excess, an ugly growth on a body. The revolutionary Ambedkar, however, believed that untouchability had its roots in the caste system, and called for the latters annihilation. Ambedkars trenchant critique of the Gandhian approach to caste, and his vehement disapproval of the Harijan Sevak Sanghas activities and Gandhis opposition to a separate electorate for the untouchables in the Communal Award, are presented in reasonable detail. Ambedkars suspicion that Gandhi wanted untouchables in the Hindu fold in order to maintain numerical majority cannot be dismissed easily. But Gandhis views are drastically under-represented in the book, which deprives the reader of his right to compare and judge for himself. Singh calls Gandhi an enigma, but desists from criticizing Ambedkars ambiguous attitude towards Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League during Partition. In a letter immediately after Gandhis assassination, Ambedkar quotes Cicero after Caesars death: Tell the Romans, your hour of liberty has come. Singh overlooks the fact that Ambedkar invites the same sentiment against himself as a result of his activities for the federation of untouchables.        
	Ambedkars theory of the origin of untouchability says that sections of defeated tribal populations, called Broken Men, settled around and protected other tribal settlements. In return, they got the meat of dead animals. Brahmin injunctions put an end to the consumption of beef, but the Broken Men did not have the wherewithal to stop eating carrion. They soon became untouchables. Although historically contested, this theory is not critically examined in the book.        
	 Singh, however, brings forth Ambedkars personality vividly. Descriptions of events like the temple entry movement and the burning of Manusmriti carry a disturbing dramatic charge. The circuitous chain of events surrounding Ambedkars Hindu code bill, condemned by caste Hindus as an attack on sanatan Hinduism, proves that democracy stands perennially challenged even in an avowedly democratic country.

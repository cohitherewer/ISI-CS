                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Rule of law                  
	Sir  The tragedy of India is that laws are introduced to clamp down on offences against the State, but the wrong people are punished. The most glaring example of such injustice is the life sentence imposed on Binayak Sen under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (Binayak Sen gets life for sedition, Dec 25). Sen, a doctor and a human rights activist based in Chhattisgarh, was charged with colluding with Maoists to fight the State. Piyush Guha, a businessman from Calcutta, and Narayan Sanyal, a member of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), also got life sentences for sedition and conspiracy.          
	Earlier, Sen had been kept in jail for two years without trial before being granted bail. People all over the world, including the famous thinker, Noam Chomsky, and a group of 22 Nobel laureates, had appealed for his release. Perhaps the Chhattisgarh government wanted him sentenced to prove that he had been guilty all along.           
	The recent judgment has made thousands of Indians like myself think about the grave injustices that prevail in the country. While Sen faces a life-term, people responsible for instigating riots that have killed hundreds and for swindling crores of rupees still run free. Rajinder Sachar, a former Chief Justice at the Delhi High Court, and several other lawyers have condemned the judgment.           
	At the moment, the Niira Radia case and the 2G spectrum scam have monopolized public attention. It is imperative that the media, especially the electronic media, highlight Sens plight. The ailing doctor is no match for the State, which seems bent on having him indicted. It is to be hoped that justice will be done when the case is taken to a higher court.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  The judgment of the Raipur court, which passed a life sentence on Binayak Sen, has been severely criticized by many. According to reports, part of the evidence on which the ruling was based had been fabricated by the police. Earlier, the Supreme Court had branded some of the other evidence as purely circumstantial. In that case, the judgment is likely to crumble under scrutiny.          
	However, the problem is not restricted to the state of Chhattisgarh. The Centre seems to endorse the judgment. The home minister, P. Chidambaram, has threatened severe consequences for those who express support for dissidents. Moreover, the statement made by the Congress spokesperson, Abhishek Singhvi, implied that the judiciary can never be wrong.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Much doubt          
	Sir  In his excellent article, Benefit of the doubt (Dec 16), Mukul Kesavan has examined the revelations of the Niira Radia tapes and their implications for media figures like Barkha Dutt and Vir Sanghvi.           
	The media in India play an important role in forming public opinion and shaping society. However, as readers, we must be able to sift through the news that is presented to us and separate the chaff from the grain.           
	Freedom of the press is vital in a democracy, but this licence to report and comment should not be misused. The medias primary objective is to keep the public informed, but biased and prejudiced reporting must be avoided. Dutt and Sanghvi have been accused of colluding with the lobbyist, Niira Radia, and of compromising their integrity as journalists. Both claim that it was part of their jobs to tweak a private source for information.           
	The revelations of the leaked tapes may be disastrous for journalists. Everything they write or say will be held suspect by the public. Several politicians were also exposed by the tapes but the peoples disenchantment with the countrys leaders is nothing new. One almost expects politicians to be corrupt.           
	In the leaked tapes, Dutt offers to endorse A. Rajas candidature for telecom minister. Sanghvi, on the other hand, says that he will doctor his articles in favour of certain parties. Both insist that there was no transgression of journalistic practice and have asked for the benefit of the doubt. This is difficult, however, since both of them are thought to be close to the Congress-led government at the Centre. While they might be in sympathy with the ideological positions of the Congress, it is unacceptable that they should behave in a manner that suggests that they are up for sale. News should not be reduced to a saleable commodity.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Mukul Kesavans article on the Radia tapes throws up important moral and ethical questions. It is a well-known fact that lobbyists are paid to push through policies and legislations that will serve vested interests. But journalists competing for big stories continue to associate with such people. A journalists job is to report on events and not to take sides or participate in dubious transactions. Kesavan condemns this practice in no uncertain terms. He asserts that there must be ways of gathering information that do not compromise a journalists integrity.           
	The two famous journalists actions have damaged the medias credibility. They are now trying to manipulate public opinion and prove that they did nothing wrong. Kesavan, however, is stern in his appraisal of their actions. This is justifiable, as the precedent set by Dutt and Sanghvi should not become the norm. It could do irreparable damage to journalistic ethics and the principle of impartiality.           
	Yours faithfully,

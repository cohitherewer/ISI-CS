The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Between fear and the healthy life
                                                     BETWEEN FEAR AND THE HEALTHY LIFE                                  Pope Benedict XVIs selective endorsement of condoms is causing a major turmoil across AIDS-afflicted Africa, writes Somak Ghoshal                          Soweto, South Africa, on December 1, 2010, World AIDS Day                                  
	Recently, Pope Benedict XVI conceded that the use of condoms in certain cases could be acceptable for the Catholic Church. The global media greeted his statement as a significant shift in traditional Catholic doctrine. Words like hope and change were bandied about. However, a closer look at the popes comment, and at one of the fastest growing Catholic populations in the world, reveal a more disturbing picture.        
	The popes remark, appearing in the book, Light of the World: The Pope, The Church and the Signs of the Times, by Peter Seewald, is illustrated by the example of a male prostitute, who is exposed daily to the threat of HIV/AIDS. The pope clarifies that in such a context, condoms may be used as protection from disease. At one level, this is certainly a sign of change. The popes reference to male sex-workers suggests the churchs much-delayed recognition of the fact that people who should not be having sex with each other, in strict Catholic terms, end up doing so in real life. At another level, by focusing largely on homosexual relations, the pope does not meddle with the fundamental premises of Catholicisms ban on artificial birth control: since the principal agenda behind the embargo is to make conception possible, it makes no real sense to enforce it on people who would never be able to conceive anyway.              
	According to Reuters, although the original German text of Seewalds book, as well as its French and English translations, mention a male sex-worker, the Italian version of the excerpt, printed in the Vaticans newspaper, refers to female prostitution  probably amended as an afterthought. Such a revision indicates an advancement of sympathies; but it is still not good enough. No clear advice on using protection is given to heterosexual married couples, either of whom may be infected with HIV, or to those having sex outside marriage. Sex as pleasure still remains a taboo in modern Catholicism  sheer fixation on the condom, the pope believes, only leads to a banalisation of sexuality.        
	The popes apprehension about the popularity of condoms was expressed last year during his visit to Cameroon, where 5 per cent of the population, as of 2007, is HIV-positive. He declared that free distribution of condoms would encourage licentious activities and thus increase the risk of sexually-transmitted diseases; abstinence is the only way of avoiding the evil of HIV infection. From the crude moralism of this injunction to his present, quasi-liberal position, the pope seems to have undergone a slight change of heart. However, to one of the largest Catholic communities in the world, living in Africa, his partial retraction of the condom ban has caused deeper confusions, if not a sense of just outrage. But first, some statistics.        
	Africa has a Catholic population of around 160 million, and it is expected that by 2025, one-sixth of the worlds Catholics, some 230 million people, will be African. Significantly, 67 per cent of all the HIV-positive people of the world lives in sub-Saharan Africa, where three-fourths of the global AIDS deaths have been taking place since 2007. In South Africa, 250 people die every hour of AIDS-related complications. Campaigns by evangelical Christians and Catholic organizations to promote abstinence have clearly not helped, except in Uganda, where a zero-grazing policy  to encourage faithfulness  has had some credible success. However, in other places, as in the Republic of Congo, the prevalence of HIV infection has increased tenfold or more over a decade  from 0.8 per cent in 1998 to 8 per cent in 2008.        
	The correlation between religious brainwashing and mortality rates cannot be wished away, more so in the context of Catholic Africas reaction to the popes damage control over the condom controversy. While a moderate view on condoms might help the church secure more new members in the West, the popes concession comes as something of a shock to a majority of African converts. Most of them see it as a betrayal of the first principles of Catholicism, even as they are willing to grant the medical logic behind the popes select endorsement of contraceptives. Most Catholic Africans believe that the more reasonable approach would be to advocate stricter abstinence in accordance with the strictures of their faith.        
	Apart from religious grievances, this popular disdain, if not rejection, of contraceptives, is fuelled by a latent sense of jilted pride, which is a legacy from the colonial times. In the Orientalist view of Africa, the dark continent was, and remains, an impossibly licentious place of unbridled sexuality. The missionary project was mostly directed at civilizing the natives by harnessing their savage instincts through the moral doctrine of religion. The view that Africans are more prone to AIDS because of their innately promiscuous nature is still popular in the West, in spite of counter-arguments offered by medical anthropologists. Helen Epstein, for instance, argues in her book, The Invisible Cure: Africa, the West, and the Fight Against AIDS, that Africans are more vulnerable to the disease because being in concurrent relationships  long-term polygamous liaisons  is common in African society for both the sexes.              
	So, instead of abstinence, a more plausible solution to containing AIDS in Africa would perhaps be a campaign to encourage faithfulness  the zero grazing policy, mentioned above, that worked rather well in Uganda. However, the intervention of the multi-billion-dollar AIDS industry, based in the United States of America, complicates matters. Depending on their priorities, Republican and Democrat administrations continue to allocate huge sums of money to either the religious Right, solely interested in the abstinence policy, or to the liberal Left, which is all in favour of the condom option. The middle path  of trying to stay faithful to a single partner  does not curry favour with the establishment: religious organizations refuse to be persuaded out of the abstinence-only path, while condom manufacturers fear that such a life of fidelity may put them out of business.        
	As a result, the West continues to blunder its way through Africa, moving from the Age of Inaction to the Age of Ineffectual Action, to quote a commentator. There are born-again, condom-burning African Christian leaders wanting to prove to the West that their people are capable of staying pure and morally untainted. So various incentives are offered, such as free washing machines to every female virgin on her wedding day. Then there are politicians like Idi Amin and Robert Mugabe, who deplore the decadent West for being the root of all evil in Africa. As a result, feel-good advertisements of young people encouraging others like them to use condoms are torn down, miniskirts and make-up are banned, and infidelity is punished with death.        
	Between the fear of god and the fear of death, the promise of leading a healthy life is conveniently abolished.

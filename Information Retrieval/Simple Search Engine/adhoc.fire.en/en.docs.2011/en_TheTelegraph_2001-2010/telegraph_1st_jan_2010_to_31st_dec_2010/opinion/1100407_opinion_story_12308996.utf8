                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MIND THE GAFFE                                                    
	The Greek philosopher, Socrates, once said that he was considered wise because he knew what he did not know. Most people, he said, were ignorant about their own ignorance. The maxim inherent in Socratess self-description could also apply to politicians: they should know what they do not know and steer away from the latter. English as she is spoke has never been Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees strong suit. It need not be so since he is the chief minister of a state whose most common spoken language is Bengali. Yet, Mr Bhattacharjee has rushed headlong into a needless controversy over the use of English with the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram. Mr Bhattacharjee believes that the sentence, the buck stops at his table, used by the home minister is slang. Mr Bhattacharjee stands appalled that a politician could use slang. It needs to be pointed to the chief minister of West Bengal, who studied Bengali as an undergraduate, that he could not be more wrong. The words used by Mr Chidambaram are very common in spoken English. The saying, the buck stops here, has been around since the 19th century and is certainly not slang. In an attempted and unnecessary thrust at the home minister, Mr Bhattacharjee has made a spectacle of his own ignorance of English and its usage. He would have lost nothing if he had kept his mouth shut.        
	There is, however, a more important issue embedded in Mr Bhattacharjees attempted riposte to Mr Chidambaram. The very fact that the chief minister can hold forth on the home ministers language suggests that Mr Bhattacharjee has enormous time on his hands. This should not be the case if he were devoting adequate attention to his ministerial responsibilities. On many important matters  from health to law and order to economic development  the state government, in the last few months, has taken no major initiatives. The general impression is that Mr Bhattacharjees government is merely biding its time till the assembly elections next year. The chief ministers excursions into the finer points of English usage would tend to confirm the impression that at the moment more frivolous subjects attract him than affairs of state. It is a sad comment on the chief ministers credibility that he has to reiterate in public that I have to do my work. He added, as if in reassurance, that he knew his responsibilities and that he would discharge them. The people of West Bengal can only hope that he does.

	You can tail them, terrorize them and finally, arrest them; you can also humour them. In a country as vast as China, there are a myriad ways of dealing with discontented citizens. Contrary to the general opinion, the Communist Party doesnt rule like a monolith. Local governments find their own ways.        
	One such unique experiment is the website of Xindu, a district in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan. The government website has won the approval not only of Chinas super active netizens, but also that of the official China Daily. It responds to online complaints promptly, efficiently, and perhaps most importantly, without sounding bossy or patronizing. It even manages to inject a sense of humour in its replies. To a netizen complaining that officials of a particular district were all fat and ugly, how could they not be corrupt?, the reply was that the Party Discipline Committee had investigated and found no evidence of corruption among the cadres. Advising the complainant to present specific evidence to the PDC, the reply added: We remind you: You should not judge if a person embezzles or not based on his or her being fat or thin.        
	Xindus online complaints system started in 2008. But some departments to which the complaints were forwarded by the central team that received the mails, simply passed the buck. When this was reported to the district party secretary, he pulled them up in open meetings. Now, departments sending mails back must give a reason for doing so. They are given a week, or at the most a fortnight, to answer the mails.        
	But the actual writing of the replies is done by the central team which forwards the mails. In an interview to a local newspaper, the man who writes the mails said he tried not to use fancy words, and liked to put his own personality into the replies.                
	New outlook        
	The uniqueness of the website, however, and also the secret of its success, lie in its openness. It censors nothing, neither rudeness, nor embarrassing exposs. Rudeness is handled with a line at the end of the reply: Please use civilized language when you report a problem. Exposs are checked out, then either confirmed or denied. For example, to a question about how many years a former village mayor was sentenced to for taking bribes, the reply gave the exact sentence: 10 years and six months.        
	This approach has worked wonders. The number of complaints by post and in person has dropped steadily since the online forum was set up  from 4,668 petitions in 2008, when the website started functioning, to 3,890 last year, and just over 1,000 this year.        
	Normally, action is taken on complaints  one about massage parlours resulted in three of them being shut down. However, if an allegation is found untrue, the complainant usually gets a dose of advice. One such reply is worth quoting.        
	A netizen asked petulantly, Why is no one acting against the corrupt officials in (a certain) town? They are greedy and blatant. Our mayor and our commune leader have cars worth 100,000 yuan, and his (sic) home interior decoration is awesome. The reply directed the complainant to present specific evidence to the PDC. Then followed a little speech, revealing the Chinese Communist Partys new, post-Mao ideology. As for the matter of the mayor and the commune leader having cars worth 100,000 yuan, you should regard it in terms of whether their incomes/expenses come from proper sources and protected under the law. You (and the broad masses) should understand that even village cadres have the right to prosper... if they become rich through proper methods, they ought to become fine examples for people. You cannot say that a cadre must be corrupt if he owns a 100,000 yuan car. If we obtain concrete evidence of corruption, we will spare no effort.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Counting NRIs in
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        COUNTING NRIS IN                              If the proposed amendment to the Representation of People Act goes through, non-resident Indians may get voting rights. But this could lead to several complications, says Seetha                        Promises to keep: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the inaugural session of the 8th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Delhi				                                 
	Can Dawood Ibrahim or Chhota Rajan, sitting in whichever country they are currently holed up in, vote in the next general elections?        
	If Prime Minister Manmohan Singh makes good a promise he made at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas  the annual jamboree of non-resident Indians (NRIs)  in January to give voting rights to NRIs, they probably can. Provided, of course, that they have retained their Indian citizenship.        
	Singh only has to take an earlier effort forward  a Bill to amend the Representation of People Act (RPA), 1950, that had been tabled by the first United Progressive Alliance government in 2006 is pending in Parliament.        
	The Indian diaspora is understandably elated at the move but theres concern within the country about the complications it could result in.        
	Right now, NRIs cannot vote in elections because the RPA requires a person to be ordinarily resident in a particular constituency in order to be registered as a voter there. Only members of the armed forces, paramilitary forces, state armed police and government officials posted abroad are exempted from this requirement.        
	The NRI request for the right to vote has been a long-standing one and the matter has also gone to court. In 1998, the Kerala High Court directed the central government to consider ways in which this could be done.        
	The amendment proposed is no more than the addition of a line which seeks to expand the definition of the term ordinarily resident set out in Section 20 of the RPA. The section, in its present form, doesnt spell out how long a person should have been living in a locality in order to be ordinarily resident there. But it states that merely owning or being in possession of a house in a locality will not be enough to get registered as a voter there.        
	Successive court judgements, former chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami points out, have said that the field officer will have to satisfy himself about the veracity of a persons claim to be a resident of a particular address.        
	However, it has been generally accepted that a person should have been staying there for at least six months. This is the basis on which electoral officers register voters, though they have the discretion to register people who may have just shifted into a locality. Clause 1A of Section 20 says that a person will not cease to be ordinarily resident in a constituency if he temporarily absents himself from the area, without defining temporary or specifying the reasons for absence.        
	The 2006 amendment proposes to introduce a new clause which says that a person absenting himself from his place of ordinary residence owing to his employment, education, or otherwise, outside India, whether temporarily or not will not cease to be ordinarily resident in India. Once again, the period that can be considered temporary has not been specified. The amendment applies only to those who remain Indian citizens and does not extend to holders of the Person of Indian Origin (PIO) card (which is given to people who once held Indian passports but are now citizens of other countries).        
	The United States and Britain are among several countries that allow non-resident citizens to vote. Britain allows citizens to vote for 15 years after they have moved out. In both countries, the expatriates are registered as voters in the locality they last lived.        
	The main criticism of the proposed amendment is that the provision is discriminatory. Allowing NRIs to remain registered in the constituencies they would have lived in had they been in India is unfair to domestic migrants, an Election Commission official points out. Under the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, names of persons who relocate within India are struck off the electoral rolls of the constituency they earlier lived in. Though the registration officer is required to give a notice and hearing to such people before deleting their names, this is rarely done.              
	The standing committee of Parliament, which studied the Bill, also noted that it seemed to be creating a separate category of citizens rather than conferring voting rights to Indian nationals living abroad.        
	The committee considered rewording the proposed Section 20 (1AA) to read a citizen of India, who has not acquired the citizenship of any other country, shall be deemed to be resident in India in any constituency of his choice notwithstanding his residence outside India whatever its duration.        
	Another suggestion made was that this problem could be overcome if the words outside the state were added along with outside India.        
	This can become chaotic, says Gopalaswami. It could create a problem of bogus voting, if checking of identity proof is not rigorous enough.        
	The amendment is also silent on how NRIs will vote. Insisting that they be physically present on voting day may be unrealistic. But allowing other forms of voting may be even more so.        
	Currently, armed forces and paramilitary forces have been given the privilege of postal ballot and proxy voting (where a relative or another nominee can vote in their place) while state armed police personnel posted outside the state and officials deployed in missions abroad can vote through postal ballot.        
	Extending the postal ballot facility to all NRIs could be a logistical nightmare, says the Election Commission official. Ballot papers for the constituency where each person is a voter have to be mailed to them and have to be returned before close of counting. We get only 15 days time from the last date of withdrawal of nominations to the time results are declared. How can we send and receive ballot papers from thousands of people across the world, when doing it for even a limited number of people who now have the facility is difficult? Even if that can be done, it can open up avenues for rigging, says Gopalaswami. Allowing proxy voting (which British expatriates can do) is even more dangerous, he feels.        
	An alternative could be allowing voting to take place in Indian embassies. But that, says the Election Commission official, wont be practical. Indians could be spread across a country while embassies are located in just the capital, with a secondary office in a couple of other cities, in some cases.        
	What the amendment will inadvertently result in is giving NRIs the right to contest elections, since a person registered as a voter is automatically eligible to stand for elections. This is an issue the standing committee also flagged and sought clarity on from the government.        
	Will the amendment Bill be reworked to address these concerns or be passed in its current flawed form? Time alone will tell.

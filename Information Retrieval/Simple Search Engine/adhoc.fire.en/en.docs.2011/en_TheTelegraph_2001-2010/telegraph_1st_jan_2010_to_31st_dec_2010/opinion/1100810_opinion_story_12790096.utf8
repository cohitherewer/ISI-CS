                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNNATURAL                                                    
	There was everything unnatural about the natural disaster that struck Leh last Friday. As scientists have pointed out, a cloudburst of such intensity over a cold desert is a rare and perplexing phenomenon. So it is difficult to blame the administration for being unprepared to meet the challenges posed by a tragedy that had been least anticipated. However, the fact remains that hundreds are dead or missing or homeless in the Ladakh region. Those who have managed to survive face the threat of waterborne diseases and are yet to receive adequate care and support from the State, although the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, did rush to the area to be with those affected. So, whether expected or not, no amount of theorizing on the event can take away from the scale of suffering that has been inflicted on the people.        
	Yet, it is precisely this aura of unexplained mystery that should provoke environmental experts to probe the causes behind such an unprecedented occurrence. In recent times, there has been a fairly clear indication that weather patterns are changing in unforeseen ways all over Asia. Close to Leh, across the border, Pakistan has been hit by one of the most severe floods in 80 years. It is true that Pakistan has made notoriously little investment in water infrastructure, neglecting to build big dams that could have arrested the virulence of the destruction. Yet, apart from the failure of the administration, other factors need to be addressed. The gradual removal of forest cover over the years is also responsible for the speed with which rainwater flowed into the rivers, raising water levels dangerously. Further up in Asia, a deadly fire is raging through forests in Russia and threatening to cause serious health hazards by releasing radioactive particles into the air near the site of the ill-fated Chernobyl disaster. It is ironic that a nuclear-powered nation that considers itself a major superpower is unable to bring the fire under control. And that is partly due to the innumerable peat bogs that lie dried up, acting as potential tinderboxes across the most densely- populated areas in Russia. From the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to the unchecked emission of greenhouse gases, people are pushing the planet to the edge of a precipice. The doomsday signs are all here. Should one be surprised by killer showers all that much?

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE LADIES IN WHITE                                  A UNIQUE SISTERHOOD      Those who lived in the shadows and uncovered the truth                                                  
	I have always wondered why Lalmohan Ganguly chose Jatayu as his pseudonym. That great bird was brave and fearless but, poor thing, he died while trying to save Sita from the clutches of Ravan. Why should a writer of detective stories, the hero of whose creation is the invincible Prakhar Rudra, take on the name of an old and infirm, somewhat foolhardy, bird as his nom de plume? Does Lalmohanbabus choice have something to do with the fact that Jatayu gave Ram the essential clue as to the direction taken by Ravans chariot? Although the clues Lalmohanbabu provides for his own hero are often suspect, prone as he is to imagine that camels store water in their stomach, he sometimes does give Feluda the much-needed lead in his investigations, albeit inadvertently.        
	The bungling Lalmohanbabu is the opposite of the suave Satyajit Ray. Yet, as a writer of detective stories installed within Rays detective stories, he seems to function as his creators alter ego. Through the gaffes he commits in his thrillers, Lalmohanbabu indicates the mistakes that a sloppy writer is likely to make. In functioning as his authors double, Lalmohanbabu recalls another crime-fiction writer who is a character in some of the adventures of Agatha Christies Hercule Poirot  Ariadne Oliver, or Mrs Oliver, as she is better known.        
	The verve with which Mrs Oliver speaks against her literary agents or the Beatniks suggests that she is voicing her creators feelings on these issues. In the character of Mrs Oliver, Christie seems to be satirizing her own travails as an author. The name Christie chose for her mirror image is interesting. Ariadne is the Greek princess who supplied Theseus with the thread that would guide him out of the labyrinth. Like Jatayu, who led Ram to his Sita in Lanka, Ariadne Oliver would often give Poirot the important link to the truth.        
	As a woman, Mrs Oliver has easy access to that storehouse of facts and half-truths which is peculiarly feminine  gossip. In Elephants can Remember, each of the women Mrs Oliver interviews has either been in the neighbourhood or in the employ of the Ravenscrofts, the family at the centre of this novel. What these nannies and domestic-helps present Mrs Oliver with is a mishmash of fact and fiction within which the truth is hidden. Christie lets Poirot extract the truth, though, one suspects, Mrs Oliver might as well have done it. And she does solve a crime on her own in The Pale Horse.        
	The indigenous version of Mrs Oliver can be found in the various would-be lady detectives of Leela Majumdars fiction. Majumdar seems to have had a fascination for detective aunts, who are apparently domiciled, with a great talent for cooking, but are also extremely intelligent, and so experts in the art of detection. Given the descriptions Majumdar often provides of her detectives, the tiktikis  the proverbial lizard on the wall that can easily merge with the background and not attract attention to itself  it can be easily deduced that a woman of the widowed pishima (aunt) category would make a great detective. So we have the redoubtable paan-chewing Padipishi in a white thhan (widows sari), who effortlessly extracts through blackmail the choicest jewels from her brothers coffers, hands them over to her good-for-nothing son, and then forgets all about them. But when, after many decades, a young descendant of her family comes on a visit to her house, she returns from the dead to guide the boy to the jewels in his dream.        
	Majumdars short story, Bhagyadebi Branch Hotel, is remarkable in what it suggests about this pishima figure. Like Padipishi, the Kashi-basi (one who lives in Benaras) Annapishi who tells this story is a formidable widow. Like Mrs Oliver, she is presumably an expert gossip, since she has earned acclaim by writing a book that recreates the daily lives of people in an ordinary by-lane of Kashi. But if she is an old gossip, she is also a writer  like Christie, or like Majumdar herself  whose book has awed the male establishment. Yet as a woman who has ventured out of her domain to become a successful writer, she must downplay her achievements. So she concocts a story about the goddess of fate gifting her the manuscript from which she had merely copied.        
	As she tells her story to her gaping audience of grandnephews, Annapishi lets slip, as if by mistake, that she is illiterate and so cannot have written the book herself. As intended by Annapishi, the children jump at the suggestion, and clamour to see the manuscript. She dismisses them by saying that it cannot be retrieved since it was a magic manuscript. Whatever might be the truth about Annapishis foray into writing, by holding her young audience captive with her tale, and by manipulating it according to her wish, she has proved that she is an expert storyteller, if not a writer. Content to remain in the shadows, Annapishi claims no more than what is rightfully hers  the domain of oral literature traditionally associated with women that is always unfinished, forever getting recreated in the spoken words of the individual storyteller.                    ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | midterm crisis
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MIDTERM CRISIS                                                    
	Two Novembers ago, liberals were euphoric after Barack Obama was elected the first black president of the United States of America. Their jubilation has been severely chastened by the results of the midterm polls. Apart from capturing a significant number of seats in the Senate, the Grand Old Party has reclaimed its majority in the House of Representatives. So Nancy Pelosi, the first female Speaker, will now have to give way to John Boehner, an arch Republican. A hardcore conservative from Ohio has replaced a liberal San Franciscan  can there be better proof that a seismic shift has taken place in US politics over the last two years? The most astonishing development, however, is the rise of the ultra-Right Tea Party movement. Not many, for instance, had anticipated the elevation of someone like Rand Paul, a Tea Party favourite, to high office. Mr Paul recently admitted that, in all likelihood, he would have opposed the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Moreover, most of his colleagues do not see the logic of putting any limits on corporate power; they are also opposed to state public pensions. So it is heartening that people finally decided to draw the line with the Tea Party senatorial candidate, Christine ODonnell, from Delaware, who was rumoured to have been a witch. If the Democrats are losing sleep over the Republican revival, the Republicans must be scared stiff by this impressive debut of the Tea Party.        
	It would be wrong-headed, if not outright risky, for the Republicans to counter the rise of the Tea Party with their own brand of aggressive conservatism. While the Republicans may eventually sabotage Mr Obamas prized healthcare reform, introduce deeper spending cuts, and reduce the size of the government, they may still be forgiven by the electorate. As the exit polls revealed, the primary concern for voters this time was the recovery of the economy rather than ideology. By defecting in such massive numbers to the Right, people have mainly registered their apathy for Democrat policies that failed to bring about an economic course correction. In a destabilized Congress, Mr Obama will find it increasingly difficult to push through more centrist and Left-leaning policies. The 44th president began his career on a note of high confidence, but seems to have been forced into making concessions halfway through his first term.

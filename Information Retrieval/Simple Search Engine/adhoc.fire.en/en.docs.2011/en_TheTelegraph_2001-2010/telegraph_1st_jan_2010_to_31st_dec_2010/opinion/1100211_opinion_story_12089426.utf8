	It is a simple enough principle. Thugs must never, even in passing, be given the time of day. Had the Congress-led government in Maharashtra looked ready to implement it at the slightest provocation, Shiv Sena goons would not have dared to go on rampage, destroying property and threatening theatre-owners, to demonstrate Bal Thackerays opposition to Shah Rukh Khan. Although the action taken by the government against the mindless violence of the Shiv Sena is welcome, there is something faintly ludicrous in the states having to marshal different security forces and cancel all leave just so that a film can be released and watched in peace. The incongruity springs from the indulgence accorded to the Shiv Sena on various occasions, an indulgence both political and social. Mr Thackeray and his goons were cosseted, predictably, by the Bharatiya Janata Party, which helped them to a slice of governance as long as it was in power. That time is now past, but Shiv Sena goons still thrive on a diet of the most regressive sentiments, the cruder and more ignorant the better. But they could not have continued to wreak destruction without touching chords of unreasoning and ill-informed antagonisms among certain sections of the people. Combined with their ready violence, and the fiery speeches of their leaders who are never brought sufficiently to account for inciting hostilities among groups, this appeal to the lowest impulses has been the secret of their perverse relevance.        
	Although all opinions  anti-women, anti-secularism, anti-freedom, anti-civilization, anti-reason, anti-democracy  have place in a democratic republic, threats and violence do not. Yet, political parties baulk at coming down heavily on organizations like the Shiv Sena, in case their electorate thinks they are unpatriotic, or un-Hindu, or too Westernized. The law seems to vanish. The ludicrousness of the Maharashtra governments amassing of security forces to protect My Name is Khan is located in this paradox. If it is Sharad Pawars show of deference to Mr Thackeray that has encouraged the Shiv Senas frenzy, then that must be dealt with politically. For once, the Maharashtra government must make clear, to the Shiv Sena and to citizens, that it will brook neither destruction nor disruption, and that meaningless aggression with communal overtones will be treated with the greatest severity.

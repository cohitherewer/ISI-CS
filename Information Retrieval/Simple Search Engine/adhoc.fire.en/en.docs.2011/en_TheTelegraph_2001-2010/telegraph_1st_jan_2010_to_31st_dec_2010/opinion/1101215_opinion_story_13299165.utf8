                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNHOMELY                                                    
	What, one might ask the Union home minister, is home? There was a brief, but sinister, moment of dangerously confused thinking and speaking in P. Chidambarams public life recently about what people who are not in their home terrain for reasons of work are generally like. Mr Chidambaram seemed to think, however briefly, that there was some sort of connection between the sexual crimes against women in Delhi and the capital attracting a large number of migrants. He elaborated on this by suggesting that unacceptable behaviour and unauthorized colonies may not be unconnected phenomena. He said this somewhere near the Jantar Mantar in Delhi, in the presence of the Delhi chief minister, in the history of whose attitude to migrants there have been similar regrettable moments. To make matters worse, Mr Chidambaram has now gone into damage-control mode, saying that his comment on migrants was a matter-of-fact reference and that when he spoke about them he did not specify state, region, language, race or religion. Paradoxically, this unapologetic defence of his own generalizing matter-of-factness sounds even more sinister. The home minister of a diverse nation, which takes pride in its standards of democratic liberalism, should speak more responsibly and less chillingly. Besides, the office of the home minister risks losing dignity and credibility with a retraction that sounds more absurdly self-contradictory than the original statement being retracted.        
	Delhis moments of international glory invariably rest on the largely invisible toil of migrants, and its most powerful inhabitants, irrespective of where they are from, tend to forget this fact rather more frequently than is good for anybody. Migrant workers got the worst deals before, during and after the Commonwealth Games. They were brought in to make the city look impressive to the world, made to work in appallingly uncomfortable and hazardous conditions, paid much less than the others, and thrown out unceremoniously once their jobs were done. Bigoted thinking sounds more or less the same across the political spectrum, from left to right. When the home minister begins to sound like the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, however fleetingly, Indians who cherish feeling at home anywhere in the country will prick up their ears  as they should.

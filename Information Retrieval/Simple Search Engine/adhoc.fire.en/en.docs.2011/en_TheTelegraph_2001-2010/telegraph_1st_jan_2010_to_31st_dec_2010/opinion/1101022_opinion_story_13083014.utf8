	Inevitable is the new buzzword resounding in the corridors of power. From lyse Palace to 10 Downing Street, it is the alibi used by politicians to justify unpopular economic reforms. Following the example of the French president, it is now the turn of the Quad in Britains coalition government  David Cameron, George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander  to invoke inevitability. Mr Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, slashed 81 billion on public spending to bring down Britains national deficit (one of the highest among developed countries) in the latest spending review. The move was widely anticipated by citizens and partially endorsed by a section of the press. Nonetheless, this remains one of the biggest cuts in public spending since World War II and parallels with Lloyd Georges infamous Geddes Axe of the 1920s are bound to be drawn. As is customary with Tory-majority governments, the ill, the poor and working parents are the worst hit. While welfare benefits have been reduced, no effort has been made to increase taxes on the rich. It would have been prudent to balance the need to reduce debt with a corresponding impetus to create sustainable jobs. On the contrary, half a million in the public sector are to be fired. Such moves may have been unavoidable, but they are nevertheless reminiscent of the Thatcherite era  although divested of the Iron Ladys ideological baggage.        
	It is always more sensible to cut public deficit when the economy is at its strongest, not when it is drooping. The process, moreover, needs to be softened by reducing expenditure over a long period. Britains economy was damaged by the previous Labour governments misdemeanours. From its astronomical defence budget to fund the war on terror to the expenses scandal in which its peers are implicated, Labour has much to account for. It is no surprise, perhaps, that Labour politicians, in the opposition now, had precious little to offer in response to the coalitions rescue plan. The Tories wagered on the peoples trust and, as with any gamble, the chances of victory are precariously balanced with the possibility of humiliation. In fact, by cheering on the cuts imposed on the common people, Tory members of parliament wagered more than they had bargained for. There may have been a touch of mischievous glee in cutting the funds allotted to the Queen, but the people may not be in a mood to be amused.

	There is no doubting the fact that the Indian Premier League works on sound business sense. Had there been any room for sentimentality in its transactions, it would have become less of a money-making machine than it is and more of a sinecure for retired sportsmen whom people had problems forgetting. The IPL represents competition, the ugliest aspects of it, as also its prettiest. Which is why the best talents in the sport are drawn to the IPL and the heaviest purses are allowed to put a price tag on them. By this simple logic of the marketplace, the cricketers of Pakistan should have been priced commodities. Till last year, in fact, they were. If the third auction of the IPL found them returning empty-handed, it is because forces more duplicitous than the market have intervened. Since last year, the competition has been the unfortunate victim of the politics of two nations. A summary ban on Pakistans cricketers from playing for the matches after the Mumbai tragedy prevented them from appearing for the tournament in South Africa. This year, the same factor has intervened, and more dishonourably. There is no formal ban on the players, but the authorities on both sides of the border, either through their action or inaction, have made sure that they continue to remain excluded from the tournament.        
	A huge question mark on their availability has dissuaded franchisees from bidding for them. The question could have been put to rest had the respective cricket boards of India and Pakistan, as also the government, which processes such travel, given enough confidence to the organizers and the parties concerned about the cricketers participation. That this was not done indicates that, on either side of the border, political one-upmanship is dictating the course of the game. The question of the cricketers availability has been linked to security, particularly in Mumbai, where a number of matches are to be held and where much public anger could be whipped up against the Pakistan cricketers by the Shiv Sena and Hindu Right parties. But these considerations should have weighed with the government, which is supposed to provide the security, and the IPL management, which is organizing the tournament, before bringing the players to the auction. The hamhandedness has done immense disservice to the game, and to the cause of peace.

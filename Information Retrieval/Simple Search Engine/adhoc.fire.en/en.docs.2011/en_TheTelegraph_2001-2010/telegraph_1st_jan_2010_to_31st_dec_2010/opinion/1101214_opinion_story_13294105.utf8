                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE HEALING GAME                                  MALA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Rumour has it that there is a very active and carefully calibrated tussle going on within the Congress to determine the successor to Manmohan Singh. Why is this happening with such intensity, since there are still some years to go before the next general elections? And why is this dissension being permitted within the party at a time when there is a frightening discord in Parliament that could damage our democratic framework as well as the larger political space? Surely, it would make sense to regroup and restructure the faulty system that governs the Congress Party in order to renew and restore the inherent strength and stability of the party mechanisms. Times have changed rather radically, and the tradition of playing a game of musical chairs to allow unaccountability to flourish will not work. This old trick, which enforces the status quo, is no longer valid.        
	The archaic political machinations of the Congress Party have broken down, and the new Indian is seeking a different kind of commitment and governance. India is demanding regional leaders who are not puppets of the central leadership of any party but are, in fact, stalwarts who belong, who will work, and who will deliver in competition with other states. Federalism is beginning to see the light of day, and it is time the Congress looks towards the horizon of an emerging India. Nitish Kumar symbolizes this change. Mayavati has understood she will have to follow suit, and will have to deliver goods and services if she intends to succeed as a regional satrap.                 
	New life        
	Unfortunately, the mother of all national parties has lost its regional faces over the decades following the watershed period in Indian politics: the Emergency. The centralisation of state politics over the last 30 years has destroyed the democratic processes that should have been the operating mechanism of the Congress Party. This resulted in the corroding of the premise on which it was founded. Party politicking, backbiting, misinformation, lies, devious manipulation of innocent party members, nepotism, fear of those with an ear to the top, and every other form of intrigue that has historically plagued regimes in decline has overwhelmed the one party that represents the diversity of India. That is the real tragedy.         
	Having won a second term with the Congress pulling in handsome numbers, this government has lost its credibility faster than anyone would have imagined. Apart from the scams, there have been many other misgivings. The various ministries should have been working in tandem, taking on the exciting challenges that come with growth and change. Instead, petty politics and greed have afflicted their efficiency and resulted in amputations. For us who are on the outside and who perceive the mood by what affects us on the ground, there seems to be a lack of team spirit. Parallel lines appear never to converge, much like India and Bharat. It is this that has resulted in socio-political anarchy. If this intensifies, a spurt in economic growth, but without infrastructure, will only aggravate human misery on the ground and create a dangerous conflict between the haves and the have-nots.         
	The challenge is to deliver for both ends of the spectrum, which is now a dirty word! Surely the United Progressive Alliance can come together and ensure that this substantive correction happens. Some individuals at the helm of the Congress, for a start, need to take the risk and tear away the old skin, encourage the growth of a new order, take the challenges head on, make their own mistakes and move ahead. This business of depending on those who failed the party and shrank it is a deadly mixture that needs to be spat out for a grand renewal.

	This is a tale of two cities, rather a tale of two countries, neighbours with deep and enduring bonds that are familial and destined to grow further.        
	About 1.8 million people in much of the national capital area of Washington spent the United States of Americas 234th Independence Day on Sunday restricted in their use of toilets, dishwashers and washing machines, absolutely banned from washing their cars or watering their gardens on pain of being asked to cough up a fine of $500 for any violation of those mandatory restrictions on the use of water. The capital regions problem was not any summer water shortage, but the state of its water supply system. For Americans, this was the latest in a string of bad news about their countrys creaking infrastructure: more than a trillion dollars are urgently needed to upgrade American roads, bridges, dams, mass transport, airports, schools, water quality and waste-disposal facilities, among other benchmarks of a developed society, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. But there is no money to be found.        
	Flashback to the previous week. In Toronto, Canadas largest city, people were lamenting that for the first time since their city was founded 217 years ago, tear gas had to be used against their own people by a police force, which was created to protect Torontonians. This is a police state, screamed one of those protesting against the G-8 and G-20 summits then taking place in Toronto, her face strategically turned towards a line of television cameras as she was being led away to a police vehicle.        
	Clearly, this woman does not have the faintest idea of what a police state even looks like. She should have been sent to Washington for a tutorial on police highhandedness against peaceful demonstrators. Or she should look up news archives of how the police dealt with protesters on the eve of the Republican Partys national convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul, which nominated John McCain as the US presidential candidate in 2008.              
	Exactly a week ago, a federal judge in Washington approved a settlement of $13.7 million with people who were arrested during a peaceful protest in the city. Among those who will receive the compensation, a result of 10 years through the legal system, was a man who was not only picked up with his juvenile offspring, but was thrown into a police bus with his right hand and left foot cuffed together and forced to spend hours together in that position.        
	Last year, Americas capital city similarly agreed to pay $8.25 million to about 400 people, many of them mere bystanders, who were picked up while watching a protest against the World Bank in 2002. Those who were arrested then included a 56-year-old woman who had come to Washington for a date and was quietly walking to her dinner when she became a victim of the police sweep.        
	Having G-8 and G-20 summits just across his northeastern border with Canada has not been good for the US president, Barack Obama, because what the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, had showcased for his guests drew inevitable comparisons with a G-20 summit, which Obama hosted in Pittsburgh only nine months ago and with a G-8 summit hosted by George W. Bush on Sea Island, Georgia, in 2004.        
	It is unfortunate that some of those who accompanied the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to Toronto for the G-20 summit are men who believe that Americas prescriptions are the best for Indian problems, men who have no hesitation about making any concession on any issue: all that is needed is for the Americans to ask for them. But if their eyes were wide open in Toronto, they would have noticed that Canadas economy is now growing at an impressive 6.1 per cent, that its property market is thriving and that the countrys banks are not in any crisis. Some 400,000 Canadians lost their jobs when the global economic crisis cast its shadow over the Western hemisphere, but three-fourths of those laid off have already got their jobs back or have found gainful employment elsewhere.        
	If the same men had only looked over their shoulder without willingly suspending disbelief, as Samuel Taylor Coleridge would have put it in his uniquely poetic way, they would have seen the economic devastation which continues to haunt America, nowhere in such stark contrast with Canada as in the cities on the opposite sides of the Niagara Falls.         
	In Canada, recovery from the economic crisis is real. It may still be fragile, in part, because of the problems across the border in the US, to which Canada is deeply tied. Recovery in America, on the other hand, is largely a product of disinformation and spin. Some of that spin was exposed two days before Americas Independence Day when it could no longer be hidden that much of the recent talk about an expanding job market in the US was on account of nearly a quarter million jobs having been created only on a temporary basis for purposes of the national census, held every 10 years. The census is now over and 225,000 jobs are gone for another decade. So, when the latest employment figures were released on Friday, these showed a new statistic of 125,000 men and women who had jobs until last month, but no more.         
	In the US, bad news is routinely released on Fridays, that too often late in the afternoon, so that they get lost during the weekend when most TV channels suspend normal news programmes and many small towns do not publish newspapers. Last weekend, when the bad news from the job market came, the US labour department was doubly lucky. Since it was a long weekend on account of Independence Day, the department had bonus time until Tuesday. News about the dismal job situation was overtaken by other issues by the time Americans returned to work yesterday.        
	Besides, unemployment figures are calculated in the US much the same way that industrial productivity was computed in East Germany. Those figures created the myth that the German Democratic Republic, as the communist state was called, was the 12th most industrialized nation on earth. Similarly, in the US, the government conducts what is known as a household survey every month as part of calculating levels of unemployment. This way, if one member of a household ceases to go to the US equivalent of Indias employment exchanges looking for jobs, this person is no longer considered as unemployed. In real America, hundreds of thousands of people have stopped looking for jobs in the months since the economic crisis began only because even going to employment offices in a futile search for work involves spending money on transport and the like, money which the unemployed no longer have. Yet, when job figures in the US are calculated every month, such people are no longer considered to be unemployed.              
	Actually, Canadas banks, which are not in crisis unlike many of those in the US and Europe, offer a model for India to follow. Canadian banks are not nationalized, but they are severely regulated and have not been allowed, unlike their American counterparts, to sell unviable mortgages and then pass them on to other financial institutions under false pretences. Following the Canadian example would cut the red tape and inefficiency of Indias nationalized banks, yet they would expose Indias financial institutions to the hard reality that the US is not the example for them to follow or work with.        
	When Canada raised interest rates in June  the only one of the original G-7 states to do so since the onset of the global financial crisis  there was a sudden realization in countries like Greece and Spain, which are reeling from a financial meltdown, that Canada must be doing some things right. But, in India, despite the economist prime ministers recent exposure to Canada, there is little realization of that countrys strengths. According to the International Monetary Fund, of the G-7 economies, Canada is now predicted to be the only country in this group that will record a surplus, although it will take another five years to do so. It would be good if all those who advise the prime minister on the economy focus a little more on Canada instead of putting most of Indias eggs in the American basket.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        COME OUT CLEAN                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The manifold tragedies of India stare us in the face every waking moment. They are a result of decades of bad governance and neglect. The inability of those who administer us to adhere to the rule of law has deepened the corruption of mind, body and soul in our benighted land. The latest amongst the many mala fide acts that are ignored by the government and its law enforcing agencies are the ruthless murders of innocent people, who are in love with each other, by order from the khap panchayats  our version of the kangaroo courts. It is a shame to witness this kind of brutality in our backyard, especially since no single political entity is held responsible for these daily murders. Haryana is reeling from this shock, with representatives from the state going to the absurd extent of supporting such murders in Parliament.        
	Where are the progressive leaders of India? Why are our national leaders not condemning these crimes? India is being engulfed by all the negative traditions of a long and layered history thousands of years old. Sati, a tradition where the wife committed suicide on the pyre of her husband, was banned, but there are people in power who continue to support the practice. Under the Indian Penal Code, murder and suicide are criminal acts. Why does the law not kick in with immediate effect? Why do the judiciary, administration and political class find endless excuses for the delay of human justice?        
	From Bhopal to the khaps, India seems to be sliding rapidly into the morass that some countries to our west have sunk into. Is that where this emerging economic power is being led by rapacious and exploitative politicians whose prime and often the only interest lies in making personal good at any cost? Is this where a progressive party like the Congress, the party of Indias stalwart international leaders, would like to take the nation?                 
	Such rubbish        
	Why does no single individual at the helm of power in Delhi or in the states address the people on Doordarshan and apologize for the murder of innocent lovers, the exploitation of the poor, the creation and nurturing of the Naxalite and Maoist menace, for the failure to compensate those who were killed, and maimed in Bhopal, and much, much more? Why does the leadership not lay down a strategy for bringing about radical change and for an overhaul of the corroded mechanisms of governance?        
	We are constantly being briefed about the importance of the economic rate of growth but the same leadership has not addressed the rate of growth of corruption, murder, illegalities, perhaps because we, the fortunate ones, have not lost our own in Bhopal or at the hands of the khap panchayats. Whenever I suggest that the economic rate of growth needs to connect with the many critical issues of existing environmental laws and suchlike, I am brushed aside as a leftie! Such rubbish is responsible for the complete lack of debate and discourse on issues that confront India at this point in time.        
	Jats hold Delhi water supply to ransom as they demand some caste status or the other. These political demands have reached a point where blackmail would seem a polite threat. Successive governments  in their desperation to remain in the gaddi, to the detriment of the values and ethos of India  have perpetuated the caste system in its worst form in order to garner votes and divide Bharat forever. If division of India and the breaking of law are the two priorities of those who have been elected to govern us, then courts should revert to khaps and India should be readied for Balkanization. Let us come out clean. The syndrome of this-too-will-pass has killed contemporary India.

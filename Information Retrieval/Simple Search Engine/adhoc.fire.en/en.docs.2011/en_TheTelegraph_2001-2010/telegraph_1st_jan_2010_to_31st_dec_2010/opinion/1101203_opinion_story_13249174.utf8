	FREEDOM By Jonathan Franzen, 
  Fourth Estate, 14.99              
	The novel, Freedom, tells us about the temptations and burdens of too much liberty. This justifies the title of the latest work of Jonathan Franzen (picture). Or perhaps it does not. There is a good amount of sticky political correctness in Franzens idea of freedom and the burdens it brings. This irks the reader throughout the 562 pages of this elaborate family epic that, just like its protagonist, seems to have a style of self-depreciation with a kind of condescension in it. The assured tone of the protagonist, who is also the narrator, hardly conveys the sense of guilt that she is supposed to communicate through her admissions. It makes the reader doubt the authors own commitment to the moral codes and political ethics he tries to impose on his characters to infuse in them an overbearing remorse for having misused freedom and for not knowing how to live.        
	The self-depreciation of the author lies in creating a deliberately warped narrative which basks in its characters confusions, and ends up being befuddled itself. His narrator, Patty Berglund, writes her life story in the third person, even if she had been trying very hard to write these pages in first and second person. Much of the novel comprises her autobiography titled Mistakes Were Made, which she composed at her therapists suggestion. From being a promising athlete to a perfect wife to a doting mother and then to a know-it-all, environmentally conscious, Left-leaning neighbour  Patty no doubt has had a fulfilling life. Franzen builds his story on shattering, piece by piece, this too-good-to-be-true image of his protagonist. He does this skilfully, with a keen and sensitive eye to detail, both material and psychological. The problem is the fact that Franzen seems to be in a great hurry to highlight Pattys dark sides. He does not let Patty grow in her goodness: his scepticism is evident from the very first references he makes to her. So, when Patty comes unhinged through her autobiographic account, it is hardly a surprise. Franzen fails to make the idyll convincing; so shattering it does not have the desired impact.        
	Patty tries hard to achieve shades of grey but fails to make this greyness real. She remains particularly perceptive and intelligent as a storyteller, so much so that the reader often wonders why a person so insightful came to commit the mistakes she now regrets, and if she has changed meanwhile, how and why this transformation happened. All this remains largely unexplained and adds to the aura of confusion that surrounds Pattys story. The authors righteousness in making Patty condemn and demean herself for having made the mistakes  the principal one being that she slept with her husbands best friend  is sometimes suffocating. But Patty does not disappoint altogether. There is some sporadic spontaneity  for example, when Pattys clever self-analysis brings out the duality of her seemingly humble nature: compliments were like a beverage she was unconsciously smart enough to deny herself even one drop of, because her thirst for them was infinite. The part where she purposely sleepwalks into Richard Katzs room and gets into his bed  insisting to herself and to Richard that they are asleep and this is a dream so as to avoid facing the reality that she is cheating on her husband  is perhaps the most real moment of the novel. It is pitiful that Patty should have to be so simplistic in calling this moment a mistake later on.        
	On the other hand, Walter Berglund, Pattys saintly husband, carries in him all the political correctness the novel has to offer. He is an idealist, a conservationist and an environmental lawyer who has never smoked or drunk. In whatever Walter does, he sticks to his politics and, more forcefully, to his sense of appropriateness. So much so, that even when Walter makes a mistake by falling in love with his colleague, Lalitha, the author subtly justifies him with tender admiration. Franzen always finds a way to defend Walter, as if to create a counterpoint to Patty. Franzen suggests that Walter is trapped in his own freedom. But a closer look will reveal that he is trapped not so much in freedom as in his own rigid definitions of right and wrong. Lalitha, too, is afflicted by Walters correctness. She does not want to have children as that is her mission in the world.        
	Richard Katz, being the irresponsible and bohemian musician that he is made to be, is the most humane character in the novel. It is he who knows, more than anyone else in the story, how to live. Yet, Richard becomes an error for Patty and a betrayer for Walter. He tenders a convoluted apology in the form of a music album dedicated to Walter, and exits unceremoniously, again displaying the authors tendency to draw simplistic conclusions.        
	Franzen deserves credit for the backgrounds he draws up for his characters. His perceptions on politics and society, their evolution and the accompanying conflicts, present certain interesting insights. It is through their histories that Franzens characters become somewhat believable. Walter and Patty Berglund, for example, inherit their idealism and their confusion from being the avant-garde of the Whole Foods generation, born at the tail end of the baby boom and ready to tell off both the past and the future generations.        
	Like the Berglunds, who are super-guilty sort of liberals who needed to forgive everybody so their own good fortune could be forgiven, Franzens Freedom seems too apologetic at times for the intelligence that gleams through an otherwise weak storyline. But his condescension is apparent in his repetitive references to War and Peace  an all too obvious effort to make the reader draw the comparison. Fiction, after all, involves a fair amount of pretension, but we all have to work really hard on pretending.

	Expectations are always high when a brand new gallery opens. When the Harrington Street Arts Centre was inaugurated recently, ones expectations ran even higher as the huge space in a gracious old apartment block had been transformed with impeccable taste for re-use as a gallery. Did the first show with a rather arty title, Essential, Eclectic Ephemeral (Jan 11-31) (the only thing ephemeral about it was the excellent installation conceptualized by Samir Roy and executed by the students of Akshar school) rise to our expectations? I would say yes, although some points can be raised about details.        
	This exhibition had on display some remarkable works by Jogen Chowdhury in which he used black ink on paper once again. And these were not the kind of Chowdhurys work that can be seen all the time in galleries. As a matter of fact, the power of the rhythmic lines, the great sense of graphic design and the contemporaneity of these paper works were in startling contrast to some paintings of fruit by the same artist in another gallery close by. They did not look like they were the handiwork of the same man.        
	One of Chowdhurys greatest contributions to the art of our times is that he had breathed new life into the Kalighat pat tradition, and unleashed the power of the sure and unfaltering line in his alpana-like ornamental creepers and the series on the victims of torture. In this new series on the story of Bakasura, the demon in the form of a heron that Bhima had destroyed, Chowdhury depicted the giant waterfowl in its death throes transformed into a fluid network of lines in the great patachitra tradition. Only here, the lines stand on their own without any trace of colour.        
	The most striking image was that of the frozen claws of the avian demon clinched in pain, perhaps before rigor mortis had set in (picture). The craggy lines became a metaphor of agony just as the gaping wounds in his Gujarat series became symbols of the artists horror at mindless violence. The Bakasura series was symbolic of man burdened by mortality. Even the fearsome demon with its tongue sticking out, serrated beak opened wide as he gave up the ghost, could not escape it. Yet, these works had a jarring note. Nothing to do with the works really, but their ornate, gold frames. These were inexcusably naff.        
	The works of two participants, however high their technical quality may have been, were quite as anticipated. The blue gold patina on Laxma Gouds heavily ornamented bronze beauties was exquisite. But these female forms based on folk art have been seen earlier in terracotta, a medium which makes them look more earthy.        
	The second artist was Prabhakar Mahadeo Kolte. His compositions exude peace, tranquillity and harmony but perhaps gallerists show too much of this. Too much of a good thing, too, can grate occasionally. Ganesh Halois two works were also quite routine.        
	Himmat Shah clearly had Cubism in mind when he worked on his four bronze heads. Several points of view collapsing into one another and African mask-inspired outlines point to modernist experiments. These are artists proof and were cast at the Bronze Age Foundry in the UK. These pieces have the rigour and poise of classical sculpture and the warm shades of brown, grey and gold add to that impression. It makes one wonder how long modern has ceased to be avant-garde!        
	Krishen Khannas works dating back to 1978 have become classics in their own right, but two works of Paritosh Sen, to whom the exhibition was dedicated, quivered with tension as the knife gleamed and teeth were clenched. Pandu Rangiah Daroz had deviated from sculpture and ceramics to create a highly textured porcelain topography with ridged surfaces, seemingly-primitive mounds, and what looked like artefacts from antiquity, some embossed with letters from the Devanagari script. It looked like the bleached remains of a lost civilization, its mystery enhanced by the dim, aqueous lighting.        
	Sheer talent had turned two senior artists, unknown in this part of India, into the centre of attraction of this exhibition. The soft-spoken Vasant Wankhede from Mumbai and the flamboyant Antonio ECosta from Goa were studies in contrast, and their works reflected their personalities. Wankhedes collages with fabric, which have to be completed in a matter of hours, were precisely thought out. He got each stroke of colour and crinkle just right without a trace of rigidity. ECosta was clearly in favour of improvization, his shades warm though not loud.

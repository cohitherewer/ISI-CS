	What on earth ever persuaded the Mediterranean members of the European Union to join the euro? The single European currency is currently used by 16 of the 27 EU countries, but all the others, except Denmark and the United Kingdom, have expressed their intention to join, and most of them have specific target dates for doing it. Yet the euro nearly came undone this month, and it is still in serious danger for the long term.        
	The EU agreed on a 110 billion euro bailout for Greece two weeks ago, but it waited too long: by then, suspicious market traders were targeting the Spanish and Portuguese economies as well. So EU ministers came up with a 720-billion euro package of loans and guarantees that will be available to any EU country that needs it in order to quell the speculation.        
	Even then, it took two calls from President Barack Obama to persuade them to act together and stop a crisis of confidence that threatened to cause a panic in the markets as big as the collapse of the Lehman Brothers bank. The very belated EU response didnt solve the underlying problem. Its been 11 years since the euro replaced the francs, marks, drachmas and pesetas of the original 12 members of the eurozone, and the current world financial crisis was its first major test. It very nearly flunked it, for two reasons. One was the unmanageable debts of countries like Greece that should never have joined in the first place. The other was the sheer lack of political institutions strong enough to protect the currency in a crisis.        
	The history of previous attempts to create a common currency argues that political union must precede monetary union, because only a strong central authority can make the decisions that are needed to defend a currency in times of crisis. The crises always come, sooner or later: wars, revolutions, depressions, oil embargoes and other unpredictable but inevitable upheavals.                
	Common woes        
	Its easy to understand why Spain, Portugal and Greece wanted to join the euro. They had only escaped from quite nasty dictatorships in the 1970s, and being part of a common European currency was one of the ways they could reassure themselves that all that was behind them now. Italys motives for joining were less obvious, but mostly had to do with its perennial desire to see itself as one of the great powers of western Europe.        
	The problem was that in no case were they economically fit to join. The way these countries traditionally dealt with their productivity deficit was to slowly but steadily devalue their currencies, thus keeping the prices of what they exported competitive. Once they were locked into the euro,they could no longer do that. It took time for the damage to show, but its certainly visible now. Unemployment in Spain is 20 per cent. In Italy, 26 per cent of the 16-24 age group are out of work; in Greece its 25 per cent.        
	The EU bailout solves the immediate financial crisis, but it does not solve the problems of the Mediterranean countries. They have huge debts, and there is no way their economies can grow out of the difficulties so long as membership in the euro cripples their competitiveness. A substantial devaluation of the euro itself, combined with serious efforts in Spain, Italy and Portugal to improve productivity, might enable them to stay in the single European currency and still regain domestic prosperity, but for Greece it is almost certainly too late.        
	For too long governments in Athens lived beyond their means, and covered up the real gravity of the countrys financial situation by cooking the books. The present government cannot deal with the accumulated debts if it stays the euro. It will have to withdraw from the single currency and default on its debts within two years.

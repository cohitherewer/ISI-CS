	There are some political alliances that have fragility written on them. The shotgun marriage between Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh was one of those. Mr Singh is a maverick politician. He rose from the alleyways of Burrabazar in Calcutta to be one of the principal figures in New Delhis corridors of power. It used to be said that he could be the maker and unmaker of governments. He was certainly often critical in the sealing of deals. From simple beginnings he made himself a man of wealth with a wide network of connections and with his fingers in many pies. Even his critics and enemies  and they are innumerable  could not deny that Mr Singh was a go-getter. His political career was built upon his network; it was definitely not on the basis of mass political support that had been built through years of work at the grassroots level. He was bound to be a misfit in any political outfit, even in the Samajwadi Party led by Mr Yadav. The latters success was derived on a support base, which is now a little dwindling. Mr Yadav, at the peak of his power and influence, was a force to reckon with in the mass politics and elections in Uttar Pradesh. Mr Singh, on the other hand, was often perceived, within the SP, and without, as the fixer who hogged the limelight. Mr Singh was larger than life and this provided his enemies with ammunition to bring him down.        
	His resignation from all party posts  it will never be known if he was edged out or he quit voluntarily  highlights another important facet of Indian political life. Figures like Mr Singh, without any background of political work among the people, and therefore with no mass base, have flitted across the Indian political firmament. But those with the staying power are all persons who have earned their laurels the hard way and thereby won for themselves the respect and the trust of the electorate. The people in their wisdom always choose the party worker over the party fixer. This is Mr Yadavs strength over Mr Singh. This is not to extol Mr Yadav and to villify Mr Singh. It is only to point to a vital difference in their political careers. This difference indicates why the alliance between the two would inevitably be fragile. On Mr Singh fell the mantle of a Johnny-come-lately who had become too big for his boots. Such a perception was harsh, but it came with the roles that he played.

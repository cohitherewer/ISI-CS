	Voters right                  
	Sir  Amitabh Bachchans sudden decision to shower praise on the Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, is surprising and shameful (Bachchan crowns Modi shahenshah, Jan 8). It is not fitting for a national icon like Bachchan to praise a controversial leader, who has been accused of orchestrating a pogrom against Muslims in Gujarat. Bachchans films have not been doing very well of late. This does not mean that the superstar should stoop so low as to get tax concessions for his latest film, Paa, in Gujarat. By courting Modi for financial benefits, Bachchan could lose fans across the nation.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The media never tire of lashing out at Narendra Modi (An undeserving loser, Jan 8). They are obsessed with projecting Modi as a political pariah, although he has won successive polls with thumping majorities. The positive effects of Modis administration are evident. No other state in the country can match Gujarat in terms of growth rate, efficiency, transparency and agricultural developments. All these measures should not be constantly undermined by harping on the Godhra riots. The people of Gujarat have chosen to bury the past and move forward towards development and prosperity.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta                    
	Sir  Swapan Dasgupta states in his article that, Compulsory voting puts all citizens, regardless of class, gender, caste and religion, on an equal footing. Modi will be accorded a place in history if the Constitution were to be amended to implement the legislation passed by the Gujarat assembly for the whole of India. Modi has demonstrated a scientific temper by acknowledging that inclusion in a democracy entails the right of every citizen to express his or her opinion.          
	Compulsory voting does not imply coercion. Citizens should not forego their right to universal franchise. However, this democratic right should be balanced by constitutional liability. Eligible voters should cooperate with the State and participate in elections voluntarily. Todays cutting-edge technology can also be employed to make it possible for the sick and the infirm to cast their vote with ease.          
	But what Modi needs to put in place first is a system of delivery for this political reform. This is not a difficult task by any means. What is required is sufficient political will. The chief minister should also ensure that Muslims in Gujarat are included in the commercial and cultural fabric. This will help him correct his past mistakes. Only then will his must-vote bill be accepted by the other states in the Indian Union.          
	Yours faithfully,        R. Subhranshu,Chandernagore, Hooghly               
	Sir  Swapan Dasgupta has tried his best to ensure that the authorities pay adequate attention to the issue of compulsory voting. But while opining about this legislation, Dasgupta mentions something that is not always the case. Dasgupta states that a government formed under the existing system is elected by a majority of the minority that turns up to vote. This may not always be correct. It is rare for any candidate to get more than 50 per cent of the total votes cast. In most constituencies, it is a three or four-cornered contest and the winner does not get an absolute majority. If this loophole is addressed, it will be more effective than compulsory voting in ensuring that an elected representative gets a strong majority.           
	Introducing the condition of an absolute majority will also be less difficult than enforcing compulsory voting, which may have to be taken up gradually. In cases where no candidate receives more than 50 per cent of the votes cast, a second round of polls has to be held in order to select the winning candidate. This will mean an increase in costs, but such measures are necessary to preserve a democracy.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Biswanath Ghosh, Durgapur

                
	Sir  If voting is to be made compulsory, then there needs to be a drastic change in the current system. At present, the condemnable practice of giving candidates tickets on the basis of caste and religion persists. In my opinion, candidates should be approved by a neutral authority, which will assess their ability to follow the essential principles of service, sacrifice and patriotism, regardless of caste, creed or community.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  If you have thousands of followers that you can reach out to in an instant, it must be sorely tempting to post more and more messages on Twitter. It seems that the Union minister of state, Shashi Tharoor, has fallen prey to such a temptation. Since the cattle class controversy  in which Tharoor is said to have described travellers of the economy class in an inelegant manner  the number of Tharoors followers increased manifold.          
	Tharoor is well aware that the media follow his tweets closely. Every single controversial comment he makes becomes national news. Tharoor knows that the best way to create this kind of controversy is to rail against the government that he is a part of.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Two devastating wars and a trail of suffering are all that George W. Bush had to show for his eight years in power. Contrast this record with that of Mr Bushs successor, Barack Obama. Having spent a little over a year in office, Mr Obama has not only delivered the major promise of his manifesto but also created a landmark. The contrast serves to hit home a relatively new idea  of a Democratic president who gets things done, even at the risk of incurring the ire of his colleagues and the disapproval of a section of the people. The healthcare bill, long championed by stalwarts like the late Edward Kennedy, finally came through on Sunday night. This historic legislation owes its passage to Mr Obamas unrelenting efforts. Although the victory, if it could be called that, might prove dear to Mr Obama, 95 per cent of his people should benefit from it. With its goal of extending care to the poorest, the bill goes on to establish Mr Obamas credentials as a principled and progressive thinker, willing to wager his popular appeal for the greater common good.        
	Yet this is not the time for Mr Obama to bask in a sense of triumph. Enraged Republicans are already going to town with their opposition to the bill, calling the loss in the House of Representatives their Waterloo. For them, the most obvious way to counter Mr Obama would be through a victory in the mid-term elections scheduled for November. With majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, the Republicans are most likely to repeal and replace the existing bill with their more moderate (some would call it elitist) version of the same. Republican attorney-generals are also challenging the constitutionality of the bill; some have flatly refused to obey the law. But it is difficult to predict which way the tide will turn for Mr Obama, given that he tries so hard to straddle the middle ground. While raising taxes, he has ensured that people are not denied healthcare because of pre-existing conditions. He has also offered a somewhat shame-faced concession to the Catholics by promising not to spend public money on abortion (except for rape and incest), and left illegal immigrants out of the bills ambit. Mr Obama, no longer a political greenhorn, is maturing into a complex tactician. He even gave up his bipartisanship for a cause dear to his heart. Short-term worries apart, this episode may bring immense gains for Mr Obama in the long run.

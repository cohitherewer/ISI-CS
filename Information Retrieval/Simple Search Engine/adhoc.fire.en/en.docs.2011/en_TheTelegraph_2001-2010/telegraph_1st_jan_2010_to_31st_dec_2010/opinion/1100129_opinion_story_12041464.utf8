	Books for the cooks                
	The Bird with Golden Wings: Stories of Wit and Magic (Puffin, 199) by Sudha Murty lives up to the promise of the title. The stories, taken from the Panchatantra, fables and folklore, are retold with verve, making the characters and settings come alive. In The Banana Tree Princess, the prince is taught the meaning of trust by his wife, in The Kind Stepmother, the wicked and covetous Badri learns that life is nothing without a little bit of kindness, while The King with Donkeys Ears retells the story of Midas, but replaces the loquacious wife with a little boy, Dinesh, who shouts his secret into a pit. What make this book really special are the beautiful illustrations by Ajanta Guhathakurta that make the stories a riot of colours.                                  
	Flash in the Pan: What to Cook, and How (Westland, Rs 250) by Tushita Patel is for those urban Indians who have been exposed to international dining experiences, but who are confident enough to flaunt their home food, and eventually their own home cooking. Patel provides recipes ranging from such exotic ones as Fresh Figs and Gorgonzola, Chocolate Fondant, to such homely ones as Gota Shedho. While belting out the recipes, Patel keeps an eye on the calorie count, and so Cheese and Spinach Pork with Red Chillies comes with a warning  its the recipe for disaster. But there are a whole lot of yummy recipes for diet watchers too, such as Aubergine in Garlic-Yogurt Sauce. Smartly presented, with useful tips, this book is a must for all those who want to startle friends and foes with continental food cooked at home.                        
	 The Beast (Tranquebar, Rs 150) by Musharraf Ali Farooqi is a translation of the Urdu original, Numberdar ka Neela, by Syed Muhammad Ashraf. This novella is about a formidable bull, Neela, who is brought up with tender care by the tyrant, Thakur Udal Singh, to wreak havoc in the lives of the villagers he lords over. The tale is an allegory of our troubled times, showing how the instruments of oppression ultimately turn back upon their creators. Witty, funny and sarcastic, Farooqis translation does justice to Ashrafs brilliant work.                        
	Taranauts: The Quest for the Shyn Emeralds (Hachette, Rs 145) by Roopa Pai is so sweet that it can give you toothache. This science fiction is a remarkable feat of imagination undoubtedly, but the plot tends to get lost in the catalogue of wonders.

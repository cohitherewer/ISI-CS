                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PHONE TAPPING                                                    
	On Monday, December 13, the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, sought to assure the nation that she and her party would not support the undermining of established institutions like the Central Bureau of Investigation and the public accounts committee. On Tuesday, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, declared that the sanctions for the tapping of phones would be given with utmost care and under well- defined rules. There was some irony in this sequence of events since it struck neither Ms Gandhi nor Mr Singh  though they work and speak in tandem on issues of national importance  that phone-tapping undermines one of the most important aspects of democracy: freedom. Eavesdropping on an individuals phone conversation is a violation of his privacy and, therefore, of his freedom. The prime ministers assurance that such violation would take place under well- defined rules is weak in the extreme. He needed to tell the people of India that their freedom is inviolate and that phone-tapping would be the exception rather than the rule. It would be an exception only when the security of the nation was at risk.        
	There is nothing in the tapes of the phone- tapping that suggests that private conversations were being listened to because there was a perceived threat to national security. There is nothing in the actions, utterances and careers of Ratan Tata, Niira Radia and others who have been mentioned in the tapes to warrant the suspicion that they were plotting to subvert the Indian republic. There is some evidence that some financial shenanigans and influence-brokering may have been involved, but these cannot be equated with a security risk. The laws of the land and other forms of investigation are adequate to punish such offences, if any offence had been committed. On the available evidence, there was no cause to sanction the tapping of phones. Instead of reassuring the nation in somewhat wishy-washy terms, the prime minister must speak  and speak sternly  to whoever authorized the tapping, even if they be very senior and respected members of his cabinet. What is more, he must tell Indian citizens that he has taken action against those who violated basic democratic rights.        
	The prime minister is actually underestimating the gross misdemeanour that has occurred. No civilized society can allow the tapping of phones and then leaking private conversations to the public. By not taking a strong and principled position against phone-tapping, the prime minister is eroding his most important assets. He is respected because of his integrity and because he is seen to epitomize liberal values. It would be a great tragedy if the system made him connive with it and he surrendered one of the fundamental principles of liberal democracy.

	Grave danger                  
	Sir  The head-on collision between the Vananchal Express and the Uttar Banga Express is the second major railway accident to take place in recent times (Sliced bogie atop bridge, July 20). It is a grim reminder of the fact that the railway system is crumbling under the pressure of an overloaded infrastructure. The consequences of this can be seen in the numerous accidents resulting in massive losses of human life, and in the frequent disruptions in the common mans most convenient means of travel. The security measures and safety standards of the Indian Railways leave much to be desired.           
	What started off in the days of the raj as a safe and affordable mode of transport has deteriorated consistently over the years. In the last few decades, successive railways ministers have introduced a large number of trains for their respective states. But they have not cared to upgrade the existing tracks or the signalling equipment, some of which are in poor shape.          
	Modernization and proper maintenance of the railway network are imperative. The need of the hour is the introduction of anti-collision devices that will detect the approach of trains from opposite directions, thus averting accidents.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Bengal train accident raises several questions. If one is to go by reports, then the two drivers manning the Uttar Banga Express grossly breached specified speed limits. The failure of the stationmasters attempts to contact them just before the disaster is no less inexplicable. I find it suspicious that two trains were allowed to run along the same track in such a contiguous manner. I also have doubts as to just how alert the two men at the helm were. Their inability to respond to the stationmasters call deepens this suspicion, as does the fact that the train was reportedly hurtling down at an alarming speed. There is just not enough manpower to manage the huge number of trains that are being introduced every day. Urgent preventive steps are needed if accidents are to be averted.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir The Sainthia train accident that claimed so many lives is tragic, to say the least. It has left in its wake some serious questions for the railway authorities to ponder. The accident could not have been caused by a signal malfunction, for the driver and the guard of the Uttar Banga Express knew full well that the train was scheduled to make a stop at Sainthia  something that did not happen. If indeed the signal had been missed, why did the guard not apply the emergency vacuum brake? In the light of these facts, the possibility of sabotage cannot be ruled out.           
	The Government Railway Police and the Railway Protection Force have allegedly made it a practice to detain night trains. This is no different from what the Maoists do. By correlating various sabotage attempts across the country, one can see that all is not well with the Indian Railways. Our railways minister and the intelligence department cannot evade responsibility for the catastrophe.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, Err too often (July 20), rightly says, Ms Banerjee has expended most of her energies getting embroiled in the political upheavals of her home state. She has betrayed the trust of the people who voted her to power. How can she be granted the privilege of being the peoples representative in this scenario?           
	In the long run, it is the driver of the Uttar Banga Express, rendered voiceless by death, who will be made the scapegoat. Human error will be held up as the reason behind the accident. The rest of us will be boarding a train every day as usual, fearing that it might just turn out to be our last journey.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhranshu Roy, Hooghly

                
	Sir  As a result of a growing economy and increasing population, passenger and freight outputs have multiplied greatly since 1950. The countrys track facilities, however, have not. This has led to repeated accidents. The massive funds required for track maintenance and signal upgrades cannot be generated by cheap train fares, which only serve the populist agenda. By accident or by design, almost every railways minister has acquired a larger-than-life public persona that is quite incongruous with their official post. This image must be replaced by that of an unrelenting professional. But perhaps that would be asking for too much, given the standard of todays politicians.                    
	Yours faithfully,

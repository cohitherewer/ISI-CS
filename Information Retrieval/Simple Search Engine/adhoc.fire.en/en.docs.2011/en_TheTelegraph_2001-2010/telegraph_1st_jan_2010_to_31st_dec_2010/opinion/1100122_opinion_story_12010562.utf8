	Its much more than a game                
	All that you cant leave behind: Why we can never do without cricket (Penguin, Rs 199) by Soumya Bhattacharya is one more of those works that are routinely churned out by writers who are interested in analyzing the importance of cricket in Indias national consciousness. In this offering, Bhattacharya employs the common strategy of peppering the narrative with personal anecdotes, socio-economic analyses and statistical inputs to explain what the game means to the fans, and its role in creating a New India. Apart from a pleasantly-written account of the most famous Indian cricketing moments and the stars, the book also argues that here in India the game has the added responsibility of serving as a secular, unifying bond to thwart the spectre of communalism. The game permeates every sphere of life in India  sport, culture, politics  and is thus a critical force that has shaped the national identity. All of this is fine, but it is a pity that Bhattacharya spends his writing skills in regurgitating facts that are now known universally.                        
	Sacred animals of India (Penguin, Rs 299) by Nanditha Krishna draws upon the wisdom of the ancient faiths to examine the rituals that led to the veneration of certain animal species in India. Each delightful chapter chooses one particular animal, and then proceeds to discuss its relevance in mythology as well as its present ecological status. Krishnas methodical research throws up interesting facts with unfailing regularity. For instance, the author points out that the deification of animals depended on their economic value and their inherent human qualities. The dog or the cow was revered for this very reason. The pantheon of species is also hierarchical, with totemic animals such as the jackal and the crocodile occupying lower positions. Significantly, in the early religious texts, the notions of wild and tame presented a continuum of sorts. The buffalo  a domesticated herbivore  was also a demon that fought the deity riding a lion. In the course of these discoveries, what is made abundantly clear is mans symbiotic relationship with animals, which had captured the imagination of early civilizations.                        
	India Yatra: Places we have never been, people we will never meet (HarperCollins, Rs 299) has been edited by Neelesh Misra and Zara Murao, and includes a foreword by Nandan Nilekani. It is a compilation of essays and photographs that make up India Yatra  an ambitious reportage project that set reporters and photographers of a national newspaper on the road to explore the complexities and confusions that India presents to those who journey to discover its mysterious soul. The stories are thus records of a myriad nation and its people, their lives and the issues that have left an indelible mark on their consciousness. But each story is also proof of how, in spite of their mind-boggling differences, the people have managed to retain a clarity of vision to survive and comment on a critical time: India hurtling on an uneven path of prosperity. It is this vision, and their unheard voices, that have been documented in this remarkable collection.                                  
	Effective editing: a practical handbook to develop good editing skills (Sterling, Rs 150) by Y.C. Halan is meant to prune the editing skills of journalists and students of media. Apart from enlisting the dos and donts of editing, Halan also provides the readers with reference points to help them remember the golden rules of snipping text so as to separate the wheat from the chaff.

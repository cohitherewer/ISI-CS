Nayar                        New future				                                                   
	Indian diplomacy is turning domestic. The sweeping passport reforms to be introduced in phases by the external affairs minister, S.M. Krishna, from February 1, have the potential of completely transforming the way Indians look at their government.        
	The changes, through which Krishna hopes to replicate what he did to Bangalore as Karnatakas reformist chief minister, will touch the lives of eight million Indians: for most of them, easy access to a passport is a means to improve their lives by going abroad on jobs, which will earn them more money. In many cases, such as information technology workers, nurses and teachers taking up jobs in the United States of America or Europe, a passport offers passage to a better standard of life as well.        
	Eight million applications is the figure representing demand for passport services that the ministry of external affairs will have to cope with in the current year. The ministry simply does not have either the infrastructure or the manpower to cope with demands from the public on this scale. A fall-out of Indias growing globalization and increasing prosperity  albeit among sections of the people  is the soaring demand for passport services. Compared to 1959, when the Central Passport Organisation was created as a small subordinate office of the MEA, its volume of work increased phenomenally by 132 times by 2007. This increase has been more rapid in recent years: since the start of this millennium, applications for passport services have seen a whopping jump of 89 per cent. Since 2005, it has seen a further rise of 32 per cent.        
	When Krishna started looking at his ministrys performance in meeting public expectations on services six months ago, one question he asked was why the increase in staffing at passport offices had not even remotely kept pace with this increase in demand for services from the public. A woeful staff shortage has led to cumulative delays in the delivery of passports at every issuing office, at every stage of public dealings  from the acceptance of applications to the making of travel documents.              
	He did not need an answer. Having run a large state government as chief minister, managed ministries and a state legislature in various capacities during the last several decades, Krishna knew how difficult it would be to obtain sanction for new government posts. But having presided over the impressive growth of Bangalore as Indias Silicon Valley  as the outside world sees it  Krishna also knew how to overcome this handicap.        
	In the mould of the multinationals which have transformed Bangalore, Krishnas thinking was that adding to the already large bureaucracy in passport offices was not the solution, although passport officers and their subordinates would have liked nothing better than to actually expand their existing empires.        
	The changes that the external affairs minister plans to put into effect from February 1, starting on a trial basis in Bangalore and in Chandigarh, have already been described in the news pages of this newspaper. To recap very briefly, the new system hopes to deliver passports to applicants within three days of receipt of police verification reports. Tatkal or expedited requests for travel documents  for which applicants shell out more money  will be delivered the same day. Passport offices will be digitally linked to nodal points in the police system in every district in the country to speed up the process of police verification.        
	Krishnas real success in reforming government in this context, though, has been beyond his own ministry. It is truly remarkable that during a phase in Indian statecraft when a life-long and consummate intelligence man like the national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan, had to give in to the security apparatus of the State and exit office, the external affairs minister was able to get the better of the system.        
	As a result of Krishnas reforms, a key change will be that the existing passport offices will become passport back-offices: each of them will print the passports they need to deliver to applicants in their jurisdiction and dispatch them. At present, printing and transportation of passports are a huge bureaucratic operation because they are made at the India Security Press in Nashik and moved under tight security, which inevitably causes big delays.         
	Occasionally, passport offices across the country and Indian missions abroad run out of passport booklets because this process takes a toll on efficiency and turns its back on systems of the 21st century which developed countries practise in similar services for their people.         
	Krishna has decided to overcome the perennial staff shortage at every passport office by outsourcing activities that do not compromise security. This was decided after a study he ordered established that the bulk of the working hours of the existing staff at passport offices was being taken up in routine physical work that can be outsourced without affecting security.        
	The external affairs minister also realized that this was the only way he could open 28 new passport seva kendras all over the country with the existing manpower. As a result of these changes, every passport office will now become a passport seva kendra.         
	This may well turn out to be a clever politicians smart public relations exercise, but at New Delhis Patiala House, the seat of the chief passport officer, officials acknowledge that regional passport offices could do well with some good public relations such as claiming to be seva kendras, literally in the service of the people, overcoming their present reputation as offices of extortion, teeming with agents, touts and fixers.        
	The seva kendras will now be responsible for chores like data entry, scanning of documents, collection of fees, digitally capturing signatures and photographs, leaving the limited number of officials to handle the actual issuing of passports, dealing with local problems and effectively implementing passport norms and policies.        
	When Krishna first proposed these changes, there were howls of protest from the same security establishment that has now proved to be Narayanans undoing. The bureaucracy  least of all the national security bureaucracy  will never willingly give up any of its awesome powers, and Krishna was told in North Blocks typical fear-mongering style from across his office in South Block that loosening the vice-like security grip over the passport system will be exploited by terrorists.        
	But Krishna had done his homework. At one inter-departmental meeting, he cited instance after instance where the existing checks in the passport system had failed to meet the requirements of counter-terrorism and national security. One such case was two years ago, when 500 blank passport booklets meant for the Indian consulate in Dubai went missing on their way from the Security Press in Nashik.               
	At first, it was feared that agents of the mafia don, Dawood Ibrahim, had managed to get hold of these booklets. But eventually, the booklets were said to have been found on a railway track on their way from Nashik to Mumbai for onward dispatch to Dubai. Krishna argued that his plans to print passports using modern technology at the premises of every issuing office would be far more secure, efficient and speedy than the existing practice.        
	Ever since P.V. Narasimha Rao set in motion the process of reforming the State, various ministries have tried to demystify the process of governance and make it more people-friendly and efficient. Partly because these efforts were ham-handed, partly because of resistance from the bureaucracy, which stands to lose from such changes, much of the government has failed in such missions. On a limited scale, the chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu, was able to change Andhra Pradesh with his e-governance, which won praise, among others, from Bill Clinton when he visited Hyderabad as US president.        
	Krishna believes what he started in Bangalore was not followed up, and that a second wave of follow-up changes that he had in store for the Karnataka capital were not implemented by successive governments in his home state. With his passport reforms, Krishna is hoping to prove once again that reforming government and creating efficiency are possible within the existing parameters of statecraft. If he succeeds, long-suffering passport applicants in this country will come to believe that a government can deliver, after all.

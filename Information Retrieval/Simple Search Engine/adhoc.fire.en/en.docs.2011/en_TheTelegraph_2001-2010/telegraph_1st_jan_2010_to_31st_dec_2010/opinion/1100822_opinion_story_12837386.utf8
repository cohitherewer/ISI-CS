	Down to earth                  
	Sir  The frontpage photograph of the black hole in the middle of the road was very interesting (Pop! A black hole in the middle of road to Writers, Aug 18). The eminent physicist and cosmologist, Stephen Hawking, is researching the black holes in space. Thanks to the excellent maintenance of the city by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, one can now see black holes right in the heart of Calcutta. If Hawking is a regular reader of The Telegraph, he would be amazed to see how his celestial subject has come down to earth.          
	Yours faithfully,        Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore
                  
	Moral debates          
	Sir  Mukul Kesavans article, Coercive assimilation (Aug 17), underlined the parochial nature of the majoritarianism celebrated by commentators on fundamentalist Islam such as Sadanand Dhume. There is, however, one problem with Kesavans contentions. Arguments per se never carry labels  they can never be called radical, liberal, right, wrong or somewhere in between (read reasonable). Accepting that Dhume and his likes are neither right nor reasonable, three questions still remain.           
	First, can the construction of a mosque near Ground Zero be conducive to the post-9/11 reconciliation process that is under way in the United States of America? Second, even if a woman from Frances poorest community is allowed to board a bus in burqa, can a terrorist not impersonate her and kill scores of civilians in the most gruesome manner? Third, while it is true that there has been a general decline in the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party in India, have Hindu extremist groups not mushroomed all over the country? And has the general mistrust of Muslims not persisted?           
	Assuming that the answers to these questions are yes, how can the willingness to break out of the straitjacket of political correctness be a bad idea? If Kesavan stands for the right kind of moral North, as opposed to Dhume, why should smoking in public places or bursting firecrackers be banned? Are all these not instances of coercive assimilation?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, Drifting apart (Aug 20), was forthright. It is feared that the proposed Cordoba House would stir up painful memories of the 9/11 mayhem. But that tragedy was perpetrated in the name of Islam by religious fundamentalists. As the editorial rightly says, raising a hue and cry over Cordoba House... only ends up reinforcing Western stereotypes of Islam.          
	The US president, Barack Obama, has spoken in favour of religious freedom in the Senate. Already burdened with the problem of joblessness that continues all over the US, and two on-going wars, Obama was brave in making his democratic credentials clear. He has done justice to the basic tenets of his nation. His attitude is in sharp contrast to that of our politicians, who are ambivalent towards identical principles enshrined in the Constitution. Had they not been concerned just with vote-bank politics, Babri Masjid would not have been demolished. We may be the worlds largest democracy but it requires leaders with sagacity and faith to give meaning to democratic institutions.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

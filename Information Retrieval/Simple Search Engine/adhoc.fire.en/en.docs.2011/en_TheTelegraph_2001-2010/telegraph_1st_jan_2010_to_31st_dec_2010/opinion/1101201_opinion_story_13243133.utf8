The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bitter bill 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BITTER BILL                                   The government has proposed a new law to regulate the legal profession. But most lawyers are fiercely opposed to it. V. Kumara Swamy explains why                                                    
	A draft bill mooted by the Union ministry of law and justice has sections of the legal community up in arms. They allege that through the proposed law  the Legal Practitioners (Regulations and maintenance of standards in professions, protecting the interest of clients and promoting the rule of law) Act, 2010  the government is really trying to impose a super regulator over existing regulatory institutions like the bar councils.        
	Some of the most controversial provisions of the draft bill include the setting up of a Legal Services Board, creating the office of an ombudsman to look into complaints against lawyers, and making it mandatory for lawyers to provide free legal services to the poor.        
	Of course, there are those who believe that the bill will help to stem the decline in the quality of service offered by lawyers in the country. But many others feel that the bill, which is inspired by the Legal Services Act 2007 of the United Kingdom, has provisions that are simply not relevant to India.        
	For instance, most legal professionals are bitterly opposed to the idea of setting up a legal services board, because, they claim, it will undermine the authority and role of the Bar Council of India and the state bar councils.        
	Currently, Indian lawyers are governed by the Advocates Act, 1961. The act lays down rules for advocates and lists the powers of the state bar councils and the Bar Council of India. The latters functions include laying down standards of professional conduct and etiquette for advocates and promoting and maintaining standards of legal education.        
	The bar councils are also opposed to the move to let the government appoint key members of the proposed Legal Services Board in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the chairman of the Bar Council of India. They point out that these government-appointed nominees would seriously subvert their independence.        
	The Legal Services Board is definitely like a super regulator over the bar councils. Under the Advocates Act, there is a well defined role for the bar councils at the state and all India levels and there is no need to tamper with the present system. This step is meant to emasculate the legal profession, says Lalit Bhasin, Supreme Court lawyer and president, Society of Indian Law Firms, an association of top law firms in the country.        
	Section 13 of the draft bill states that the Legal Services Board would assist the bar councils in the maintenance and development of standards for advocates and education and training of the legal professionals. But Section 29 goes on to say that the directions of the Legal Services Board relating to the regulatory objectives of this act shall be the guiding principles in so far as functioning, performance and professional principles to be followed by all legal professionals. This, many point out, is in violation of the Advocates Act, which gives that power to the bar councils.        
	The legal fraternity is also opposed to the provision that empowers the Legal Services Board to censure the bar councils by means of public notices. This will result in people losing faith in the legal profession, says Bhasin.        
	The move to appoint an ombudsman to look into complaints against lawyers is yet another sticking point. According to the draft bill, the ombudsman will hear the complaint after examining the documents and witnesses from both the sides, and in case a lawyer is found guilty, he will forward his findings to the disciplinary committee of the state bar council.              
	In other words, say experts, the ombudsman does not have any disciplinary powers at all. We feel that the office of the ombudsman is superfluous. Why should a person be made to go to an ombudsman, who has no power for disciplinary action, when he could easily approach the state bar council? asks Shivprasad Swaminathan of Pre-Legislative Briefing Service (PLBS), a body run by a group of lawyers who analyse government legislations.        
	Agrees J.D. Jaibhave, chairman, Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa, Bar councils take complaints against their members very seriously and quite a few lawyers licences have been revoked for misdemeanours. So I dont know how an ombudsman will add value.        
	Again, experts point out that Section 27 of the proposed law, which stipulates that lawyers should offer their services to the poor for free, is not very clear. To be constitutionally tenable, the provision needs to specify what proportion of a lawyers work ought to be for free and the kind of work he or she ought to do for free.        
	Another section of the proposed law that is being fought tooth and nail by the legal fraternity is the power given to the Legal Services Board to encourage multi-disciplinary services for the Legal Professionals. This effectively recognises and seeks to regulate professionals like chartered accountants, company secretaries, tax consultants and others who may have specialised in some law but are not registered with the bar councils.        
	According to Bhasin, promoting non-lawyers to offer legal services would do irrepairable harm to the legal profession. The noble heritage of the legal profession is being taken away by introducing non-lawyers in the profession, he asserts.        
	But the bill has its champions too. And they point out such a law may be necessary to properly regulate the legal profession. I think one of the primary reasons for this bill is the fact that the state bar councils have been rather weak on regulation, says Prashant Reddy, research associate, National University of Juridical Sciences, Calcutta.        
	Reddy cites the example of Supreme Court lawyer R.K. Anand who was found guilty of trying to influence witnesses in a case, and was debarred by the Delhi High Court. Yet the entire bar went and boycotted the judge who passed the order. There is a feeling that the bar councils are extremely low on discipline. Similarly, in the field of legal education, they have failed miserably in laying down standards and regulating the law colleges, says Reddy.        
	However, almost all agree that the bill contains an important lacuna  that of making adequate provisions for consumer protection. V. Niranjan of PLBS, for instance, says that the bill should declare that services offered by legal professionals should fall under the definition of service under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The omission of this provision is inexplicable given that one of the objectives of the bill is to protect consumers, says Niranjan.        
	Those in favour of the law say that though the government is on the right track, it should take everybody on board. An overarching regulator is definitely the need of the hour, but an overlap of powers only ensures a turf war, says Reddy.

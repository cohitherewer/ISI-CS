	I make this comparison only on the clear understanding that I am not referring to any specific mother-in-law of mine, past or present. That said, I must admit that the British governments creation of the worlds largest marine reserve around the Chagos Islands incites in me the same conflict of emotions that I would feel if I saw my mother-in-law drive off a cliff in my new car.        
	On the one hand, the creation of a 545,000-sq-km protection zone around the worlds largest living coral structure, the Great Chagos Bank, is a good thing. It is one of the worlds richest ecosystems, with 220 coral species and more than 1,000 species of reef fish. On the other hand, the British governments motives are deeply suspect. It has spent the last decade erecting legal obstacles to the return of the original inhabitants of the islands, the Chagossians, whom it expelled from their homes 40 years ago in order to provide the United States of America with a secure base in the middle of the Indian Ocean.        
	The British foreign office insists that theyre trying to save the fish. But since the Chagossians appeal to the European Court of Human Rights will be decided in the next couple of months and they are likely to win it, the foreign office would be digging another line of defence against the return of the Chagossians at this point.        
	The 2,500 people of the Chagos Islands were evicted from their homes in 1967-71 so that the US air force could have a strategic base on the main island, Diego Garcia, that was unencumbered by any inconvenient natives. Most of the inhabitants were dumped without resources 1,900 km away in Mauritius, which maintains a claim on the Chagos Islands. In exile, some of the Chagossians got an education, understood what had been done to them, and started demanding to be allowed back. In 2000, a British court declared that the expulsion had been unlawful and ordered the British government to let the islanders go home. But then 9/11 came along and made Diego Garcia an important US base again.                
	Strong bond        
	The US still didnt want the original inhabitants back for security reasons, and the foreign office always tries to keep the Americans happy. So the British government issued an order in council in 2004 to block the islanders return on security grounds. The foreign office has fought for a decade to deny the islanders their rights because the US doesnt want any natives cluttering up the archipelago. But it cannot control the European Court of Human Rights, so how can it go on doing what Washington wants when that court tells it to let the Chagossians go home?        
	They are always two steps ahead at the foreign office. Make the whole Chagos archipelago a protected marine area, and you can postpone the return of the Chagossians forever by bringing up an endless series of environmental objections to their return. William Marsden, chairman of the Chagos Conservation Trust, was positively lyrical about the PMA. Todays decision by the British government is inspirational, he said. It will protect a treasure trove of tropical, marine wildlife for posterity and create a safe haven for breeding fish stocks for the benefit of people in the region.        
	So it will, but it will also enable the British government to keep the Americans happy and the Chagossians in exile for a long time to come. The CCT has taken the lead in this initiative. Marsden is the former Director Americas and Overseas Territories at the foreign office. Its founder, Commander John Topp, was previously the British Representative  the senior British officer at what is really a US military base on Diego Garcia. Mind you, its probably just coincidence.

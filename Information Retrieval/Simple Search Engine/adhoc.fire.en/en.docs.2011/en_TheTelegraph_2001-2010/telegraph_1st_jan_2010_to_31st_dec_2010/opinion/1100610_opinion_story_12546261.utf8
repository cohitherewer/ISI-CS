	Manmohan Singhs government has slipped on oil. On Monday, it failed to take a decision on oil prices. The reason for this was remarkable: enough ministers from crucial ministries were not present to take such an important decision, which was deferred to the next meeting of the empowered group of ministers. The facts, rather than the hope, need to be highlighted. One of the ministers absent was Mamata Banerjee, the railway minister, who indicated that she was absent because she is against any hike in oil prices. Her party, the Trinamul Congress, has already taken a firm position against raising the prices of any petroleum products. Thus there is no guarantee that Ms Banerjee will show up at the next meeting of the empowered group of ministers. It should be recalled that the president of the Congress, Sonia Gandhi, has said that the government should not even think about reducing the subsidy on the kerosene sold through the public distribution system. This renders null and void the recommendations of the Kirit Parikh report that had suggested such a cut. The report recommended serious reforms in the oil sector and spelt out some of the implications of not carrying out such reforms. One such implication is that in the next 10 years the public sector units dealing with oil will be out of business because of the losses they will have to suffer on account of subsidies.        
	The usual reason cited against the raising of prices of petroleum products is the protection of the poor. Facts, however, do not support this line of reasoning. Take kerosene for example. Mr Parikhs report points out that only 1.3 per cent of rural households use kerosene for cooking. The argument that it is used for lighting should be read together with the governments efforts to introduce subsidized rural electrification for the poor. This means that the latters dependence on kerosene for lighting should lessen over time. Kerosene prices were last raised in 2002; since then, according to calculations, rural incomes have risen 60 per cent. Thus the poor should be able to bear some rise in the price of kerosene. Mr Parikh also recommended a reduction in subsidies on diesel as this would lead to a shift to railways, which is much more energy-efficient. As to raising liquefied petroleum gas prices, it can be no ones suggestion that the poor in India use LPG. Oil price is one of the holy cows of Indian politics and, like all holy cows, irrational.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        EYES IN TIME                                                The festive season is not kind to coffee-tables. Large and heavy books of large and brightly coloured photographs tend to proliferate at this time of the year. INDIA: 150 YEARS IN PHOTOGRAPHS (Roli, Rs 3,500) by S. Prasannarajan would appear to be in that burdensome genre, judging from its size, weight and gridded, multicoloured dust jacket. But ignore the introduction (the usual snake-charmer-versus-call-centre and triumph-of-democracy clichs), give the book a bit of time, look at it slowly with an open mind, and you will be entertained and enriched, and might even find yourself reflecting on history, images, points of view and the layered theatres of human life  the passion plays of democracy, as the introduction puts it. At one level, the book tells a familiar story, being a celebration, more or less, of Indias coming of age into liberalized globalization.  
	Unfortunately, the progress from the earliest raj photographers (Beato, Bourne, Oscar Mallitte) to contemporary photojournalism is also an advance towards visual predictability. So the contemporary section is the most boring  as if the natural culmination of this fascinating evolution are the Infosys headquarters, Ambanis Corporate City, the CWG stadium and the Tata Nano, none of which is remarkably photogenic. But the early work, right up to the mid-1990s, is full of goodies, though most of it is by Western photographers. Among them, Ernst Haas comes out as the founding father of Incredible India, with his colourful depictions of a now-familiar exoticism. The best surprises are Julia Margaret Camerons Ceylon portraits and Oscar Mallittes indigo workers  the latter being beautiful black-and-white photographs of the colour blue. The work of E.O. Hopp and Dario Mitidieri, together with that of Bert Hands, James Burke, Marvin Zichtner or Douglas E. Curran, are also important elements in the selection. Dont miss the Beatles with their wives and girlfriends in Rishikesh with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1968.

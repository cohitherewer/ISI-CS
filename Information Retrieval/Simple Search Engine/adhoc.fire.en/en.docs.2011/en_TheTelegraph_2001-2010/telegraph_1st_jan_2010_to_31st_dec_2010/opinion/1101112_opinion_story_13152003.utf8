	No more                   
	Sir  Siddhartha Shankar Ray, grandson of Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, died after a protracted illness on November 6 (SS Ray passes away at 90, Nov 7). It is not unusual to praise someone after his or her death, but it is difficult not to be effusive about Ray. Many criticize this Congress leader for the way he tried to suppress the Naxalite uprising with an iron hand. Yet how many of us know that the same man had arranged for the education of some of the Naxalite activists whose parents had met him in private? Besides his Naxalite strategy, there are also a few other blemishes on Rays otherwise brilliant career. These include his alleged role in crushing the Khalistan movement with supercop, K.P.S Gill, when he was the governor of Punjab in 1986. As one of the confidantes of Indira Gandhi, Ray is also credited with drafting the letter to the then president, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, to proclaim the Emergency in June 1975. But he was not responsible for the excesses committed subsequently during the Emergency, and, in fact, fell out with Indira Gandhi after her son, Sanjay, started calling the shots.          
	As the Indian ambassador to the United States of America, Ray not only formed the India Group in the House of Representatives, but also did much to protect and promote our countrys interests. His excellent administrative skills were evident from the way he handled the refugee problem after the Bangladesh War, when he was the chief minister of West Bengal. His tenure in office saw the introduction of minibuses in Calcutta, and also the beginning of the construction of the Metro Railway, with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi laying the foundation stone in 1972. Like me, many a sports-lover would remember Rays love for cricket, football, tennis and other sports. He was a rare triple blue of Calcutta University, and represented the famous institution in cricket, tennis and football. Ray served as the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal in the mid-Eighties. Current politicians-cum-sports administrators can take a leaf out of Rays book on how to manage politics and sports simultaneously. Many politicians, even Congressmen, did not agree with Rays policies, but his ideas always had a hard clarity. The country, particularly West Bengal, is in dire need of such charismatic political figures as Ray.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  With the death of the former chief minister, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, an era of dynamic leadership in West Bengal comes to an end. The Congress has lost a seasoned and experienced politician in Ray. He will always be remembered for the way he flushed out the Naxalites when he was the chief minister of West Bengal from 1972 to 1977. The political leaders of West Bengal, Jharkand, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh  the states plagued by the Maoist menace  can take a cue from Ray on how to tackle the problem. Ray was a very well-read man. But he remained accessible to everybody even when he was the head of state.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  Siddhartha Shankar Ray will be remembered as a successful barrister, an able administrator, a controversial political leader, and a ruthless suppressor of the Naxalites and the Khalisthanis. In spite of being a notable figure, Ray had never gained acceptance among members of his own party, the Congress. His advices were more ignored than observed by his party colleagues. Ray had been criticized for his role in the declaration of the Emergency. When the misdeeds committed during the Emergency came to light, Ray had tried to shrug off responsibility. But every man has strengths as well as weaknesses, and Ray was no exception. However, the Trinamul Congress is trying in vain to cash in on Rays death, which is unlikely to yield any political mileage for the party.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
U.K. Pal, Calcutta

                
	Dark passage          
	Sir  I had recently visited Barabil, on the Orissa-Jharkhand border. I took the Howrah-Barabil Janshatabdi Express while returning. By the time the train had left Jamshedpur at around 5:40 pm, darkness had descended. The stretch between Jamshedpur and Kharagpur is considered to be a high-risk zone, liable to Naxalite attacks. Trains are not allowed to pass this stretch after 7:30 pm. Now that winter has set in, by 5.30 in the evening, it is almost dark. But lights along the tracks in this zone are conspicuous by their absence. Often, when the trains stop at remote places far away from stations, as ours did, the passengers can easily become sitting ducks for the Naxalites. Instead of just stopping trains from crossing the stretch after 7.30 pm, the railways authorities should improve the existing infrastructure.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Janmejoy Gupta, Calcutta

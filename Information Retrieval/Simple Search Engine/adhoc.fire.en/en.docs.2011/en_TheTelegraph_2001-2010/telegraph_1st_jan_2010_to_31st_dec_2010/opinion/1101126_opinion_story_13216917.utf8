	As more and more Indian writers get published in Britain, they will sooner or later be confronted by the question whether royalties payable on the book published abroad are subject to both foreign tax as well as Indian tax.        
	The answer is that since there is a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Britain, on the completion of certain formalities no tax is deductible at source by Britain but such income is taxable in India in the ordinary way. But it isnt as simple as that. To avoid the withholding tax, the Indian writer has to declare himself a non-resident there. A non-resident is usually taken to be a person who has lived there for less than 183 days in continuous residence. Getting published usually takes more than six months. In fact, the lead time between submission of a typescript and signing a formal contract is close to nine months during which the writer should remain in station or be readily available for any clarification. Of course, there are exceptions, especially if the writer is a celebrity and his physical presence is not a necessary condition for publication. But for most authors, being there helps any editorial revision that may be required. The point is that the six-month residency qualification is difficult to fulfil for most authors wanting to be published abroad.        
	For books that originate here, Indian publishers have a clause in the contract which states that the author is a tax-payer in India and, therefore, no royalties should be deducted for co-published editions in Britain. But Indian-originated books are a very small percentage of co-published works; most originate in Britain and are reprinted here. There are two reasons for this. First, Indian writers prefer to have their books first published in Britain and then bought here at specially reduced prices. Second, better professional management which means better marketing and world-wide publicity that mean higher sales and royalties. Despite high rates of British taxation for non-residents, with a double taxation agreement, the net returns for an Indian author still work out to be higher than what he would get here.         
	Has DTAA helped Indian writers? For one, it has brought home the fact that there is nothing wrong for an individual residing in one country to make a taxable gain in another. For another, it has shown that a person who is obliged by domestic laws to pay tax on that gain locally and pay again in the country in which the gain was made was inherently wrong: since this was inequitable, double taxation agreements have encouraged more writers to get their works published. Any step that would help to put some more money in the pockets of those who live by writing alone is always to be welcomed.

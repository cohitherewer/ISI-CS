	New game                          
	Sir It is a myth that players think only of the glory of the country (Hockey camp boycotted, Jan 9). Hockey players have boycotted the camp for the World Cup over monetary issues. This shows that it is money that matters and not just participation in the game.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir The controversy over Hockey India is a sad reflection of the plight of the game in the country today. If players have to agitate and demand compensation for their hard work and commitment, how could one expect them to be motivated and win laurels for the nation? With the Commonwealth Games round the corner, Indias chances of winning medals in hockey, football or track events look remote.          
	Cricket has stifled the development of all the other games that our country was well-known for. It monopolizes sponsorships and financial support. Meanwhile, even the government fails to extend support and encouragement to other games. Maybe it is only a matter of time before all other sports are completely forsaken for cricket.                    
	Yours faithfully,         H.N. Ramakrishna, Bangalore                      
	Sir HIs proposal to sack the existing team and send fresh players for the approaching World Cup might have been a good decision (No end in sight to the crisis, Jan 13). The senior hockey players demands are ill-timed and their performance does not meet international standards. But Rs 25,000 per match is meagre when cricketers get well over a lakh for every one-day match.          
	Now that Sahara India has offered to pay Rs 1 crore to each player, various state governments are willing to extend financial support, and the president of the Indian Olympic Association, Suresh Kalmadi, has engaged in talks with the players, one hopes that the situation would be defused. The results of the tournament will prove whether the offered package has provided an impetus to the Indian hockey team.          
	The recent boycott indicates the vital role that sponsors, the media and the people can play in improving the standards of any sport. It should be recalled that cricket, which has the country in its thrall, is now played only in ten Test nations and a few other countries. Many countries known for excellence in sports are not even interested in cricket.
     
	Yours faithfully,         Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,Faridabad       
	Sir It is condemnable that Indian hockey players should pull down the image of sports in the country. The blame, however, should fall on HI, which has withheld payment to the players. Cricket always has the spotlight in India, despite significant achievements in hockey, badminton and Formula One, among other sports. The Board of Control for Cricket in India is one of the richest cricket boards in the world, and whopping amounts are spent on events such as the Indian Premier League. But hockey receives scant financial support.          
	The ministry of sports should break out of its apathy towards any sport outside cricket. India considers the inclusion of cricket in the Olympics but does not improve its standards in hockey, which is very much a part of the Olympics. It seems that the film, Chak De! India, was only a transient inspiration.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhirup Bhunia, Calcutta 

      
	Sir It is shocking news that the Indian hockey players were not paid, forcing them to go on strike. I feel that the media, which created a furore about the Rathore case and managed to shake the government, have not been vocal enough on this subject.          
	In the past, the Indian hockey team has won a number of gold medals in the Olympics.Currently, it is going through a bad phase. That does not mean we cannot be champions again. It is strongly recommended that the truth be reported in the media and the players start practising immediately.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Benu Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir HI must be firm in dealing with the rebellious players. The governing body should take a cue from the strong measures adopted by the controlling board of cricket in Australia after the World Series Cricket (Packer) held in the continent in 1977-78. Following the controversy after the series, the board had refused to select any of the cricketers who had played in the Packer series for the national Test side and had sent a whole new team for international matches.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

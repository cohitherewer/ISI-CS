The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Inside An Ugly Pit
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        INSIDE AN UGLY PIT                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Rahul Gandhi has stolen the show despite older, intellectually lethargic Congressmen and women having tried hard to undermine and sabotage his endeavour, work and ideology, all of which make them insecure. Even the mere whiff of a possible deviation from the kind of strangulation that has prevailed thus far makes them worried about their future. Regardless of the historical baggage, Rahul Gandhis contention is absolutely correct. The system crushes those with no connections; governments have known this to be true along with the fact that this is the major reason behind the rampant corruption that has suffocated and afflicted India and its delivery mechanisms. Not a single leader has enforced the cleansing. Prime ministers have entered office and promised to restore dignity and good practice, but have fallen victims to long-winded and convoluted political and other forces that have made them completely moribund in this critical exercise.        
	Sadly, we are at the bottom of this ugly pit. Rahul Gandhi knows that the Congress must lead from the front if it wants to be relevant in a changed and more transparent world. His contention that the corrupt must be punished should send shivers down the backs of those who have manipulated the system for personal gain. People in the government and in the party who are connected with businessmen and women who clear projects and proposals and execute them by violating existing norms and rules are put under pressure by the latter. They, in turn, deviate from the law for remuneration in cash or kind. These people are the real destroyers of ethics and morality in governance and business. The corporates who paid to get their work done are equally culpable.                 
	Clean path        
	Those in politics are responsible too. They should have ensured that rules are streamlined to make business easier. They should have put down simple, more user-friendly regulatory norms that could not be interpreted in endless ways so as to condone deviations. Such people should also be made accountable to the nation. The government has protected those who have indulged in corruption, using the rate of growth as the takia kalam. This must change.        
	I am sure that the guilty are saying that they have heard this all before and that there will be no belling of the cat that is corruption. India hopes that this sickening attitude will disappear and a new beginning made. There has to be a radical overhaul of the human machine that determines the high offices in the government and in the party. India is running out of patience and its leaders can afford to be idle at their own peril  they will lose the next election even if it appears that there is no substantial opposition. This is fertile ground for the resurrection of a resurgent Opposition.        
	However, if the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance respond with stern action against those at the top, and question their modus operandi in an unforgiving tenor, and force the hand of the government in power to begin the process of restoring dignity, probity and integrity into the system that runs the administration, they could build a huge support-base in rural and urban India. The nexus of big business and government must end.         
	Simultaneously, the guards who greedily guard the portals of the Congress, allowing no discourse, debate, new blood, dissension  nothing at all except for their own dictatorial writs  must be sent back to their respective states to work at the village level to deliver a new mandate using their experience at the helm. The youth should take over and the aged should return to their roots and take vanvaas. Some resignations need to come forth  it is the cleanest way to begin.

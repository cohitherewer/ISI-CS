The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Export ban
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        EXPORT BAN                                                    
	The general election of 2009 dealt the Opposition a blow  in terms of numbers in Parliament but even more in terms of self-regard. The failure led to a fratricidal war in the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and toppled the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party. His young successor has found it hard to enforce his authority over older leaders. Just when the Opposition seemed to be in the throes of self-destruction, though, the Congress gave it a kiss of life by stoking up inflation. Opposition parties went to town over it. Since February they have been organizing demonstrations across the country. At the end of July they backed up their words by deeds  they damaged 79 buses in Mumbai and 20 in Pune. Bus owners in Calcutta escaped the fate only by listening to the ruling partys order to stay off the roads; it did not have to demonstrate how violent it can be.         
	The BJP took it to a higher level. Its leaders drove up to the presidents house with a truck bearing ostensible signatures of 10 crore victims of inflation  just who they were, what they signed and when they signed it is not known. And after paralysing Parliament as usual with its rude and noisy protests, the Opposition permitted a debate. As usual when in a spot, the ruling party fielded the finance minister. He was pretty blas about inflation; according to him, high growth was bound to be accompanied by high inflation. That is not true of China, but then no one wants India to go the Chinese way  not even in inflation control. Pranab Mukherjee correctly identified the inflation to be demand-led. He was even prepared to lay some blame on the rural employment guarantee scheme, which has put purchasing power in the pockets of the rural poor. But he conveniently forgot to mention the role of his own government, which has run ever-rising fiscal deficits since it came to power in 2004.         
	A time has now come when the nation cannot afford its spendthrift government. The key lies in its own hands. It is sitting on close to 50 million tons of grains; if they were sold in the market, they would bring down prices immediately. They are so huge that the government does not know where to keep them; they rot in the rains. And if it does not come to its senses, things will soon get worse. There has been a sterling monsoon. It will have restored soil moisture; Punjab is likely to harvest a record wheat crop. Instead of buying it up to rot it, the government should open up exports. Russia is witnessing the worst drought in a century, and has banned exports. World wheat prices are going to reach the sky. Punjabs farmers can get rich by exporting  if only the government would permit them.

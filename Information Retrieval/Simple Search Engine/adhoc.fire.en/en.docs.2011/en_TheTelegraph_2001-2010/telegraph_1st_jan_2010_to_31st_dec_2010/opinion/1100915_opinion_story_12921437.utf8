	No one still imagines my fellow Britons to know their own history. But surely they must know their own language? They dont. And their ignorance is infecting others who use it.        
	First  its too rich to miss  the history. Last year, a Cardiff University lecturer asked his new economics students to name the British commander at Waterloo. One in six knew. Just one in nine could name any 19th-century British prime minister. Nor are the students alone. The once-grand London Times recently wrote that the House of Commons was destroyed by German bombs in 1941. Hit, yes. But destroyed? My eye. Too bad the Times didnt use its.        
	As for language, the less said the better, maybe. But was I to sit silent when I read an Indian newspapers report that a state minister has made an offer that Don Corleone may have found difficult to refuse? Sorry, my friends, but no. Godfather Corleone no doubt had political pals in New York, but not, even in fiction, in Calcutta. For may have read might have.        
	Why? The short answer is just because. A longer one starts with a look at may have. We use may to express present uncertainty about ongoing events: he may be at home. Perhaps he is, perhaps he isnt, both are possible but we arent sure which is true. Its logical to use may have for present uncertainty about past ones: he may have been at home yesterday. Possible, of course, implies as far as we know; his wife and the Almighty doubtless know the truth, but we dont.        
	Theres no possibility, however, that Don Corleone found it hard to refuse any offer from Calcutta, no uncertainty about it: as we all know, he never got one. But suppose he had: the Howrah bridge, say, in return for the Brooklyn one. If offered that deal, he indeed might have found it hard to refuse. Might have, sic. Those words imply that if A had happened, then B might have  but in fact A didnt, so B couldnt. Some sequence of events was possible, but it didnt happen, and we know it didnt. Thats where to use might have.        
	The two usages are wholly distinct. Yet you can find may have for might have all over the British media. And their error is plainly catching on elsewhere.        
	Curiously, a similar error, but the other way round, also is common: might (or, less often, might have) instead of may (or may have) in such phrases as he might be clever, but hes no genius. That is an odd but wholly acceptable way of saying although he is clever, nonetheless.... Acceptable, that is, provided you use may, not might (unless, of course, youre reporting what someone said: in that case, the standard rules turn the original he may be clever, but... into the columnist wrote (eg) that he might be clever, but...).        
	Yet often  notably in sports reports  youll find phrases like Tendulkar might be a great batsman, but.... That might is flatly wrong. Dont ask me why may is OK there even when theres no uncertainty: Tendulkar is a great batsman, period, and we all know it. But English is often odd. And things may not be so certain: he may (I dont know) be clever, but (Im sure) hes no genius.        
	Strangely, this error runs against the one usage where may and might are equally acceptable. He may have gone home means its possible, but you arent sure. He might have suggests greater doubt: its possible, but you suspect not. That usage makes the phrase about Tendulkar look even odder; it seems to imply real doubt about his skills, the very opposite of what the sports journalist intends. Yet might be... but is spreading from its British base, just as the erroneous may have is. They should both be stopped.        
	I dont expect that: todays error easily becomes tomorrows idiom. But why invent idioms that lead to confusion?                     THEWORDCAGE@YAHOO.CO.UK

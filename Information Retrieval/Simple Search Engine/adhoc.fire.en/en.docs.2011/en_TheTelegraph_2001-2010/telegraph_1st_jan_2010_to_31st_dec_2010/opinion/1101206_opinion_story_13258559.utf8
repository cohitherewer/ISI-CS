The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Pakistan after the deluge
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PAKISTAN AFTER THE DELUGE                          - That millions of Pakistanis are suffering has changed nothing					 					      KRISHNAN SRINIVASAN                                                      
	The millions who clung helplessly to trees and rooftops and stared pathetically at the cameras from inside refugee camps have disappeared from the headlines. It is now, only five months later, as if the greatest natural tragedy that ever struck Pakistan had never taken place. The river from which this subcontinent takes its name, which can easily be forded in the normal dry season when it reaches the Arabian Sea east of Karachi, wreaked havoc during the monsoon this year from Gilgit to the plains of Punjab and Sind. A tenth of Pakistans population of 170 million was reported to be affected directly by death, displacement, injury and loss of material possessions, and the entire population by the indirect economic, social, infrastructural and medical consequences.        
	Since India is hyphen-linked to Pakistan in everyones mind, not least among the media, military and political circles in New Delhi, it is proper to consider what might be the wider political effects of the floods on that countrys future. To rehearse the background, the elections of 2008 brought back the all-too-familiar duo of national parties, the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League, as government and opposition. An indirect election process produced a president who reneged for two years on pledges for which his assassinated wife had campaigned. The military after Pervez Musharraf beat a retreat to barracks but the newly elected politicians were only too happy to shirk responsibility and re-endow the army with full powers to conduct the politico-military strategy against a militant insurgency that had been deliberately home-grown and was belatedly adjudged a threat to the State.              
	The United States of America after Barack Obamas arrival appeared to recognize the importance of Pakistan as a nuclear-weapon country with a much larger population than Afghanistan and a huge military force whose interests differed considerably from Washingtons. The army suffered more casualties than the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces did in Afghanistan and is in no mood either to feel grateful for the big-ticket lethal stores to feed its obsession with India, or to meet American urgings to take on the Taliban or militant extremists like the Lashkar-e-Toiba. The US will come to learn to shed its wholly unrealistic expectations of how much Pakistan can contribute towards the American effort in Afghanistan and how much its investments in cash and military hardware will alter the entrenched reality of widespread anti-American sentiment.         
	The important features of the post-Musharraf period in Pakistan have been the revival of the strength and influence of the army in all walks of foreign and domestic strategy, the ineffectiveness of the civilian body politic, the weakness and inertia of local institutions, and the growing sense of futility on the part of Pakistans knowledgeable and aware circles. Given this scenario, it is hardly surprising that the Pakistani State was not up to the challenge of tackling the floods adequately. Nothing captured the insensitivity of the States response as accurately or poignantly as the images of President Asif Ali Zardari in his French chateau or addressing a rally to promote his son in the United Kingdom. Back in Islamabad, the prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, and his cabinet were neither sufficiently agitated nor active. So it was again left to the military to step into the vacuum of disaster relief, along with its irregulars, the militant groups masquerading as humanitarian organizations.        
	In the aftermath of the deluge, President Zardari has lost what little credibility he had. Having reluctantly lived up to assurances to transfer and devolve the wide-ranging powers accumulated and handed down by Musharraf, his political importance now rests solely on his role as chief spokesman for the Bhutto dynasty on which the ruling PPP so heavily depends. No alternative to a dynastic succession shows any sign of being encouraged or of emerging of its own momentum. While Nawaz Sharif, the leader of the PML, is far more popular, his record of governance when last in power lends no grounds for any optimism whatever that he has either remembered or learned anything from his previous two periods in office as prime minister.        
	The army has only strengthened its already unshakeable position at the summit of decision-making in the country. Despite the army chiefs three-year extension and dire warnings on record by top American officials of a very fragile, very volatile and very combustible country right now... we could wake up one morning and have another Zia-ul-Haq in power, a committed jihadist, the army does not seem anxious to step forward to take responsibility for the whole paraphernalia of government.        
	Since 2002, the US has provided $12.6 billion of security-related equipment and opened its arms market to Pakistan for items that could have relevance only in flattering the Pakistan armys hostile obsession with India. The allocation of $7.5 billion over five years under the Kerry-Lugar legislation was intended to address Pakistans basic civilian challenges, but the floods induced a change in plans and forced considerable diversion into direct humanitarian relief. This will enable faster disbursement than the cumbersome bureaucratic machinery would have permitted in normal times, but Washington is doomed to be disappointed if it entertains hopes that through its sponsorship of relief efforts the current widespread animosity against the US will be dissipated.         
	The terrorist organizations and their parent bodies, such as the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, will capitalize on the prestige and grassroots goodwill earned through their relief efforts in the same way that they did five years ago after the Kashmir earthquake. This will stimulate the flow of volunteers for jihad to these extremist groups from the flood-affected regions. Even if the government showed any inclination to discourage the credit flowing to such groups, counter-measures would be impossible and unpopular, especially since the militants enjoy the patronage of their main protectors and promoters, the army. The huge disparity between the lack of adequate relief in the areas most affected in the tribal belt and the greater emphasis on relief activity in the feudal-landlord plains of Punjab only highlights the distorted priorities designed to serve vested interests.               
	Much has been made of the recent resurgence of civil society and the media, but it would be rash to expect them to be the agents of any major change. Whatever Asma Jehangir, the newly elected head of the Bar Association, may claim as a forward-looking fearless agenda of checks and balances spearheaded by the Bar, no new dawn is breaking on the efforts to curb the incompetence of the political class, the extra-constitutional powers of the army, or the vice-like grip on society of the feudal and business-related political leadership and robber barons. None of the non-governmental, non-militant-related spokesmen connected with flood relief has succeeded in developing a national voice, and there is no publicly expressed opinion to challenge the relevance in Pakistan of a military policy that aspires to compete with Indias rising power domestically and internationally, when palpable distress prevails at home and when the priorities should be, after immediate relief and rehabilitation, employment for the young, education, primary health, improved water management, better managed power supply and stronger democratic institutions. The plight of those 17 million Pakistanis rendered dead, homeless and impoverished by the floods has changed nothing and seems to have been forgotten already. It is the mark of a failing State when an ill wind blows no good.

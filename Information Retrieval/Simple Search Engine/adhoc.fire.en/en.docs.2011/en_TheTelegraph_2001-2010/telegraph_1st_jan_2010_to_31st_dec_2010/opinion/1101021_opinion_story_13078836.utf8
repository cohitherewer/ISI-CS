	The French people had known it since 2007, when they elected Nicolas Sarkozy as their president, but did not quite anticipate the ham-handed way in which it would be executed. The rise of a centre-right government in the middle of an economic downturn does not augur well for the citizens of any country. For France, with its robust tradition of socialism, such a phenomenon was bound to bring on deeper troubles sooner or later. The road to disaster appears to have been paved by the high-handedness of Mr Sarkozys government. Although the pension plan has always been the French presidents flagship reform, the full repercussions of this move did not strike him until recently. For the past one week, France has been witnessing an eruption of popular discontent over Mr Sarkozys decision to raise the age of retirement from 60 to 65 and the age of full pension entitlement from 65 to 67. Millions, including a large number of teenagers, have taken to the streets and brought the country to a virtual standstill through nationwide strikes. Such developments, together with a sharp fall in his ratings, have reduced Mr Sarkozys chances of retaining office in 2012, but the president does not seem to be too worried. He has decided to stick with his reforms no matter what the cost.        
	It is hardly surprising that a neo-liberal president would try to heal wounds that have been caused by neo-liberal policies in the first place. This has been a trend in French politics until Franois Mitterrands socialist reforms in 1983. The pension reforms may have been inevitable, but Mr Sarkozy could have factored in a few provisions to make them more equitable. Working conditions are never the same for all workers. A postman at 60 may well wish to, or indeed be forced to, retire to a more sedentary life. So it is not without reason that Mr Sarkozys policy has been popularly perceived as exclusionist and elitist. Under the French system, the government distributes to the retired the money it collects from the employed. A redistributive mechanism such as this is inherently unpredictable as it is susceptible to changing demographics and the rate of unemployment. In a country like France, with no tradition of privately funded pensions, even unavoidable measures such as the pension reform must be introduced with a great deal of delicacy, which, alas, has never been Mr Sarkozys strong point.

	Wars within                  
	Sir  History seems to be repeating itself again as far as terror attacks and insurgencies on Indian soil are concerned (Mine fools scanners, blows up 8, May 9). India has been unable to eradicate the twin menaces of Maoist attacks and terror strikes completely. Each time, the attackers prove to be more agile than the defence forces. We must step up security in order to fight the Maoists and the terrorists successfully.          
	The Indian government failed to take immediate action when the problem of terrorism first surfaced in India. As a result, terror attacks have now become a constant threat to the people of this country. The casual approach of politicians towards this issue has made the country even more vulnerable. Violence in Kashmir has, for long, been a common occurrence. It is not difficult to make out that the terrorists are slowly spreading their roots to many parts of India. If the government fails to take stern action against the Maoists as well, they too will expand and strengthen their network across the country and become a scourge of the nation. Once that happens, India will continue to lose its jawans in the war against these forces. The State invests a lot on every jawan. Unless it wants this meaningless loss to continue, it should prioritize the end of the Maoist threat over everything else right now.          
	Our leaders are secure in the knowledge that India has a powerful army, navy and air force as well as a large array of modern weapons. But they should wake up to the reality. The country, at this point, faces a bigger threat from internal enemies than from those outside. Wars within ones own borders are harder to fight than an open conflict with another country. It often becomes tough for the State to ascertain the identity and location of the enemy within.          
	India is now sandwiched between Maoists on the one hand and terrorists on the other. But a strong will and correct strategy will help the country defeat the enemy forces operating inside it. India must show its enemies that it will not tolerate violence on its soil any longer.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It has been more than six months since Operation Green Hunt was launched. Yet, the home ministry does not seem to be making much progress with its goal of containing the Maoists within two or three years. The E.N. Rammohan committee, which was appointed to look into the Dantewada massacre, has reportedly raised questions about the quality of leadership in, and the existing coordination among, the state and Central forces. He stated in an interview that he does not approve of the approach adopted by the Centre to tackle the Maoist problem. He added that a military solution to a socio-economic issue is unacceptable. He also recommended an operation to set right the wrongs of 1,000 years, and recommended that the government should enforce land-sealing, enact laws to ensure that tribals get maximum benefit from forest produce and mining, eliminate intermediaries and wipe out corruption.          
	The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had admitted recently that there has been a systemic failure in giving tribals a stake in the modern economic processes. Their alienation, he stated, has taken a dangerous turn. The government should suspend hostilities towards Maoists and open a dialogue with them, as the various non-governmental organizations and intellectuals have suggested. Arjun Sengupta, an economist and a member of the Rajya Sabha, is of the opinion that Naxalism is a cry that must be heard. The much-revered social activist and writer, Mahasweta Devi too thinks that the Centre should enter into a dialogue with the Maoists. She even offered to mediate on the peoples behalf.          
	When the Maoists had offered to hold talks with the government provided it halted the offensive against them for 72 days, the home minister had refused to agree, saying the State would not accept any precondition for the talks. Rather than inventing excuses so as not to hold talks with the Maoists, the home minister should actually be exploring every possible opportunity to converse with them.          
	After the Dantewada carnage, P. Chidambaram has become even more stubborn in his approach. He has said that holding talks with the Maoists would now mean mocking the sacrifice made by the 76 jawans in Dantewada. Moreover, the government has recently issued a warning to intellectuals and civil society groups supporting the Maoists, threatening them with legal action and a 10-year jail term (Government warns Maoist friends, May 8). In response, Mahasweta Devi has dared Chidambaram to arrest her and jail her for 10 years if the Centre thought she was a Maoist.          
	Yours faithfully,

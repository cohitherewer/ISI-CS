                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GETTING IT RIGHT                                                    
	Concerns over inflation, in the government, the corporate world and among the urban public at large, may have been moderate up until now, but the latest figures  a 10.16 per cent increase in the wholesale price index in May  suggest that inflation is no longer benign. To add emphasis to that feeling, inflation for March was revised upwards from 9.9 per cent to just over 11 per cent; it can be expected that the numbers for May would be revised upwards accordingly some time later. But here is the scarier thought: policy actions may be able to do very little to rein it in. If anything, some analysts believe that past policy measures may actually be responsible for keeping inflation stubbornly high. All the factors that helped India manage the credit crisis may now be feeding the inflation beast. First, take agriculture. Here and globally, supplies have been low, across several categories, including in India. Wheat crops in Australia and oilseeds in Malaysia  to name just two instances  have impacted the food supply situation adversely. Measures to provide incentives to consumption, such as the national rural employment guarantee scheme, have been introduced when supply conditions have been under stress, raising prices in the open market. Then, the government raised its minimum support price for pulses to farmers after the sowing season which may have pushed prices up for consumers even further: the timing of that measure is questionable at the very least.        
	Next, commodity prices were affected by rupee depreciation. In May this year, when metal prices had moderated, they continued to be high in India; futures contracts that companies entered into are in dollars and for delivery beyond May. Consequently, the depreciation of the rupee and the strength of the dollar kept prices firmly higher; now metal prices in global markets are beginning to catch up, so a reduction in inflation from lower commodity prices seems difficult.        
	Then, gas prices were hiked by the government, the impact of which was most evident in the settlement of the dispute between the Ambani brothers following the Supreme Court verdict on the subject. That adds more than a little fuel to the fuel price component of the WPI, and increases input costs. The evidence strongly suggests that supply side factors have influenced inflation the most, and it is on the supply side that we must look for solutions. It would be a grave mistake to raise interest rates now (and the finance minister, to his credit, has said he is not in favour of any such increase as a reaction to inflation concerns); it would be not just wrong, but bad policy.

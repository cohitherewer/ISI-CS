	Without honour                  
	Sir  The governments efforts to deter khap panchayats from carrying out honour killings has met with unexpected opposition from within the Union cabinet (Khap pits PC against colleagues, July 9). According to the report, an honour killing is the murder of a person who is said to have brought shame on his or her family by refusing to enter into a marriage, committing adultery or by being in a relationship not approved of by the family. Such killings cannot be tolerated in a democratic country. Over the last few years, many parts of India, especially the northern states, have witnessed incidents of honour killing. These were usually ordered by local khap panchayats. It is imperative that Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code is amended to prevent such homicides.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Khap panchayats and traditionalists, who have no scruples about killing couples who marry against their clans wishes, are of a regressive and criminal mindset (Plain murder, July 9). This social malaise is compounded by the governments failure to take strong action against offenders. Instituting a group of ministers and asking state governments to furnish their responses, presumably because law and order is a state subject, dilute and delay decision on the issue.          
	As the editorial observes, the use of the word honour to qualify a killing executed by a clan gives the murder an aura of respectability. Even the State appears to be acknowledging its magic, the editorial points out. If such killings must be distinguished from other murders, the State and the media should replace the word honour with a word like clan.          
	These killings are cold-blooded, premeditated acts of murder. The murderers should be tried and sentenced accordingly. Other people involved in the decision and planning should be tried and sentenced for conspiracy to murder, no matter how many of them there may be. The whole family of the victim could be involved or the village elders or panchayat members. In this context, it might be useful to re-examine the concept of panchayats.          
	The Union home minister may have had a point in citing the example of sati to urge the need for a fresh definition of honour killings. But the editorial is also correct in stating that the IPC is nuanced enough to deal with all sorts of murder, and that the proposed clause would result in the acceptance of the notion that those accused of honour killings are somehow different from, and better than, other killers.          
	The Union minister for sports and youth, M.S. Gill, voiced apprehensions about the fact that the proposed amendment would empower the police to take action against local leaders and panchayats if they tried to punish those accused of bringing dishonour to the clan.          
	But who are the panchayats or clan members to pass judgment and dole out punishment? The supposed offenders should only be tried under the rules laid down by the Indian Constitution and laws. Other ministers were also worried about hurting social and religious sentiments and stressed the need to be sensitive to folk culture. If such sentiments and culture endorse murder, then they cannot be accepted anymore. Modern India has no place for them.          
	Yours faithfully,

	A suitable man          
	Sir  Mukul Kesavans article, Howards end (July 6), highlights Australias eagerness to rule the world of cricket. When it became clear that his candidature to the post of president of the International Cricket Council would be opposed, John Howard allegedly tried to buy the support of the Zimbabwe Cricket Board. Yet, while still the prime minister of Australia, Howard had sanctioned travel bans on people from Zimbabwe, including members of the countrys cricket board. Howard is also known to have dismissed the star Sri Lankan bowler, Muttiah Muralitharan, as a chucker.          
	All fans want to see the world of cricket governed by someone who loves the game and is efficient. But Howard seems anxious only to assert the supremacy of Australian cricket. Under him, cricket in Asia would have suffered greatly. Thankfully, Asian and African countries have taken a stand on the matter and ousted his candidature. Having conducted an event like the Indian Premier League, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has gained in stature. Sharad Pawar, a former BCCI chief, has also been a minister in the Indian government for years. He is well-suited for the post of ICC president.          
	Yours faithfully,

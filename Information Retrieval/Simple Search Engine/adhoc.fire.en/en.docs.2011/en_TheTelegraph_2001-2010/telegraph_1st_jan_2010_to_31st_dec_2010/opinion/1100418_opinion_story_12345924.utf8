TELLING TALES

	What is it that makes an artist? For a long time, like everyone else, I thought it was a particular gift or ability  and I still believe that ability is a prerequisite. I speak of ability because there are certain activities that seem to require none. Writing is a case in point: there are lots of people who think that knowing a language is enough reason to begin a career as a writer. Acting is another; many of us secretly feel that if we were a bit better-looking and less shy, we might well have been actors. Politics, especially; almost anyone, if theyre venal enough, and have the right connections, can be a politician. Art, music, sports, mathematics  these, however, are different. You are singled out, either by the kind of physique or brain you have, or by a peculiar, inexplicable aptitude.        
	Of course, much of 20th-century avant-garde artistic practice is meant to put that very practice into question; to  whether it always intends to or not  provoke the irate viewer into commenting: Even I could do that! Crucially, this category of viewer didnt then go on to do that, as that would have been a waste of time; this viewer comprised the market for the prints of the Old Masters, and contemporary landscape painting. This viewer believed, as we all do in secret, that the vocation of art is hard-earned and hard-won.        
	A few years ago, I began to entertain fantasies of becoming an artist. These were noticeably different from the fantasies Id had, since I was a boy, of being a writer. Naipaul speaks about how, for him, the mysterious urge to be a writer preceded, powerfully, having anything to actually write about. He speaks about it almost as a necessary component of the writers psychology  the attractions of the role, which are then set aside, temporarily, when the writer, at long last, discovers their subject-matter. At least as difficult as the education in technique is for the artist and musician is (Naipaul appears to suggest) the discovery of subject-matter for the writer  as difficult, but more unpredictable, unforeseeable, and enforcing a radical break. To move from wanting to be a writer to addressing your subject-matter is to also experience, suddenly, a new awkwardness and fraudulence  Naipaul mentions how he lacked the confidence to put writer under occupation in his passport until hed published his sixth novel. All these elements in the trajectory have resonances for me.         
	My lack of confidence in declaring myself an artist has a more straightforward reason: I am not one. And if Ive been daydreaming about artistic practice, its for very different reasons from those pertaining to the writer-manqu. Being an artist never held any particular glamour or promise for me, as, at various stages in my life, being an army commander, a chauffeur, a singer-songwriter, a film-maker, or a poet all did. Either the stamp of authority or that of sexual desirability (or both) confers to the dream role its magic; why the artist wasnt one of these multiple assignations Ive no idea. It may have been that I suspected that, while I might make an astute commander or a respectable chauffeur, I had simply no talent for art.        
	In the last three or four years, though, Ive begun, infrequently, to be visited by ideas for artistic projects and exhibitions. Are ideas, in themselves, any good?  moreover, are they good ideas, and what does one do with them? We all know what happened when Degas, who occasionally wrote verse, but found the writing laborious, told his friend Mallarm: I have so many ideas for poems, but find it hell writing one. Mallarm remarked witheringly: You dont write poems with ideas, Degas, but with words. Could an artist turn to me with a similar reprimand: you dont make art with ideas, but with paint? It doesnt seem clear, any more, what an artist works with. While poets and novelists continue to use words, its plausible that an artist might use words as well, or music, or other media. Ever since the impulse towards representation  even the representation of abstraction  ceased to predominate in the art world, the art-work has become a sort of essay: a completely hybrid form. Naipauls account of the writers discovery of subject-matter involved a flight from the apprentices obsession with the literary  great themes, ideas, forms  towards lived life, experience, and, significantly, locality: whether that was a lane in Trinidad, a small town in Texas, or a village called Nischindipur in Bengal. But I doubt if finding ones mtier as an artist today entails a comparable flight, from the world of themes to that of lived life.         
	Having said that, many of the art-impulses I feel have to do with the city in which I now live for most of the year, Calcutta. Though I didnt grow up here, Ive observed it since childhood  but observation and recollection, which have gone into my writings on the city, dont necessarily have much to do with the impulses Im speaking of. They probably emerge from the shock of living here, up close, the digestion, over eleven years, of that shock, and from momentary reassertions of distance. I live here anonymously, like a migrant, and these impulses, these idle flashes, are directly related to my daily movements and activities.        
	Ill provide an example. After performing (as a singer in the North Indian classical tradition) at an expatriate Bengalis house in Salt Lake, I was given, in lieu of a fee, a gift. The gift was, in its way, a progeny of the time  a lamp (a faux Tiffany lamp, my wife instructed me) with a sensor switch, so that it would light up every time you touched it. What to do with it? Usually, wed donate it to an unsuspecting but appropriate recipient, but this time I had a sort of mock-epiphany, an artistic solution that came seemingly from nowhere: Id exhibit it. The rubric would be Unusable Gifts  we had many of those, but had simply not thought of collecting them. I could enumerate two other exhibits instantly: a violently purple shawl that was a wedding gift to my wife from a relative, and something shed instantly known shed never wear; and a rather beautiful black horn from Assam, given to me on a visit to Guwahati, which made a sound if you blew on it, but which I had no real reason to blow on, and no place to display except a cursory bookshelf. The next exhibit might arrive in the next few days, or in a year, or more. Marcel Duchamp said of his readymades and found objects that you couldnt go looking for them; they couldnt be anything  you had to wait for them. The same was true of the project germinating in my head: patience, vigilance, and cunning were all essential for it to take shape.        
	Having mentioned Duchamp, I should recount a rather frivolous idea  a direct spin-off from the Frenchman, maybe a homage. As we know, Duchamps most famous readymade was a urinal, which he shifted to an exhibition space, turned upside down, and named Fountain. Here in Calcutta, the public urinals are outnumbered by public urinators, at street corners, whether or not theres cover, standing by a low bush, or a wall. At some point, the irritation I felt on my sightings melted into a theme: crucially, but unavoidably, invoking Duchamp, Indian Found Objects. But how to transport a urinator to an art gallery? The simplest solution would be a stealthy hand-held handycam (since CCTV on the streets is rare), perhaps inverting the image (though that may be stretching the parallel thin); yet it may well be intriguing to see the arc of piss shoot skyward, rather than down.              
	Ill share a last idea before returning to my other lives. It has to do with Calcuttas renowned sweet shops, most of them little more than cubbyholes that somehow withstood, fortified by an indelible soot, globalization and change. Ive often been struck by the large, framed picture that invariably hangs on the wall, a portrait in sepia of the founder-owner, whose vision of the future unfolds in his absence, as sweets are selected and rupee notes exchange hands. These figures have the air of the great men of the Bengal Renaissance (which they probably are, without so being acknowledged), the air of the extraordinary possibility of the time, of coming more or less out of nowhere and yet leaving an impress on history. In tone and texture and demeanour, theyre often like the pictures you see on the flyleaf of Bengali modern classics, of novelists, playwrights. Ive long been planning to take pictures of these pictures  from the walls (for example) of Bhim Nag, Ganguram, K.C. Das, and Balaram Mullick  till I have a whole album of these personages: then put them up in a gallery. Alas, I dont have a good camera, let alone any training in photography. However, I notice that many artists werent born artists, or even trained to be one. Jeremy Deller, whose work I much admire, confesses he was never any good at art. Increasingly, it all begins to look like a scam.                          (FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE PHILLIPS DE PURY SPECIAL CATALOGUE)

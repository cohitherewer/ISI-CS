	Past horrors                  
	Sir  What democrats hope (Sept 11), by Ramachandra Guha, was important from two perspectives. First, public memory being short, the Emergency is at the risk of being forgotten or even dismissed as a sad chapter that needs to be put behind us. The media have a major role to play in this matter. They should highlight how democracy was throttled in India during the Emergency, lest it happens again. This is all the more important because many members of todays young generation are still in the dark about the Emergency and its different aspects. Guhas article has brought to light the servility that existed among politicians, bureaucrats and journalists towards an unconstitutional and dynastic dictator. He quotes a senior journalist who used the pseudonym, Analyst, to portray life during Emergency in devastating detail. Guha also shows that four of Sanjay Gandhis supporters are still active in public life.          
	Second, Guhas article is also relevant because of the prevailing attitude in India towards dynastic rule. Unfortunately, sycophancy remains active within the Congress. This is evident from the steady rise of Rahul Gandhi, who is yet to have an enviable record in politics. Having said that, one must also admit that there is another side to the story. Indians, generally speaking, profess a sycophantic mindset. They are equally at fault, because they have clung on to a feudal mindset and shamelessly worshipped political leaders belonging to a particular family. The media, too, must share the blame for perpetuating this culture of sycophancy. How many times are words like scion used to describe Rahul Gandhi?          
	Guhas article will caution Indians against repeating the mistakes of the past in the near future. They will do well to remember that as in the past, a state of Emergency can be declared even in the present.                    
	Yours faithfully, Amit Banerjee, Calcutta            
	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas article took readers back to the dark days of the Emergency and described what had been done to raze Indias democracy to the ground. Guha exposes Sanjay Gandhis marauding raids on democratic institutions that went unnoticed by his indulgent mother, Indira Gandhi, who was the prime minister then. Democracy was thus reduced to autocracy. Guha catalogues the various invidious steps that were taken to impose Sanjays will on the entire nation. In the process, Indira and Sanjay spared none  not even the respected leaders of the Congress. Sanjay became his mothers most trusted ally and nipped all forms of dissent in the bud. His main intention was to turn India into a monarchy by securing the throne for his mother. But his ambition remained unfulfilled as he died in an air crash.          
	Sycophancy and servility continue to remain trademarks of leaders who are close to those who wield power. Guha uses his unsparing tone to identify some such leaders. Some of the bureaucrats who rendered yeoman service during the Emergency have also been rewarded with plum postings. Guha must be thanked for unfolding the bleak pages of history. He has correctly suggested that Indian democrats live in the hope of the revival of a truly nationalistic spirit among those ruling the country. This will only be possible if the legacy of anti-democratic means is buried forever.          
	Yours faithfully, P.B. Saha, Calcutta            
	Sir  Ramachandra Guha should be congratulated for drawing an accurate picture of Sanjay Gandhi and of his role during the 1970s. Sanjay thought that the laid-back attitude of the government was responsible for the erosion of the Congresss support base. But the manner in which he went about changing things to build a modern India is certainly debatable. However, if the government implemented some of his policies, Indias economy would not have been in such a bad shape. But it is a matter of great shame that the Emergency was imposed by violating constitutional provisions. Corrupt officials used Sanjays name to occupy important posts and squandered public money. Indira Gandhi felt the debilitating impact of the Emergency when it was too late, and, in the end, Sanjays dream lay in ruin.                    
	Yours faithfully, Jayanta Datta, Chinsurah, Hooghly            
	Sir  Three cheers to Ramachandra Guha for his provocative and revealing article. Guha exposes the true colours of the likes of Khushwant Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and Kamal Nath. But it is a pity that Guha did not reveal the identity of the Analyst. Indias democrats are searching for leaders who can stand up to the marauders of democracy. Their hopes lie with intellectuals who can keep the flag of democracy fluttering.          
	Yours faithfully,

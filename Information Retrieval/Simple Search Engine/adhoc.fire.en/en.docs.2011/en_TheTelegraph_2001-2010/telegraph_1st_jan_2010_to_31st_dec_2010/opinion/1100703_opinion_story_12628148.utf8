	Sapphire Creations latest production, Parivahitam, is as much about dynamic movement as it is about nuanced stillness. In choreographer Sudarshan Chakravortys deft manoeuvring, movement and phrases  unrestrained by grammar or preordained imperatives  combine with sheer immobility to become startling binaries in a complex and distinctive dance vocabulary. It communicates by creating its own unique symbolism.        
	Excerpts from this piece, as well as from another titled Souls in Tranzit, were presented by Sapphire Creations dance workshop at the Palladian Lounge recently. Though the extracts were short, they were not too brief to reiterate that it is as much the idiom as the thought behind a piece of choreography that make it truly contemporary. In these two productions, Sapphire has chosen to deal with concerns such as relationships, society and temporality. If Parivahitam juxtaposes a disciplined and structured past with a haphazard and unhinged present, Souls in Tranzit speculates on the nature of intimate relationships and their effect on individuals.         
	Deeply disturbing in content, both have the immediacy of impromptu dialogue. In Parivahitam, the past, with its intimidating yet comforting baggage of order and tradition, stands up against a chaotic present explored through movement patterns bordering on neurosis. The piece attempts to look at life as an image of time, with the future holding the key to meaning and happiness. Imagery from life, metaphor, humour and anecdote are used as effective embellishments for making a constructive statement without taking sides in the argument.         
	Souls in Tranzit is a more complex interaction between two individuals, their accidental coming together and equally accidental separation later on exposing the arbitrary nature, indeed the dangers, inherent in human behaviour. But in repetitive images of fall and recovery, it also highlights resilience as an inescapable truth of life. With occasional movements originating in the audience, this piece seeks to create an understanding of HIV/AIDS.        
	At once abstract and tangible, Chakravortys choreography denounces a linear narrative for an emotionally intense, edgy expression. Watching Sapphire perform is to be invited to think, as it were. The mind is teased, forced to react, urged to formulate opinions and to zero in on ones own line of argument.         
	But if modern dance has been described as thought in action, it is also about an intensely physical expression hinged on training, posture, leaps, falls, recovery, balance, floorwork, and an energetic exploration of space and time. The dancers, Paramita Saha, Dibyendu Nath, Koushik Das, Ankita Duttagupta and Nikita Bhattacharya, display commendable versatility in these areas. They take on the additional responsibilities of creating identities and playing roles, successfully connecting with the audience at an emotional level.

	It could be Shining Indias first big encounter with its tribal backyard. The United Progressive Alliance governments planned push for the uplift of the tribal people could make a big change not only to their lives but also to the countrys development story. When the Union finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, speaks of the urgency of development work in the Maoist-dominated areas across the country in order to end tribal alienation, the hint clearly is at a new approach to achieve inclusive growth. The Maoist rebellion in the tribal-majority, forested areas may have highlighted the importance of a new deal for the tribal people. The rebel threat notwithstanding, reaching the fruits of Indias new development regime to the tribal people is a task that no government can ignore for long. The tribal communities are not only among the poorest in the country, but they also number over nine crore. Mr Mukherjees honest admission about the policymakers failure to end the tribal peoples alienation only underscores the importance of making amends. His thinking is in line with what the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, had said on the issue in recent weeks.        
	However, building schools, roads and other infrastructure in tribal-majority areas can only be part of a bigger process. The big change has to take into account the question over how to make the tribal people stakeholders in Indias new growth story. The real big push can come from sincere attempts to implement the National Tribal Policy, which has been gathering dust for the past six years. The policy, first formulated by the National Democratic Alliance government in 2004, promised to give the tribal people an inalienable right to their land and ownership of forest produce. It also sought to minimize the threat of their displacement due to mining and dam-building projects. Another significant promise that the policy made was to make the tribal people part of the decision-making process over mining and other development work in their areas. This last promise is particularly significant at a time when the country has opened up the mining sector to domestic and international investors. All this signals good intentions. But then, a good policy may not mean much if politicians continue to treat the tribal people as no more than a vote bank.

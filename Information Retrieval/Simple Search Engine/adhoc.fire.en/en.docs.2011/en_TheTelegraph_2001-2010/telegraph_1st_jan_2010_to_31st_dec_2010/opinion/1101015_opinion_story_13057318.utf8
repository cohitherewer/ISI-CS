	John Stuart Mill advocated it 150 years ago, while some feminists took up the cause even earlier. And yet, the vindication of the social and economic rights of women remains an ongoing task  indeed a duty  of the civilized world. It is not surprising, therefore, that the findings of the latest Global Gender Gap Report, prepared by the World Economic Forum, reiterate a well-worn truth  that a vast majority of women in the postcolonial world live in abysmal neglect. It is no wonder that India ranks an appalling 112 in a list of 134 nations  its only consolation, if it can be called that, is that China fares even worse with regard to womens health and survival. The Scandinavian region appears to be the best place for women to live in, although some of the developed nations like France have, rather oddly, gone down the ladder. These are but amusing curiosities compared with the gruesome realities  malnutrition, illiteracy, patriarchal oppression  that are part of womens lives across the developing world.        
	The true value of the report lies not in its dire predictions, but rather in the conclusions that it draws. It establishes a correlation between gender-equal societies and economic growth. In order to empower women, both socially and financially, the State must increase its spending on education, healthcare and nutrition. A socially just model of spending leads to a steady cycle of demand and supply, which, in turn, results in holistic economic development. As the neglected half of the population becomes better qualified, a highly-skilled human resource pool is not only created but also expanded and sustained by the men and women who are part of it. Gender justice is also related to financial security within individual families as well as to overall national economic health. There is decisive evidence that gender-equitable societies are more adept at handling financial crises. In fact, with both men and women fighting hand in hand, these nations are likely to come up with stabler, and more long-term, solutions to economic troubles. Such statements may sound like truisms but they have been ratified by empirical findings, and articulated time and again by activists and economists all over the world. The WEF report reinforces these correlations and, by doing so, lets a ray of hope into the trail of despondency left behind by its findings.

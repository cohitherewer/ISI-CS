                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SAVING GREECE                                                    
	When a country doubles its gross domestic product in 10 years, the story is likely to be too good to be true. According to official statistics, Greeces GDP doubled from $126 billion in 2000 to $356 billion in 2009, driven by very high government spending. As it turns out, the previous government had falsified government accounts, misstated actual economic growth and built a mountain of debt totalling about 115 per cent of GDP (roughly $375 billion), of which about 80 per cent is foreign-owned. That propelled the European Union into its own systemic crisis, one that threatens its very foundations and the credibility of the euro as a reserve currency, besides the sustainability of Europes economy. German and French banks hold most of Greeces debt, which has been downgraded to virtually junk bond status; the largest economies in Europe have a vested interest in saving Greece, and in ensuring that their biggest banks dont fail. Some analysts say that its those banks that are being bailed out. Intense negotiations are underway on putting together a bailout package of euro 110 billion (roughly 45 per cent of GDP), of which the EU member nations will provide 80 billion, with the remaining 30 billion coming from the International Monetary Fund, over the next three years. In return, the Greek government must agree to reduce its fiscal deficit from the current 13.6 per cent to less than 3 per cent of GDP in the next four years.         
	Greece has accomplished that once, reducing its fiscal deficit by 12 per cent between 1989 and 1995 in preparation for European monetary union and the introduction of the euro as common currency across 16 countries in 1999. It may not be as easy this time around. For one thing, the bailout has to be approved by 27 parliaments; with German provincial elections due on May 9, more than 60 per cent of the population is against bailing out Greece. Other countries, like the Slovak Republic, want the bailout package to be deferred until the June 2 Greek parliamentary elections; almost all members of the current parliament oppose proposed austerity measures like a wage freeze, spending cuts of 13 per cent of GDP and higher taxes. But the country cannot afford to wait: Greece needs to roll over an euro 8.5 billion, 6 per cent, 10-year bond due on May 19. The contagion effect could slow down overall global growth, and thereby reduce consumer demand, including that for Indian exports.

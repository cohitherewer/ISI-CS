                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      LEGAL TWIST                                                                          
	The government of Indias proposed Integrated Child Protection Scheme aims to bring together existing child protection initiatives under a single, unified programme. One of its purported goals is to supplement and strengthen the established infrastructure under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000. However, my short visit to Berhampores Ananda Ashram was enough to convince me that the State has a long way to go before it successfully meets the challenges in front of the children who need its care and protection. This is not surprising, given the States laggardly response to its social responsibilities. But what startled me was the fact that even an enlightened piece of legislation such as the JJ Act can, at times, be inadequate, given the complicated situation. A frail-looking boy from Bangladesh helped me realize that it is often difficult to plug the gap between a law and its noble intent. Mohammad Tulu Sheikh is his name, and this is his story.        
	Tulu (as he is known) was not yet an adult when he and his elder brother crossed over into India illegally at Jalangis Dhanirampur. They visited a few places, including Ajmer Sharif, and were arrested by the Border Security Force on their return journey. The tout had disappeared shortly before their arrest. The BSF sent them to Raninagar police station, which transferred them to Lalbag jail. A local court then ordered them to be lodged at the Berhampore central jail. His brother, who has been living in India for a long time, was freed as he held an Indian passport. As for Tulu, he found himself in Ananda Ashram. In 2007, the Home received word to prepare for Tulus repatriation. The papers have been readied, reminders have been sent, but Tulu continues to languish in the childrens home.         
	Tulu is certainly an offender, but the factors at play here are intriguing. Given his minimal education and level of awareness, it is not difficult to believe him when he says that he didnt know that one needed valid documents to visit another country. He feels cheated by not only the tout but also his family. Considering the gravity of his offence and the associated security concerns, it is impossible for the law to take a lenient view. Yet, what is equally true is that he was a minor at the time of his offence, and hence not in a position to act knowledgeably. A related concern about the JJ Act is the lack of checks and balances to prevent boys and girls without criminal records from being clubbed as juveniles in conflict with law. Moreover, given the paucity of child protection officers in the police stations, the law should empower committed NGOs to ensure the safety of the children that they rescue till the minors are produced at the magistrates office. This would have spared the victims the trauma of a night (or a few days) at a police station. Often, because of the lack of space, rescued children and hardened criminals share the same cell. The JJ Act also makes it mandatory for care institutions to grant 30 days of annual leave to children who have a home. But it hasnt accounted for the fact that upon their return, most of the children find it difficult to re-adjust to the vagaries of State care.        
	A child welfare committee member I spoke to assured me that recommendations are regularly sent to concerned ministries to amend weaknesses, if any, in the law. But it takes a while to smooth out the creases in the legal fabric. Meanwhile, children like Tulu, who find themselves caught between two nations, continue to wait to return to the place that they call home.

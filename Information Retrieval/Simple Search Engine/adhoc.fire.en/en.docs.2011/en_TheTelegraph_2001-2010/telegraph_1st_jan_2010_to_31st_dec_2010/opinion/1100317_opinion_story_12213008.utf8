	Lessons to learn                  
	Sir  The United Progressive Alliance government is taking radical steps in the education sector, and has made a mess trying to customize the existing system. The absurd laws that the human resource development ministry keeps framing almost every day will shatter our hopes of an educated India. The recent approval of the parliamentary bill in favour of establishing foreign universities in the country may give birth to another such law (Varsity bill gets nod, March 16).          
	India was one of the first countries to introduce higher education when it established the Nalanda and Taxila universities. Even in the colonial period, three universities were set up in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. But the foreign rulers never tried to affiliate these Indian universities to those that existed in their homeland. Higher education is the culminating point of a continuous process of learning, and should necessarily be rooted in the soil of the land.           
	Learning is a fruit of human resource, and the social, cultural and spiritual heritage of a country. Foreign universities are unlikely to keep any of these in mind. The countrys education system will lose its Indianness if higher education is imported here.          
	In order to attract foreign universities, the Indian government will take recourse to gimmicks to present themselves in a favourable light to the visiting delegates. In doing so, the government may actually insult the countrys prestigious past. If foreign universities are set up here, their Indian counterparts will suffer neglect when it comes to infrastructural development, since the new faculties of the foreign universities will have to be maintained. Government-run universities will provide education at low costs, but their facilities will also be poor. If students demand better amenities, the government will simply suggest that they enrol themselves in the foreign study centres. Indian universities will become the poor mans place for higher education, while foreign institutions will automatically be reserved for children of wealthy parents.           
	The degrees offered by foreign universities will draw the attention of employers both in India and abroad. With unemployment on the rise, the merit of degree-holders from Indian universities will be devalued because of a colonial mind-set, which looks upon foreign tags as more worthy. It will become easier for western countries to attract the most intelligent minds of a third-world nation like India for their own benefit.           
	Even though the UPA government is confident of being in Parliament for the rest of its term, it should not be over-confident about the future of Indians which now appears bleak, thanks to its educational schemes.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Of late, there has been a controversy over who is eligible for the Bharat Ratna. The name of a visionary who has brought sweeping changes in the education sector comes to mind: Kapil Sibal. Finally we have somebody who is prepared to break the shackles of a system that has turned students into scoring machines. A public forum should be created through the media where people can send ideas pertaining to education that could subsequently be forwarded to Sibals ministry.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Uncertain future          
	Sir  Pakistani cricket has once again fallen prey to uncertainty. A few days ago, Shahid Afridi was accused of ball-tampering and suspended from some matches. Now the Pakistan Cricket Board has punished six members of the Pakistan team for their poor performance in Australia (Pak cricket wields broom, March 11). Such a show was indeed not expected of experienced cricketers. However, it is shocking that a whole group of them were banned. It was on the performance of these players that the Pakistan team was relying for the World Cup. Now they will have to bank on inexperienced players.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Rathin Kumar Chanda, Chinsurah, Hooghly

                
	Strange plans          
	Sir  It was exciting to hear Sam Pitrodas plans for the adoption of an electronic lifestyle in our country. Since we have uninterrupted power supply in our remote villages, literacy levels of 99.9 per cent, the best roads in the world and excellent infrastructure in our schools, it will be easy to cultivate a lifestyle like the one Pitroda suggests. But one nagging doubt remains  if we are to vote using cell phones, as per Pitrodas bright ideas, what will happen to the secret ballot?          
	Yours faithfully,

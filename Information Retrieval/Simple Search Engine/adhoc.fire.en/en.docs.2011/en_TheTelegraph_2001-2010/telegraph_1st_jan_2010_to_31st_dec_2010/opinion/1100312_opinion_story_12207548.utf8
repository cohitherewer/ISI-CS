	Saris of India: Tradition and beyond By Rta Kapur Chishti, Roli, Rs 3,500        
	One of the most appealing sidelights of Saris of India: Tradition and Beyond (general editor: Martand Singh) is the short verse appended to each of the chapters that separately discuss the history and the types of saris woven in 15 states of India. The eye of judgement/ says Vidyapati beginning the chapter on Bihar, Sees only vices not virtues/ See only to enjoy and understand. That is one of the core themes of this impressive volume, extensively researched and written by Rta Kapur Chishti (with support in each state). To travel the world of the sari, as Chishti and her team have done, is our roadmap for Bharat Darshan, a voyage of love, respect, longing and wonder.         
	The versatility and sensuousness of the sari have fascinated both wearer and viewer through the ages. Yet, its real magic lies in its everydayness, the fact that it can be adjusted to fit all activities, and can, at the same time, be the outward semblance of inner nature, both by the way it is worn as well as by the colours and designs that are chosen. Yet somehow, like the endlessly unravelling folds of Draupadis piece of fabric, the sari does not end there. It is art and skill, and sweat and often tragedy, a way of Indian life that varies from region to region, tied up with the lives and skills and daily routines of men, women and children; it is an aesthetic attitude, capturing multitudinous ways of expressing community, ethnicity, livelihood, embodying character and mood; it is also a philosophy of presenting the body, and a living memory of the past built into temples and carved in stone, hammered out in brick and moulded in plaster.         
	Much of this is conveyed in this book that has been generated by extensive travel-based research: three-and-a-half months in each of the states described in each chapter. The bulk of fieldwork took place between 1984 and 1991, although Andhra Pradesh was completed in 1997, with Chishti doing verification tours in 2002-03. The team for each state needed a year to put together the material, gathered through a hectic process of listening to groups of weavers in each district, discussing, writing, travelling from village to village, visiting factories and homes, and constant photographing. While the details of creating different kinds of saris and the histories of their evolution make up the bulk of the writing, what also emerges is the tragedy of gradually vanishing forms of skill. The growing dominance of the power loom separates the older generation of weavers from the younger, and changes in the market and the nature of demand determine methods of selection and exclusion.         
	Unexpected stories emerge through this search, as of the tale of weavers going underground for years in Goa, when the Portuguese prohibited the handloom, while the women of certain communities of fishermen and farmers refused to give up wearing their special saris. Of more immediate interest are the stories of the roles of zamindars as patrons of weavers, then the political and nationalist overtones the garment was made to bear, followed by the changed circumstances of the market, the interest or disinterest of governments and the success or failure of cooperatives. The focus on the weaving, dyeing, the choice of colour and design, the differing sizes of the piece of cloth, may be one of the reasons for the lower priority accorded to the history and transmission of design and motif. But photographs and brief discussions of temples, carvings and floral patterns do make the occasional connection.         
	One small grouse  unfair perhaps, given the wealth of information and beauty  is that the story of the sari is limited, through oral history and the documents of a hundred years, to living memory. What were the ancient origins of the unstitched garment that immersed women from all classes of such a large landmass for centuries within its folds?        
	The richness of the volume comes in large part from the excellent photographs by Renuka Kelkar, and from the diagrams. The typical designs of each state are given in annotated panels, reminiscent of galleries. A striking innovation is the detailed series of line drawings, interspersed with photographs, of the step-by-step method of draping the sari for each community or class in the different districts of every state. Left shows part of the panel for the draping method of coastal tribal agriculturalists from Maharashtra. Top is a striking example of the many traditions of wearing the sari. Centre shows a Mechh woman weaving a coarse garment for her own wear on a back-strap loom. Bottom is a Santhal woman sitting before her hut in Orissa, suggesting the designs of the saris her community likes to wear. The versatility of the sari is suggested by the picture on the right, where a woman climbs a tree in Rajasthan.

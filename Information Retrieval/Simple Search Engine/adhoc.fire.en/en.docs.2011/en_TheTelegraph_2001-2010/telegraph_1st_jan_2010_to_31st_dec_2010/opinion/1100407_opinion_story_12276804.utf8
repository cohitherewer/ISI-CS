                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NEIGHBOURLY CAUTION                          - Pakistan will remain a danger to itself, to India and to the world        Ashok Ganguly                          Secret dealings                                              
	Before 1980, no one could have anticipated the disintegration of the mighty Soviet Union. And then our generation watched the break-up of a once mighty world power which had played a leading role in world peace in the second half of the 20th century. Parts of the jigsaw of what were then the constituents of the former Soviet Union are still in the process of playing out their identity as independent states. The adage that one can expect the vagaries of a nations history but a nations geography is more static has been turned on its head frequently enough since the dawn of civilization.        
	In 1947, Pakistan was created as a new nation state by the British by breaking up parts of India at a time when the liabilities of a colonial asset had begun to outstrip its value to the colonial occupiers. There was a subdued sense of relief that Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his cohorts of the Muslim League had been seen off once and for all and that both countries could, hopefully, live as civilized neighbours once the flames of Partition had died down.        
	Although West and East Pakistan were geographically separated, the belief was that the bonds of Islam would be the raison dtre of unity and cohesion. The overwhelming victory of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his Awami League in the Pakistan general election of 1970 brought to the surface the inherent contradiction that religion could be an overarching bond ignoring the realities of language, culture and ethnicity. The rest, as the saying goes, is history.        
	Following the independence of Bangladesh, the shame of defeat and disintegration remained temporarily subdued in what remained of Pakistan.              
	Following the end of the civilian rule of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the takeover of the government by the Pakistan army under Zia-ul-Haq, the full force of the humiliation of the loss of East Pakistan exploded in the psyche of the Pakistani population. This sense of the humiliation of defeat and loss has been passed on from generation to generation and, in many ways, explains the behaviour and actions of Pakistan to this day. The only way that Pakistan feels that it can redeem itself and justify its creation in the eyes of its own people and the rest of the world is by recouping its territorial loss in one way or another.        
	This is the genesis of the evolution of the various power centres in Pakistan. These are, from time to time, the civilian elected government, the army, the Inter-Services Intelligence and what have been euphemistically called non-State actors, such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba, the Taliban, the Hizbul Mujahideen and al Qaida. The strategy of the Pakistan army was to keep the Kashmir pot boiling, to eventually have an overwhelming control over Afghanistan and to regain the ground which it had lost in 1970. In this new big game, Pakistans civil as well as military governments have skilfully used the United States of America to fund its economy and armaments: firstly, to drive out the Russians from Afghanistan with the active assistance of the Central Intelligence Agency and foreign mercenaries, and eventually to suck the US into the quagmire that was left behind by the Russians. In the process of advancing this devious ploy, Pakistans ISI, which is a surrogate of the Pakistan army, is playing a central role. It has become its own master and is now a strong force in its own right. Civilians have no authority or control over the ISI. The armys writ is also becoming limited as it provides water, rations and personnel to the ISI but, in turn, has limited control over it. The non-State actors, an original Pakistan innovation, is the brainchild of the ISI, to keep the civilian government, the army and the Americans on tenterhooks. That the army and the ISI are the main actors and the civilian government a faade has become clear now, at the time the US-Pakistan dialogue has commenced, the theme of which is: We have done enough to fight terrorism and have become a basket case in the process; so what is the US going to do to revive the economy and pride of Pakistan and restore parity with India?        
	These unholy institutions created by Pakistan, instead of advancing its grand designs to create a greater Pakistan, are gradually pushing the country towards becoming a failed state.        
	As its neighbour, India faces the greatest threat from these multinational non-State actors groups and the ISI, since they are distancing themselves from their creators and handlers and have become a rabid cancer spreading across the heart of that nation.        
	It is in this scenario that the US, desperate to get out of Afghanistan, finds itself blackmailed by Pakistan (read the army and the ISI) trying to create the mythical fifth force, the good Taliban.        
	As India has witnessed during the past few years in Kashmir, Mumbai, Pune and other places, while a civil society becomes more helpless in Pakistan, the non-State actors are slowly but surely gaining an upper hand in the bazars and cantonments of that country, spreading death and destruction across the nation almost on a daily basis.        
	The world was surprised by the revelation that Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of the Islamic bomb, was also the global peddler of the Islamic bomb. The complicity of the Pakistan army and the ISI in the A.Q. Khan episode remains a secret for the time being. In their desperation to seek a civil nuclear agreement with the US, Pakistan has recently levelled charges against A.Q. Khan, a full 10 years after the exposure.              
	A State which began by fraying at its edges is now under siege by forces of its own creation. That India, being its neighbour, experiences the brunt of the fallout has become a stark reality. It is also worth noting that Pakistan is not only a threat to India but has become a threat to the rest of the world. There are innumerable what ifs in the rapidly deteriorating situation in Pakistan. India will have to continue to protect itself from misadventures of the various forces in Pakistan which have got out of the control of the civilian and military establishments.        
	One cannot, as a civilized people, but feel a sense of sadness at the complete disarray in its neighbourhood. India will have to continue to remain engaged with Pakistan, because dangers and disagreements need to be continuously and publicly aired in order for them to remain visible and in the public domain around the capitals of the world. The latest episode, concerning the case of David Coleman Headley, who was the key player in the Mumbai and Pune attacks, fully exposes the international ramifications of Pakistan as a terrorist nation, for which the US now faces a large issue of accountability.        
	Pakistan and its different power centres will remain a large and viable danger in the foreseeable future to itself, to India and, eventually, to the rest of the world. How the scenario unfolds remains the biggest unknown and threat of our times.        
	In our efforts to reach out to the saner elements in Pakistan, we are confronted with a national insanity there, arising out of its erosion of nationhood, a purpose without which no nation can survive in sanity and good order.

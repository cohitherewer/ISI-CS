	Among the heap of messages left by the early morning suicide attacks on two guesthouses in Kabul recently, the most easily decipherable is the one pointing to Kabuls vulnerability. The capital has been, and remains, the stage where the Taliban cannot resist showing off their prowess. The success of Operation Mushtarak in Helmand, where the allied forces and the Afghan army have registered a remarkable victory against the Taliban and reinstated the local government, may have given reason to the Taliban to put up another show. Their last performance in January  with a string of suicide bombings in public places  was a direct snub to government efforts at reconciliation. The latest attack, which has killed at least 18 foreign nationals, is a similar answer to the military advance, development strategy and the high hopes that the government and its Western backers still repose in themselves. What is curious about the attacks this time is that the direction for reading the messages is being provided by the Taliban. They do not want too much to be read into the fact that at least nine of those killed were Indians. Yet there can be little doubt that the targets had been chosen with care, as also the timing of the attack, which came only days after Pakistan  a sanctuary for the top Taliban leadership  had begun re-engagement with India after a 14-month lull. Strangely, the Taliban want this message to remain inscrutable.        
	It is an open secret that the Talibans successive attacks against Indians reflect the anxiety of the Pakistan defence establishment about Indias strategic involvement in the region. There has been sufficient proof linking the Inter-Services Intelligence with the Kabul embassy bombing of 2008. Although no concrete evidence has surfaced to connect the recent attack with Pakistan, it is undeniable that forces inimical to India have been strengthened by Pakistans vocal opposition to Indias involvement in Afghanistan and the formers latest diplomatic efforts to isolate India in the region. The Kabul bombing, together with the fulminations of jihadists against India and the atrocities within Pakistan against minorities, are efforts to deepen the mistrust between India and Pakistan that almost derailed the talks in New Delhi. If Pakistan wants India to keep talking to it, it must address its misgivings about Indias role in Afghanistan.

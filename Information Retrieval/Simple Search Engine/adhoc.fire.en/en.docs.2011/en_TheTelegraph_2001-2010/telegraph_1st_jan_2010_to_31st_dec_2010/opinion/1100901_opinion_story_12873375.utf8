	The future is dry                   
	Sir  It is painful to learn about the acute problem of potable water in Cherrapunji, which, till recently, was regarded as the wettest place on earth (Water, water, not enough to drink, Aug 28). The report on Cherrapunji will surely make many people nostalgic. I was born and brought up in Shillong, and I cherish the memories of my visits to Cherrapunji. Irrespective of the season, during our trips, we would invariably be greeted by rain and cloudy skies. At that time, the greenery around Cherrapunji was equally arresting. The lush green hillocks with their clusters of pine trees and waterfalls were a feast for the eyes. On a clear day, Cherrapunji offered visitors a birds-eye view of a small tract in neighbouring Bangladesh. On account of the felling of trees as well as urbanization, Cherrapunji is no longer the wettest place on earth. That title now belongs to a nearby village called Mawsynram. It is shocking to learn that timely initiatives, such as rainwater harvesting, were not undertaken by the authorities to ensure the availability of potable water to Cherrapunjis residents. The observation that Cherrapunjis drinking water scheme is a reminder to the world not to take natural resources, however abundant they are, for granted should warn India that a mighty catastrophe might befall the country if it is unmindful of its environmental obligations.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Different era          
	Sir  Bhanu Bandyopadhyay would have celebrated his 90th birthday on August 26 had he been alive. Unfortunately, his birth anniversary went almost unnoticed this year. No special screening of his films was organized by the state cultural department, despite the fact that Bandyopadhyay was associated with Bengali films for almost 40 years. Be it in the role of an elderly man who daydreams of retrieving his youth in Asite Ashio Na or as a struggling sleuth in Bhanu Goenda Jahar Assistant, Bandyopadhyay fit every character he played like a glove. He was a masterly comedian who invariably had his audience in splits with his antics. Bandyopadhyay was equally at ease on stage and on screen. He was one of those rare artists who preferred to make a mark in a supporting role rather than play the lead. What is equally significant is that Bandyopadhyay managed to hold his own even in the company of stars such as Uttam Kumar and Soumitra Chatterjee. This only goes to show that in the past, the audience loved character actors as much as they loved glamourous stars. Nirmal Deys Nirdharita Shilpir Anupasthitite and Bikash Rays Natun Probhat were the rare occasions in which Bandyopadhyay played serious characters. My only regret is that the kind of films that Bandyopadhyay acted in have virtually disappeared from Bengal. Those were indeed the best years of Bengali cinema.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Clouded vision          
	Sir  Perception is reality. Everything now depends on how successfully a perception is created. In politics too, Mamata Banerjee and her party are trying to make use of perception. She may have learnt this art from the National Democratic Alliance that had tried to create the perception that India was shining. The Trinamul Congress has steadfastly propounded conspiracy theories which state that Banerjees life is under threat. Gurjant Singh, who was granted bail recently, was made to pay the price. Banerjees stint as the Union railways minister has witnessed several accidents, robberies and deaths. But since she has successfully created the perception of a diabolical Left conspiracy, there is a fair chance that her spell as the railways minister will be seen as a successful one. After all, there are innumerable railway projects  new stations, halts, hospitals and stadiums  to attest to that. So even though one travels in fear, one should not blame this iconic leader.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is a matter of great concern that truck drivers are not following traffic rules. The inactivity of the police has further emboldened them. Stringent action should be taken against rogue drivers. It is certain that a more serious mishap would have taken place had Gurjant Singh really intended to harm Mamata Banerjee. But a few questions need to be raised. Why did Banerjee decline the offer of a bullet-proof car? What precisely is the message that she is trying to send to the people? Is she trying to put the blame on her political rivals in case anything untoward happens?                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Inflated hopes                   
	Sir  The hope expressed by Dipankar Dasgupta in Controlling inflation (July 1)  short-term inflation will cause less pain if the poor are protected  is nothing short of a prayer. Why do we control inflation instead of targeting it? Is it because it is known that inflation is likely to be excessive in the near future? Dasgupta acknowledges the harsh realities of the market and also the fact that the poor suffer the most, be it because of war or of an unstable economy. He also points to the negative results of adjusting inflation with the nominal rate of growth. Yet, the government goes on with its single agenda without trying to take other measures to protect the poor. In fact, the government seems more serious about decontrolling the price of oil than about raising real incomes. In the six decades since Independence, the government has not come up with any sure-fire way to fight poverty. Economic advisers like Kaushik Basu may be prescribing food coupons as direct subsidy to the poor. But, as Dasgupta himself notes, the existing corruption is bound to defeat such well-meaning policy measures as well.          
	The fact remains that freeing oil prices will increase expenditure and reduce the incomes of the poor and of those in the unorganized sector. Unlike salary earners, the latter do not have a dearness allowance to tide over the crisis. The government is sure that it will not rollback the prices, but there is no assurance yet that it will try and curb corruption.           
	Economists like Dasgupta and those running the government seem to be helpless when it comes to safeguarding the interests of the poor. Dasgupta is hopeful that better resource management may improve the situation if the government takes its responsibility seriously. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the government will do this.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Dipankar Dasguptas article made it clear that Indias agricultural economy remains entirely dependent on the vagaries of nature. The finance minister and other policymakers have repeatedly said that a favourable monsoon and a good crop will help tame inflation and raise the real rate of growth. It is unfortunate that we still have not taken adequate measures to use our water resources optimally. India has ignored the benefits of rainwater harvesting, and there has not been enough investment in irrigation in the last several years. As a result, India remains dependent on natural phenomena such as the monsoons. There is no long-term strategy in place to fight droughts or floods.           
	It has to be kept in mind that inflation has persistently risen also because of the rise in the prices of non-food items. Despite a negative borrowing rate in real terms, the industry has increased the prices of durable consumer goods. The negative policy rates in real terms have enabled consumers to borrow to finance their needs. The industry, on the other hand, has enjoyed working capital finance at a favourable rate, a factor which contributed significantly to the positive trend in industrial growth.           
	There is something else that needs to be pointed out in Dasguptas piece. While analysing the logic of the Parikh-Basu line of argument  on tying up petroleum prices with world market  Dasgupta suggested that the fuel needs of the poor be subsidized. But he acknowledges the fact that identifying the poor still remains a problem. The other problem is that if there is an unprecedented rise in the prices of petroleum products in the international market, then the government will have to intervene and the subsidies in the energy sector will have to be increased. At this stage, the Parikh-Basu logic may be of no avail.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Tug of war           
	Sir  It is a pity that the firebrand socialist, George Fernandes, should now be torn between his well-wishers  his brothers and Jaya Jaitley on one side, and his wife, Leila Kabir, on the other (Time for Jayas Leila, July 1). Both parties are apparently worried about Fernandess deteriorating health. The Delhi High Court wanted Fernandes to be presented before it so that a solution could be found. It then decided that the ailing leader will continue to stay with his once-estranged wife. But how can anyone, reportedly suffering from Alzheimers, be expected to decide on his treatment and where he wants to be lodged? It seems that the quarrel is about Fernandess property, which is reported to be quite substantial. The question that will continue to bother the common man is regarding how a socialist like Fernandes could accumulate such wealth.           
	Yours faithfully,

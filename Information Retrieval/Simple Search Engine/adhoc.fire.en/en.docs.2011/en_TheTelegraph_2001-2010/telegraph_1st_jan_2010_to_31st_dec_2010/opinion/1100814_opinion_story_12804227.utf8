                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Flop show                  
	Sir  Swapan Dasguptas views on the Commonwealth Games cannot be dismissed (Delusions of wealth, Aug 6). The sole aim of the event is to herald Indias arrival on the world stage, and not to bolster its reputation as a sporting nation. The astronomical sums spent on renovating stadiums have raised questions of financial discrepancy. The dismal state of stadiums even after renovation has also exposed the lack of vigilance on the part of the organizing committee. The organizational duties should be handed over to the army to undo the damage.           
	Yours faithfully,        Chirag Mandal, Howrah 
                  
	Unsafe act          
	Sir  I would like to thank The Telegraph for publishing an interesting report on the proposed amendment to the Arms Act (Diggy takes aim at Pistol PC, Aug 9). I believe that the home ministrys proposal to make it difficult for citizens to obtain gun licences goes against the interests of the common people. The original Act recognized the common mans right to defend himself. But in its amended form, the legislation will make it virtually impossible for an ordinary citizen to get a licence for firearms. To obtain such a licence, an applicant, reportedly, has to get approval from the local thana, the circle inspector, the sub-divisional police officer as well as the district superintendent. Recommendations are also required from the sub- divisional magistrate, the district arms magistrate and even the state forest department in the case of residents living near forests.           
	As things stand today, it seems that the only people eligible for a firearm licence are politicians and their henchmen or those with fat purses. The government has not been able to contain the proliferation of illegal firearms. Neither is it in a position to provide security to the populace. The babus and the VIPs who are heavily guarded can never understand the security needs of a person residing in, say, Bihar or Jharkhand. Does the government have the data to prove that licenced firearms are misused and are a threat to public safety? And if this is true, why does it not use its powers to cancel these licences and punish the officers who recommended them?           
	Rather than think up novel ways of making it difficult for law-abiding persons to acquire a licence, the government should direct its efforts towards controlling the sale of illegal arms and giving better protection to citizens. I sincerely hope that the mandarins in the home ministry will take a look at this problem.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rajiv Dewan, Jhumri Telaiya, Jharkhand

                          
	Poisoned stream          
	Sir  The high level of pollution in Keralas backwaters and lakes is the result of ill-planned farming practices. In Kuttanad, for instance, tons of pesticide are sprayed in the fields in the name of crop protection, without anyone realizing that the long-term damages outweigh the immediate benefits. Consequently, land, air and water have been contaminated and people forced to flee to other places. It has also been reported that pesticide pollution in Vembanads backwaters is higher than the bacterial pollution caused by the lack of proper sanitation in the area.           
	A paradigm shift is, therefore, required as far as the agricultural practices in Kerala are concerned. Perhaps switching to organic farming can improve the situation. A comprehensive action plan must be charted out to ensure that organic farming practices are strictly enforced across the state.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala

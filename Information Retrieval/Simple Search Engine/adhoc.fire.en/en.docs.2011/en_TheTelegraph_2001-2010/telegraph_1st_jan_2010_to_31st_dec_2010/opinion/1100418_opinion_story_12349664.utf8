	The Bharatiya Janata Party president may be in a hurry to ring in the changes in his party, but he often runs late when it comes to keeping his own appointments. Be it foundation day, or a programme celebrating the birth anniversary of BR Ambedkar, Nitin Gadkari invariably arrives well behind schedule. But he does come prepared with perfect alibis, the most popular being he was busy attending another meeting or had been caught up in traffic on his way to the venue from the airport. The party leadership, too, seems to have fallen in line. BJP leaders have been heard clarifying that since Gadkari took over as the party president, he has been travelling all over the country. Hence, his hectic schedule has slowed him down considerably. We all know that the slow and steady win the race in the end. But they seldom win the hearts of those who are kept waiting.                            
	The media were excited about the blink-and-you-would-miss brush between the Indian prime minister and his Pakistani counterpart in Washington. This is what the official spokesperson of the ministry of external affairs had to say when he was hounded by journalists keen to know what had taken place between Singh and Gilani: I understand that at the reception, Prime Minister Gilani and Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh shook hands with each other and exchanged pleasantries. But the newshounds were far from pleased, and they wanted to know more. Consequently, questions continued to fly in the spokespersons direction: how long had it lasted? Where had it taken place? Did the two meet in the main area or in the corridor? The official managed to keep his cool despite the continuous barrage. It was at the reception that President Obama had hosted, he answered, and added that the pleasantries lasted the usual time that such exchanges normally do. The terse reply, combined with the absence of a meaty story, silenced the scribes at last.                        
	 The fatal incident at Dantewada has brought under scanner the Union governments policy of doling out gubernatorial positions in Maoist-hit states to bureaucrats and intelligence officials. Some members of the Congress have been saying that ESL Narsimhan, who was a member of Indias intelligence apparatus and the governor of Chhattisgarh for five years, could not manage to change the situation on the ground. His successor, the former defence secretary, Shekhar Dutt, has taken over the reins, but the security situation in the state continues to be grim. A section in the party is of the opinion that the khadi-topiwallahs are better at providing the healing touch to the aam admi. Motilal Vora, the proponents point out, had been a huge success in Uttar Pradesh when the state was under presidents rule. It remains to be seen whether the party leaders approve of the policy of appointing politicians, and not former bureaucrats, as governors. If they do, the netas will sport a wider grin while the babus wear a deeper scowl.                            
	 Is Digvijay Singh following in the steps of his mentor, Arjun Singh? After Diggy Raja questioned the measures adopted by the home minister to quell the Maoist insurgency in a newspaper article, many old hands in the Congress concluded that Digvijays strategy bore marks of the Arjun stamp. Apparently, in the 1980s and 1990s, Arjun, too, had resorted to letter-writing to take on formidable Congress leaders like Kamlapati Tripathi and PV Narasimha Rao. It is apparent that Digvijay is trying to carve a niche for himself outside the perceived institutional hierarchy. Sometime back, a gag order had been issued to prevent party leaders from speaking out of turn. When he was informed about it, Digvijay, apparently, told an associate that he had not sold his soul to anyone.      
	Given the partys history, and, more importantly, Arjun Singhs present status, Digvijays well-wishers might be thinking that he will do well to remember that old adage  discretion is the better part of valour.                            
	 Amar Singh has been made a member of the reconstituted and prestigious National Integration Council, which is headed by none other than the PM. Dropping out is Arjun Singh, who, last week, also failed to find a place in the Jawaharlal Nehru Trust. But one wonders who should be more concerned, Arjun or his follower, Digvijay?                          
	Mani Shankar Aiyar is on a comeback trail. For sometime now, Aiyar had found himself on the back benches after he failed to win the Lok Sabha polls. But his stint in the political wilderness is over. After being appointed convener of the centenary celebrations committee, he won a presidential nomination to the Upper House. Now it seems that Aiyar is all set to be included as a member of the National Advisory Committee that is headed by Sonia Gandhi. Aiyars elevation, however, has got some sections worried that it might lead to the creation of an anti-US lobby in the party. Now that might cause Prakash Karat to smile after a while.

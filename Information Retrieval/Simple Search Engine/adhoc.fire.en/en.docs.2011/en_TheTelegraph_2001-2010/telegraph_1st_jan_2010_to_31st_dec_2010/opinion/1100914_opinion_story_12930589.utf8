	In higher education, the path to excellence is necessarily straight and narrow. To widen it for the sake of a larger range of options, without carefully weighing the academic goals and resources, is to risk the enforcing of downward uniformity. This is what the IIT council might end up doing by allowing the Indian institutes of technology to offer full-fledged courses and award degrees in medicine. Over decades, the IITs have built up their specialized strengths, creating benchmarks in the pursuit of academic excellence in the country. Academically and politically, this has not been easy to do. Within these institutes focus on technology, the problem of how to step up the emphasis on research, with an eye to the requirements of industry and the developing Indian economy remains a concern for the government committee set up to look into the matter. To work out, and hold on to, the precise terms of the IITs autonomy and independence in relation to the Centre, especially its ministry of human resource development, is another ongoing struggle. Both problems, crucial to keeping the priority of academic merit, are far from being resolved. So, by taking on, on top of all this, the responsibility of setting up the infrastructure for quality medical education  with or without the supervision of the Medical Council of India  the IITs might be biting off more than they can chew.        
	Medicine and technology each has its institutions of excellence in India. The histories of their founding, nurture or ruin have been distinct from one another, and in seeking to maintain or improve these institutions, the fate of each should be kept distinct. Interdisciplinary courses, which combine technology and medicine or biology, are one thing, and could be part of projected improvements, but going into comprehensive medical education is quite another path to open up. In the 2010 QS World University Rankings, only IIT Bombay manages to find a place among the top 200 universities of the world, its position down to 187 from last years 163. China, South Korea, Thailand, Japan and Hong Kong are all placed above India in this list  China six times, with Peking University moving up to 46 from 47 last year. The IITs should stay focused on what they were meant to excel in originally (as should the countrys medical colleges and institutes), and make sure that their benchmarks are strictly academic.

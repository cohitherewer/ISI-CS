	Getting late                  
	Sir  It is surprising, to say the least, that the Centre is still thinking of putting a ban on such utterly despicable practices as child marriage (Child marriage ban on Centre mind, Dec 17). Child marriages, and the governments hesitation in banning them outright, make a sad commentary on the condition of our society and the administration. While one can still understand the prevalence of this practice as being the result of a lack of education, the governments failure to act is inexcusable. The argument that recognizing child marriages would protect those women who have already been a victim of this practice is just a pretext for inaction with vote banks in mind. One fails to understand how a young girl forcibly married off is to be protected, when the very fact of her marriage is a violation of child rights.          
	The Law Commissions report of February 2008 suggested 18 as the marriageable age for both boys and girls, while at the same time stating that marriages at ages 16 or 17 would be valid unless one of the parties gets the marriage annulled. The strange second clause contradicts the first. Such confusions bring to the fore the necessity of fixing the legal definition of the age of consent. It may be mentioned here that the Supreme Court had, more than two years ago, ordered all the states and Union Territories to make the registrations of marriages compulsory (SC: Register all marriages Oct 26, 2007). If such orders had been taken to their logical conclusion, child marriages would have been rendered invalid long ago.          
	The attitude of most Indians in relation to girls that largely governs child marriages is something that needs to be altered urgently. Aspirations for a male child, female foeticide, financial planning geared towards a prosperous career in case of a son but marriage in case of a daughter are the external proofs of our lopsided belief in the superiority of the male child over the female. Such ways of thinking are not limited to those who live in the suburbs or villages. Even educated urban Indians, fearing societys disapproval, feel uneasy if their daughters marry late or do not marry. Yet they feel no qualms about their sons behaving in a similar manner. As long as a daughter is considered a burden, gender disparity will remain, and daughters would be married off at an early age.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Horror on wheels           
	Sir  There seems to exist an inverse relationship between the introduction of new trains and the state of services provided to passengers. Otherwise, why should such basic requirements as drinking water, hygiene, and lighting in the compartments suffer a fall in standards while more and more trains are being introduced all over the country? Even the air conditioned compartments of such important trains as the Kanchenjunga Express, Kamrup Express, or the Brahamaputra Mail, which connect state capitals, are no better than the ordinary bogeys of local trains. The toilets are not cleaned regularly and the resultant stink pervades the compartments. Rats and cockroaches run riot in the corridors of the Kanchenjunga Express, often biting passengers.          
	The Brahamaputra Mail, connecting New Delhi and Dibrugarh, was a prestigious train some 10 years back. But today not just its sleeper classes but even its AC compartments are in a shambles. Soiled and dirty linens are supplied to the passengers by the railway staff. The used linens are dumped near the railway toilets and then reused. Passengers have no option but to use them to beat the chill of the AC compartments.           
	The anarchy at the New Jalpaiguri railway station testifies to the fact that the administration is indifferent to the issue of cleanliness. Platform 1A of NJP station is incomplete. Yet the Kanchenjunga Express and other trains are regularly allotted this platform. These trains go unwashed as a result. Passengers protest time and again against such abuse of their rights, but the officials seem unmoved.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Recently, I went to Guwahati by the Saraighat Express and returned by the Garib Rath. Although both are superfast trains, the passenger services provided by them are terrible. Vendors infest the trains  whether their AC compartments or the sleeper classes  at all hours of the day. There is no system for cleaning the toilets during the journeys. Besides, the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited does not seem to have a fixed rate for the food it serves, and charges as per its liking, much to the passengers confusion.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I bought a Venus Home Appliances geyser on July 1 this year. The geyser stopped working on December 20. I complained, and the complaint was received on December 21 by Venus Home Appliances Private Limited on Hazra Road in Calcutta. Till date (evening of December 28) the problem has not been solved. My geyser has neither been repaired nor replaced. As a result, during the coldest spell of this winter, I have been without hot water. I draw the attention of the readers to the services (or lack thereof) that are being provided by a reputed company.          
	Yours faithfully,      
M. Jhala, Calcutta

	A daughters claim on her fathers property has always been a contentious issue in India. And if she has already taken her stridhan at the time of marriage, is it fair that she should share her fathers property equally with her brothers? The question had been settled with the Indian Succession Act that accords equal succession rights to daughters and sons. Yet the civil laws have never sat easily in a country in which numerous religious communities, sects, sub-sects and tribal groups tend to take recourse to their respective personal laws. This underlying conflict between civil and communitarian laws is the source from which the recent challenge to a 1986 Supreme Court judgment on the disposal of property springs. In response to a case brought by a Syrian Christian woman, the Supreme Court had ruled that the Indian Succession Act would apply to Christians in the Travancore and Cochin regions, that is, an extensive area in south and central Kerala. The Christians in these areas were earlier governed by the Travancore Christian Succession Act and the Cochin Christian Succession Act that did not give sons and daughters the same right to their fathers property.        
	This is just one small example of the numerous incidents in which communitarian law comes into conflict with the civil law. By their very nature of being community-specific, personal laws clash with the secular principles of justice enshrined in the civil law code. Although it is the States duty to ensure that the civil law governs all, politicians are chary of alienating different communities  hence losing votes  by insisting on it. As a result, discrete instances of conflict come to the courts, and in each separate case, the courts assert the primacy of the civil law. The Supreme Courts 1986 judgment, for example, seems to refer to only two laws in Travancore and Cochin to remain within the cases terms of reference. But in principle it is actually asserting the primacy of the civil law over all personal or community-based laws. It is as if the shift to a single principle of justice from its various community-driven conceptions is happening bit by bit, case by case. The court is, in a way, filling a vacuum left by the State. The changeover from personal laws to the civil is inevitable, but with a hesitant State, the court has to run the risk of looking too active in order to carry out the States task.

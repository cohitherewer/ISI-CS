	Burning coffins, breaking a pot before the statue of King Taksin, throwing plastic bags full of rotten fish, and even pouring 300 litres of human blood on important government buildings last month  the Thai Red Shirts, protesting against the misrule of Abhisit Vejjajiva, finally seem to have run out of bizarre rituals of rebellion. The storming of the parliament by vehement demonstrators of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship, on April 7, was shorn of symbolism, and left scores of lawmakers scrambling for their lives. The mood was palpably dangerous  ministers had to be airlifted to safety  and continues to be so. Just as the rebels have lost all patience with the imperious Mr Vejjajiva, the government, too, is in no mood to relent. So the inevitable has happened. After months of calculated silence, while dissenters were allowed to express their outrage, Mr Vejjajiva has finally seized the opportunity he was waiting for and imposed a state of emergency on his country.        
	There is very little that Mr Vejjajiva can hope to take away from this momentary triumph, if it can be called that. While a state of emergency will allow him to exercise sweeping powers over his people, it is not going to make him one bit popular. Ironically, it is popularity that is crucially at stake in Thailand. Mr Vejjajiva, who ousted the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, in a coup in 2006, is yet to earn his mandate to rule. So far, his sole claim to legitimacy has been upheld by the army, and supported by the tiny clique of the traditional elite who were terribly put off by Mr Shinawatras pro-poor policies. Demands for fresh elections have been ignored with impunity, as the Oxford-educated Mr Vejjajiva made no secret of his innate disdain for hoi polloi. So present-day Thai politics looks perilously close to what Myanmar has experienced for decades. But unlike General Than Shwe, Mr Vejjajiva has wisely refrained from outright confrontation with the protesters. Yet, a gentle approach is not going to help either, which is not to recommend open combat as the only way out of this mess. Already, sections of the police and the military are withdrawing support from the government, which possibly explains the growing might of the protesters. Unless Mr Vejjajiva honours the demand for elections at the earliest, Thailand is not only going to spiral out of control but also pull him down along the way.

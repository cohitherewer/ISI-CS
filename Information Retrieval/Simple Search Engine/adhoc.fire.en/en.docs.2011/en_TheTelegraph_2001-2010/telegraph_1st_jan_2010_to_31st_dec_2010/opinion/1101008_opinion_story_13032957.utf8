	At home: A short history of private life By Bill Bryson, Doubleday, Rs 950        
	Having written A Short History of Nearly Everything (2005), the Reverend Bill Bryson should have retired a contented man to the rectory in the sleepy village near Norfolk where he lives. If he did anything of that sort, it lasted only for a while. For after telling us nearly everything we need to know, Bryson still seems to have an awful lot more to add. His new book is filled with as many facts as a bestselling writer of eminently readable prose can possibly cram into 500-odd pages. The result, though brilliantly entertaining at times, turns out to be rather stressful reading. Brysons anecdotage is largely fascinating, but seldom amounts to little more than the piling up of trivia that have been carefully chosen to titillate, shock or amuse the reader. The latter may, in turn, feel reasonably tempted to skip pages packed with inane information once he gets the hang of Brysons style.        
	Bryson is incurably addicted to anecdote. He typically leads the reader into a forest of facts that becomes almost claustrophobic as he keeps galloping from one point to the other. Bryson simply cannot resist bursting into asides  however related they may be. For instance, while discussing the cholera epidemic in 19th-century England, he mentions one Edwin Chadwick, who believed that the disease was caused by smells. Then suddenly, Bryson remembers that Chadwick gave Britain the workhouse. This brings him to Chadwicks half-brother, who, driven by personal tragedy, emigrated to America, and was hailed as the father of baseball. Finally, there is a footnote on their father, who taught the scientist, John Dalton, and was well acquainted with Tom Paine, whose Rights of Man brought on the French Revolution. You may well wonder how any of this is remotely related to cholera.        
	Some of the chapter titles are also intriguing. In The Cellar, The Passage and The Study, Bryson pays more attention to bricklaying, the invention of the telephone and to rodents respectively. The subtitle itself is a bit misleading. Bryson is not so interested in private life as a psychological phenomenon or as a crucial element in the history of inwardness and personhood. Rather, for him, the history of private life is a history of getting comfortable slowly. The inevitable fallout of such an approach is superficiality. We are told that history mostly is... masses of people doing ordinary things. So we get a vivid account of cooking, eating, excreting, having sex, giving birth and dying through the ages. We learn how a myriad appliances and gadgets, manners and etiquettes, norms and laws, came about. And scattered along the way are treacherous twists and turns that waylay the reader and lead him to details that are, most often, not even tenuously relevant to the larger argument. Such a strategy will annoy any serious historian. Even an ardent gossip, who takes pleasure in idle chatter, will not be fully sympathetic. A good gossip is never glib and would know how not to lose his audiences attention.        
	Bryson never scratches the surface of social history, he remains unabashedly selective and his chronology is usually wildly haphazard. By the end of his introduction, he has undermined the grand design suggested in his subtitle. We learn that we will get the history of only the last 150 years or so. It is less obvious that he will be concentrating almost exclusively, and unapologetically, on England and America, as if the rest of the world is of no consequence. However, if you choose to forgive these shortcomings, there is much that you can take away from Brysons book. To begin with, the sheer surfeit of information, coupled with the extensive bibliography, should open up scores of new, and quirky, areas of research for students of the social sciences. We certainly need more histories of glass-making, dirtiness, adulterated food, curious taxes, and the fear of being buried alive, to suggest a few less-explored terrains. Only one hopes that these prospective works would be better organized than Brysons.        
	Still, some of the Brysoniana is jaw-dropping. Apparently, a popular American guidebook informed its readers that they may wipe their lips on the table cloth, but not blow their noses with it. A French visitor to Philadelphia  it is uncertain when  noted in amazement how one man removed the flowers from a vase and peed in it. British hygiene was no better. After the court of Charles II departed from Oxford in about 1660, one of those left behind remarked... how the royal visitors had left their excrements in every corner, in chimneys, studies, coal-houses, cellars. An American lady reported in 1867 how she and her sister took armloads of shoes to bed... to throw at the rats that ran across the floor.        
	There are gruesome descriptions of medical catastrophes and brutalities. Bryson quotes the novelist, Fanny Burney, who, afflicted with breast cancer, went through a full mastectomy in the pre- chloroform days. Samuel Pepys, fortified only by a stiff drink, had his kidney stone  the size of a tennis ball  removed. In the late 19th century, doctors were routinely prosecuted, and had their licences revoked, for examining the genitals of their female patients. And the Victorian obsession with chastity led to the invention of the Penis Pricking Ring in the 1850s (picture). It was slipped over the penis at bedtime (or indeed any time) and... lined with metal prongs that bit into any penis that impiously swelled beyond a very small range of permissible deviation.        
	Entertaining as it may be, it is also embarrassing to listen to Bryson re-imagine history with a scandalously grand sweep. We hear him quiver with rapturous excitement as he heralds the great age of whaling, the age of servitude, the great age of housebuilding, the age of the celebrity architect or the age of mass manufacture. Sometimes he slips into a Sunday-sermon mode, and can be sleekly self-indulgent. Bryson seems to be positively gloating as describes his own work as a history of the world without leaving home or a book done in carpet slippers.        
	In the rambling opening chapter on The Great Exhibition of 1851, Bryson surveys the career of Thomas Marsham, the rector who built the house where he now lives. Marsham, as Bryson says, belonged to a class of well-educated, wealthy people who had immense amounts of time on their hands. In consequence, many of them began, quite spontaneously, to do remarkable things. In Brysons own case, the first part of the statement holds good as well. Of the second, one isnt so sure.

	Troubled times                  
	Sir  Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, has been witnessing bloody riots for over a month now. Violent clashes between the military-backed government premiered by Abhisit Vejjajiva and the Red Shirts have made life in one of the most cosmopolitan cities of the world seem like a nightmare (Bangkok scrapes off riot mess, May 24). The situation reached its climax on May 19 when the army launched the most severe attack to quell the rioters  it bulldozed into the protesters camps with powerful weapons, killing a few people, and forcing many of the protesters to surrender. It appears from the reports, which are pouring in from the international news agencies, that the protesters could not take the armys onslaught any longer and gave up in order to avoid further loss of lives. However, some outraged demonstrators did go on a rampage and set fire to the stock exchange, to shopping malls, banks and cinema halls among other things. This had led the government to declare a night-time curfew in Bangkok, though life is returning to normal now.          
	Thailand, formerly known as Siam, is one of the few countries in Southeast Asia that has not been under any colonial rule. It was a seat of Buddhism till it became one of Asias most attractive tourist spots. It is a country where the notoriously glamourous Pattaya exists alongside the cities where people live a quiet and disciplined life. But with rapid urbanization, things have changed. Bangkok has not only become modern and attractive but also the sleaziest city in Southeast Asia. Not just the rural poor, but the people dwelling in certain downtown areas of Bangkok itself live in rather pitiable condition.          
	Since the time the military-backed autocratic regime of Vejjajiva returned to power, the Red Shirts started their agitation for the return of democracy in Thailand. The desperation of the people seems to have now intensified. An analogy can be drawn between Thailand and its neighbour, Myanmar. Both countries have been grappling with the consequences of an autocratic rule. In Myanmar, the brave Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been leading a life of confinement for decades, is fighting to bring democracy back to that country. It now remains to be seen whether another neighbour of these two nations that is well-known as the worlds biggest democracy will come forward to help.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Money matters          
	Sir  It was not because of a sense of brotherhood that European countries had come together to form the European Union, with euro as their common currency. They did so in order to counter the hegemony and monopoly of the US dollar. Arguably, the EU has been a success as far as its endeavour to pit the euro as a strong competitor to the dollar goes.          
	But it now appears that countries such as Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland or Italy have realized all of a sudden that they do not have enough funds to pay back their debt (Fall from grace, May 21). The citizens of these countries were kept blissfully unaware of the crisis that was looming over their heads. They have now been asked to contribute towards clearing off the debt that their country owes to others. As such, the anger of the people is quite justified.          
	I wonder what impact these failing economies will have on the European stock markets, considering that havoc was created in the American stock exchanges when some banks and financial institutions closed down, leading to the global financial meltdown in 2008. It can be said that the economies of developed nations were bound to collapse at some point of time. Whatever goes up has to come down  China too seems to have reached its saturation point.          
	Therefore, it does not surprise when some say that even a country like India, which has millions of poor people, would become a superpower in a decade or so. But whether this will happen because of the progress of the people within the Indian State is uncertain. It is possible that India will rise only because all the other economies that are doing well now may collapse. Perhaps, as the proverb has it, India is the one-eyed king in the kingdom of the blind.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitras article, Africa reaches Europe (May 21), makes a mockery of the rules of economics. Mitra admits that African governments spent more than what they gathered from taxes... resulting in large gaps in the balance of payment, but he disapproves of the International Monetary Funds prescription to restrict imports or to impose monetary discipline on Greece. However grand idealism may sound like, spending money on social welfare  which the author approves  while emptying the State exchequer is a stupid move economically.          
	Yours faithfully,

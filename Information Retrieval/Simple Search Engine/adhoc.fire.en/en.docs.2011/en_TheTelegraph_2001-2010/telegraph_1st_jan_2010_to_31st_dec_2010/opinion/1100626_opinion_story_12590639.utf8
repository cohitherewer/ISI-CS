	Wrong move                  
	Sir  The image of Indian security personnel carrying the dead bodies of Maoists tied to poles reminded me of the incident in 2001 when members of the Bangladesh Rifles had hoisted the bodies of slain BSF jawans in a similar manner. The BDRs act had provoked international outrage. Security forces have the right to take steps to counter militancy. But acts such as carting dead bodies of militants on poles must be avoided. Such acts can create unrest among Maoist sympathizers, thereby adding to the trouble faced by security forces.          
	Yours faithfully,        S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 
                  
	Still the same          
	Sir  The editorial, Reinventing Calcutta (June 19), was thought-provoking and its tone absolutely matter of fact. The city has gone from bad to worse during the uninterrupted misrule of the Left Front government. The rule of the leftists was populist by nature. During their reign, ponds were filled, greenery denuded, waterbodies destroyed, residential and office complexes built in an unplanned manner, hawkers encouraged to occupy pavements and so on. The change of guard at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation would not make much of a difference as the Trinamul Congress too has an eye on the vote bank and is likely to resort to populist strategies.          
	Given the current situation, it is entirely possible that changes at the citys corporation and, possibly, at the Writers Buildings in the near future, are unlikely to make a difference to the lives of Calcuttans who would continue to suffer in the same manner.                    
	Yours faithfully,         A.S. Mehta, Calcutta       
	Sir  The triumph of the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC in Calcuttas municipal corporation elections will mean nothing unless the new regime decides to undo the wrongs perpetrated by the Left Front. Will the new rulers get rid of the hawkers who have encroached on Calcuttas public spaces? Will the vehicles flouting pollution norms and the unlicensed autos be barred from plying on the streets? The new authorities should also take steps to save Calcuttas vanishing greens and waterbodies from the deadly clasp of ruthless promoters. It is imperative for the TMCs councillors to stop encouraging the agents of unscrupulous forces. Only when the harried citizens are able to enjoy their civic rights and are awarded a corruption-free dispensation can it be said that Calcutta and West Bengal are heading for change.           
	Else, the change will be merely political, and the common people will continue to tread along the same laggard path.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur                      
	Parting shot          
	Sir  An Urdu-medium primary school, the Horer Danga Sholapukur Dubraj Urdu school, was inaugurated by Saidul Haque, Burdwans member of parliament. Nearly 200-250 students were enrolled along with five teachers. The institution was attended by students not only from Burdwan but also from other places like Memari and Galsi. Since the school teaches students from standards I-IV, pupils are forced to travel to Durgapur or Asansol for further studies. The children find it very difficult to travel to Durgapur or Asansol by train. Moreover, when the parents came to know that the said institution was not affiliated upto standard X, the number of students began to fall. Now the school is running only on paper, and has one teacher. Could the authorities look into the matter, considering the fact that Burdwan has a sizeable Muslim population?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kader Aziz, Burdwan

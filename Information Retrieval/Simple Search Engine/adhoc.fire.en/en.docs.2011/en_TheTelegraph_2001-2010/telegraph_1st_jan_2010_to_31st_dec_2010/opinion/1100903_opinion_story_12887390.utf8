	Strong popular feeling can be very moving and difficult to ignore. Especially when the feeling is one of pain on behalf of the Bhopal victims or the starving poor. In a democracy, it is for the government to respond when necessary, to rectify the situation or assuage feelings of injustice when there is adequate reason. The institution untouched by popular feeling is the court; it remains neutral and independent, above the passions of people and politics. India has a wise and independent judiciary, and The Telegraph bows to none in its respect for the Supreme Court of the land. Yet it is forced to differ with two of its recent decisions. The final sentencing in the Bhopal case last June caused a countrywide uproar that led to the government promising a refurbished system to ensure upgraded medical treatment for all victims and compensation for those who have not got it or have not been given enough. It also filed a curative petition with the Supreme Court, in response to which the court has agreed to review its September 1996 judgment. In 1996, the charge was changed from culpable homicide to causing death by negligence.        
	The real need now is the palliation of the victims suffering, something that the government needs to concentrate on. If the prosecution failed to build an adequate case in 1996, it is difficult to see what it can do now. Neither is it the judiciarys job to ensure that the compensation and medicine are properly targeted. The courts duties are somewhat different. Similarly, there can be no questioning the humanitarianism behind the courts concern over the fact that foodgrain lies rotting in government godowns even as poor people starve. But that is a failure of the executive; it is up to the government to correct the many serious flaws in food storage and distribution policies. The Supreme Court, however, has ordered the agriculture minister to distribute food free to poor people. It has reportedly also commented on the amounts that should be stored and the need to review the list of people below the poverty line. Although the court itself had said it did not want to enter into the nitty-gritty of governing, this can hardly be called anything else. The executives failure will reap its own penalties; the system is so designed. It is always best when the judiciary, the executive and the legislature each discharges its clearly demarcated duties.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	After the verdict                  
	Sir  All should welcome the long-awaited Allahabad High Court verdict on the Ayodhya dispute, as it reflects the sentiments of the people of India (Court rules in favour of 3-way split, Oct 1). The parties involved in the dispute should sit together and reach an agreement instead of appealing to the Supreme Court. A member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Kamal Farooqui, has very rightly said that the court has created an opportunity to bring about a reconciliation, and that in future, a mandir and a masjid may co-exist in Ayodhya for the greater good of the nation. I hope that the AIMPLB will ensure that no further appeal is made against the verdict. A mosque and a temple alongside each other can serve as symbols of how even complex problems can be solved amicably in India. The verdict should pave the way towards setting a remarkable example of communal harmony and progress.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
V.M. Khaleelur Rahman, Ambur, Tamil Nadu              
	Sir  The Allahabad High Courts verdict seems to have satisfactorily answered the questions raised by Indians regarding the Ayodhya dispute. Any further appeal challenging the verdict will lead to unnecessary complications. This chapter in Indias history should be closed once and for all. Indians have the freedom to practise their own religions. They are not going to be fooled by politicians who wish to stir up unrest.          
	Yours faithfully,         Gauranga Bhattacharya, Midnapore              
	Sir  We have already had enough bloodshed and hatred in India. Now that the decades-old Ayodhya controversy has ended in a verdict, it is time for Indians to stand together and declare that the progress of our country and a bright future for our children matter most to us. Our social duties as Indians are to respect people who profess different faiths, and to care for and stand by one another.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Asif Patel, Belgaum, Karnataka                     
	Sir  The Ayodhya verdict is being hailed for its balanced apportioning of the disputed land among the litigants. However, it also might lead to the building of a temple, something that the chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Mohan Bhagwat, clearly intends to do. Should a fortune be spent on a temple when poverty drives hundreds of farmers in India to commit suicide every year? Does the Bharatiya Janata Party really have the peoples interest in mind when it pushes for the building of a temple? Cannot Rams legacy be kept alive by using the money to help the poor people in that area?          
	I disagree with the view that the Ayodhya dispute is basically pointless. It would have been significant if it could spark genuine interest in the moral and political ideals of the Ramayan. Sadly, it is the cry of Hindutva by right-wing politicians that represents Hinduism today and reduces it to the mere constructions and demolitions of shrines. It is shameful that parties like the BJP, the RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad still have such a strong voice in a secular republic like India.          
	Yours faithfully,        Madhuchhanda Ray Choudhury, Pittsburgh, US              
	Sir  The issues that are plaguing the country today are inflation, unemployment and lack of security. In comparison, the land dispute in Ayodhya is less important. However, it is a matter that has been stretched over decades. Both the BJP and the Congress sought to increase their respective vote banks by exploiting the issue. The Allahabad High Courts verdict provided the best possible solution to such a messy problem. Unfortunately, one of the contending parties intends to take the matter to the Supreme Court. This clearly means that we have not seen or heard the last of the dispute.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  On the day of the landmark judgment, the governments assurance of peace to the people of the country was an example of effective governance. In spite of the Kashmir problem and the security concerns over the Commonwealth Games, the government managed to ensure peace on September 30. The verdict, in favour of all contending parties, was just. But it was the administration of the country and the media that contributed to the image of a mature nation.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

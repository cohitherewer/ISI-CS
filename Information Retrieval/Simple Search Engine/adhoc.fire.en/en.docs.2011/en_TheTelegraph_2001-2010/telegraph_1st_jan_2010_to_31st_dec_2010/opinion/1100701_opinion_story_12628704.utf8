	It is no surprise that the global economic recovery was the main subject of concern in the G20 summit that just finished in Toronto. There was a general consensus among the leaders that the initiatives taken to sustain private demand needed to be continued. The problem, however, was the handling of the fiscal deficit faced by some of the countries. Here no rigid guidelines were laid down. Each country was left to address the issue in the manner it deems fit. This was described as differentiated and tailored approach. Another key area was global demand. It appeared necessary to boost savings in certain countries, and to boost domestic growth in others. One implication of this, the pundits say, is that the Chinese should spend more and the Americans less. This could well make China the pace setter for growth in the near future. This would entail a shift in the balance of economic power. It is important for India that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the president of the United States of America, Barack Obama, were in agreement on most of the important economic issues affecting the world. Mr Obamas words of respect for Mr Singh must be read in this context.        
	In Toronto, in many cases it was Mr Singhs wise counsel that was listened to and followed. It was Mr Singhs suggestion that state fiscal stimuli to counter the global economic meltdown and how and when such policies should be wound down should be left to the countries themselves. It was agreed that a general coordinated winding down of expansionary fiscal policies could hamper the recovery process. The G20 countries committed nearly $2 trillion to stimulus measures. The downside of this is the enormous rise in public debt in the G20. A balance needs to be struck between the stimulus measures and the servicing of the debt. The latter could easily derail the recovery process. The timing and the extent of the rollback of the expansionary policies were left to individual countries and their own assessment of the turnaround. Another area of concern was the pace and the extent of the financial sector reforms. There was a discomfort about the US financial sector reform bill. The worse days of the global economic slowdown  the worst in a hundred years  may be in the past. But their shadow remains and is unlikely to disappear when the rich and the powerful nations meet again in November in Seoul.

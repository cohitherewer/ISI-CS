	It would be interesting to know whether the leaders of the Left Democratic Front in Kerala celebrated the states birthday in style. For victory in the Kozhikode city corporation can hardly compensate the LDF for its losses in the just-concluded municipal and panchayat elections. But it is not easy to be certain about the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which heads the LDF. It is, after all, the CPI(M)s arrogance, complacence and alienation from the people that are being cited as the chief reasons behind the LDFs obvious loss of support in both urban and rural areas. The United Democratic Front, led by the Congress, has done strikingly well, winning in seats and areas that have been under the LDFs control for years. The numbers suggest a hard blow to the LDFs standing since, even in some of its victories, it seems to be holding on by its fingertips. And the Bharatiya Janata Party has not done too badly either, inveigling its way into the position of decider in a few local bodies with a hung verdict.         
	At first sight, though, the results may just look mixed. In any case, Kerala traditionally changes voting sides every five years, alternating between the LDF and the UDF. This would mean that the UDF is due to take over government in the next assembly elections anyway. What is dangerous to the Left, however, is the fact that the LDF always held a huge majority of local bodies, including the panchayats, whichever coalition was in power. It is its alienation at the ground-level that should alarm the CPI(M) most, as if its sap has suddenly dried up. Corruption, glorification of the incompetent, habitual lying, blatant nepotism, a self-perpetuating mindlessness  all these call to mind the disenchantment with the CPI(M) in West Bengal, which goes to the polls with Kerala next year. Perhaps both states are also a bit tired of the combination of outdated rhetoric and invariable failure in every sphere. But here the similarities end. Maybe because Kerala has always had the sense to change the parties in government every five years, it has managed to leave West Bengal far behind, including in education and health. Even the grassroots stranglehold that the CPI(M) had in Kerala could not fully block its progress. But even that state seems to have had enough. Add to its woes a chief minister forever carping at the state party secretary and Keralas eagerness to get rid of the LDF becomes even more explicable.

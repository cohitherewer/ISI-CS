                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HIGH-LEVEL SUDOKU                           - The unit of analysis is no longer just India-Pakistan        Kanti Bajpai                                                                
	The meeting of the Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries at the end of February ended with nothing of great significance  except for the fact that it happened at all. There was a general sense, virtually across the political and strategic spectrum, that the meeting was a failure. Nehruvian internationalists, who set great store by negotiations, thought it did not go far enough. Globalizing liberals, who favour diplomatic flexibility and creative diplomacy in a world they consider driven by economics rather than politics, felt that neither side showed much nimbleness. And hardcore realists, for whom power and force (or the threat of force) are the staples of international life, shook their heads over the apparent pusillanimity of the Indian government, which found itself talking to Pakistan when it should have been brandishing a sword.        
	How shall one think about India-Pakistan relations? Which position is right? Should one negotiate regardless of terrorism, as the prime minister seemed to suggest in his statement in Parliament where he defended the governments decision to talk to Islamabad? Should one set aside historic positions on the nature of negotiations between India and Pakistan, as suggested by liberals, and look for truly out-of-the-box solutions, perhaps with a particular focus on economics and energy, but, most importantly, with the help of the United States of America and anyone else who could intercede with Pakistan to good effect (China? Saudi Arabia?)? Or is the only way to deal with Pakistan through the deployment of military and economic power sufficient to overawe Islamabad? And if that is not enough, should New Delhi, as argued further by realists, consider the threat or use of force against militants or against the Pakistani armed forces to bring about an end to terrorism?              
	All three positions have their limitations. Internationalists want negotiations for ever until agreement is reached. But negotiations about what? India has historically wanted a composite dialogue, which deals with all outstanding issues, from security and Kashmir to trade and people-to-people relations. Every agreement with Pakistan, including the Tashkent Accord of 1966, the Simla Accord of 1972, and the Lahore Accord of 1999, has incorporated Indias preference for a composite negotiation. Pakistan, by contrast, has always wanted to limit the scope of negotiations. Kashmir has been the singular agenda of the Pakistanis, even though they have repeatedly agreed, in cold print, to a composite dialogue.        
	Suddenly, however, the two countries have reversed their preferences. India now wants the agenda restricted to terrorism, and Pakistan wants a composite dialogue. In the wake of 26/11, both positions are understandable. The issue for the internationalists, though, is the following: how can the two make progress when they are once again in disagreement over the basic structure of negotiations? Is it worthwhile to hold meetings when they differ so profoundly on the fundamentals of any discussions?        
	The liberals are not surprised by the impasse in negotiations. They want both countries, but especially their own, to be more flexible and creative given the globalizing world that we live in. For them, Pakistan is a relatively minor issue in that world. Technology, investment, and trade are the key to national resilience and power, and, ultimately, therefore to security. India must modernize in a rapid, transformative sense, led by the market, if it is to catch up first with China and then the developed countries. It must grow at 10 per cent per annum or more, if it is also to stave off internal rebellion  by separatists, by Naxalites, and by other disaffected groups. Territorial attachments, over, say, Kashmir, are relics of an old politics. India must be prepared to be flexible over the dispute and other issues with Pakistan, keeping in mind the larger goal of economic modernization. Liberals think that flexibility is both cause and effect: flexibility with Pakistan would allow India to forge ahead economically and politically; forging ahead economically and politically would allow India to make Pakistan an offer on Kashmir it could not refuse since Indias market, goods, and capital would bring prosperity to Pakistan as well.        
	The problem with the liberal argument is that, within India, the attachment to territory is enormous. Any attempt to compromise in any substantial way over Kashmiri territory would lead to an enormous political reaction, one that the Indian government may not be able to control. Also, Pakistan has other options economically, particularly the greatest locomotive of global growth  China. Islamabad and Pakistani elites are convinced that they dont need India economically.        
	The realists have appeal because if coercion is the way forward with Pakistan, their policies do not depend on Pakistans cooperation (except its surrender). According to realists, India must unilaterally build up its national power  military and economic  and must use that power to bear down on Pakistan. At the limit, New Delhi must be willing to use force. Its armed forces must plan to use a variety of punitive strikes that could hurt Pakistan. Thus, India might bomb militant camps, use commandos to raid Pakistani territory, and, if necessary, send large, rapid-action forces as deep as 50-80 kilometres into Pakistan to get Islamabad to come to a final and lasting agreement on Kashmir and terrorism.        
	This unilateral method of dealing with Pakistan is attractive because it is unilateral  but it is also extremely dangerous, for at least three reasons. First, it is not clear that Indias conventional forces have the edge to win these kinds of military engagements. Second, China might choose to intervene. Third, Pakistan might use its nuclear weapons. Some realists dont worry about nuclear weapons since they think that if Pakistan were ever to use them, India would retaliate so massively as to solve the Pakistan problem once and for all. The problem with this view is that one has to consider the role of China, which has a much stronger nuclear force than India. Those who answer that China will be checked by the Russians or the Americans (or both) must be sure that these two powers will come to Indias aid and risk global confrontation when it is New Delhi that would have escalated the conflict with Pakistan.              
	If all this was not problematic enough, it is worth adding another complication, which, increasingly, is the most knotty problem of all perhaps  the rising tide of Islamic extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The extremists dont care about negotiations with India; nor do they support the kind of modernization that liberals dream about; and as for war and nuclear confrontation, some of them harbour such an apocalyptic view of the world that they might even applaud an India-Pakistan armageddon. Neither Delhi nor Islamabad has an answer to the call of the militants.        
	Perhaps this is another way of saying that we are looking at the wrong problem, which is no longer India-Pakistan but rather Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh plus Iran, China, Central Asia, and Russia. The unit of analysis has quite simply changed. And the foreign- secretaries talk about bilateral issues is working within the wrong matrix altogether. Nothing less than a comprehensive regional working through of several interconnected problems will suffice at this stage. An unprecedentedly complex and challenging sudoku? Yes, but probably inescapable.

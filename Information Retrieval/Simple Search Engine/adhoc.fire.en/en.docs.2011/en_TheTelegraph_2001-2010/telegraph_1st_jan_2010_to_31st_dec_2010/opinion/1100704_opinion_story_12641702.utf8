	George Smiley will have to be summoned back from retirement as the ghost of Harold Adrian Russell  popularly known as Kim  Philby refuses to go away. The arrest of 10 persons in the United States of America on charges of spying for Russia suggests that the black art of espionage is not dead. It has been active, though all the while it was presumed to be dead. Spying is by no means a 20th-century phenomenon: it has been described by one of its chroniclers as the worlds second oldest profession. (It is significant that the worlds oldest profession and the second oldest one came together in one of the most notorious scandals of the last century, involving Christine Keeler and John Profumo.) Its long history notwithstanding, very few will deny that espionage acquired new and unprecedented dimensions in the course of World War II and its aftermath. When an Iron Curtain came down over Europe and a few years later the Berlin Wall came up, the world came to be divided, politically, ideologically and economically, into two opposing camps which were at war with each other without actually resorting to warfare. The Cold War, as the hostilities came to be called, was one of the defining periods of the 20th century till the collapse of the Soviet Union. The principal instrument of the Cold War was espionage, and both sides, in almost a mirror image of each other, used it relentlessly and without scruple. One of the great triumphs of that long and cruel espionage war was the recruitment by the KGB  the Soviet secret service  of five Cambridge students who served as deep penetration agents  or moles in the jargon  within the highest echelons of British intelligence agencies. The most successful of these was Kim Philby. The recent discovery of spies in the US by the FBI after an investigation lasting over a decade has resurrected memories of Philby and his fellow spies, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt and John Cairncross. The Cold War and the black arts linked to it, contrary to popular belief, may not be things of the past.        
	Apart from spies, the Cold War also produced its own literature. The spy thriller became a genre in itself and its two masters portrayed the world of spooks in dramatically contrasting terms. In Ian Flemings James Bond, the spy became the glamour boy engaging in acts of derring-do for the glory of Britain; in John le Carrs George Smiley, the spy became an introverted, middle-aged gentleman struggling to retain a foothold in a declining Britain being overwhelmed by Soviet Russia and the US. Fleming died during the Cold War and Mr le Carrs fictional world lost its special charm after he decided to come in from the cold once the Wall came down and Smileys people became redundant.        
	The news of a Russian spy ring in the US opens up the possibility of Mr le Carrs return to the turf that was truly his own and also to his old form. The honourable schoolboy may have to be sent out again from a renovated Russia house. The spy is not dead. He only sleepeth.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PLEASE BE PATIENT                                                          
	It began in 1911, when George V moved the capital of his Indian empire from Calcutta to Delhi. Almost a hundred years after that fateful durbar, Delhi has barely managed to land on its feet with the Commonwealth Games. But given its swish new world-class feel post-CWG, Delhi gives Calcutta yet another reason to feel left behind by history  or left with little other than history. Over the last few weeks, the sense of a sad contrast between the two cities has found an apt emblem in the state of the Metro Railway in Calcutta, compared to that of its counterpart in Delhi. In Calcutta, the Metro inspires mortal thoughts, being most often in the news for suicides and terrifying mishaps in the dark. But the Delhi Metro, with its expanding network, its state-of-the-art, eco-friendly technology and its ability to make commuters feel safe and comfortable, has come to stand for an urban modernity that makes the world look at India, and India look at itself, with new eyes. What does this say about the two cities, about the people who live in and run them?        
	The loss of direct access to power is certainly one of the principal factors behind this falling by the wayside. In all the hectic bidding that goes on around events like the CWG, the Olympics or other summit events, it is always the other, lesser, cities that lose out against the might of the capital. This leads not only to an accruing material disadvantage, but also to an equally demoralizing transformation in political and civic attitudes. The Metro Rail authorities in Calcutta like to see themselves as virtually forsaken by both the Central and the state governments. This feeling of deprivation and neglect only too easily becomes an excuse for allowing the Metro to lapse into what it has become today  an embodiment of shabbiness and mismanagement that had started out, more than two decades ago, as something to be proud of. It is ironic that this should happen in the Central railways ministers own city, and that she often gets criticized for channelling her energies into securing her base in the state at the expense of her duties as minister.        
	But even if the Calcutta Metro were to become flush with funds all of a sudden, the Metro Rail authorities have given Calcuttans little reason to believe that the money would be used to give them the state of the art. When the condition of everything from roads and flyovers to government hospitals indicates a consistent inability to handle large sums of money in a planned, efficient and accountable way, what is the guarantee that the Metro would be dealt with in a radically different manner? So far, the signs have been far from reassuring. Between an old communication system that does not work inside the tunnels and new air-conditioned rakes that cannot tackle peak-hour crowds, what might Calcuttans hope for? Please be patient! announces the bodiless voice in the dark. Never mind if it is getting difficult to breathe.

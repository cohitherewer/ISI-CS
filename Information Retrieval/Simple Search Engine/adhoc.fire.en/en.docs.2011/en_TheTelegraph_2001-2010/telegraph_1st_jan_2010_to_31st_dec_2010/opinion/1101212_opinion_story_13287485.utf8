                              Father figure        
	 Everyone knows that Lalu Prasad bit the dust in the recently concluded elections in Bihar. But what is often forgotten is that his son, Tejaswi, fared as badly as his father. Prasad had launched Tejaswi in the course of the campaign amidst much fanfare, hoping that the latter will serve not only as a trump card for the Rashtriya Janata Dal but will also negate the influence of Rahul Gandhi. Tejaswi canvassed for his mother, Rabri Devi, as well as for the party. Having declared himself as the youngest of young leaders, he took a dig at Rahul by saying that while he was just 22 years old, the Congressman had crossed 40. But Lalu Prasads ploy failed miserably, and his party suffered near decimation in the electoral battle. The drubbing has forced the former chief minister to scout greener pastures to relaunch his son. Apparently, he is now pushing the Delhi Daredevils to induct Tejaswi in their side for the Indian Premier League. Prasad is telling anyone who is willing to listen to him that his son has all the talent that is needed to make the cut. But after what happened in Bihar, not many seem keen to believe that Tejaswi will prove to be a success in this whole new ball game.                              
	 In its second avatar, the United Progressive Alliance has given the aam admi plenty of reasons to be unhappy. Prices of essential commodities continue to rise, corruption remains unchecked, and parliamentary proceedings are still being disrupted. But actress-turned-activist-turned-politician Nafisa Ali has been displeased with the government because of a theft that occurred in her boutique. Ali, who switched over from the Samajwadi Party to the Congress, has been heard complaining about the flimsy security in the capital and the Delhi Polices ineptness. But shouldnt she switch sides yet again before launching her tirade against the Congress-led coalition?                
	 For the beleaguered Suresh Kalmadi, home isnt where the heart is. Member of the legislative council and state Congress secretary Mohan Joshi has declared that he will contest the next Lok Sabha polls from Pune, which had elected Kalmadi earlier. Joshi claimed that after the CWG imbroglio, the Congress should not give a ticket to Kalmadi. The timing of Joshis declaration was perfect; he was speaking at a function in Pune where Kalmadi was in attendance. After Joshi sprung his nasty surprise, Kalmadi didnt know where to look.          
	 Another politician who isnt exactly happy about developments on the home front is Ghulam Nabi Azad. It is true that at the moment Azad is in great demand in Delhi. There is a possibility that he may be given charge of important states such as Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka or Tamil Nadu. But what must be troubling him is the fact that his bte noire, Ahmad Patel, has been put in charge of crisis-laden Jammu and Kashmir, which is Azads home turf. Besides being his arch rival, Patel is also considered to be close to the state PCC chief, Saifuddin Soz, who belongs to the anti-Azad camp. Given their common woes, Azad and Kalmadi will have a lot to tell each other.                            
	 The Congress and the Opposition are at loggerheads inside Parliament over the 2G spectrum imbroglio. But outside the House, Congress leaders continue to maintain civil ties with their opponents. Sample these examples. Rahul Gandhi surprised everyone by attending the wedding of Rajiv Pratap Rudys nephew. Prithviraj Chavan, the new chief minister of Maharashtra, made it a point to be present at the wedding of Nitin Gadkaris son while Ahmad Patel was also spotted at Bhajan Lals granddaughters marriage. But one wonders whether these overtures on the part of the government will help break the deadlock that prevails at the moment.                            
	 Ever since the cover was blown off the Niira Radia tapes, politicians have become wary of serious discussions over the telephone. But this, some would say, has come as a blessing. These days, the netas have been doing all the listening, and not the talking, for a change.      
	Footnote
                  
	 Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a member of the Rajya Sabha, has earned a new epithet for himself  that of a letter warrior. In his latest missive, Chandrasekhar had questioned Ratan Tatas righteous indignation over the 2G spectrum scandal. Earlier, Chandrasekhar had taken on another industrialist over a different telecom tangle. After a round of open letters, his rival had called for truce and invited the triumphant Chandrasekhar for a drink in the medias presence. Chandrasekhar has also been credited with sending dispatches to the prime minister and the defence minister concerning other issues.      
	But critics seem to think that Tatas seven-page retort has shown that on this occasion, Chandrasekhar seems to have met his match in this battle of letters.

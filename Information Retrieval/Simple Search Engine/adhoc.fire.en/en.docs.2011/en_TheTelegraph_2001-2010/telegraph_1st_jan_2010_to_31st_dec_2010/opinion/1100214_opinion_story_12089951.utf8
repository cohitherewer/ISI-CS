	Stick over carrot                  
	Sir  The debate over captaincy in the Indian hockey team is unwarranted (Captaincy issue not over yet, Feb 8). The selection panel and the coach are qualified enough to choose the captain. There seems to be a lack of discipline in the team. Earlier, the players had gone on strike over pay packages. This time, some team members have challenged the selectors decision to nominate Rajpal Singh, and not Prabhjot Singh, as the skipper. Stringent action should be taken against these unruly players to avoid such hassles in future.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Historys loss   
	Sir  It is a matter of shame that India has allowed the ancient language, Bo, to die in the Andaman Islands. Boa Senior, the last surviving member of the Bo tribe, died recently. With her death, the Bo language has now become extinct (With Boa die tribe and tongue, Feb 5). This, however, was bound to happen, given the linguistic imperialism that prevails in this apparently democratic country.          
	India sanctioned Rs 36 crore last year to promote Hindi  an amount that was much bigger than the sums allocated for the promotion of all other Indian languages. When the concerned authorities disregard even popular languages like Bengali, Tamil, Gujarati and Punjabi, how can one expect that they will take measures to preserve marginal languages like Bo in the face of such linguistic and cultural chauvinism?          
	The least the authorities could have done was record the Bo language with the help of its last speaker before she died. With the loss of a language, we not only lose information about an entire society and its culture, but also a storehouse of indigenous wisdom.          
	It is time the authorities took a queue from this unfortunate incident and made a genuine effort to rescue dying languages and cultures. It is important to ensure that the diversity of Indian languages is preserved for posterity. It is equally important to undertake measures that would help all languages to be treated equally. Otherwise, the spirit of democracy in the country will suffer.           
	The media should also wake up to this issue and protest against the linguistic hegemony that exists in Indian society today.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Throughout history, languages and dialects have evolved, prospered and then vanished. History is replete with such instances. Be it the ancient scripts of Mohenjodaro and Harappa, the hieroglyphics of Egypt, the Rongorongo script of the Easter Islands or the writings of Aztec and Mayan civilizations  several ancient dialects have got lost in the course of the march of civilization. Many other languages existed without a written script, which is why very little is known about them. In the early ages, the rise and fall of languages corresponded to the rise and fall of empires.          
	Most of us know these facts from text books. But when we are informed about the demise of a language in the form of a touching, humane story, it affects us emotionally. The passing away of Boa Senior is such a story, and the implications of her death would take some time to sink in. With her death, the history of the making of the Bo tribe and its culture has been lost forever. The extinction of the Bo language is also an instance of how languages die when isolated ethnic groups open up to the outer world and to other cultures. Perhaps this is the price we have to pay for a globalized world.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Death trap                  
	 Sir  The accident Mamata Banerjee met with on NH 6 while returning from Lalgarh is regrettable (Riddle: to thank or to target Gurjar, Aug 11). Yet I hope that this incident will serve a purpose by exposing the lawlessness that prevails on our highways, which are but corridors of death. The sight of trucks, buses and cars speeding down the wrong lane is common. What is more appalling is the audacity of the drivers who, when challenged, turn abusive. Their impudence is abetted by the unconcern of the police on patrol.  
	Yours faithfully,         Dhrubo Mukerjee, Calcutta
        
	Stuck in a rut          
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is likely to destroy the traditional values and high standards of Presidency College by buckling under pressure from Alimuddin Street (Party packs Presidency VC panel, Aug 3). The principle of putting the party before everything else in educational institutions in West Bengal, introduced by the late Anil Biswas, has been well followed. One would have expected Bhattacharjee to rise above this line and treat his own college differently.           
	The three members of the panel that is to appoint the new vice-chancellor seem to have been chosen because of their strong attachment to Alimuddin Street, even though their academic credentials may be beyond doubt. The fact remains that there were many other equally or better qualified academics who could have been chosen for the task.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta                    
	Sir Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is said to have appointed Amiya Kumar Bagchi, Sankar K. Pal and P.N. Ghosh, all with strong Marxist leanings, to choose the first vice-chancellor of Presidency University. This will come as a blow to all past and present students of the college who expected the Presidency University Act to minimize government interference in the university. But there were always worries in this regard, and the worst fears seem to have come true.          
	The selection panel should have had truly apolitical, famed academicians to lend transparency to the selection procedure. That is not to be, and so the institutions return to excellence is likely to be in jeopardy.           
	The chief ministers efforts to undo three decades worth of damage to education in West Bengal will certainly be foiled for a while. It can be expected that most of the names sent to the governor for approval by the current panel will consist of those who bear allegiance to the present government. It will be disappointing if this results in a biased vice-chancellor.          
	Yours faithfully,        Adhip Kumar Bose,Calcutta                              
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The recent remark made by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief, Raj Thackeray, blaming migrants for the spread of malaria in Mumbai, is ludicrous and unethical. His explanation for the outbreak is not a scientific one; it makes a mockery of a very serious issue. Is he trying to say that mosquitoes are selective about whom they bite? The plight of Mumbai residents owing to malaria is unfortunate, but Thackeray has accused government hospitals of only treating migrants to the exclusion of local people. The problems the people are facing should be attributed to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. Action has to be taken to contain malaria and against Thackeray as well for making such irresponsible statements.                     
	Yours faithfully,        Farzana Nigar,Doranda, Ranchi

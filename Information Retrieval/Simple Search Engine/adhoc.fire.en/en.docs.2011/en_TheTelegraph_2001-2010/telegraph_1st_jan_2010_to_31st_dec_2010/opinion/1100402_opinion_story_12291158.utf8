	All play and no work                
	Love, a rather bad idea: All it gives is a lousy hangover (Srishti, Rs 100) by Anirban Mukherjee is set at a time when Delhis IITians take a break from their dour routine of lectures and examinations. September  the month in which the campus holds its annual cultural event  brings with it the promise of unbridled revelry as the students busy themselves with rock concerts, debates and even steamy, amorous exchanges. Thus, for Samar and his friends, life during September justifiably resembles a colourful graffiti. But things soon take a turn for the grey when Samar decides to contest the student-body elections. Suddenly, friends change colour, and Samar finds himself on his own, confronting difficult choices. Worse, he realizes that even his most gifted teachers have not prepared him for what was to follow. Mukherjees portrayal of life on the campus is a tad kitschy and the flimsy plot comes as a disappointment.                                  
	Adrift: A junket Junkie in Europe (Frog, Rs 150) by Puneetinder Kaur Sidhu is an attempt to portray the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of an evereffervescent Europe with punch and panache. Sidhu comes across as a passionate writer and an unpretentious individual. Here, she admits that she is not on some spiritual quest, neither is she on a journey of self-discovery. Her sojourn begins with the accidental discovery of an unutilized air ticket that sets her off on a trip during which she discovers the many joys that Europe has to offer  a surprise Goa party thrown by Indophiles in Germany, a legally-purchased joint in Holland, the sheer beauty of Vienna, picnics on the Hampstead Heath and so on. Sidhus book is pacey and humourous, but it lacks the analytical richness and contemplative quality that inform the works of accomplished travel-writers like Pico Iyer.                        
	 Daydreams at work: wake up your creative powers (Macmillan, Rs 265) by Amy Fries will shock all those who believe daydreaming to be a wasteful exercise. Fries utilizes her extensive research and interviews with a wide array of people, including psychologists and entrepreneurs, to prove that daydreaming is beneficial, and is also linked to creativity. The sensational claim notwithstanding, Friess dry-as-a-bone analysis may put readers to sleep.

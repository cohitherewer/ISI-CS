	There is no better leveller in politics than what, for lack of a better term, can be described as the system. Once a person enters the system and works to make it function more efficiently, he is forced to drop many of his extreme ideas. The system thus makes an efficient minister out of a rabble-rouser. Yesterdays apparent critic of private investment becomes its champion. The most recent example of this is Mamata Banerjee, the supremo of the Trinamul Congress, who in West Bengal ran the campaign against the small-car project of the Tatas. The withdrawal of that project from West Bengal earned her an anti-industry image. As she sees herself as West Bengals chief minister-in-waiting, she can ill afford to have this image. Thus, as the Union railways minister, she is working hard to rid herself of this image and label. One important step that she has taken in this context is the announcement that the railways ministry is open to accepting private investments to finance the laying of tracks. It will be simplistic, however, to see this decision as only a function of Ms Banerjees image-building exercise. Ms Banerjees favourable turn towards private investment must be located in her recognition that to run her ministry efficiently, the demands and compulsions of the system must prevail over ideology.        
	A similar point could be made about the party against whom Ms Banerjee rails, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). It is obvious how far the CPI(M) has moved during its long tenure in office in West Bengal from its original anti-capital ideology to its present investor-friendly position. There was a realization here, however late, that to rule West Bengal credibly and competently it is necessary to forsake ideology and to adopt more flexible attitudes. The Bharatiya Janata Party went through a comparable experience once it came to power at the head of the National Democratic Alliance. Following the same logic in the reverse direction, it can be argued that a party like the Shiv Sena continues on its irresponsible and extreme path because it is yet to be tamed by the system. The demands of effective governance impose different priorities on people. A rejection of those priorities often means stepping out of the system, which is a heavy price to pay for a politician or a political party.

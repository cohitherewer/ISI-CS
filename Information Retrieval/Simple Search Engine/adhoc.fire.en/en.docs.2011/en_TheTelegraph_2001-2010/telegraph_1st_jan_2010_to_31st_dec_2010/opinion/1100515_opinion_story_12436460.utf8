	Each classical dance form has a rich technique and a strict format designed by the maestros. Yet the possibility to experiment and innovate is always there. The balance between grammar and imagination depends on proper training in the classical style, which is the basis of creativity. Padatik Dance Centre proved this in its annual Kathak show at Gyan Manch on April 3. The programme featured junior and senior students, guided by Madhumita Roy, Sandip Mullick, Souvik Chakraborty and Nilanjana Sengupta.        
	The evening began with a Krishna bhajan in Raga Kalavati by the students, guided by Kakoli Chatterjee. Angikam, choreographed by Madhumita, was based on a slokam angikam bhushanam yasya. The dancers performed this Shivastuti with grace. Mixing Kathak with Flamenco was a good attempt  rhythmic footsteps aptly blended as the dancers proved their taiyaari. The most entertaining item came from Souvik, as he juggled Taal Tarang with improvized bol patterns in teentaal. The magic of the calculation was enjoyable, as were the crisp chakkars and clear footwork. It was followed by abhinaya based on the thumri, Chayan nahi aaye. The youngest students showed enthusiasm in the Vaidic chants. In Nilanjanas theme, Spring, the dancers painted a colourful canvas in Vasant.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DIVINE MOMENT                                                                  
	Six decades ago, amidst strife and bloodshed, this country was divided on religious grounds. Millions were butchered. To call it a massacre would be to diminish the horror. I would often rummage through envelopes in my fathers study, where my mother had hidden photographs of little hills of dead bodies piled up like meat to auction in lots. Hill after hill of corpses from slaughter in the Punjab.         
	No matter how politically incorrect it might sound, it has always been easier to provoke Muslims to react to religious causes and be converted into fearless fanatics willing to die for their cause, than followers of any other faith. It is a quality that has been exploited for as long as I can remember, right to this very day, not just in India but around the world. Add to this the stupid semantics of an egotistical Home Minister who conjures up palatable phrases like  saffron terror and you have grounds for the spread of full-blown malice, mayhem and blood-curdling hatred. It has to stop. Perhaps it will, now.         
	What makes the recent high court judgment significant and truly Indian, holistic and vedantic, is that it respects life, humanity, faith and a harmonious co-existence of peoples and communities. It takes India from darkness to light  tamaso ma jyotirgamaya  and reveals an ultimate reality, from asatya to satya. Forty-seven years ago, instead of pussyfooting around stark realities and pandering to myopic politicians, India should have had a common civil code for all its citizens. We created differences from the word go and now look over our shoulders to blame someone else for the tragic fallout. Thousands of families mourn because we treated an innate problem simplistically. But today there can be a new beginning if we rationally and lovingly gather and strive to bring the Muslims and Hindus of India together as children of one motherland.         
	This is a divine moment, granted to us by fate, and we must grab the opportunity to bury our hate and prejudices. We must capitalize on this moment of history to embrace one another with a passion and caring that no one will ever be able to take away from us. Our bonding should be honest and firm so that no scheming deceivers have the courage to manipulate our trust and tear us apart again.         
	If you think Im being idealistic, sure, I am. What else should we be? Has fanatical pragmatism and the pursuit of economic power to conquer the world with wile and money got us anywhere? There can only be one truth and it is that we are all children of divine providence, brothers and sisters one and all, with no right to divide humanity into colours and ethnicities and claim the superiority of one race, culture or belief over another.         
	With this judgment, I hope that all our so-called secularist hotshots will shut up once and for all. I am talking about those who appear tirelessly and repeatedly on television as experts on topics as diverse as homosexuality, air traffic control and the rising cost of onions, while our peasants slave, starve and commit suicide, our brethren lie with street dogs, uncared for in puddles of urine in filthy hospital corridors, and our women still burn in backward communities, and die of social torture. All this while we analyse the pros and cons of slumdogs and corrupt politicians, game managers, and crickets bookmakers and fixers  all spawned in India. The Made in India tag is beginning to smell foul.         
	And, while the nation is in the process of puking over expenditures in Delhi, in a land of homeless and hapless Hari jans, our political warlords and this stinking government are about to reap more benefits and make more money by dividing us into castes. Putting labels of disgrace on all of us, like the Nazis did to the Jews, at a time in history when we must fight to remove all such stigmas from a society already burdened with brahminic superstitions and mind-bending ideologies. If we can settle the issue of Ayodhya as philosophically as we have,we must also banish the caste system with the same firmness of purpose and launch a mass non-cooperation movement to prevent the new census from perpetuating what must be wiped out once and for all.        
	When the census workers turn up, I recommend we all put down harijan  as we surely are. But the fact is, the Hindu-Muslim bhai bhai emotion will take some time to sink into our ravaged, polluted psyches. We have looked at one another with suspicion and disrespect for a long time. But our children are not being born into the prejudices we grew up with, so it would really be disgraceful if we opened their eyes to differences that should be buried forever.         
	In time, Ayodhya will haunt us like a myth. Different stories will be told of what once happened there. Some tales will frighten us, some amaze and some appal. But thats what stories are for.         
	I pray that Ayodhya becomes the burial ground of hatred. Let us now, on this once-ruddy land, sow seeds of love, peace and harmony that generations hereafter will feed and prosper on. And let the once-bloodied waters of the Saryu sparkle anew and flow into our hearts and lands to bring fulfilment. And I pray that Ayodhya becomes a pilgrimage glorifying those who united amidst disunity, spread hope where there was hopelessness, and made the journey from intellectual and spiritual darkness to enlightenment, from senseless death to eternal peace  amritamgamaya. May the rainbows of promises rest eternally on our shoulders. Let everything we get befit this sacred motherland of ours: India  Hindustan.         
	Then I was standing on the highest mountain of them all, and round about beneath me was the whole hoop of the world. And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and I understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must live together like one being. These were the words of Black Elk. And they called him an Indian.

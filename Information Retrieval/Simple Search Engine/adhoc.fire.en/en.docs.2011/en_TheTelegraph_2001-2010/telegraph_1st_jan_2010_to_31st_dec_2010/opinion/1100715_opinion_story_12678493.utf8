The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Life and death under the arc lights
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LIFE AND DEATH UNDER THE ARC LIGHTS                                  DARK HABITS      Why do the media get all excited over the suicides of fashion models?                                                  
	The suicide of the model, Viveka Babajee, late last month, has evoked a predictable response in the media. It has given newspapers and television channels the opportunity to launch into a familiar lament  that theres a dark side to the world of glamour and untold pitfalls in a life under the arc lights. And now that another former model, Natasha Padbidri, has committed suicide, the din is bound to get louder.        
	It was no different when Geetanjali Nagpal, once a successful model, was found begging and bedraggled on the streets of Delhi in 2007. Or when Nafisa Joseph, an ex-model and MTV anchor, hanged herself in 2004. On each occasion, the media came up with a flurry of stories to show that, for all its glitz and glamour, the world of high fashion could chew you up and throw you out as a psychological wreck. Indeed, every time a model commits suicide, the incident is held up almost as a cautionary tale, as if to say that the lives of those exotic creatures of the catwalk are unstable in the extreme and fame on the ramp can exact a heavy price.        
	One wonders why this is so. For if we take the number of suicides to be an index of the vulnerability of a social class, then lots of other groups appear to be at a much greater risk than models and hence ought to attract much more hand-wringing on the part of the media.        
	Take housewives, for example. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, one out of every five suicides in the country was committed by a housewife in 2008, the latest year for which data are available. Also, housewives accounted for 54.8 per cent of the total number of suicides by women that year. Yet one does not see the media getting exercised over the fragility of the profession of a full-time wife and mother, or the helplessness and desperation that often drive her to take her own life.         
	One reason for that is the fact that housewives are faceless non-entities. As indeed are countless other despairing souls  the unemployed, the bankrupt, the frustrated in love, the manic misfit  who opt out of this world daily. Their lives and deaths do not make good copy. But models, even down-at-heel former models, are near celebrities. As any media hand will tell you, people are interested in their stories.         
	Fair enough. But surely harping on the seamy side of glamour in the wake of a models suicide does more than just slake our curiosity about how and why she died. For no matter what the apparent reason for their deaths  both Babajee and Joseph seemed to have been depressed about failed love relationships  theres always an insidious attempt to suggest that their lives came apart because of their lifestyle and the pressures of the modelling world.        
	Its an attractive proposition all right, since it plays on our desire to see the downside of life in the fast lane. If the vast majority of us will not achieve fame, then its nice to know that fame has a sordid underpinning. And since movie stars no longer carry the stain of social disapproval, who better than fashion models, those quasi celebs who supposedly thrive on ecstasy and easy virtue, to illustrate that point?        
	Such an attitude is shockingly prejudicial to the modelling industry. Not only because it implies a moral judgment, but also because it ignores the fact that most models tackle the stresses and strains of their high-visibility jobs without careening towards self-destruction. And the sooner members of the media realize this the better.

	About eight months ago, I was visiting an old friend in San Francisco, and for reasons I couldnt then explain, I found myself betting him and his son $100 each that the Democrats would lose their majority in both Houses of the Congress in the US mid-term elections this November. It seemed like easy money to them then  surely the Democrats wouldnt lose the Senate  but I think they are going to owe me $200.        
	Much is being made of this in the media at the moment: how disappointed Barack Obamas former supporters are, how mobilized the Republican base is, how extremely hostile to him the new Republican-controlled House and Senate will be. How can Obama be so calm about this? Why doesnt he get out there and fight?        
	Well, he has made a few fairly fiery speeches recently, but basically he knows that speeches wont do much good. His supporters are disappointed because it has been a long, grim recession, and for most Americans, it is still not over. Obama couldnt get another economic stimulus bill through the Congress at this point even if he thought it was a good idea. So he cant hurry the recovery up.        
	Some of the people who voted Democratic in 2008 are also very cross because Obama hasnt brought American troops home from Afghanistan, or hasnt got any legislation about climate change through the Congress. The Democrats lack all conviction, while the Republican base is filled with passionate intensity. Obamas approval rating of 44 per cent is not especially low for a president of the United States of America two years into his first term Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were considerably lower at this point in their presidencies  but most of his supporters wont bother to vote in this election, while almost all his enemies will.                
	Credible scenario        
	If you really believe that your country has been hijacked by a Muslim communist who was born in Kenya, then you will certainly get out and vote. If all of the retired white people vote, and only the usual mid-term proportion of all the other demographics does, then the Democrats will lose both Houses of the Congress. So why isnt Obama worried about it?        
	He will certainly regret that so many long-serving Democratic Senators and Congressmen are going to lose their seats this autumn, but it really does not matter much to him who controls the Congress for the next two years. The US has not yet gone through the painful debate about how to tame the deficit that has already happened in most European countries. But it will have to do so soon. That poses a particular problem for the Republicans. If they do not raise taxes on the rich or cut defence spending, then they have to support brutal cuts in healthcare and pensions or lose all credibility as deficit-cutters.        
	But cutting entitlements would alienate the Republicans own most important demographic: older white people. They will not risk that. By contrast, the Democrats would not be alienating their own base if they cut defence spending and raise taxes on the rich. So they can be coherent and consistent on the topic. A Republican-controlled Congress may well come to be seen as an obstacle to fiscal responsibility even by many Republicans.        
	Make the further, quite reasonable assumptions that the US economy will be growing strongly again by 2012, and that US troops will be on their way out of Afghanistan, and you have a credible scenario in which the Democrats win back both Houses of the Congress and re-elect Obama. Meanwhile, Obama can veto any Republican attempt to repeal the legislation he has already got through the Congress, and he will retain a free hand in foreign affairs. He could even try to get new legislation on immigration through the Congress: it wouldnt pass, but he could thereby lock up the Latino vote. No wonder he looks calm.

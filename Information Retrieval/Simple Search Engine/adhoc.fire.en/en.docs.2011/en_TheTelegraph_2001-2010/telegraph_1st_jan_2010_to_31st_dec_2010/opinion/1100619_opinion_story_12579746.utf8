The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Reinventing Calcutta 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        REINVENTING CALCUTTA                                                           
	There was a time when outsiders debunked Calcutta as a lost city. The citys very own communists cried foul when Jawaharlal Nehru called it a city of processions and when, decades later, Rajiv Gandhi dismissed it as a  dying city. But for many years now, Calcutta has inspired little but self-loathing among its own inhabitants. It must be a very dismal state of affairs for a city when its own residents consider it a shame to live there. Calcutta has come to represent all that is wrong in metropolitan life. Given the quality of its air or water, the filth on its roads or the utter lawlessness of its vehicular traffic, a healthy and dignified civic life has become almost impossible in Calcutta. No tears need, therefore, be shed for the exit of the Left-ruled civic board. In fact, the change of guard at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters could be a time of hope even for long-despairing Calcuttans.         
	Changing Calcutta is not so much a matter of financial resources as of a new vision and determination. The civic boards revenue may still be much smaller than that of Mumbai or New Delhi. But financial help from organizations such as the Asian Development Bank and projects such as the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission has now made a big difference to the resources available with the CMC. For all its faults, the outgoing Left-ruled board too expanded the sources of tax revenue. What it lacked, however, are a vision for a renewal of the city and a work culture to bring about qualitative change. And the biggest hurdle to those was a political approach to civic management. The new mayor, Sovan Chatterjee, has been a councillor long enough to know why the CMC is such a miserable performer.         
	It may be unrealistic to expect that the new Trinamul Congress-run board would keep partisan politics out of its strategies for remaking Calcutta. Nothing much may change if Mr Chatterjees energies are spent merely on trying to score political points against his leftist rivals. With the elections over, he must leave all the hot air of the poll campaign behind him and get on to real business. Involving experts in urban planning and management could be a useful strategy for him. He could take a leaf out of the book of what Pittsburgh, the American city once famous for its steel industry, did in order to reinvent itself. The decline of the steel industry left the city tottering on the brink of an economic and civic collapse. In an ambitious strategy to revive the city, its administrators formed a panel comprising a wide variety of experts and finalized the Pittsburgh Pledge. The success of the venture made it something of a model for the rejuvenation of a city in decline. Only drastically big measures can unleash the process necessary for Calcuttas renewal. Mindless populism should have no place in that vision of reconstruction.

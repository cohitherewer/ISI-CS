The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A certain standpoint
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A CERTAIN STANDPOINT                                                                        
	Remembered   Childhood: Essays in honour of Andr Eacute; B Eacute;teille																														 Edited by Malavika   Karlekar and Rudrangshu Mukherjee,   Oxford, Rs 595
    
	No review could improve on the masterly Introduction to this collection of essays in honour of Andr Bteille. But since the editors, Malavika Karlekar and Rudrangshu Mukherjee, are also the anthologys onlie begetters, they understandably dwell only on its strong points.   
	To the lay reader, a Festschrift is like a superior private joke. The Introductions use of first names heightens that impression. This reviewer knows Bteille as a perceptive commentator on aspects of contemporary life. But he is much more to the 12 contributors whose essays were inspired by his My Two Grandmothers, whose unique genetic and cultural mix few can match. Even if Jan Breman and Veena Das are the only two actually to name Bteille, the others acquire legitimacy from his aura. Despite this dependence, it should be possible for a Festschrift to claim a valid identity of its own, based on the standing of the writers and the quality of their work. It was surprising, therefore, to find here a common misuse of the word fascination that I had constantly to grapple with in my editing days.         
	The main interest for this reader being historical rather than literary, such infelicities can be overlooked. The shadow of national and international events, caste and class, race and religion, family dynamics and colonial complexes brings the expositions to life. Since they also reflect what Bteille calls a certain standpoint, no reader can agree with all postulations and conclusions. But that is no bar to sharing the obvious pleasure with which the writers summon up the remembrance of things past, or to recognizing each essay as a brick in the edifice of our social history.        
	Aparna Basu is especially relevant from this angle because she walked among the great, but Tapan Raychaudhuris reminiscences are no less enjoyable for portraying life at the grass roots. Karlekar and Pradip Kumar Bose present two sides of the same Bengali in partibus infidelium coin, each scarcely aware of the others milieu. The points at which Karlekars Bengali society of bungalows, bageechas (never bagans!) and babalog touch Boses Delhi Bengalis in quarters, and the nature of such contact, would reveal volumes about social stratification. The essays tempt readers to read between the lines, connect with situations and events that are not mentioned and guess at the reason for the not-so-subtle sniggering about Karlekars brother-in-laws father and his family. The writer assumes that ones world is the world; the readers imagination can expand it into the world.         
	As T.N. Madan says shrewdly, childhood is made up as much of what is imagined as it is of what actually happens. It is also what one chooses to remember and project, like Gopalkrishna Gandhis delicate initiation into sex and Susan Visvanathans haunting loneliness. In portraying the straitened circumstances of their youth, Gurcharan Das and Breman may be saying something about their present.         
	The child is father of the man and like many adults, the young Basu saw no inconsistency in her mothers refusal to let her join the Girl Guides because it entailed saluting the British monarch, though the family took pride in its East India Company connections and knighthoods. Alan Macfarlane must know he was sent back to England before India could taint his accent, and surely the young Mukherjee heard many disparaging references to Clifford Hicks being Anglo-Indian. Some recollections reinforce the view that sociologists are better at analysing other peoples reminiscences than recounting their own. Others, like Bremans application of the Indian Class IV classification to his Dutch father, suggest that globalization need not mean only the creeping West, as in the Introductions attribution of traditional Indian prudishness to Victorian values.         
	Returning to the Festschrift, a lay reader will raise academic hackles by suggesting that while the concept of honouring eminence with the literary equivalent of a silver salver is laudable, the invention can lead to excesses. Jagdish Bhagwati can claim like Clive to be astonished at the moderation of only six Festschriften in several countries as well as Festschrift conferences and galas since Joseph Vogt, the German (what else?) classical historian, was honoured with 89 volumes. The series was stopped before it ended. Perhaps it is marching through the ether as webfestschrift.        
	One feels that the gentle and retiring Bteille would find such embarras de richesses rather overpowering.                     
	Rudrangshu Mukherjee is the editor, editorial pages, The Telegraph.              SUNANDA K. DATTA-RAY

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GREAT EXPECTATIONS                          - Old Bihar has yielded place to new Bihar        N.K. Singh                                                          
	Five days ago Nitish Kumar assumed office for the second term as the chief minister of Bihar. The five years which went by altered the economic and social landscape of Bihar. Public memory is short. We, however, recall that Bihars politics then had scarcely crawled out of feudal, agrarian, caste-based loyalties with deep sectarian divides. Economically it ranked without fail at the bottom of the growth pyramid. The great burst of Indias new momentum had passed this large populous landmass by. Even within the poor performing eastern India, it lagged behind the rest of its neighbouring provinces. So, in this broader sense, the tectonic changes over the last five years represent two distinct characteristics.        
	First, the malleability of a stratified society. While it is premature to write the obituary of caste, class and sectarian divides, the old order of identity politics has distinctly changed in the quest for a better life and in the context of visible signs of development. It is easy to describe the recent election as development replacing caste identities. In a sense, Nitish Kumars victory achieves a clever symmetry between social and economic engineering. Caste and class divisions are not homogeneous entities. There are inherent contradictions within these groups in which the less advantaged are exploited within the hierarchy and welcome a more inclusive growth through active State intervention. The empowerment of women, minorities and Mahadalits is part of the same process. Notwithstanding Nitish Kumars somewhat socialistic orientation, he has combined State interventions with the test of market forces. Old Bihar has yielded place to New Bihar.              
	Second, improved governance and tangible development gains have enabled Bihar to join the mainstream of Indian aspiration. These are aspirations for better infrastructure, health and education, to mention a few. They inject optimism for a better future and unleash the micro entrepreneurial zest in individual lives. The congregation of millions of micro decisions alters the macro picture. A stratified society suddenly becomes aspirational and grasps the new order.        
	As I watched the enthusiastic cheer and acclaim of the vast multitude of people in Gandhi Maidan, Patna, during the oath-taking ceremony of Nitish Kumar, one was overawed by the rising tide of expectations. Managing aspirations and, more so, expectations, is no easy brainer. Time runs out fast. Nitish has limitations of resources, inbuilt implementational and institutional handicaps to guarantee preferred outcomes.        
	So what are the key challenges which confront the new government?        
	First and foremost, the continuation of the same policies. Namely, policies designed to guarantee peace and security of life and property. Allowing individuals to pursue their lives with freedom from fear and a development matrix whose tangible gains are visible in multiple ways. However, strengthening the law and order machinery, undertaking administrative reforms, completing the ambitious roads programme with credible maintenance systems, improving educational outcomes and fully fructifying the health initiatives are part of the same set of policies. So the first priority must be to complete the daunting unfinished agenda on initiatives which have commenced.        
	Second, it is now well recognized that the growth impetus substantially emanated from enhanced public outlays raising the size of the plan from Rs 3,100 crore in 2004 to Rs 21,000 crore last year. This also entailed a sevenfold increase in plan expenditure that was financed mainly through mandatory devolution from the Central government and improved tax buoyancy with the borrowing programme being kept within the targets stipulated in the fiscal management act. There are limits beyond which public outlays cannot be enhanced. Enticing private flows to supplement public expenditure needs an innovative approach. Private flows need not come through large investments or capital-intensive projects. Given comparative factor advantages, downstream development in micro, small and medium industries  say, in the agro and agro-processing sectors  will result in value-added activity and create gainful employment. My tours in Bihar persuade me of the enormous scope in agro processing, say, for banana, sugarcane, potato, brinjal, and other fruits and vegetables, along with dairy, encompassing rainbow agriculture. Many countries in the world have become prosperous by mere downstream development of the agro processing industry. These have low-energy intensity, yield quicker results and create gainful employment. The same is true of the services sector in health and education. A focus on vocational and skill development programmes has multiple benefits. It will also improve the nature of migration, moving away from mechanical jobs to value-added activities and enhance remittance flows.               
	Third, the per capita energy consumption in Bihar is perhaps one of the lowest. Seeking moderate energy security needs improved generation capacity and reforms in transmission and distribution systems. While distributional improvements are tangible, endemic power supply shortages need to be overcome. The Central government must take a more rational view by according coal linkages to credible outstanding generation proposals both from public and private sectors. Fresh approaches are needed on power purchase agreements to garner surplus power from generation elsewhere, both from ongoing Central power investments and by revisiting earlier arrangements.         
	Fourth, agriculture, which is the backbone of the state economy, has to be rehauled. While agriculture has shown progress, a fuller implementation of the agricultural action plan prepared by the state  by way of the seed replacement programme, optimal use of fertilizers, encouragement of allied agricultural activity to improve farm incomes  can result in doubling agricultural productivity. Finally, strengthening and streamlining the efficacy of the public delivery system is central to the success of all anti-poverty programmes.        
	In Charles Dickenss Great Expectations, conscience is described as a dreadful thing. And beyond conscience, the enhanced consciousness of the Biharis has ushered in irreversible changes. Who can afford to disappoint them?

	Q: Our mother died intestate and our brother had her land mutated in his name, depriving us of our one-third share. We fought for restoration of our rights and won the case. My sister and I are senior citizens and live in Calcutta while the piece of land in question is in Madhya Pradesh. We learnt recently that our brother has received a remand on the case and that he has had the land records changed showing him to be the sole owner of the land. What should we do?        
	Gaytari Chopra, Calcutta        
	A: You have to first ascertain whether your brother has filed an appeal against the case won by you and if so, whether you still stand a chance to challenge it. If an ex parte judgment has been passed in his favour, try settling the same aside. Take the help of a competent advocate. However, if no such appeal has been filed, you could lodge a complaint against him in the police station and the land records office, making him liable for fraudulent misrepresentation.        
	Q:I am a teacher in a government-aided school and have a public provident fund (PPF) account. My wife runs a coaching centre. She has her own PAN number and a separate IT file. Can she open a PPF account in her name?        
	Pravash Dutta, via email        
	A: Yes, your wife should be able to open a PPF account in her name. But it is the appropriate bank authorities who would be able to guide her better in this regard.        
	Q: I purchased a piece of land under the jurisdiction of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation in 1975 and built a three-storeyed house there. The property was duly mutated in my name. Subsequently, I sold the ground floor. Recently, I approached a bank for mortgage of the property. After scrutiny, the bank turned down my request, saying that I did not have a clear title to the property. Do I really lose my title to the property by selling just the ground floor?        
	Subrata Kumar Sil, Calcutta        
	A: No, your title to the top two floors, still owned by you, remains. You could apply for a separate mutation with respect to the two flats owned by you on the top two floors, setting the municipal corporation records right.

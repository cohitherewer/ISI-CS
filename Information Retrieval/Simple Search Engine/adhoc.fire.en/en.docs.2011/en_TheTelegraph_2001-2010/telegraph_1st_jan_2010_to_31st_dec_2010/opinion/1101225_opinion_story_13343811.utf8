                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OPENING DOORS                                  VISUAL ARTS: Bhaswati Chakravorty                                                                  
	Rabindranath Tagore is always so much fun because he keeps opening new doors  in all directions. The trick is to find the right key each time. While curating the exhibition, Illustrating Rabindranath  put up under the auspices of the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre at the Gaganendra Pradarshashala from December 3 to 9  Abhik Kumar Dey undoubtedly had the right key. Exhibiting a representative collection of illustrations of the poets various works, by himself as well as by numerous others, would have meant a painstaking task of research, documentation and selection, one that was executed with imagination and flair. Distributed along the walls of two floors, the display had a double logic. It sought to record the evolution of creative illustration in the history of the book in Bengal on the one hand, while displaying, on the other, the remarkable variety in the illustrations of Tagores works, especially during his lifetime, that gave birth to a unique world of art. In this, as in so many other spheres, the poet had an inaugural role.         
	A few examples of early Bengali illustration, from engravings in wood or metal, meant to fill the pages and attract readers, started off the exhibition. They included, for example, an 1816 picture from the Annadamangal, by Gangakishore Bhattacharya, and manuscript illustration from the Shahnama, produced in Murshidabad in the 18th century. These flowed smoothly into the more artistically inclined block-printed illustrations and lithographs of the mid-19th century, and reproductions of pictures that Tagore himself recalled from his childhood. Among these were a page from Irish Melodies, Gustave Dors haunting illustrations for the Poems of Tennyson that the young Tagore discovered in his older brothers desk, and a picture of narwhal-hunting from Rajendralal Mitras monthly Bibidhartha Sangraha that he used to pore over on empty afternoons.        
	Harish Chandra Haldar first illustrated a Tagore poem in an 1885 number of Balak. It is not as though all the exhibits are unfamiliar, but the context compels the viewer to look at all of them afresh. The point of the exhibitions build-up of the first engravings, pictures and Western illustrations is felt most strongly in this early phase. Some illustrations are truly rare, suggesting the fertilizing influence of the West, as the one of Kalmrigaya, again by Haldar, with the old king looking like Merlin, or a figure out of Blake, and his son like a fleeing nymph (right).         
	Through unknown early illustrators as well as known  and loved  ones, such as Sukumar Roy (bottom left) and Sukhalata Rao, the viewer gradually enters a busy universe of restless, swirling creativity, where the poet encourages young artists, first Abanindranath Tagore and then Nandalal Bose, to draw for him. It is like an explosion of excitement that grows with the burgeoning of the Bengal School and prompts independent artists, including some from the family, such as Sunayani Devi, to illustrate poems, plays and novels exactly as the inspiration catches them. Gaganendranath Tagores unique style enriches Raktakarabi (bottom), while his unforgettable illustrations in the poets Jeevansmriti resonate with the combined childhood memories of both writer and illustrator.         
	Inevitably, Abanindranath and Nandalal dominate the scene, although numerous others, including later artists such as Benode Behari Mukhopadhyay, and Western illustrators of translated works, join in this creative festival. Even the viewer is touched by this fervour and delight from long ago; the precise captions  unfortunately mostly in Bengali with the thoughtful arrangement and excellent reproductions help create an echo of all the concentration and excitement. Paintings and sketches by various artists for Gitanjali and Fruit Gathering or Bichitrita reveal the range of styles the poet could inspire, both in colour and in black-and-white. Blown up, Nandalals linocuts for Shahaj Path seem even more startling with their quality of clarity in dreamlike visualization. A heart-warming interlude is provided by a photograph of the poet earnestly discussing the illustrations of Chitrangada with the much younger, rather chubby, Abanindranath. In many ways, the photograph represents the essence of that creative moment. The Chitrangada illustrations were romantic, while the ones Abanindranath secretly sketched into Nadi later were abstract  dynamic but patterned. One of Abanindranaths funniest pictures was made for The Parrots Training (left).         
	The poet did not just ask others to illustrate for him; in an uncanny throwback to the Pre-Raphaelites, he himself would write poems on pictures, as he did on Nandalals. He is present as an artist too, not only through the covers and lettering he designed, but also through his manuscript deletions, a well known one being from Raktakarabi. But he seems most characteristically present in the slightly crazy illustrations for Shey and Khaapchhara  fantastic, sinister and often quite irresistibly funny. Their familial link with the peculiar linear illustration the poet made for his late rhyme, Galdachingri tingrimingri, that he called Abachetaner abadan (Contribution of the subconscious) is obvious. The achievement of the exhibition lay in its ability to let the viewer make connections at all levels and in all directions. It did open doors  into realms beyond pure information and visual delight.

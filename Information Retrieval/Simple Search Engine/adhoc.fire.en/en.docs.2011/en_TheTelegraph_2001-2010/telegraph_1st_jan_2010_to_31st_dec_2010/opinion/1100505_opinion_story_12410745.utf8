The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | jungle out there
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        JUNGLE OUT THERE                                                    
	To secure a driving licence in Calcutta, all one needs to do is sit back and relax. There is nothing surprising about this process. It is often said that Calcutta is the easiest Indian metropolis to live in. The city moves at a tardy pace, so living here is less of a struggle than in other Indian metros. Judging from its readiness to make things simpler for the citizens, it appears that the administration is quite smug about such a reputation. For instance, for a long time, the Left Front government adamantly refused to ban two-stroke autorickshaws and rickety buses, the main causes of air pollution, fearing that such a move would not only inconvenience commuters but also disturb its support base among the workers unions. So ancient smoke-belching vehicles, fed by a thriving black market in katatel (illegal fuel), plied the streets. Although public interest litigations, court rulings and media campaigns have almost managed to eradicate that menace, the streets of Calcutta cannot be trusted. It has always been a jungle out there. A recent expos by The Telegraph reveals what has always been widely suspected: that drivers in Calcutta are a privileged lot, thanks to a venal public vehicles department.        
	With one motor-vehicles inspector responsible for every two lakh registered vehicles, the possibility of carrying out a meaningful driving test becomes remote. What goes on in the name of a test, therefore, is a charade, in which examinees have to merely sit and watch the difficult art of driving to earn their right to take the wheel. Of course, driving licences can be had for much less trouble. A reasonable sum of money and a packet of cigarettes are good enough to buy this precious document, which actually signifies nothing. These ludicrous arrangements may be able to assuage the conscience of the PVD in some inscrutable way, but they certainly do not make the lives of pedestrians any safer. Calcutta is already notoriously prone to accidents. The promise of hundreds of amateur drivers taking over the roads augurs imminent disaster for the average citizen. In its desire to dispense with inconveniences, the administration is on the verge of turning the whole of Calcutta into a red-alert zone. But what is a little risk to public life so long as it simplifies the task of a criminally negligent administration?

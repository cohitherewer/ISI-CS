	Seagull Books is celebrating 28 years in publishing by putting up a largish exhibition on book design and covers titled The Art of the Book, Digital Collages by Sunandini Banerjee (upto July 17), reflecting the craft of making books at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre. The exhibition is mounted on both floors of the centre  whose walls have been painted a matt but rich red  and, along with the digital prints and Seagulls latest titles showing off the one-off dust covers, there are several pretty artefacts, such as a series of miniature tailors dummies, miniature heads of great Western classical music composers, beautiful enamel plates handpainted by Arunima Choudhury, a large mirror and several ceramic figures, along with Somnath Hores dissonant feral sculpture of curs on heat.        
	The single element that is common to all the rooms is publisher Naveen Kishores black-and-white photographs of the beautiful buildings, streets and squares of European cities like Paris, and many of London as well. These are taken in the best tradition of the classic style and could belong to any time in the century we have left behind or even the past decade, as these quarters are well preserved by the strict heritage laws of those countries.         
	Sunandini Banerjees digital prints are spin-offs from the covers she designed for Seagulls original titles, which can also be seen in the substantial and lavishly illustrated catalogue brought out on the occasion and meant for book fairs abroad, like the one in Frankfurt. Banerjee has the instincts of a thieving magpie and she has culled images and text from a myriad sources, although because of copyright reason, she has mostly confined herself to a botanical encyclopaedia, vintage posters and publicity material from the former Soviet Union freely available on the internet.         
	A lifetime of influences is reflected in her choice. She also had Naveen Kishores entire range of urban Europe photographs and bhashan detritus at her disposal, and this set the tone and look of this exhibition which, save the touches of Bollywood kitsch and the popular Battala prints, hardly ever reveals its Indian identity. No problem in this globalized world, except that collages  where disparate elements, such as well-shod skeletons of animals, images picked up at random from typical feel-good American advertisements and films of the 1950s and earlier, and signage thrown in and churned together, washing machine style  are so commonplace that they have long lost their wow factor.        
	However, Banerjee, a self-taught Photoshop artist, is in her element when she literally turns things on their head as in the art work for Tzvetan Todorovs On Memory as a Remedy for Evil, where she has caught the dummies of a human being, an aeroplane and a raven in a free fall, or the sickle moons with a headstock growing out of one on the Night Music cover. The simpler the design the more it conveys, as in The Silences of Hammerstein with its doodle of a head and the newspaper clipping, whereas the stack of gilded frames (the concept is nice though) on the cover of Sartres Portraits gobbles up the white space.         
	Seagull has brought out a booklet recording the conversations of the gilded youth of this publishing house with their mentor, with whom they scale the Olympian heights of High Culture. Ordinary mortals may feel like Philistines in the company of these beings with the rare gift of instant mastery of photography and design without any previous training. A whiff of ammonia is strongly recommended to wake them up and bring them down to earth.

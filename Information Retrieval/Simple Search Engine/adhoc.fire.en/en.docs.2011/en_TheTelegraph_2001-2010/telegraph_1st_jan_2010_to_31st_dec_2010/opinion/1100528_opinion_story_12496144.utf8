This religion was Jainism, which flourished in northeast India at least a generation before the Buddha. The principles of Jainism are embodied in its iconography. Its Jinas and Tirthankaras  the founders of the faith  always stand upright, for they are not swayed by human whims, carry no weapon, for they are freed from anger, and have no consort, for they have renounced sensual pleasures. VICTORIOUS ONES: JAIN IMAGES OF PERFECTION (Mapin, Rs 3,500) edited by Phyllis Granoff, with its 188 colour plates, provides ample evidence of the austere beauty of Jain art. Left is a marble statue of Rsabha, the first Jina, from Rajasthan. Top is an image of hell as found in a 17th-century manuscript. Bottom left is the Parsvanatha Temple in Rajasthan, while bottom right is the ayagapata (devotional plaque) in red sandstone from Mathura.

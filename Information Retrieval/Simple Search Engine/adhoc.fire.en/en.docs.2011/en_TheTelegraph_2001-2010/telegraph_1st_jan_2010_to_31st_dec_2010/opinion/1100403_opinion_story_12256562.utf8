	The relevance of a cultural expression that celebrates love and decries violence cannot be denied in the context of todays strained international relations and senseless aggression. Suchandas presentation of Prachi Pratichir Milanbelar Punthi at Max Mueller Bhavan recently, steeped as it was in the inclusive world vision of the German poet, Goethe, who advocated everlasting love above everything else, touched the right chords. The production, which had guru Surangama Dasgupta at its helm, chose to bridge gaps in both form and content.        
	The translation of Goethes immortal work, West-Easterly Divan, which was profoundly inspired by the lyrics of the Persian poet, Hafiz, provided the basis of a ballet that wove in several Indian dance forms. And so, what emerged was a union of the East and West in a seamless whole, with poetry and music complementing dance to make a case for international and inter-religious understanding.        
	Stories of love and separation such as those of Yusuf-Zulekha, Laila-Majnu, Shirin-Farhad were effectively used by the choreographer. The dancers brought the myths alive on stage and told the lovers tales, which also depicted the clash of civilizations. The imaginative costumes helped, and so did the various dance forms that the performers had at their disposal.

	Q: I built my house in the Rajarhat Gopalpur municipal area with permission from the municipal authority. However, the local councillor is now refusing to give his consent to the completion certificate. He is demanding a part of my land  which is vacant as per municipal rules  to construct a road. He also wants me to build a club for local political workers. How can I save myself from these unjust demands?         
	R.K. Sharma, Calcutta                
	A: The commissioner of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation issues the completion certificate once he is satisfied that the house or building is fit to be occupied in all respects. The local councillor has no role in this regard. So there is no reason for you to give in to his illegal demands.              
	Q:Our tenants pay rents of Rs 60 to 100 a month. They are, in fact, relatives of the original tenants who left long ago. However, the rent receipts are still being issued in the names of the original tenants. We have earlier lost a legal case against these people. How can we evict them?        
	Name withheld                
	A: You have not stated the details of the legal case that you lost. However, if you want to evict the relatives of your tenants, you will have to file a civil suit for eviction against your tenants on grounds of subletting and/or any other ground available to you according to the provisions of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act. But before that, you should stop issuing rent receipts in the name of the original tenants. Instead, send the tenants a notice to quit the premises.               
	Q:My husband owns a flat in a co-operative housing society. My father has also purchased a flat in the same society. Now my father wants to transfer his flat to my name. Can he transfer it through a deed of gift? Can I become a member of a society where my husband is already a member?        
	Madhuchanda Ganguly, Calcutta                
	A: A person owning a house or apartment in his own name or in the name of a family member is not eligible to become a member of a co-operative society as per the provisions in the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Rules, 1987. Hence, in your case, membership to the same society is likely to be rejected on that ground.

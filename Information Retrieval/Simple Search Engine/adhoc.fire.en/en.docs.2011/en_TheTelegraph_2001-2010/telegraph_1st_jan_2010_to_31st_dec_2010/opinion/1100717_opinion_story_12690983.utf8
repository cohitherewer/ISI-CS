	Restoration can be a thorny issue. Take the Ajanta caves. Historians are unsure whether they should allow the cave paintings to fade away naturally or if conservators should restore them according to their own perceptions for lack of adequate photographic documentation. The restoration of Sistine Chapels ceiling took ten long years, and when it was re-opened to the public on April 8, 1994, it sparked a controversy as the fresh colours of the Ancestors of Christ that emerged after the cleaning were thought to be too bright. It was feared that the cleaning process was too harsh. Ultimately, all the overpainted areas and contamination was removed to reveal only the layers that Michelangelo had painted on freshly-laid plaster.        
	Mercifully, the restoration of Johann Zoffanys (1733-1810) The Last Supper, hanging in St Johns Church behind Raj Bhavan, has remained untouched by controversy. The large painting (120 inches x144 inches)  its colours opulent and glowing after the removal of the layers of dust and most of the infill used during earlier attempts at restoration that occluded the original pigments  was unveiled before a large gathering on July 4. The original canvas was intact but the secondary canvas was damaged in parts by damp and in a tiny section by insects. (Picture on top; bottom shows the restored version.)        
	It is conjectured that soon after it was dedicated to the church following its completion in ten days, the painting was savaged, allegedly by those whose image Zoffany had sought to tarnish by depicting them as the apostles, not portrayed in a favourable light, or even vilified in the New Testament. Zoffany was a known prankster and personal grudges often played a large role in his choice of real-life models for the characters he depicted. So the canvas had to be consolidated and structurally stabilized.        
	The five-month-long restoration project, funded by Max Mueller Bhavan/Goethe Institut, was undertaken by a team of conservators from the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage led by the German conservator, Renate Kant.        
	Restoration ranks low as a priority in this country, and is almost unheard of in this city. The painting, hanging in the church for close to 250 years, always looked dramatic. But now, after being revealed in its true colours, the dynamism of the composition is enhanced, with many details of the facial expressions and gestures and the backdrop visible after years. The Twelve Apostles look particularly animated, some whispering conspiratorially, some looking with awe and perhaps with a hint of apprehension at Jesus as he blessed the bread and the chalice of wine before him. Some of them are caught in a brooding frame of mind like the greybeard in the foreground in crimson robes and a black shirt. This is typical of the German-born English artist, who is said to have introduced the theatrical conversation piece. Zoffany won fame after the actor, David Garrick, commissioned him to paint portraits of noted actors in scenes from their best known plays, and his Colonel Mordaunts Cock Match and The Tribunal of the Uffizi testify to the skill and adroitness with which he could handle crowd scenes. Once he fell out of favour with the royalty, he shifted to India in 1783 to seek his fortune like many of his coevals.        
	Flouting church painting traditions, Christ looking heavenwards is almost overshadowed by his robust and sinewy disciples who encircle him. Flame-haired Judas Iscariot, almost bare-bodied and with powerful arms exposed, is immersed in thought, his brows wrinkled as he perhaps contemplates his great betrayal. Like many of his contemporaries, this Rococo painter could handle drapery with mastery. The sheen of Marian Hastingss grand, rustling silk gowns in Zoffanys portraits hanging in the Victoria Memorial Hall looks very real. The heavy, dark scarlet drapes billowing behind the apostles look more lustrous than they did before, adding to the theatricality of the scene, and highlighting, by contrast, the full moon with clouds scudding across its angry orange face.        
	Like the boyish St Johns flaxen hair and ivory skin, earlier the brilliant colours looked a shade or two duller. Now, the titular saint of the church seems to have emerged from Salomes imagination, his body white beyond compare. The flesh tints have gained transparency and richness, adding a touch of earthiness. The brass utensils at the bottom, with which Christ washed the feet of his disciples before sitting down for the meal, appeared lustreless, badly in need of a scrub. Indeed, the bowl was badly damaged. Now they sparkle. This is how it was meant to be.

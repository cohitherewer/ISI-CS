                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FLOOD OF ILLS                                                    
	With its four provinces ravaged by floods that have affected 14 million of its population, Pakistan is in the throes of one of the worst natural calamities in living memory. The aftermath of the disaster  declared to be more severe than the 2004 tsunami, the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir and the recent Haiti earthquake  may be more devastating given the possibility of an outbreak of diseases and the inevitable impact of massive displacement. But what is doubly worrying to the world is the collateral effect of the floods. The disaster has further undermined the credibility of the civilian government, which is now, seemingly, non-existent in the flood-hit areas. The Pakistan army and the able and efficient network of Islamist organizations, like the Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, are conducting most of the relief work. Both the army (which has pledged a part of the soldiers income to the relief fund) and the Islamists are undoubtedly making the most of the opportunity. The popular disaffection with the governments tardy relief work may even give the Taliban a fair chance to recoup its losses and make a fresh comeback in the regions in which it has been overthrown.         
	Pakistans Western allies, particularly the United States of America, understand the vast possibilities the floods have opened up. For now, the US is capitalizing on the rare public relations initiative it has gained by being at the forefront of the evacuation and relief work in Pakistan. But it also knows that unless the Pakistan government gets its act together soon, the floods will have a ricocheting effect across the region. The scale of the humanitarian crisis in Pakistan and its possible impact have motivated a number of countries  members of the European Union as also Australia, Japan, China, Kuwait and others  to pledge substantial amounts to Pakistan to pull the government out of the crisis. Yet, India, Pakistans closest neighbour, has managed to come up with nothing more than an expression of distress. Surely a government that provided crucial assistance during the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, donated generously in the recent crisis in Haiti and refused international assistance during the 2004 tsunami so that it could be diverted to more needy nations, can do better than this? Why do the humanitarian ideals of India have to be compromised by its politics?

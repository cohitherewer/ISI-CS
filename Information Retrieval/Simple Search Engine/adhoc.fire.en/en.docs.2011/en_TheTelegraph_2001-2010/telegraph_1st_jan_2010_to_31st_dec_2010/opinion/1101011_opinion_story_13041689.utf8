	As the 33 Chileans trapped in a mine since August 5 prepare to join the world above, they must fortify themselves against the flurry of attention  most of it pleasant, though some of it perhaps not so  that they are bound to receive. Naturally, the global media are all agog at the news of their ascent, full of questions about how the men managed to hold body and soul together while living, for over two months, in conditions that are, quite literally, hellish. The miners organized themselves with remarkable expertise and discipline into three groups, and entrusted each with specific duties  from maintaining individual health records to the regular disbursal of food and other aid. Still, the going must have got tougher with each passing day, and a former journalist is reportedly conducting media training classes through video-conferencing to teach the men how not to lose their cool when faced with uncomfortable questions  especially those pertaining to sexual thoughts while underground, money matters and internal squabbles within the team. This training may well turn out to be useful for some of the miners, who will have to face furious spouses, alongside their no-less-enraged mistresses, who turned up at the rescue site bearing photographs of the same man. The mining tragedy may turn out to be a marital tragedy.        
	On another note, the incident itself should be a lesson in safety regulations for the industrialized world. It is amazing that even in the age of technological revolutions it took over 60 days to even initiate the process of saving these men, however admirably they may have been kept alive by the joint efforts of the Chilean government and the scientific community. But it is yet to be seen if the rescue capsule designed by Nasa is capable of lifting the men up to safety. It is perhaps not the time to rejoice just yet.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Food for thought                  
	Sir  In Small change, big move (July 5), Tapas Majumdar has dealt with a subject of vital contemporary relevance. Without undermining the worth of a plethora of suggestions from experts in the field of education, Majumdar has drawn on his personal experiences to discuss the relevance of some of these suggestions for creating a successful academic ambience. He cites the truism of having a large number of richly endowed universities, which would better the prospects of higher education, than a great many universities with meagre resources that already exist. There can be no quarrel with his argument. It would be a splendid idea if new world-class universities could indeed be set up in India and in places hitherto considered incapable of running institutions offering postgraduate degrees. To have these fully functional, even within five decades, with world-class faculty and administrators, would be even more heartening. But then, all this is wishful thinking, as Majumdar clearly points out.          
	Together with infrastructure, a certain degree of commitment is required. Majumdars reminiscences on Calcutta University fill me with a sense of pride since I had the opportunity of spending the last two years of my academic life there. I had the privilege of being taught by illustrious professors like R.K. Dasgupta, S.C. Sen, A.D. Mukherjee and A.G. Stock. The mention of Hiren Mukerji, whose knowledge of history and incomparable oratorical skills I enjoyed as a student of Surendranath College, delights me beyond measure. However, I do not subscribe to Majumdars view that the glory of this internationally famous university, built under the stewardship of Ashutosh Mookerjee, has completely faded. Some of the lustre has definitely been lost, but nothing could rob Calcutta University of its image till date. Student unrest may have given it a bad name, but it is patently unfair to compare its fall with that of some other universities in the country.          
	Majumdars last point is important. Fast track routes are necessary to promote talent. Sadly, no thought is spared for the best students who have to go through the routine gestation period. It is not numbers but quality that counts. Our wise policy-makers seem to have forgotten Jimmy Johnsons remark that the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.          
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Danger signals          
	Sir  As Bhaskar Dutta points out in Hint of new dangers (July 8), the post-recession world economy is suffering from a psychological dilemma  whether it ought to continue with stimulus packages or reduce public debt. The issue of reducing public expenditure is getting more attention after the economic crises in Spain, Greece and now in Germany. The newly elected Tory government in Britain is also acting cautiously. It has declared a series of cuts and put the private sector at the heart of economic recovery. However, the British finance minister has also introduced a number of measures to restore confidence in business and to keep down inflation, apart from reducing government borrowing. The last is supposed to fall from 10.1 per cent of the gross domestic product this year to 1.1 per cent in 2015-16. Public sector net borrowing will be 149 billion this year, 116 billion next year, 89 billion in 2012-13, and 60 billion in 2013-14.           
	As Dutta warns, the cuts make sound budget logic, but may spell disaster if effective demand reaches suboptimal level. Economic recovery, in that case, may be affected. The private sector cannot be trusted entirely to foster economic recovery. Economic management after the Great Depression and after the recession of 2007-09 was aimed at keeping the public sector as the main vanguard of recovery. If demand is reduced following contraction in public expenditure, the private sector will not be able to play a proactive role in recovery and the generation of employment. The British government should not forget the historical importance of the Keynesian model of economic management.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Happy secret          
	Sir  The engagement and marriage of the Indian cricket captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and his childhood friend, Sakshi Singh Rawat, were closely guarded secrets. But this cannot be entirely explained by Dhonis wish to keep the media at bay. Was it also done to prevent heartbreaks and suicides? Soon after the wedding, Dhoni is supposed to have met the Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi. Perhaps he had a discreet message to convey to the 40-year-old politician  that politics, like cricket, can be managed in wedlock.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala

                
	Sir  I am disappointed with the steady deterioration of standards of reporting in The Telegraph. The frontpage story with the headline, Dhoni in city girls knot (July 5), may still be justified by some logic, but should the story, Here is Sakshi, crickets first WAG, with a picture of Rawats domestic help, have been carried?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Biswanath Das, Jamshedpur

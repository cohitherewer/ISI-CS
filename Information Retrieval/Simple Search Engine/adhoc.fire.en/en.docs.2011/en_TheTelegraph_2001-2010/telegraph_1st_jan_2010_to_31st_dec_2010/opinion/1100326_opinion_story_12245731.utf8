	Important step                  
	Sir  It is a matter of great pride that Presidency College has finally been given the recognition that is its due, and will now be recognized as a unitary university (CM beats Mamata to Presidency, March 20). This comes after years of neglect and interference by the state government. The credit for this landmark reform must go to the teachers and students of the institution who have struggled for years to win more freedom and autonomy.          
	University status will mean new challenges and opportunities for the institution. It also brings with it greater responsibility for the teachers, students and alumni affiliated to the university. It is imperative that mistakes of the past are not repeated. Presidency must not share the dismal plight of other universities in the state. The institution has no dearth of well-wishers and famous alumni who could play a vital role in making it a centre of excellence once again. Let us hope this opportunity will be used to reinstate Presidency as one of the top educational institutions in the country.          
	Yours faithfully,         Gaurav Churiwala Garg, Calcutta                    
	Sir  The decision to grant autonomy to the once prestigious Presidency College appears to be more political than academic. The question that remains is why it took more than three decades to decide to upgrade the status of this prestigious institution. With Presidencys reputation at an all-time low, there is intense speculation as to whether gaining autonomy will free it from political interference and restore it to its former glory. Granting deemed university status to Bengal Engineering College does not seem to have helped the institution much. It is hoped that Presidency will not meet the same fate.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Debashish Chatterjee, Calcutta                    
	Sir  The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seems to have shown undue haste in getting the Presidency University bill passed in the state assembly. The Opposition is fully justified in appealing to the West Bengal governor, M.K. Narayanan, asking him not to approve the bill before it is subjected to further scrutiny by a committee of experts. The bill should be discussed before it is approved by the governor.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Grim choice          
	Sir  The recent comment made by the Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, was disturbing. He has reportedly stated that due regard should be given to the wishes of a rape victim if she chooses to marry the rapist or have the baby conceived as a result of the crime. Womens organizations have justifiably criticized this radical suggestion that has come from the highest judicial authority in India.          
	It is no secret that only a few rape victims in India dare to lodge a complaint. Legal formalities and court hearings  these are intensely traumatic for the victim  may drag on for years. Frequently, the victim is harassed by the accused outside court. With little hope of justice, many women buckle under pressure and, in a desperate bid for rehabilitation, choose to marry the rapist. A few months back, a young woman in Delhi converted to Islam in order to marry the man who had raped her. She could no longer bear the social stigma of being a rape victim.          
	Indian courts have been prone to making controversial judgements in recent times. In one case, a court upheld the marriage between a 15-year-old girl, a minor, and a man who had allegedly abducted her, despite the fact that sexual relations with a minor can be legally considered as rape.          
	The CJIs latest comments will give a free rein to hooligans to abduct, rape and marry any girl they choose. Even in cases where the victim chooses to marry the rapist, the charges should not be withdrawn. Rape is a crime against humanity. Without punishment, it is very likely that the offender will repeat the crime.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Manish Garg, Noida, Uttar Pradesh                     
	Sir  The government now proposes to delineate the offence of marital rape and enforce stringent laws on the matter. The new amendment to the existing criminal laws will impose harsher punishment on husbands found guilty of the offence. With this revolutionary step, the lawmakers have elevated marital ties to the platonic level. The new laws will also achieve some of the targets for the governments family welfare programme, which currently reaches a large part of the population.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

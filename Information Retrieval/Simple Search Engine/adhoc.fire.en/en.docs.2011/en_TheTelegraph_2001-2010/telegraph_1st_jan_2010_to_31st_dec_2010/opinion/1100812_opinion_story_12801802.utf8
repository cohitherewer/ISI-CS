The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Games up for grabs
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GAMES UP FOR GRABS                                  The Indian sporting scene needs a radical makeover                                          
	With barely 60 days to go for the Commonwealth Games, the domestic scene is as chaotic as a bar-room brawl in a Western movie. Everybody is attacking everybody else. The sports ministry, national sporting bodies, the state government, journalists, retired players, sporting icons, Central ministers prodded by news anchors are shouting themselves hoarse. At times, it is comic. But for the nation, especially for sports-lovers, it is painful.        
	Corruption, infighting, delay, shoddy facilities, financial and time overruns have been endemic to Indian sport, but never in this scale. The mind-numbing sums spent on the CWG have mostly been used for building new stadiums, upgrading the existing ones, and in building and improving infrastructure in Delhi to acceptable international standards. If the media have got it right, then India has lapped the field in corruption stakes and won the first gold medal with a CWG record.        
	Massive amounts have been sanctioned to sports bodies to improve standards and hopefully win more medals at the CWG. In sport, it is indisputable that no amount of money can produce instant champions. Further, it is impossible to wisely deploy huge sums in haste, without an adequate administrative structure to implement schemes. With the national sporting infrastructure close to a vacuum, spending such large amounts is like trying to sow seeds in the wind. Clearly, the current sporting system has been a total failure. Any Indian sportsperson making an international impact is quick to say, My success was not because of the association but in spite of it.        
	Years ago, Sanjay Gandhi tried, unsuccessfully, to push through reforms in sports associations. The associations have banded together, circled their wagons under the banner of the Indian Olympic Association, and, with great zeal, kept government directives at bay through legal tangles. Reportedly, the sports minister is furious with the associations. The truth is that both national associations and government bodies have failed the nation due to various reasons.         
	Achieving excellence at the international level require facilities and the precision of a space launch. It is a comforting thought that the promoters of the CWG have managed, while seeking financial assistance, to convince the government of the value of sporting excellence of international standards and of the millions required. The power of success in sport is beyond belief.        
	An Indian victory in a packed stadium, with millions watching on TV, fires the whole nation. It brings pride, confidence, a change of attitude and spurs the nation to greater effort. Sounds hyperbolic, but it is true. Indian sport is still in the colonial shackles of associations teeming with honorary workers in an age where only specialists can achieve or survive. The stakes are high and the Indian sporting scene needs to be sorted out.        
	A few fundamentals. First, a detailed look at the constitution, articles of association, rules and regulations of all sports bodies, with special focus on electoral eligibility and practices, is needed. Perhaps the Election Commissioner should be roped in to see that all interested parties are given adequate voice. Second, there should be compulsory integration with the education system. Third, professional promotion of events at national and international levels should be ensured. Last, the middle class must start thinking of sport as a profession that will give their children a good living with a respectful standing in society. This can open the floodgates of talent.        
	The government has a major role in developing infrastructure in cities and villages and in integrating sport with the education system. Apart from bringing joy to children, it will help to develop their physique and character. The various associations need an infusion of new blood, with professionals conversant in latest technical and promotional practices. Transparency and accountability should be strictly enforced. To end on a light note, my physio, Shivaji, incensed by the continuing exposs of corruption, has suggested renaming the CWG as the hariloot games.

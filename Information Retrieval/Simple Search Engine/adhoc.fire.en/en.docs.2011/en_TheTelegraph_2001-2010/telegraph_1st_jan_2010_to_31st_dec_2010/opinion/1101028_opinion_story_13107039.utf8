	There are some moments when perfection seems more desirable than ever. Choosing interlocutors for Jammu and Kashmir is certainly one such. Part of the governments various initiatives to address the Kashmir issue, the exercise seems aimed at a sensitive and fair-minded exploration of peoples feelings, whichever segment of society they belong to or whatever political opinion they incline towards. It is not definably a peace mission, yet a move hoping for palliation in its general effect with the message that the Indian government cares. If, instead of palliation, a team of interlocutors steps right into controversy at the very beginning of its year-long project, the difficulties of choosing the right interlocutors in an issue as delicate and as layered as Kashmir become clearer.        
	A politician as interlocutor would obviously be disastrous. What is needed is an expert on the subject, someone thoroughly aware of the nuances of the society and politics of the region, with the skill to conduct warm yet neutral conversations. The neutrality is a must for, having been appointed by the government, the interlocutors immediate response as well as his considered, even well-informed, opinion, must remain unexpressed. Whether a solution will or will not require Pakistans involvement is really not an interlocutors business. Intelligent, interested people, with knowledge and experience of the issue are not lacking: hence the governments problem in choosing the right persons. Perhaps high-profile and defined personalities, however well-versed, are less useful in these situations than self-effacing experts unused to the media and far from welcoming them. The model for an interlocutor could be the visiting professor homing in on his subject from a distance, an outsider with skill and knowledge but with no perceptible colour or known opinion for anyone to snipe at. Anyone with the job of interlocutor in Kashmir bears an extraordinary degree of responsibility. It is a duty that will not tolerate even a moments thoughtlessness.

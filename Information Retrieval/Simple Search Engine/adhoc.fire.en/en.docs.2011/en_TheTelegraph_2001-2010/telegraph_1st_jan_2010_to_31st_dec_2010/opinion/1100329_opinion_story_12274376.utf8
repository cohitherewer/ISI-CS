	Rulers always needed money, especially the conquerors; so governments and bankers were inseparable. Some of them became privileged enough to become the governments exclusive bankers. It was only in the 19th century that governments began to realize that all finance was interrelated and that a single bank failure could bring the entire financial system toppling down. The realization led to the emergence of the lender of last resort, the central bank. Central banks would rather be safe than sorry; so they invented precautionary rules. Cash reserve ratios and minimum capital requirements were the first such impositions. Indias government had an insatiable thirst for borrowings, so the Reserve Bank of India added a third parameter, the statutory liquidity ratio, to force banks to buy government bonds. Government banks bought government bonds far beyond what they had to hold. So, in effect, they ended up holding more than two-thirds of their assets in government loans. Financing feckless governments became their main business; financing growing businesses was only a side business.        
	Meanwhile, governments of developed countries moved to unfetter their banks; banks moved into new businesses, at home and abroad. World finance became more interrelated, and systemic risks increased. This suddenly came to light when, following the Lehman Brothers, the big financial institutions of the United States of America hurtled into crises, and a laissez-faire government had to rescue one bank after another. The crisis also gave a new lease of life to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF developed a methodology to estimate systemic riskiness, and found a ready market for it amongst the Group of 20 countries, which have, in effect, appointed themselves the worlds stabilizers. Its new tricks have given ideas to the RBI, which has now come up with its own financial stability report. Not surprisingly, it gives high marks for stability to the system that the RBI oversees.        
	The RBIs way of making any financial activity safe is to ban it. The result is that Indian financial markets are extremely undeveloped; in particular, new financial instruments have borne the full brunt of the RBIs hostility. So Indias financial system has remained small and served its growth needs inadequately; it has been dominated by the RBIs favourite government banks, and their margins are about the fattest in the world  India pays heavily for a pittance of credit. These facts will not be exposed in the RBIs beautifully produced reports, and will never be mentioned in the corridors of the North Block. Nor will the IMF ever dare refer to them. But the fact is, financially the government has served India poorly.

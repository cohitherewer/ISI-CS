	Before they can force the State to wither away, Nepals Maoists seem to want the countrys government to disappear. If seven attempts by the political parties to elect a prime minister had failed, it was primarily because of the former rebels obstructionist tactics. The result is a dangerous political vacuum that has deprived the people of even a semblance of governance and also made the countrys politics vulnerable to international manipulations. The recent allegation that a Maoist leader had accepted money from Chinese embassy officials in Kathmandu, in order to buy votes in the last round of the prime ministerial polls, is evidence of the danger. The Maoists denial has been far from convincing, but they want to counter it with their old anti-India rhetoric. This is at the heart of their planned month-long agitation to protest against foreign intervention in Nepals internal affairs. They see an Indian hand in anything that thwarts their moves. Thus, the failure of the Maoist leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, to be elected prime minister was laid at Indias door. The truth, however, is that most parliament members do not trust the Maoists enough to give them the top job in the government.         
	However, a stable, democratic regime in Kathmandu is as much in the Nepali peoples interest as in Indias. When New Delhi mediated between the Maoists and the democratic parties of Nepal, the aim was to end the decade-long insurgency and restore democratic politics there. A peaceful Nepal is crucial to Indias strategic interests in a sensitive border region. But India cannot remain inactive if the current drift in Nepal disturbs the geopolitical equilibrium in the region. Only last week, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, expressed his misgivings about an assertive China and its goals in South Asia. But Nepal needs to save itself from the Maoist games for the sake of its own people and society. Its democracy is fragile and flawed, but it would be a disaster if a communist coup knocks out democratic politics in Nepal. The current deadlock has not only brought governance to a halt but also clouded the incomplete peace process. The United Nations Mission in Nepal, which is the main international agency overseeing the peace process, has had its term extended thrice. Nepal could descend into another spell of anarchy if the political void derails the hard-won peace initiative.

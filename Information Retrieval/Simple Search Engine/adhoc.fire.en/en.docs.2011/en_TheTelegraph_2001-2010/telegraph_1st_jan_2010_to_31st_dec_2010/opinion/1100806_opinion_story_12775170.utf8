The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a quiet indian
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A QUIET INDIAN                                                    
	In spite of its long history of idol worship, India is a country of unrecognized icons. This statement is particularly true of Indias secular icons. They are almost always, especially in contemporary times, cricketers and film stars. There is thus a distinct possibility that when Ratan Tata steps down in 2012 as the chairman of the Tata group, his achievements may not get their due recognition. Yet any objective assessment, away from the glare of limelight, will show that he is arguably the greatest Indian of his time and generation. Mr Tata succeeded J.R.D. Tata, who was hailed as a legend in his own lifetime. Mr Ratan Tata thus had a difficult act to follow. Undaunted by this, Mr Tata decided to fashion his inheritance on his own terms and to put the companies he led on a new path of growth and development. There are two success stories, in this context, that deserve special notice. Mr Tata is often not seen as a pioneer but as someone who expanded what he inherited. This overlooks the fact that he is perhaps the only Indian industrialist who put on the market two products that are completely Indian  the cars, Indica and Nano. Indian firms have excelled in the task of assembling and in providing skilled labour, but Mr Tata set the pace in manufacturing things that are Indian.        
	The other achievement is the phenomenal expansion of Tata Steel that occurred under Mr Tatas leadership. Tata Steel today is one of the largest producers of steel in the world. This was possible through the acquisition of Corus in the centenary year of Tata Steel. This acquisition was the product of a vision that Mr Tata nurtured. He wanted to make the Tata group a global player and he chose to do this by making his steel company  in many ways the Tata groups flagship  grow from Indias premier company to become one of the best in the world. Mr Tata may lack the flamboyance of his predecessor but his footprints are national and global. He has allowed his achievements to speak for themselves without being burdened by the mantle he wore. His approach to his empire is reflected in the process he has established to find his successor. He could have just named his heir. Instead, he decided to give to the process his characteristic professional touch: he has appointed a selection committee. This could not have been an easy thing to do in a company whose name is eponymous with that of a family. Floreat, Mr Tata.

	The institution of the comptroller and auditor general has a long history in modern India. It plays a critically important role in maintaining the checks and balances that are vital for the proper functioning of a democracy. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has very aptly described the CAG as an important watchdog of democracy. The CAG ensures that all financial transactions of the government are above board and have followed the necessary rules and regulations. Since the government, by definition, handles money that is not its but belongs to the public, the CAG ensures accountability and rectitude in the governments financial affairs. This is a very onerous responsibility which assumes that the CAG should be scrupulously fair in the course of its own work and during the preparation of its report on any given matter. The prime minister drew attention to this when he emphasized that the CAG should take care to distinguish between wrongdoing and genuine errors. He drew attention to this distinction between a bonafide error and a deliberate mistake while speaking at the 150 years celebration of the CAG.        
	The prime minister perhaps did not say enough to guarantee that the CAG remains always fair. One elementary principle of fairness is the recording of the views of those against whom allegations have been made. No CAG report can be either complete or fair as a mere case for the prosecution. It has to include the case for the defence as well. Yet, it is often the case, that the preliminary and interim report of the CAG, without the arguments of the accused party, is leaked to the media who for their own selfish interests lap up such leaks. It is part of the CAGs responsibility to guarantee that these leaks do not happen as a matter of routine as happens in India. The CAG cannot be seen as the guardian of rectitude and yet itself be subject to leaks that are unfair and improper. The prime minister has drawn attention to the proneness of the CAG to see mala fide motives in what are no more than ordinary human errors. Following that dictum, it is not necessary to project motives behind leaks emanating from the CAG even though they happen with alarming regularity. It is the responsibility of the CAG to see that only its full report and assessment come into the domain of public discourse. Without that guarantee, its work will be half done.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STILL HANGING ON                                                    
	Silvio Berlusconi has seldom been known to lose a political gamble. In spite of his chequered lifestyle, he was returned as prime minister of Italy in 1994, 2001 and 2008, each time with a landslide majority. But he seems to have outdone his previous achievements this once. It is incredible that after slanderous revelations of misconduct, Mr Berlusconi managed to survive two confidence votes by the skin of his teeth: 162 to 135 in the senate, and 314 to 311 in the chamber of deputies, the lower house. Under Mr Berlusconis Centre-Right coalition  from which his former neo-fascist ally, Gianfranco Fini, recently dropped out, escalating the national crisis  Italy has been pushed into an economic disaster of alarming dimensions. The leftwing opposition remains weak and divided, unable to offer a viable alternative. More importantly, the television industry, which has immense influence on public opinion, remains largely under Mr Berlusconis control. In the circumstances, the outcome of the confidence vote is more indicative of a political stalemate than of either the stability of the government or of the peoples faith in it.        
	It would not have made much of a difference to Mr Berlusconi anyway, even if he had lost the confidence motions. In that event, he would have called for fresh elections and, through his expert manipulation of the electronic media, ensured that the peoples mandate went to him. So even though Mr Berlusconi remains short of a clear parliamentary majority, it is premature for analysts to start composing his political obituary. In the past, a political deadlock of such proportions could be cleared by the provisional appointment of a technical government, made up of a coalition of politically-neutral technocrats. But since Mr Berlusconi has resolved to never resign, the inaction in the parliament is unlikely to end any time soon. As a consequence, important legislations and decisions are pending indefinitely, as the nation hurtles into anarchy and rioting.

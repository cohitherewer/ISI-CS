The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Scared away
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SCARED AWAY                                                    
	Much of the news about West Bengal today must be an investors nightmare. Singapores foreign minister, George Yeo, was literally closer to reality when he happened to be in Calcutta and to personally witness the dark clouds that hung over the city and other parts of West Bengal. His stay in the city coincided with political activists parading the streets with the body of a slain colleague. If he had stayed on a few more days, he would have seen the ruling party activists, led by none other than the chief minister, holding the city to ransom on some other issue. Obviously, Mr Yeo could not have commented explicitly on such extraordinary acts of West Bengals politicians or the chaos that prevails in the state. But there is no way one can miss the point in what he said about Singapore holding back its investment plans for the state. The point is that the current spell of violence, chaos and collapse of governance is enough to make potential investors shun the state. And, what Mr Yeo said must also be the feeling of domestic entrepreneurs. Between the ruling coalition and the Opposition, the states politicians have managed to restore West Bengals old reputation as a hopeless state where violent, partisan politics kills all productive activity.        
	The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, must bear the primary responsibility for this state of affairs. He is not only the executive head of the government but also the most important leader of the principal ruling party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He seems to be utterly incapable of stopping political violence or using the administration to stem the rot. What is worse and even more dangerous is the fact that he has been calling upon his party activists to resist the Oppositions attempts to unleash forces of anarchy. True, Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress and the Maoists have posed serious challenges to his rule. But, instead of getting the administration to deal with it, Mr Bhattacharjee seems to rely more on his party to do it. The result is an administrative collapse that has left the field free for violent turf-wars between rival political parties. The Lefts militant politics scared investors away from the state in a big way in the 1960s and the 1970s. Now, its abdication of its responsibilities as a party of the government threatens to do worse for West Bengal.

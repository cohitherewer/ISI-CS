	Eight months after the elections, Iraq is witnessing the first serious attempt at government-formation through the ongoing all-party talks in the northern town of Arbil. The impetus to the initiative was provided by Iraqs supreme court, which ordered parliamentarians to resume work and elect a speaker last month. Without this, there would perhaps be less urgency for Iraqs politicians to put on the table their ideas about steering Iraq out of the political stalemate. Fortunately, they seem to have a clearer idea of where they are headed than before. The incumbent prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, and his State of Law now have the support of both the Shia religious parties, headed by Muqtada al-Sadr, and the Kurdish alliance. This gives him a clear majority in parliament against Iyad Allawis al-Iraqiya coalition, supported by many Sunni legislators. Mr al-Maliki is in a better bargaining position with the Iraqiya demands for the presidents chair (held by the Kurds) and a constitutional amendment to reduce the powers of the prime minister. Mr Allawis party has been offered the speakers position, which has not pleased him or the Sunni Arabs. So Iraq, whose parliament reconvenes on Thursday, may be closer to a settlement but farther away from peace.        
	Nothing illustrates this better than the sharp rise in sectarian violence. The past month alone has seen a string of attacks in Shia-dominated areas and places of worship. The United States of America, which concluded its first phase of military withdrawal in August, is worried. It has warned against the exclusion of the Sunni Arabs from power, which may lead to a resurgence of Sunni extremism. The steady increase in Irans direct influence on Iraq through the Sadrists is making the US no less uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the USs voice may carry less force than before. The Iraqiya partys non-participation in government is unlikely to stop Iraqs tilt towards Iran and may increase the internal polarization.

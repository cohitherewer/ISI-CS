	I have just returned from a short trip to the East Coast of the United States of America. I went there to participate in a strategy meeting. The location consisted of a pristine 400 acres of green lawns and 19th century mansions that now houses PGA golf courses with undulating fairways, manicured greens and stretches of challenging sand bunkers. The mansions are let out for conferences and meetings of the type I had gone to attend. The place is located alongside one of the most prestigious US universities bearing the name of the town in which the sprawling campus resides.        
	On arrival in the town and driving through the estate, my first reaction was that of regret for not carrying my golf gear with me. As our meetings progressed, my regret was gradually tempered by bouts of rain and the sight of diehard golfers soldiering on, drenched and bent against cold gusts of wind. I was happy to watch them play from the warmth of the meeting room instead of being among them in such inclement weather.        
	A stunning sight, the next morning, amazed me and has provoked me to write this piece. An overnight heavy rainfall had apparently made the sand bunkers soggy. A fairly large number of amateur players were expected on the course that day. Giant industrial air-blowers, mounted on mobile platforms, were being operated to dry the sand bunkers in order to make them playable by the time the amateurs arrived to play.        
	I was shocked by the sight of sand bunkers being blow-dried as I had never before witnessed such a scene. If this was the way they were going to dry the bunkers along the length of the golf course, I wondered about the value of the carbon debit this single golf course was accumulating for the benefit of a handful of amateur golfers.        
	The climate change sceptics, especially in the US, would scoff at my concern. And, in any case, the US being the largest per capita consumer of energy in the world, I could see why it has been consistently opposing every global treaty to reduce carbon footprint.        
	By the end of our meeting and on my way back, I wondered how the habit of mindless waste of energy might be more widespread in the US and if the consequences of such unquenchable demand for energy might have been responsible for the recent BP offshore blowout in Florida or even, more frighteningly, for the conjuring of the bogey of the weapons of mass destruction that led to the disastrous war in Iraq.        
	I love to play as well as watch the game of golf and am proud that Arjun Atwal became the first Indian to win a US PGA title. However, I am unable to reconcile myself to the game becoming an energy-guzzling monster, especially when electrical air-blowers are employed to dry bunkers so that 40 or 50 amateur golfers can have a good round of golf, in spite of nature willing otherwise.        
	The university town is well known for its Nobel laureates and Fields Medal winners, so it is a tragedy that this reputation is in such stark contrast to a golf course where wet bunkers are air-dried for amateur golfers pastime. In the end, I was glad that I had not carried my golf gear. I would not have had the heart to play a round even if it had not rained.

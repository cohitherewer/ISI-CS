The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Secrets in the box
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SECRETS IN THE BOX                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Dramatized from Satyajit Rays story by Sima Mukhopadhyay, Rangroops Braja-buror Sabuj Baksa presents an eccentric (picture) regarded by his neighbours as highly suspicious because he beckons to their kids and because of the weird goings-on inside his house; until two boys investigations reveal a misunderstood child at heart. Ray implicitly criticizes society for suppressing instead of nurturing the child in all of us. Mukhopadhyay directs a pretty eerie beginning but cannot pace the denouement, letting it drag beyond its one-hour optimum. She also reveals the secrets in the box too literally as small soft toys, when an empty trunk better suggests the magic power of the juvenile imagination.        
	An exclusively kiddie cast enrolled at The Creative Arts made a heart-warming impact with and the Piper played another tune, in which Sangeeta Bapuli has the Pied Piper desert the children in Ratland, where the educational rat race transforms them into rodents  until the Pipers son saves them. Despite the Western rather than Indian source, Ramanjit Kaur directs her most successful show yet, everything coming together satisfactorily. We even saw some tiny stars-in-the-making: Simar Singh (the hero), Rubani Singh, Suroma Nag, Ruhani Singh and Ishika Jalan.        
	We should also encourage college-goers taking to theatre, especially those bitten hard enough by the bug to write and direct their own scripts and form their own groups. Coincidentally, two new ones fight shy of nomenclature: one, from Jadavpur University, named itself Insert Name, while the other, mainly comprising students from Heritage Institute of Technology, had no name at all. Saravanan Mani, a compulsive writer and moving spirit behind the former, produced Alecaiwun which, like many of his plays, welds epic Indian tales with contemporary popular culture in an absurdist form boasting all parts performed by women who know to swear easily. For the other, Devaditya Sanyal composed Mein Leben, an idealistic but under- rehearsed tragedy about a German classical musicians conflict between his art and his lover.        
	LAlliance Franaise, so active in Calcuttas cultural life decades ago, awakens from its theatrical slumber with another production by Night and Fog, La Grande Bouffe, dramatized from Buuels classic 1972 film, Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie, by Avisek Arora. And surprise, surprise, he directs it in two versions, French and English, back to back separated by an interval. Unlikely that anyone here has done that before! Buuels wild, surrealistic, satiric nightmare scenario about the constantly deferred attempts of five friends to dine looks more apropos owing to the casts helpless amateurishness, proves how much French absurd drama influenced the movie, and gives another meaning to deference.

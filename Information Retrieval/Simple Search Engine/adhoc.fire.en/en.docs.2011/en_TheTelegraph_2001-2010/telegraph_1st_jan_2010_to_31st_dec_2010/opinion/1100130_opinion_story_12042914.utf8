The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | test of a different class
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TEST OF A DIFFERENT CLASS                                                          
	The examination bogey is of highly respectable vintage. But funny tales, real and fictional, about the outlandish ways children think up to deal with the bogey, have become antiquated; there is nothing funny about examinations any more. Neither can that staple of vernacular comedy, the golden-hearted young man who steadily fails to cross Class VIII or Class X and is yet an indispensable part of a sprawling, untidy and compassionate family, be even imagined today. It is not just that the family structure has changed, but also that cultural and social attitudes, together with economic aspirations, have changed radically, inducing a complete makeover in the approach to education both within the family as well as in institutions.        
	Examinations, even internal school examinations, have become a source of unbearable stress for children, a fact that is among the chief causes of concern for the Union human resource development minister, Kapil Sibal. While many schools in villages suffer from a scarcity of basic resources and infrastructure, the better institutions and those competing to reach higher standards require of their pupils a level of tip-of-the-tongue mastery that exhausts and frightens many. Demanding parents who expect returns for the investments they make, the inevitable system of private tuition, standardized questions and model answers required to be learnt by rote, all drive children into a corner, confining their minds to a single focus and undermining freedom in growth. The implicit prioritization of the applied sciences and technology-related subjects in educational policies is an additional coercive factor.        
	Mr Sibals plan of changing the format of examinations within school in order to de-stress the child is a step in the right direction, and one that has been long due. The recent suicides of schoolchildren are a frightening reminder of the urgency of change. Experiments have shown that the complete abolition of all testing methods may leave children inadequately equipped. But continuous internal assessment, together with periodic, time-bound tests of intelligence and ability rather than just rote learning would accord with internationally approved methods of school-teaching. Teaching children to think for themselves, to present their arguments, to apply what they have read with guidance from their teachers, hone their intellectual and creative abilities and expand their knowledge through projects would make learning enjoyable and take the sting out of tests.        
	But such changes would also require hardworking, committed teachers trained to teach in the new method. Besides ensuring this essential resource, the HRD minister must also ensure that all schoolteachers have decent working conditions, a space to work and read in, a library to share with the children, and a bathroom that can be used. Happy teachers make happy children too.

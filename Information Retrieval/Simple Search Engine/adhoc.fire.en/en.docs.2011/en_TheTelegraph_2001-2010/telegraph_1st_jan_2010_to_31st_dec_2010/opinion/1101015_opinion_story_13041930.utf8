                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Values and ideals                  
	Sir  The Ayodhya verdict seems to have shocked secularists like Ramachandra Guha (Watch the space, Oct 9). So much so, that lambasting the judges of the Allahabad High Court who delivered the verdict seems to have become the sole concern of men of Guhas ilk. Guha calls the Ayodhya sentence a split verdict. May I remind Guha that split verdicts were also delivered in the Kesavananda Bharati case and the Mandal Commission case? But the judgments favouring the majority in these cases later became the laws of the land. Guha is furious since he thinks that the Allahabad verdict favours the Hindus. But the ruling also has something for the Muslims. In support of his stance, Guha has quoted M.K. Gandhi. Gandhi was undoubtedly a great man. Yet his concept of brotherhood between Hindus and Muslims failed to prevent a partition on communal lines.          
	Guha quotes Gandhi to say that Hindus should give Muslims whatever they ask for and accept whatever sacrifice this may entail. Is the reverse not true as well? Is it impossible for Muslims to make a sacrifice and facilitate the building of a temple at the Babri Masjid site? The Allahabad High Court has delivered a verdict that may pave the way for a peaceful settlement of the dispute, which has been dragging on for years. Instead of welcoming the judgment, secularists are instigating fundamentalists to challenge it in the Supreme Court. It is often said that the sangh parivar does not honour court verdicts. Why are secularists like Guha dishonouring the judgment?                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ramachandra Guha says that he received a series of hate mails when he suggested in The Telegraph and on television that the disputed property in Ayodhya should be used not for building either a temple or a mosque, but should rather be home to a hospital or park that would serve a trans- religious and truly human purpose. Although Guha has obviously been hurt by the messages, he refrains from delivering a wounding retort while not compromising on his position on the Ayodhya issue.          
	He admits with disarming candour that Indias ethos, values, ideals and aspirations are determined by those of the Hindu majority, and yet this majoritarian worldview is endorsed by a minority of Hindus. He concludes his article by saying that neither a mosque nor a temple on the site would solve the dispute. The only just, sustainable, and peaceful solution is for Hindus and Muslims alike to seek their spiritual solace in pieces of territory as yet uncontaminated by hatred and bloodshed, he says. This, I believe, is also the majoritarian view of secular-minded citizens of a constitutionally declared secular State.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Hate mails are common nowadays, and they need to be ignored. Ramachandra Guha should not have read the mails if he thought that they encouraged hostility. Guha quotes M.K. Gandhi as saying, As a satyagrahi, I am emphatically of the view that the Hindus should give to the Muslims whatever they ask for, and willingly accept whatever sacrifice this may involve. Unity will be brought about only by such mutual generosity. Unfortunately, such benevolence hardly has any relevance today. Hence, Guhas recommendation that a park or a hospital be constructed at the Ayodhya site is also likely to fall through.           
	With regard to the Allahabad High Court verdict, I beg to differ with what the legal analyst, Manoj Mitta, quoted by Guha in his article, has said. Mitta thinks that the judgment has permitted the vandals of 1992 to emerge as the victors of 2010. Had this been true, the judgment would not have evoked an unprecedented positive response from both the minority and majority communities.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  By distributing the Ayodhya land between groups representing the interests of just Muslims and Hindus, the concerns of people who profess faiths other than these two have been ignored. As a citizen of India, anyone can demand ownership of the land. This silent group constitutes the third party to the case. Should the case be taken up in the Supreme Court, it should consider this aspect.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asok Kumar Das, California, US

      
	Sir  I am a Hindu, not a fundamentalist, and I do not observe all religious rituals. I am not at all satisfied with the Ayodhya verdict. God is addressed by different names by people of different faiths. As such, there is no distinction between a temple, a mosque or a church. The Ramjanmabhoomi quarrel must be stopped once and for all. A charitable hospital for leprosy patients should be built on the site. The trustees of the hospital should be Hindus, Muslims, Christians and others.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashim Kumar Chakraborty, Guwahati 

                
	Forward march          
	Sir  Notwithstanding the barbs of a desperate chief minister, Mamata Banerjee deserves to be congratulated for what she has achieved in her tenure as the Union railways minister. The inauguration of the Metro Railway up to New Garia will definitely be welcomed by people of the area and beyond. The Kabi Subhas station is beautiful and well planned. Only one thing is missing  a parking lot where a commuter can park his car and take the Metro to his destination. There is ample space in the compound for such a facility, which may earn some revenue for the Metro railway as well.          
	Yours faithfully,

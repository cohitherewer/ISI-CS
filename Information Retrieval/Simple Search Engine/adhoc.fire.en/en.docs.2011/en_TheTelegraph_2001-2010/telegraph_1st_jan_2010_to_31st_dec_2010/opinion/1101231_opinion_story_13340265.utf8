                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Step backward                  
	Sir  It is shameful that the chief minister of West Bengal should halt traffic to congratulate members of the Left-backed primary teachers association for winning the district primary school council elections (Real duty, Dec 24). What is even more appalling is his rather pathetic plea to the teachers to preach to guardians the party gospel as a way of ensuring the success of the Left in the forthcoming elections. Constant poll reversals since the 2009 Lok Sabha elections have made the Communist Party of India (Marxist) so shaky and nervous that any win, however negligible, boosts its sagging morale. This was evident when the chief minister tried to win the favour of the teachers, denigrating and belittling education in the process.           
	It is sad that West Bengal, which once produced professionals and distinguished educationists who led from the front, is now counted among the states with low literacy rates. This abrupt downfall is the result of the faulty policies pursued by the Left Front government during its 33 years in office. The rot started when the teaching of English was abolished at the primary school level, destroying the basic fabric of the education system. Although Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee deserves to be praised for re-introducing English at the primary level, he evidently could not repair the damage that had already been done.           
	By polarizing teachers on the basis of their political allegiance, the government has made the system even more corrupt. As teachers enjoying the patronage of political parties dominate the scene, apolitical teachers with good track records and dedication will suffer silently because of lack of incentive and encouragement.           
	One supports a particular political party on the basis of the work it has performed. A party can woo voters only by letting its performance speak for itself, and not by coaxing them and making a mockery of the political process. Teachers are the builders of a nation. They must be encouraged to shape the careers of students in the right manner. Politicization of the education system will only destroy the students futures and weaken the country in the long run.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is not surprising that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should ask teachers to launch a widespread campaign to educate their students guardians about the ideologies and principles of the CPI(M). Ever since it came to power in 1977, the CPI(M) has moulded the education sector in a way which ensured that students do not learn with a free and open mind, which may allow them to challenge the communist ideology. The first step in this direction was the removal of English as a subject at the primary level. The resistance to computers and computer education was another step. The most important measure, however, was to fill the education sector with Left-leaning teachers so that students were indoctrinated with the party ideology right from the beginning. By the time the students matured into working adults, they would be expected to follow in the footsteps of their leaders. Thus power would remain in the hands of Left leaders. That this strategy has been quite successful is evident. In the process, West Bengal may have fallen behind other states in terms of development, industrial growth or job prospects, but the CPI(M) government is obviously not worried about these. However, the reversals that the Left has suffered in its political fortunes over the last two years have forced the government to think of new measures to prolong its stay in power. Entrusting panchayats with education is one such step, and goading teachers to propagate the party ideology is another. It is not hard to guess what the outcome of these two moves will be. In the future, someone from the party will perhaps magnanimously admit to having made mistakes. But by then, it will be too late to rectify them.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Suman Sankar Dasgupta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The late CPI(M) stalwart, Jyoti Basu, had discontinued the teaching of English at the primary level in schools. He associated English with the imperialistic policies followed by the British that had supposedly resulted in students not being able to do well in interviews outside the state.           
	Thereafter, it became a practice to recruit teachers not so much on the basis of their qualifications as on the basis of whether or not they toed the party line. Now it is Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees turn to further deteriorate the education system. One would not be surprised if primary school children are taught Marxist doctrines next.                     
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A DIFFERENT GAME                          - The pros and cons of exporting football and importing pyjamas        NOTEBOOK: Ian Jack                          Fifa headquarters, Zurich, December 2, 2010                                              
	Does Britain have too small an economy to support its morality? Let me put this riddle in a different way. Can British governments still afford to take up moral positions that could damage the countrys economic self-interest? You may, of course, deny that it has ever really done so  whatever the public posture, trade and money came first  but in the late 1990s the Labour government adopted what it called an ethical foreign policy and history does throw up instances where governments (not, of course, just British ones) have put principles before national advantage. And there has always been at least the pretence that commonly accepted ideas of right and wrong figure high in every decision.        
	Now unabashed realpolitik runs the show. This became obvious when the prime minister, David Cameron, visited India and talked about nothing other than friendship and trade  the days when Britain offered irritating advice on Kashmir are clearly over  and it grew even more obvious on his China trip, when he refused to comment on Chinas abuse of human rights. Britain needs India and China much more than these countries need Britain, and Camerons silence, however much Britains liberal establishment may regret it, is completely understandable. Nobody wants these days to upset India and the Chinese: export orders and Western economic recovery depend on them. We are the little people now and have a realistic appreciation of our situation.        
	Last weeks shameful events at Zurich, however, are harder to excuse. The committee of Fifa, the organization that governs world football, met in the Swiss city to decide which countries would host the World Cups to be played in 2018 and 2022. Unlike the Olympics, the World Cup actually makes money for the country its played in. The English Football Association and the British government determined that in 2018 it had to be England and for some reason believed the chances were good. Off went the delegations led by David Cameron, Prince William and David Beckham to lobby the Fifa committee in Switzerland  or, if you like, to abase themselves before a group of nonentities, several of whom are known to be crooks.        
	This was awkward. Most of the world has kept quiet about corruption inside Fifa, whose proceedings are secretive and opaque, but only a few days before the decisive meeting the BBC broadcast a brave investigative documentary that showed how the bribery worked  basically, money for votes. A British newspaper, The Sunday Times, had published a similar story earlier in November, again with charges that seemed well-founded (as they would need to be  England has the worlds stiffest libel laws). Fifa, naturally, was none too happy about these disclosures, which drove the team leading the English bid to despair: what did the media think they were up to by shooting Englands cause in the back? And so Cameron, Beckham and the heir to the throne flew to Zurich to placate, as well as to schmooze, flatter and cajole.         
	It was embarrassing and it did no good. Out of 22 votes on offer, England secured a miserable two. Fifa awarded the 2018 tournament to Russia and the later one to Qatar. In Russia, corruption is a way of life and inquiring journalists tend to die young. As for Qatar, it cant be great fun being a woman there, it doesnt admit Israelis, and the July temperatures mean that every game will need to be played at night in artificially cooled arenas. But both countries have riches to spend and Fifa is determined to spread what it calls the message of football away from its homelands in Europe and South America.        
	Who comes well out of all this? I have to say the British media do. Something rotten lingers at the heart of the worlds most popular professional sport and the Sunday Times and the BBC invested time and resources to tell us about it, no matter the national consequences. This is what good journalism exists for. Like many people, I take my hat off to the journalists and celebrate the fact that England wont be hosting the 2018 World Cup.              
	**************              
	Unforgettable experiences are fairly easy for the foreigner to acquire in India. The most recent of mine came a couple of years ago, when Gopal Gandhi, then the governor of West Bengal, invited me to tea at Raj Bhavan. It was a stupendous affair. Not the tea itself nor the biscuits that came with it: both were good and nicely served in silver teapots and from china plates, but a grand hotel might have done better and even a not very grand hotel (the old BNR, say, in Ranchi) would have done just as well. The stupendousness came from the location, a room (perhaps the Blue Drawing Room) that was big and tall enough to hold a herd of elephants but contained only the two of us, plus a servant or two to manage the cups and saucers. Guards saluted me all the way in  they seemed to spring from behind pillars down every long corridor  and all the way out again. When I got back into my taxi I felt like a scruffier version of Lord Wellesley, who had the place built in 1803.        
	Last month I met Gopal Gandhi again in humbler circumstances in London when we shared a stage at the Nehru Centre, of which he was the first director. We were to be in conversation. This kind of event can be very forced and artificial  whats natural about having a conversation overheard by an audience of two hundred people? But he was patient with my questions, some of which he must have heard many times before (Was it a help or a hindrance to be Gandhis grandson?), and subtle and entertaining in his answers. He has formidable skills as a diplomat. I asked him about Nandigram and the scrape he got into with the CPI(M) government, and his answer was so fluent and at the same time so impenetrable that I might just as well have tried to open an oyster with a fingernail.              
	He was interesting about London. Hed spent some enjoyable days just walking around the West End. He loved the fact that it had hardly changed since he lived there in the 1990s  and that, he said, could be said of no Indian city. The peace that permanence brings used to be considered an Eastern quality: Eternal India. How odd that to find it now you need to travel west.              
	**************              
	For the past week or so Britain has been covered in snow and temperatures in some places have dropped to -22 degree celsius: the snowiest, coldest November that most of us can remember. Satellite pictures show an island thats totally white. I lie in bed watching the flakes drift past my window, glad of hot water bottles and coal fires to supplement the central heating. A few days ago I tumbled down the stairs on my back after catching a toe in my too-loose pyjama bottoms. A comical entanglement with painful results  hence bed. Lying here, it strikes me that India is entirely responsible. If Britain hadnt imported the idea of pyjamas from India in the 19th century I wouldnt be wearing any  before then we had nightshirts that left legs free (and cold). But then it also strikes me that we pinched another domestic idea from India at around the same time: the bungalow. If Id had the sense to live in a bungalow then it wouldnt have mattered that I caught my toe in the pyjamas: bungalows have no stairs to fall down.        
	This may be a wonderful illustration of how difficult it is to weigh up the good and bad consequences of imperialism. On the other hand, it may just be the painkillers talking.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MARGINS OF ERROR                                  WORDCAGE - Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	A writer deplores, as I do, British readiness to adopt American slang. But, he goes on, the import of US technical neologisms for devices or processes invented in the USA (e.g. software, podcast) and which have no traditional British equivalent are perfectly legitimate.        
	Whats wrong there? Muddled wording, for a start. Presumably its the devices that were invented in the USA: the neologisms are already defined as US. But that clearly implies that its also the devices which have no traditional British equivalent  which just as clearly isnt what the writer intends. Next, the grammar. One error sticks out: singular subject, the import; plural verb, are. Ouch. Theres another, harder to spot: and which, in place of simple which. Quite a lot for one sentence. Still, it serves a purpose: muddle apart, it neatly displays two distinct levels of error.        
	We all know that a singular subject doesnt take a plural verb, or vice versa: no one says man walk or men walks. You may hear phrases like we was walking, but even those who use them know theyre wrong. The error is not rare, even in the grandest newspapers, especially when a singular subject is separated by a host of plurals from its verb. Nor, though spreading, is it recent: Fowler denounced it a century ago.        
	True, there are exceptions. Politics is or politics are? It depends on the context. Collective nouns  the crowd is or are? Its up to you. But listen to the sense (unlike the officials avowing that the government are united, as if unity sat well with a plural verb). And some such nouns, used in their root sense, not metaphorically, need a singular verb: a swarm of taxmen are after him, fine, but a swarm of bees is.        
	So much for the blatant error. But theres another sort, as in that and which above: the grammarians error. At school I was taught to shun phrases like a man much hated, and who deserved it. Let it read who was much hated, and who, or a man much hated and one who; or simply be recast as, say, much hated, and deservedly. I stick to this rule, but I wouldnt die for it. There are many such rules, and some dont deserve the name: split infinitives, eg, are to be avoided, yet sometimes one is justifiable, even necessary. Quite often Im uncertain where to draw the line.         
	But then Im not a member of the English Academy whose birth I wrote of four weeks ago, and whose sponsors prose supplied the sentence quoted in my first paragraph above. The sponsors, a body called the Queens English Society, are not wholly happy with the reception their academy got. To their website, its critics are beasts of prey.        
	The lions, it seems, were linguists and the like defending their territory, who could not tolerate the upstart QES encroaching on it (to be exact, on their own game, but lets not mix our metaphors before we have to). Far worse were the common curs who maul and massacre the language and aint not going to ave no smart git tellin em wot theyve got to say  and evidently told the QES so in crude blogspeak.         
	In between came the scavenging rooks who scrabble around to find some comma or hyphen misplaced in QES prose and crow, these people think they know it all yet they have made a mistake themselves, caw, caw, caw! Your wordcager? It was, for the record, five unneeded commas, three missing ones and a sentence of wild obscurity that I noted in a dozen short lines of QES English, but so be it. And its nice to see the QES admit that its folk are human and even they are not above making mistakes. As even they prove again in the sentence Ive cited. And as  I indeed said so  we are all, but we dont all pose as an academy.        
	But enough. Too much study of the infelicities and plain errors of even the best writers, let alone would-be academicians, are apt to lead one into follies of ones own. Isnt they? Or do I mean arent it?

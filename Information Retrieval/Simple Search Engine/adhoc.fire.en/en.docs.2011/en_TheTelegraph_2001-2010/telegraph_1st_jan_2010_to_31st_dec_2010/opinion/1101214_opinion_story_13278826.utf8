	Terror returns                  
	Sir  The recent bomb blast in Varanasi proved, yet again, that the Indian government is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens (Blast kills toddler, groups cite Ayodhya verdict, Dec 8). Even after the ghastly Mumbai attacks, little has been done to prevent terror strikes across the country. Islamic fundamentalism continues to hold the country at ransom.          
	A large number of the worlds terror strikes takes place in India. Other countries, like the United States of America and the United Kingdom, have managed to thwart several attacks and apprehend suspected terrorists over the last few years. Indian intelligence agencies lag far behind in this regard.           
	Moreover, India has failed to take decisive steps against Pakistan, even though there is substantial evidence of the latters involvement in a number of attacks. As a result, Pakistan continues to ignore Indias pleas to crack down on terrorist training camps on its soil.          
	With Indias leaders busy fending off charges of corruption, the threat of more terror strikes remains ignored. It is pointless to appease the US and rely on its support in the fight against terror. The recent expos by WikiLeaks seems to indicate that the US will only listen to the countries that might harm its own interests. Indias stance on this matter and its failure to combat terrorism are shameful for a country that hopes to become a superpower.           
	Yours faithfully, Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur            
	Sir  The blast in Varanasi  which resulted in the death of a child and of a 45-year-old pilgrim from Madhya Pradesh  was tragic. However, it is a relief to know that there were no more casualties. The panic triggered off by the blast could have resulted in a fatal stampede. If the terrorists responsible for the blast had planned for more deaths, they were unsuccessful.          
	However, the government has failed in its responsibility. Although intelligence agencies had given prior warning of the attack, the authorities were unable to prevent it. The terrorist group, Indian Mujahideen, which claimed responsibility for the blast, is already known to the government. It is supposed to have masterminded the attack near Jama Masjid on September 19 as well. The government should have monitored the outfit closely after that incident.          
	India would do well to follow the USs example. Recently, American intelligence officials unearthed the package bomb plot. Not long ago, US security had intercepted mysterious parcels sent from Yemen. This was later thought to be a dry run for the package bomb plot. It is only the vigilance of the American security agencies that had prevented a disaster. Earlier this year, a car bomb planted in New Yorks Times Square was detected in time and the alleged culprit arrested. The Indian government should take urgent measures to reform and strengthen its security systems. No more lives should be lost in terror attacks.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In the wake of the blast in Varanasi, the Central government and the Uttar Pradesh government have been locked in a blame game (Ghats stop aarti for three days, Dec 9). However, after the Mumbai attacks and the blast at the German Bakery, the Maharashtra government and the Centre were in perfect accord. The reason for this contrast is obvious: the Congress is in power at the Centre as well as in Maharashtra. But in UP, the ruling Bahujan Samaj Party shares a turbulent relationship with the Congress.            
	Yours faithfully, Arun Malankar, Mumbai          
	Sir  After the ordeal of 26/11, counter-terrorism measures had been adopted and intelligence systems strengthened. But the blast in Varanasi is a grim reminder of the fact that our intelligence department still has serious shortcomings. Effective intelligence gathering is essential for preventing terror strikes.          
	The countrys intelligence wing seems to have been neglected, and perhaps its officers have little incentive to work in it. They are required to keep a low profile and even their successes are kept largely under wraps. The government must commit itself to building an effective and efficient system of intelligence. To begin with, dedicated officers should be appointed. A spirit of dynamism and professionalism must be infused in the ranks of the countrys intelligence personnel.          
	The intelligence services have dealt with even greater challenges in the past. In the present crisis, there is no reason why it cannot rise to combat terrorism at the urban centres.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The blast in Varanasi was a barbaric act of terror. Such acts of violence affect people of all faiths and need to be condemned on humanitarian grounds. Places of religious significance like Varanasi are known to be sensitive spots. However, it is difficult to keep such places under close surveillance all the time. Concentrating security in a few areas may leave other spots vulnerable to attack. Terrorism has only one long-term solution. People from all faiths should abjure religious hatred and learn to live in harmony.   
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  After the attack on Mumbai in 2008, the Union government had pledged to eliminate terror attacks once and for all from India. However, just two years later, the spectre of terrorist attacks has returned with the tragedy in Varanasi. The recent incident reflects the incompetence of the government. The Congress seems to lack the political will to eliminate terror.   
	Yours faithfully,       
Sravana Ramachandran, Ooty

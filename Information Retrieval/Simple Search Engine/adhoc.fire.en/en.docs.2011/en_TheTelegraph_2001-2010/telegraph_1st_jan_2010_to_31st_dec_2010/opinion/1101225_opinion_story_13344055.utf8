                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HERE COMES HERITAGE                                                                  
	For lovers of a special kind of music, there is only one zebra crossing in the world. It is located on Abbey Road in north London. On an August morning 41 years ago, four long-haired musicians from Liverpool were photographed crossing here. The photograph, the result of a ten-minute long shoot, appeared on the album called Abbey Road. The rest, as the saying goes, is history. The album and the picture were endowed with greater significance because Abbey Road turned out to be the last album the Beatles recorded together. (Let it Be was released later, but had actually been recorded earlier.) In Abbey Road, the Beatles, aware that this was probably their collective swansong, forgot their differences and squabbling and decided to go out singing on a high note. The photograph carried hints that it could be the last time the band would be performing together. The shadow of death hung over the photograph. There was the interpretation that the four figures walking over the zebra crossing represented a funeral procession: Paul McCartney was dead; a dopplegnger had been used in his place and the bare feet suggested a corpse. John Lennon, leading the procession in a white suit (cut by the Savile Row tailor, Tommy Nutter), was said to represent a clergyman; Ringo Starr, second in line, wore a black undertakers suit and George Harrison, bringing up the rear, after McCartney, is the grave-digger, dressed in denim everyday clothes. The interpretation had its moment and died down. But the photograph remained etched in public memory, as did the zebra crossing.        
	The zebra crossing has now been granted Grade II listing by the heritage and tourism department of Great Britain. The studios on Abbey Road, where the Beatles had recorded many of their songs, had been accorded similar status in February. Abbey Road and its zebra crossing are now part of British heritage as much as the eponymous album is part of musical history. Purists will raise a question: is the zebra crossing that is now listed the same one on which the Beatles were photographed walking? The point is more than a quibble as researchers have pointed out that the crossing of the photograph was actually further north than where the crossing is located today. But no one quite knows when and why the crossing was moved. Popular perception, fortunately, has no time or patience for such nitpicking. For music lovers, the present zebra crossing on Abbey Road is the zebra crossing on which John, Ringo, Paul and George walked, and one of them barefoot to boot.        
	That a zebra crossing can be made part of heritage shows how fluid and capacious the idea of heritage has become. Even public memory has become part of the past that Britain wants to cherish. Four figures walking over a set of symmetrical white lines has more mythical value than other great crossings.

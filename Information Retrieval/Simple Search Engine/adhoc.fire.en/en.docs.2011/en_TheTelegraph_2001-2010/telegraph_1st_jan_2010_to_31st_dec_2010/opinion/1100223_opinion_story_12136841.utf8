	It is only in the last quarter century that mankind has begun to grapple with the fact that the earths atmosphere is not a limitless resource. This stark reality has been brought home to us by climate change. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, mankind has been burning ever increasing quantities of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) and the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the principal cause of global warming. Scientists tell us that if the progressive concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is allowed to exceed a certain range, it will lead to dangerous interference with the climate system.        
	In other words, the planets atmosphere must be treated as a scarce resource. The current negotiations on climate change seek to limit greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and thus, in effect, regulate access to the global atmospheric resource. Since fossil fuels are the main source of carbon dioxide emissions, a climate change agreement has major implications for the levels and patterns of energy consumption available to signatory countries.        
	For a developing country like India, it is essential that any agreement should be based on equity, that it should not slow down economic and social development and poverty eradication or perpetuate the vast economic divide between the developed and developing countries.              
	The vast bulk of the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere has originated in the industrialized countries as a result of their very high levels of consumption of coal, oil and gas. These countries are thus occupying much more than their fair share of atmospheric space. In order to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, the developed countries must reduce their per capita emissions, releasing adequate atmospheric space for the development of poorer countries.        
	India has always maintained the principled position that every human being has an equal right to the global atmospheric resource. Per capita emissions of developing countries are a small fraction of those of the industrialized countries. For example, Indias per capita emission is just a little over one tonne of CO2e, compared to more than 19 tonnes CO2 of the United States of America. Per capita emissions of poorer countries will rise as their energy consumption increases to meet the requirements of economic and social development and poverty eradication.         
	As the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change notes, The largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.        
	Equity demands that, over a period of time, the declining per capita emissions of the developed countries should converge with the rising per capita emissions of the developing countries, while compensating the latter for the excess atmospheric space previously occupied by the developed countries. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change requires the affluent industrialized countries to cover the incremental costs of mitigation and adaptation actions in developing countries. The international community should combat climate change on the basis of equity.        
	The Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has proposed that Indias per capita emissions will not, at any stage, exceed those of the developed countries. This is not only a fair but even a generous offer. It is no more than an assertion of our right to utilize an equal measure of energy on a per capita basis as the developed countries, provided we adopt the same energy mix and technology as the advanced countries.        
	Perpetuating the vast disparity between the per capita emissions of the advanced and the developing countries would amount to perpetuating the huge differences in their per capita income levels. A climate change treaty that binds us to lower per capita emissions over the long term will also restrict our per capita use of coal, oil and natural gas to lower levels than those of developed countries, making it virtually impossible for us to close the income gap with those countries. Any climate change agreement that denies us our right to equal utilization of the global atmospheric resource would be an unequal treaty restricting our right to development. It would divide the world into two categories of countries: those who are rich and those who are poorer  and treaty-bound to remain poorer.         
	Not surprisingly, the principle of equity based on an equal per capita approach has served as the basic foundation of our position in the climate change negotiations, ever since they began in 1990. Every government in New Delhi has endorsed this approach, reflecting a national consensus cutting across party lines.        
	This consensus has now been challenged by the minister of state for environment, Jairam Ramesh. Earlier this month, major national newspapers carried the startling report that the minister of state had indicated that India may abandon the per capita approach. The minister added that the US-based economist, Arvind Subramanian, has been commissioned to prepare a paper on alternative options. This is not the place to critique Subramanians writing on climate change; suffice it to say that he rejects the per capita equity approach. Jairam Ramesh also revealed that he plans to hold an international workshop in May, so that a new approach is ready before the climate change negotiations scheduled for June.              
	Rejecting the per capita principle would undermine the position of India and other developing countries on the question of climate equity. By proposing to decapitate the principle of equity, the minister has already inflicted severe damage to our credibility in the negotiations.        
	Rameshs statement gives rise to a number of questions. First, did the minister of state consult the cabinet before questioning in public the basic foundation of our long-standing national policy? After all, the per capita approach has been regularly endorsed by cabinet decisions over the past two decades.        
	Second, does the minister of state plan to consult Parliament and, if so, when? Should a policy resting on a national consensus be reversed without reference to Parliament?        
	Third, does Ramesh propose to consult Indias civil society and the Indian public? Would a national workshop not have been a more appropriate forum to debate a possible reversal of Indias policy than an international gathering?        
	These disturbing questions require immediate answers. Our policy on a vitally important issue like climate change must rest on a national consensus. It cannot be arbitrarily refashioned on a personal whim. A major policy reversal, such as the approach contemplated by the minister of state for environment, should be taken only if it is approved by Parliament.

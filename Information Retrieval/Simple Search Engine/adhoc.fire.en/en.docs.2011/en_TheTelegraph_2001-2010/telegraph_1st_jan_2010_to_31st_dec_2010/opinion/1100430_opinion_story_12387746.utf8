	Struck hard                  
	Sir  The nationwide strike in protest against the rise in food prices seems to have affected only Calcutta (Ouch! The great betrayal, April 28). The city wore a deserted look while places like Mumbai remained normal.          
	Meanwhile, members of parliament from the Trinamul Congress, who claim to champion the rights of the aam aadmi, continue to support those in power at the Centre who are responsible for the price rise. It seems that a ministerial post has silenced certain members of the party. After the TMCs strident protests against the Left Front governments measures in Singur and Nandigram, there was some hope that things would change for the better once it joined the United Progressive Alliance government. This proved to be a false promise. West Bengal needs a leader who would root out the entrenched corruption and rid the state of the culture of bandhs once and for all.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Perhaps a concern for the environment, as well as the rise in food prices, prompted the Left Front to call for a Bharat bandh. Virtually empty roads accounted for a drastic fall in suspended particulate matter and, after a welcome bout of rain, the city wore a washed look.          
	For those who ventured out of their homes, there was another big relief. The roads rang with something akin to the sound of silence. There were no screaming hawkers, frantic honking by drivers or the roar of diesel engines. With the government making no discernable attempt to tackle the problem of air pollution, frequent bandhs could have the salutary effect of making the citys air somewhat more fit for breathing.          
	Perhaps there should be a consensus on reserving some more days for celebrating the environment. This would encourage the Left Front and other parties in the state to clear the roads more often. Not that they need any encouragement.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Subhayu Saha,Khagra, Murshidabad                        
	Sir  Strikes and bandhs have become a dime a dozen. Unfortunately, the only solution a political party can think of when confronted with a problem is to call a strike. Even if one accepts that protesting against injustice is a democratic right, one has to admit the fact that bandhs bring life to a standstill. A strike or bandh is a political weapon, but it must be used judiciously. However, political parties use this weapon frequently, without realizing the trouble that it causes to people. During bandhs, day labourers find it difficult to make ends meet. Attendance in offices and factories is minimal because of the non-availability of transport. As a result, the economy suffers and prices of commodities shoot up. Schools and colleges remain shut, thereby hampering the education sector. Sometimes, there is violence too when rival supporters clash. All this makes bandhs unacceptable to common citizens.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Subha Chatterjee, Burdwan                      
	Sir  The Telegraphs polygraph test on the five Calcuttans (Take the truth test, gentlemen, April 28) should have excluded the two Chakrabartis  Gautam Mohan and Asok Mohan  since they are subservient to their political masters. Ever since the Left Front came to power in West Bengal, statements made by the police commissioner and the chief secretary are meant for the medias consumption only.          
	It is alarming to note that the bureaucracy and the police, two institutions that are supposed to stay neutral, have become an integral part of the political set-up. It is being said that there will be a change of guard after the elections next year. Even in that case, the new incumbents to these positions would find it extremely difficult to remain unbiased.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Coded message          
	Sir  The central government has constituted the Unique Identification Authority of India with a budget that runs into a few hundred crores to issue identity numbers to citizens. But this provision has not been made mandatory. At the same time, the government has been working on the National Population Register as well as the all-India census. A considerable amount of money has already been allocated to each of these projects.          
	The three separate exercises will lead to a colossal wastage of resources and add to the existing confusion. The government should merge the three and make the unique identification number compulsory. The UIN should serve as proof of residence as well as of land ownership. The UIN card should also facilitate the recording of multiple addresses of an individual. If the UIN is not made compulsory, most members of parliament will not care to register their names for this unique initiative.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
J.K. Bubna, Calcutta

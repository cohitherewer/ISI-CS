The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Royalty is not enough
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ROYALTY IS NOT ENOUGH                              Bookwise                                    
	Can authors live on their royalties alone? Come March-end, which closes the financial year, and almost all authors realize that royalties are never quite enough. At best, they constitute a supplementary income that has to be backed up by a regular job or by a range of freelance work that brings in a monthly income to keep their writing going. Besides, over the years, there has been a great flexibility in the paying of royalties, mostly tilted in favour of publishers who have cut the authors share because of rising production and marketing costs and other overhead expenses.         
	Hence the question that many authors ask today: with diminishing returns, is it worth their time and money to write books instead of articles for newspapers and magazines, which have an inexhaustible appetite for raw materials, thanks to the expansion of the media?        
	First, the basic facts. An authors earnings from a book come from royalties  his share of the sale price as determined by the publisher. The standard hardback royalty scale was 10 per cent on the first 1,000 copies, that went up to 12.5 per cent thereafter. On certain smaller print runs, the royalty reverted back to being 10 per cent. On mass-market paperbacks, the royalty was 7.5 per cent of the published price, rising to 10 per cent after 15,000 copies. This was the standard formula followed by almost all publishers till the 1990s, though generalizations can be misleading.         
	No longer. The standard formula now is 7.5 per cent on hardback editions for the first print, going up to 10 per cent for subsequent reprints, and 5 per cent for mass-market paperbacks. Thats not all. The 7.5 per cent or 5 per cent is calculated not on the full-published price but on the net receipts by the publisher or on the amount he gets after the trade discount he gives to the retailer. That is, if the published price is Rs 100, and the publisher gives a standard discount of 25 per cent, the authors royalty would be calculated on Rs 75  which is Rs 5.6 for the hardback and Rs 3.75 for paperback, assuming both hardback and paperback prices are the same. Since the standard discount is not spelt out in the publishers contract to the author (because of variable discounts offered by publishers in the trade), disputes on royalties are a constant source of friction between them.        
	Apart from reduced royalties because of the net receipts clause, there is a hidden agreement between publishers and authors now. First-time authors who are still unknown (well-knownness is increasingly becoming one of the important criteria for getting published), are asked to pay a substantial proportion of the production costs that could go up to full production costs. It is expected that the author would be compensated with enhanced royalties, but since first-timers know little about production costs, many publishers just pass this over.        
	Of course, much depends on the authors negotiating muscle or on how keen he is to get his book published. If he can slog it out with his publisher and keep his options open on the choice of the publisher, he could get some concessions on production costs. But there will be none on royalty rates which have now been standardized with most publishers.        
	Authors will have to accept lower royalties and hope that other spin-offs from being published will compensate for their labours. Or they can enlarge their field of activities by writing more frequently in the media which make them better-known, thus enabling them to set their own terms.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The power of two is greater than the might of one
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE POWER OF TWO IS GREATER THAN THE MIGHT OF ONE                              The ruling parties and the Opposition must learn to work together for the sake of a better West Bengal in the years to come, writes Shyamal Datta                                Stubbornly divided				                                             
	Without being apologetic or mincing words, the locals made it clear that the 2011 elections were going to be historic as they would bring the curtain down on the 33-year-long uninterrupted rule of the Left Front government in West Bengal. The series of election results, from panchayats to Parliament, in the past one year, had made the writing on the wall all too clear  it is only going to become more prominent after the state municipal elections this year.        
	This perception, right or wrong, has made the ruling front somewhat defensive. Sharp battlelines are being drawn between contending political alliances. A definite note of belligerence is noticed in the utterances and activities of party leaders and workers. This has been a common feature in West Bengal, thanks to the politics of violence perpetuated by the ruling dispensation since 1967.              
	The parts of South 24 Parganas I visited were known for frequent spurts of violence between jotedars and peasants. Threats, intimidation, coercion, social boycott and violence have been the weapons to muffle dissent and force submission to the dictates of the parties in their respective areas of control and influence. The doling out of political patronage and favours has given rise to special interest groups as opposed to those with legitimate entitlements. The administration has been manipulated, leveraged as part of well-calibrated designs to subvert the state machinery, and made to toe the party line right down to the grassroots. The work culture in government offices has become a thing of the past.        
	Fiefdoms have sprung up and thrived for years, much to the chagrin of those who profess different ideologies. With the whiff of change in the air, those who have been suffering for not following the lines of a particular party or parties are now becoming vocal and violent, and also getting involved in acts of reprisals. No wonder the state known for its peace, forced under the jackboots of the party satraps, is now reporting lawlessness on a regular basis.              
	The overnight flush of support for the Congress-TMC alliance and their successive victories at the hustings are attributed to a marked shift in the allegiance of those people, who, out of fear and panic, had preferred to keep quiet and acquiesced in the highhandedness of the ruling parties. Even a section of those known to be owing allegiance to the Left, is now changing colour and taking shelter under the wings of those expected to be on the winning side in the final round of the electoral battle. The streams of support from these two categories seem to have combined to project an overwhelming growth in the support base of the Congress-TMC alliance. In the midst of such a fast-changing scenario, what perplexes saner and non-politicized people is the TMCs inimical stand of having no truck with the Left Front  and with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), in particular  in spite of being the official opposition party in the state. The party has issued diktats that there will be no sharing of platform with representatives of the ruling front. This has raised legitimate questions as to whether the TMC believes in parliamentary democracy, in which the Opposition and the government in office are required to act in a responsible manner, discharging their assigned roles of serving the interests of the people and the state. How would the TMC react if the same treatment is meted out to it while it might be office? Does the party think that friends and foes are permanent in politics?        
	The lifeline of any relationship  social, economic or political  is communication, dialogue and debate. How can a party, which is expecting to sit at the high table of governance, take a stand of having nothing to do with the one in power today, thereby throwing all norms of decency and decorum to the winds? Such a position is not only impetuous but also politically immature. Always saying no to everything that the adversary does or says may be good short-term politics but it definitely does not indicate leadership qualities. Outright non-cooperation only sharpens the political divide that the Left rule has brought about. Relentless hostility only perpetuates instability and chaos.        
	The TMC has to think in terms of taking critical decisions with a strategic mindset. Without that, it would find it difficult to push forward the political process as and when it is able to assume the responsibility of running the state. The party, or its allies, cannot be part of the problems and not of the solution. It has to summon wisdom, will and courage to play a constructive role, whether as Opposition or in government, with due deference to democratic norms, burying all that went wrong in the past and undermined democratic processes.With determination and sincerity, it has to take initiatives to pave the way for the campaign of bipartisanship to grow as a distinct policy and set the tone for a new mantra of governance. The problems confronting the state are stupendous and its challenges formidable. These need active involvement and participation of all the players in the system, with a well-charted road map for their resolution.        
	Sometimes I wonder that if the Democrats, under the dynamic leadership of President Barak Obama, can reach out to the Islamic world, what prevents the TMC, under Mamata Banerjee (no comparison inferred), from reaching out to the people outside the ideology of her party but living in her own state? Why should she think all the time along party lines, and not treat the state as a constituency for its growth and development in a bipartisan spirit?        
	If the party is people-centric, not individual-centric, it cannot afford to pursue policies that only polarize the society along party affiliations. After all, the common man is not engaged in any politics. He is engaged only in the day-to-day struggle for survival. For him, what matters is not any ism, but bread, shelter, health, education and job. It is worth remembering that the partisan politics that the state witnessed for the last 33 years has led to the alienation of a large chunk of people, whose sentiments the TMC is now harvesting to bring about a better tomorrow that has been long overdue. Divisive politics has undermined the efficacy of institutions and systems, thus weakening the state. Let that tradition not be sustained, through the same mistakes made by the rulers over the years. Policies that divide the people do not strengthen democracy, but vitiate the political climate for the government in office as well as for the Opposition.        
	Leaders at the two ends of the political spectrum have to realize and appreciate how hard it is to navigate the transition from the role of Opposition to the world of actual public administration. Opposition for the sake of opposition is often infectious and creates a strong urge to pay back in the same coin. The people of West Bengal have been witness to this, they know how seriously this has compounded their sufferings. The politics of vendetta, if pursued, do not take much time to turn the angels of today into the devils of tomorrow and vice versa. This brand of politics is bound to provide the same opportunities the next time, on a much faster pace than before, for the political opponents to coast back to power, exploiting the failings of the adversaries. Politics is said to be the art of the possible, and treating political opponents as untouchables is far from the norms of this art. Those who fail to adopt it make hapless victims of the people and the job of governance difficult.              
	The need of the hour is a strategic outlook to encourage greater sensitivity to issues, aided by policies that hold the people, not the party, as being central to administration. These policies would help address problems of sluggish economic growth, unemployment, poor infrastructure, lawlessness and other deficiencies, effectively. Good politics is needed for good governance. Bad politics engender bad policies. Good policies help meet basic needs, mitigate grievances and fulfil the aspirations of the people. Good politics creates space for voices to express themselves freely without undermining the interests of the State, its strategic compulsions and humanitarian values. Bad politics shuts the door on healthy political debate, the staple of a vibrant democracy.        
	West Bengal needs reconciliation. Political leaders must bury the hatchet and make a new beginning, guided by greater circumspection, understanding and initiative to work in the larger interests of the state. This will be possible when the campaign of bipartisanship starts gathering momentum by enlisting the support of all sections of people. From now till the 2011 assembly elections, people are going to watch keenly and assess the manner in which political parties conduct themselves and demonstrate their ability to run the state in a responsible manner. The Left sees fresh signs of hope in the overwhelming emotional support expressed by a cross section of people at the demise of their legendary leader, in the recent successes at some college union elections, and in the greater response to the partys philosophy after the debacle at the Lok Sabha elections, triggered off by the self-defeating posturing of the opponents. Left leaders are hopeful that these developments may help improve the chances of the front in the upcoming elections to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and over 80 municipalities in the state as a prelude to an improved showing in the assembly polls. The Left hopes to retain power, albeit with a reduced margin.              
	The Congress-TMC combine is surely aware of the shifts in the mood of the people, if any. Notwithstanding, it would be better advised to bear in mind that sensible and non-politicized sections of the people cannot, and do not, view its continued boycott of meetings and discussions in which the ruling parties are present with any measure of kindness. The recent boycott of the meeting with the finance ministry in New Delhi by state government functionaries (including the irrigation minister) on financial grants for repairs of embankments devastated by Aila and flood control measures in East and West Midnapore is the latest in a series of self-defeating posturings of the party. Such gestures may cost the party dearly in the long run. Even if it emerges triumphant at the hustings in 2011, it may have to be prepared for an uphill journey with frequent road blocks, some of which will be its own doing and others prompted by the irresponsible acts of its adversaries.        
	There is still time left to ponder and change, and shift gear to reconciliation. The two power blocs will have to move simultaneously and show greater sagacity in the interest of the state. A sincere joint endeavour will go a long way in cleansing the environment of mistrust, rancour and suspicion that has prevailed for decades. But the million-dollar question is Will they be able to meet the peoples expectations of bipartisan politics as an instrument of governance? I sincerely hope that they give it some serious thought.

	As I write this, the Commonwealth Games are just a few days away. The controversies related to the Games, the public utterances of Lalit Bhanot and the like, have all hogged newspaper headlines. Some of the incidents are so ridiculous that they are funny  black comedy style. However, the overwhelming feeling is one of sadness and shame because the preparations or the lack of them, the apathy and scale of corruption, all reveal a gross failure of governance. If various wings of the government such as the public works department, the Delhi Development Authority and others cannot manage an event of relatively small magnitude, what hope do we have that the government will be an efficient manager of the economy?        
	Fortunately, the State plays an increasingly diminished role in the economy under normal circumstances. I have deliberately added the caveat normal circumstances because the actions and policies of the Central government were very important during the recent global recession  the government did manage to insulate the Indian economy from the carnage and mayhem occurring in much of the world economy.         
	Those days seem far away and the economy is thriving. Virtually all indicators look very promising. The economy has been growing steadily for some time now. The immediate future looks even more promising. Forecasts made by the government as well as several private organizations are all uniformly upbeat  the forecasts of the rate of growth of the gross domestic product fall in a narrow band of 8.5 -9 per cent. Since these forecasts were made before the onset of the monsoon, they did not take its impact on the economy into account. The rainfall this year has been extremely good in almost all parts of the country. So, agricultural output will be bountiful in the coming months, and this will have positive effects on the rest of the economy.               
	An important side effect of the steady growth of the economy has been a large increase in tax revenues accruing to the government. Indirect tax revenues have gone up by 45 per cent during April to August. Corporate tax payments have increased by 17 per cent, while personal tax payments have gone up by roughly 10 per cent during the same period. The increase in the latter component is probably, in part, owing to a greater degree of compliance by taxpayers. Of course, Indian taxpayers have not suddenly become more upright citizens  the increased compliance has been forced on them because the tax authorities have made it harder to evade taxes.        
	Apart from the increased tax revenue, the government has also received a bonanza in the form of the proceeds from the auction of telecom licences. The total amount collected by the government from different zones has exceeded all expectations. Roughly midway through the financial year, it is almost certain that the actual revenues collected by the government will exceed the projections made in the budget.         
	As a result, the government is planning to cut back its market borrowings during the rest of the financial year. This is good news for the private sector. Government borrowings tend to crowd out private borrowings in the sense that less is left for private sector borrowings. So, lower government borrowings will help keep market interest rates in check even if there is an increased demand for credit from the private sector. This is quite likely since credit requirements inevitably go up during phases of rapid growth.         
	Will the significantly more promising budgetary situation of the Centre be a one-off event? Greater tax compliance and steady growth in the GDP will ensure larger inflows of revenue to the exchequer. Of course, there will be no windfall gain in the form of auctions of telecom licences in the next few years. However, the government will probably be able to gain fairly substantial sums from a larger disinvestment programme. Perhaps, this will enable the government to restrict the size of its borrowing programme during the next few years. Most conservative economists who feel that the burgeoning public debt is not sustainable will certainly recommend this course of action.         
	There is one black lining to the silver clouds surrounding the Indian economy. While the increased economic activity within the country has led to a surge in imports, the continuing sluggishness in the global economy has meant that our exports have more or less stagnated. The combined effect has been a steep increase in the trade deficit. During the last quarter, the trade deficit has been as high as 10 per cent of the GDP. In other times, a floating exchange rate would have mitigated the severity of the problem  the external value of the rupee would fall, making imports more expensive and exports cheaper. This, in turn, would have reduced imports and increased exports.              
	This self-correcting mechanism does not work any more. As readers of The Telegraph are probably aware, the Indian stock exchange has now become one of the best performers in the world. Since the growth of the real economy has also been an outlier in terms of global growth rates, India has become one of the favourite destinations of foreign institutional investors. There has been a huge inflow of foreign funds, mainly on account of portfolio investment. So, there is no danger of the country running out of foreign exchange in order to pay for the trade deficit. In fact, there has been an increase in our foreign exchange reserves. Not surprisingly, there has been no decrease in the external value of the rupee.         
	There are apprehensions that this is an unstable situation. While some of the major European economies  in particular Germany and France  look as if they have resumed robust growth, many other countries, including the United States of America, continue to stagnate. So, the global demand for our exports is unlikely to pick up any time soon. On the other hand, imports may not taper off. So, the trade imbalance is likely to persist for some time. Portfolio investment can be very volatile. For instance, redemption pressures in the country of origin may force the FIIs to withdraw funds from Indian stocks.         
	Fortunately, our stock of foreign exchange reserves provides a very comfortable cushion. We can pay for several months imports even if the inflow of foreign funds on account of portfolio investment dries up completely. So, there is every reason to be cheerful as far as the economy is concerned.       The author is professor of economics, University of Warwick

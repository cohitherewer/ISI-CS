	There is an injunction derived from the code of British public schools that says juniors should be seen and not heard. This principle applies with greater vehemence to the behaviour of senior bureaucrats. In a popular democracy, it is not the job of bureaucrats, however senior, to make public statements. In fact, at the best of times, they should not even make public appearances. Public statements should be made by the minister concerned. A bureaucrat, almost by definition, is the backroom boy that Humphrey Appleby personified in the serial, Yes Minister. The home secretary, G.K. Pillai, transgressed this simple code by making the statement regarding the involvement of the Inter-Services Intelligence in the attack on Mumbai in November 2008. It is not the veracity of what Mr Pillai said that is at issue. Or even the timing of the statement  since it was made when the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan were engaged in crucial talks. Mr Pillai should not have spoken; the matter ends there.        
	One wrong cannot, however, be rectified by another wrong. The foreign minister, S.M.Krishna, publicly criticized Mr Pillai for the timing of his statement. Here again, what is critical is not what Mr Krishna said but his manner of saying it. A minister should not criticize or rebuke a senior bureaucrat in public. Ideally, Mr Krishna should have spoken to the home minister and expressed his reservations to him rather than speaking in the public domain. It is unfortunate that in India both bureaucrats and ministers are so eager to speak on camera that they have forgotten the meaning and importance of the term, in camera. Mr Krishna and Mr Pillai have been in public life long enough to know the unwritten proprieties that govern the high offices they hold. It has become an unseemly practice in Indian public life of ministers tweeting or speaking out of class, or ministers and bureaucrats having public spats, or of ministers criticizing senior bureaucrats in public. All this is compounded by the spectacle of ministers brazenly staying away from their offices and duties to nurture their electoral fortunes. These only serve to erode the dignity of public office. The prime minister cannot afford to sit back and let all this happen. He is not an impartial observer. He is the leader of the government and therefore the leader of the country. Too much is at stake to take refuge in masterly inactivity.

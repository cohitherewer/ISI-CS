	The fight to be civilized is hard and lonely. But Chanderpati was not consciously fighting for civilization in her village in Haryana, she was fighting for justice. Her son and daughter-in-law had been murdered by the girls relatives on the instructions of the area khap panchayat or caste council, for having married within the same gotra or sub-caste. Ms Chanderpati wanted the law of the land to punish the killers, the law that the khap panchayats active in Haryana, Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh completely ignore. This was a historic step, and Ms Chanderpati found almost no one by her side. These self-styled councils are responsible for numerous killings of young couples, for forced separations of man from wife and child from mother, as well as for outlawing and banishing families of those who marry against the panchayats diktat. Their power derives as much from tradition as from political patronage. It is not difficult to see that political leaders who rely on caste-based voting would nurture such powerful caste groups. The Haryana chief minister calls khap panchayats the repository of tradition and values.        
	Ms Chanderpatis struggle has culminated in death sentences for the five men who did the actual killing. The panchayat head who ordered the murder has been given a life sentence. But the police, who looked away when the couple was kidnapped and who delayed identification of the bodies, have gone unpunished. Yet the courts verdict comes at a time when the caste councils activities are drawing attention. The Union home minister has already expressed angry concern, and changes are being proposed to the relevant laws. Death resulting from the dictates of a khap panchayat will be treated as a distinct kind of murder in which everyone taking part in the decision will be regarded as guilty. The change will not be easy, but Ms Chanderpati has set an inspiring example.

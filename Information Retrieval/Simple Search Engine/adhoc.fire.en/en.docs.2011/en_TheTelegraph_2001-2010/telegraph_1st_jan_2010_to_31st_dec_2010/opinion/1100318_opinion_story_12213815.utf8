	Magic on stage                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitras article, Exit of a civilization (March 12), was an excellent attempt to help readers understand Kumar Roy, who breathed his last on March 1. The life of Kumarendu Narayan Roy Chowdhury, as Kumar Roy was known before he joined the theatre group, Bohurupee, is a history of sorts and it was presented by Mitra with enviable lan.          
	Hailing from a rich family in Dinajpur, the doyen of Bengali theatre had a chequered career. Roy loved his profession deeply and gradually mastered the art of lifting theatre to sublime heights in tandem with fast-changing social realities. He knew how to marry form with content to make his creations intellectually nourishing and aesthetically enduring.          
	Mitra describes how Roys thoughts were metamorphosed after he was befriended by that mad genius, Ritwik Ghatak. The penchant for producing amateur plays for domestic entertainment gave way to a passion for mass theatre that eventually led to the discovery of Roy as a partisan with a cause. Bohurupee provided a platform for the blossoming of his innate genius. He revered the legendary Sombhu Mitra as his guru, and remained devoted to the latters concept and vision of theatre. A dramatic turn of events came about when Sombhu and Tripti Mitra parted ways with Bohurupee. Roy felt dejected, but soon recovered from the shock with the help of Khaled Chowdhury and Tapas Sen, who inspired Roy to stay put in Bohurupee and help the group retain its pristine glory. Even with his popularity scaling a peak, Roy remained humble and believed that the audience was the ultimate judge of the theatre he produced.          
	It was thrilling to see Roy at the theatre halls despite his crippling ailments. He used to appear before the audience after the end of his plays to deliver short but absorbing discourses on the key attributes of good theatre. He also requested the audience to patronize theatre, as theatre groups were often short of funds. As Mitra points out, Roy dominated the Bengali stage for nearly six decades, injecting a new vigour into modern theatre. Hopefully, his appeal and influence will be sustained.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Hurt by art          
	Sir  In Modern is an abstraction (March 14), Ruchir Joshi writes, The parivar mobs and their controllers werent bothered about the quality of Husains art  they had no means or inclination to analyse it  they were attacking what they saw as the effrontery of having a Muslim as the best-known painter of the country. However, Hindu mobs are upset with M.F. Husain for painting Hindu deities in the nude. In a similar vein, Muslims have also criticized the works of the Danish artist who drew cartoons of Prophet Mohammad, as well as those by Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasreen. One wonders why Husain selects Hindu deities as his subjects and then depicts them in an objectionable manner.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ruchir Joshi imitates a handful of Indias pseudo-intellectuals when he insists that the parivar mobs opposed the works of M.F. Husain because they could not accept the idea of a Muslim being the countrys most famous artist. Joshi has suppressed the fact that neither the sangh parivar nor any other ultranationalist outfit has ever harassed artists such as Zakir Hussain, Ustad Bismillah Khan, Amjad Ali Khan or Naseeruddin Shah.          
	Can the denigration of the deities of a liberal and progressive religion be an example of art? If so, Husain should try and practise his art in another country. But he should also be aware that in the Arab world, denigration of Islam is punishable by the death penalty. Husains self-imposed exile will not hurt Indias secular and democratic credentials.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur 

                
	New response          
	Sir  A young bride from a Burdwan village has done the right thing by rubbing off her sindoor and annulling her marriage as a mark of protest against the dowry system (Of a different colour, March 14). With women being more empowered now, and with the tabling of the womens reservation bill, it is hoped that incidents of dowry and domestic violence will come down in due time. This incident, in which the groom was punished by the villagers for demanding dowry, will encourage women to raise their voices and force men to think twice before demanding dowry.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Women have the right to live as they wish. It is heartening to read about young brides opposing dowry. If girls from villages can show such courage, so can other Indian women.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Chunku Pani, Orissa

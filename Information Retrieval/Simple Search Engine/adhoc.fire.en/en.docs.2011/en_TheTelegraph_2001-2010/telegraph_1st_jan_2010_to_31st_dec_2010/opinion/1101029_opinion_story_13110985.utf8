The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The romance of the Secret Annex
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE ROMANCE OF THE SECRET ANNEX                                                      Ellie Kendrick as Anne Frank in the 2010 film version of the Diary                      
	Anne Frank: The Book, The Life, The Afterlife By Francine Prose, Atlantic, Rs 999              
	Like a palimpsest, Anne Franks diary has been written over time and time again. First, it would be rewritten by its young author, who went back to the early entries of her diary and reworked them; her father, Otto Frank, who would then edit the diary for publication, and countless others would adapt it for stage and film, teach it in schools, write about it, read it and even deny it. Over the last 60 years, the image of the notebook with the red-checked cloth cover has been inscribed, effaced and reconstructed a number of times. And each time, a picture of Anne Frank forms, melts away and then takes shape once more.         
	Francine Proses latest work  Anne Frank: The Book, The Life, The Afterlife  is yet another gloss on the diary and its author. In this account, Anne Frank is not just any teenager pouring her heart out, but a fierce and intent author who crafted her diary as a work of art. Prose makes a persuasive, if somewhat persistent, argument, pointing out that from the spring of 1944, Anne started revising and redrafting the early entries of her diary. Anne must have written obsessively, for at the same time, she continued adding new entries to her diary. Prose compares passages from the original entries with the reworked versions. Narrative details have been added, characters fleshed out and sentences reconfigured to sharpen their dramatic impact. Anne was already contemplating a romance of the Secret Annex. The book she wanted to write would be called Het Achterhuis or the house behind.         
	Anne speaks about wanting to be a writer, but this is no breathy, wide-eyed ambition. She shrewdly appraises her abilities: I know that I can write, a couple of my stories are good, my descriptions of the Secret Annex are humorous, theres a lot in my diary that speaks, but  whether I have real talent remains to be seen. The Anne Frank that Prose would have us know is a brilliant, complex and extremely self-aware individual. We are to recognize Anne as a writer and the journal not just as a personal diary, but as a deliberate project to document the experience of the time that the Franks spent in hiding, while Holland was under Nazi occupation.         
	In the years after the war, a somewhat sanitized version of the journal was published under the rather sentimental title, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. Otto Frank had edited out most of the references to sex as well as Annes darker speculations on her parents marriage. She was to be the emissary of peace and goodwill in a world still recovering from the war. According to Prose, there was also a move, initiated by Otto, to displace the story from its contexts, both religious and historical. Although some  like the half-crazed writer, Meyer Levin  saw Anne as a symbol of Jewish suffering, her story was universalized. She represented the triumph of the human spirit in adverse circumstances anywhere. The Holocaust, which had claimed her for one of its victims, was relegated to the margins of this heroic tale.         
	The script for the Broadway play, eventually written by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, dwells on a saccharine Anne who believes, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart! The grimmer sections of the passage, where Anne speaks of a world in chaos and of mankinds urge to destruction, are ignored in the play. Prose is critical of the transformation of Anne Frank, both on stage and on film, into a giddy American teenager. The 1959 film, directed by George Stevens, presents a coy, pouting, highly eroticized Anne Frank. The Broadway play had been reticent about the Holocaust. In the Hollywood film, it is used to build up a sexually charged momentum. The moment of Annes first kiss coincides with the arrival of the Gestapo to arrest the occupants of the Secret Annex.        
	While popular culture was reinventing Anne Frank in its own image, there were also those who curated her life and used her story to reach out to people who had suffered other oppressive regimes. Others tried to deny the Holocaust and prove the diary a fake. Prose also documents the complexities of teaching Anne Frank in schools, including the ways in which teachers struggle to introduce young students to the horror of the Holocaust. She ends with her own experience of teaching the text to college students.         
	In fact, the book ends much as it began, with an emphasis on close reading. For Prose, author of a book called Reading Like a Writer, this seems to provide a critical fulcrum. Under her keen scrutiny, the lines of the text yield meaning and shape themselves to her argument. While such readings form some of the most lucid and powerful passages in the book, there is, at times, an uneasy feeling of being coerced into a point of view. This is reinforced in the concluding chapter of the book, when Proses students more or less echo her own observations about the diary at the beginning.         
	Indeed, Proses image of Anne Frank is not that different from the one going around today. The United States Holocaust Museum, for instance, launched an exhibition called Anne Frank, The Writer: An Unfinished Story in 2003. It is tempting to approach Anne Franks diary as a literary work. The story of the Secret Annex closely resembles another work on the Holocaust that has recently won critical acclaim. The literary world has suddenly rediscovered Hans Kielsons Comedy in a Minor Key, first published in 1947. Prose, in a review, pronounced the novel to be a masterpiece. Based on Kielsons own wartime experiences, the novel traces the story of a Jewish man who is hidden by a Dutch couple in Nazi-occupied Holland. Although there is no direct mention of Hitler and the Nazis, the world of Kielsons novel, like Annes Secret Annex, reverberates with the tensions of the world outside. Reading about the diary today almost inevitably brings to mind Kielsons novel.        
	The historical facts about the Holocaust have been extensively documented and are now well known. With a certain distance from the actual events, critics and readers seem to be looking for more literary responses to the Holocaust. Like most of her earlier incarnations, Anne Frank the writer may well be a child of her times.

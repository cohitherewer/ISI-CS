	More than the freak air crash in Mangalore, what reveals the deplorable state of affairs in Air India is the decision of a section of its employees to go on strike. This has virtually grounded the airline, and caused immense trouble to passengers. The ostensible reason for the strike call is to protest against a gag order issued by the airline management on all employees. The order came after some members of the staff had spoken about the crash to the media. Both the reason for and the mode of protest are absurd, and should not be given the time of day. There is no earthly reason why any and every staff member should have the right to hold forth to the media on the crash. The assumption seems to be that being an employee of an airline company makes a person an expert on the business of aviation and on the innumerable number of factors that can cause an aircraft to crash. The management issued the gag order to stop speculation and the circulation of rumours. In fact, if the employees of Air India carried out their duties with responsibility, they would not have the time to talk to the media about matters that are best left to experts. Thus, the reason for going on a strike is no reason at all.        
	The mode of protest is also situated on fragile turf. The strike has not been called by all the employees. In fact, all the employees were not even consulted. The strike has been called by the leaders of two unions  the Air Corporation Employees Union and the All India Aircraft Engineers Association. These two unions claim to have the support of 14,700 employees which is about 50 per cent of the total staff of the airline. Two points need to be noted from these figures. One, around half of the employees are actually outside the ambit of the strike. And two, even those who are actually members of the two unions were not consulted about the strike since it was a flash strike. In other words, the leadership of the two unions acted on their own without gauging the response of the employees. The strike is thus undemocratic as it imposes the will of a few on the majority. The strike shows that sections of the employees actually believe that speaking to the media about a crash is more important to them than providing services to passengers. Service to passengers comes last in Air India  and this explains its plight.

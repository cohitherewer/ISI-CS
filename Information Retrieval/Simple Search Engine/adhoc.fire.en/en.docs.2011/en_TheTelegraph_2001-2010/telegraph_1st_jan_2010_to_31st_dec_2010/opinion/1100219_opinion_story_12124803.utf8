	You dont change the tactics of a winning game, is a sporting metaphor that authors should bear in mind because minor irritants always crop up with publishers even when the going is good. Hence the question  should authors change their publishers, especially after years of collaboration? And what are the differences that compel authors to change tack?        
	Basically, there are three areas where differences show up in some form or the other. First, money; second, the author-editor relationship; third, the authors belief that other publishers would do a better job with their books. If you look closely at these points of dispute, you will find that they arise because of a misunderstanding on the part of the author regarding what returns to expect from his book. Or, because the publisher has not explained the implications of the clauses of the contract, the vagaries of the market and the average life-span of a book, especially to a first-time author.        
	Take money first because that is the bottomline of success or failure for both author and publisher. Money means the advances paid to the author on receipt of the finished book, and the royalties that would accrue to the author on the sales of the book. Indian publishers are wary of giving advances, although a modest beginning has been made by some publishers. But these advances are deducted as the first charge from the royalties. Royalties are now fixed at not more than 10 per cent of the published price though many publishers now calculate them on net returns, that is, on the amount the publisher receives after allowing for discounts to wholesalers.        
	Advances have been a constant source of friction. Publishers hedge their bets on advances because they are not confident of selling the entire edition. Often some copies remain unsold.This means that they have not been able to recover the advance which is calculated on the sale of the entire edition. Net royalties can be calculated only when the wholesale trade discount is spelt out in the contract; if it is not, as is often the case, there are always lingering doubts in the mind of the author as to whether he has received an honest statement of returns.         
	Publishers maintain that they are unable to provide the discount structure because there is a sliding scale of discount, depending on the number of copies purchased and on whether the payment is against cash or credit. This is justified, but an average discounted price can be indicated in the contract, if only to avoid future misunderstandings.        
	But this isnt all because publishers now make as much money on the sale of rights as on the sale of finished copies of books. There are three basic rights: market rights, that is, giving the rights to sell the book in various parts of the world to different publishers; translation and serialization rights; television and film rights. Each of these rights is sold for a negotiated sum to different publishers, that could be, in some cases, quite considerable. But how much does the author make out of the deal? While conventions have been established in the West, many Indian publishers have not yet spelt out how the fees are to be divided between the authors and themselves.        
	Differences between editors and authors seldom lead to a split because the editor lets the author have his way. But there have been instances where they have led to a parting of ways. So should the author change the publisher because there is the prospect of a better deal with another? Only if he has reached the end of his tether, but always keeping in mind that the known devil is better than the unknown.

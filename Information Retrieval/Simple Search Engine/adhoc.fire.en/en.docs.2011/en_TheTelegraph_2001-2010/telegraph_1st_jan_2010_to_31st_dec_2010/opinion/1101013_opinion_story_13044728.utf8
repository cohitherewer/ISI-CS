	Perfect choice                  
	Sir  Controversy never seems to give the Nobel Peace Prize a miss (Jailed dissident feted for rights struggle, Oct 9). Last year, the conferring of this prestigious award on Barack Obama within a few months of the American president assuming office had kicked up a row. This year, the peace prize has been awarded to Liu Xiaobo, a human rights activist from China, who is currently serving a 11-year prison term. Xiaobo co-authored Charter 08, a manifesto that pushes for political reform in China which was published on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He also participated in the Tiananmen protests in 1989.          
	Naturally, Chinese authorities have taken exception to the Nobel committees decision to award the peace prize to someone who, they think, is a criminal. China perceives this as a calculated move by the committee to embarrass it in front of other nations. Expectedly, China  the worlds second largest economy and a very powerful nation  has reacted vehemently to this seemingly confrontational posturing of the Nobel committee. Any other country would have reacted in the same way under similar circumstances.           
	It is well known that the peace prize is bestowed on the basis of political considerations. Hence, its worth has eroded over the years. The Nobel committee could have averted such an unpleasant situation by nominating someone else for the award.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Nobel committees decision to give this years peace prize to the Chinese rebel, Liu Xiaobo, for his long and non-violent struggle to secure fundamental rights for the people of his country, is an extraordinarily bold step. Xiaobo was a hero during the Tiananmen Square face-off. He was jailed for preparing a charter demanding democratic reforms that was signed by numerous intellectuals. Understandably, the Chinese government has reacted sharply, describing the committees decision as a deliberate attempt to undermine Chinas military and economic prowess.          
	Notwithstanding Barack Obamas fervent appeal to China to release Xiaobo at the earliest, the reaction of the Western world has been tepid. Xiaobo has been completely cut off from the rest of the world (Shroud on peace laureate, Oct 10). Hence it is highly unlikely that he will get the opportunity to receive the prize in person.           
	In the past, two other Asians have been honoured with the peace prize for similar reasons. The first is the Tibetan spiritual leader, Dalai Lama, for his tenacious struggle to establish Tibets rightful claim on its own territory. The other recipient is Myanmars democratic leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been placed under house arrest by the junta for years. It is a cruel irony that these three crusaders of human rights now find themselves locked in a state of despair. Yet, they have not given up hope and seem ready to take on new challenges.The Nobel committee must be congratulated for acknowledging the spirited efforts of these men and women who have pledged their life for a great cause.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Chinas attempt to dissuade the Nobel committee from awarding the peace prize to Liu Xiaobo is a reminder of the erstwhile Soviet Unions ugly attempts to coerce Boris Pasternak to decline the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958. The repeated attempts to suppress dissidence ultimately resulted in the collapse of communism. It remains to be seen whether China succeeds in throttling freedom and free thinking in the long run. Xiaobos call for free speech and multi-party elections symbolizes his aspiration for equality. But the communist party in China has dubbed Xiaobos actions as anti-State. Xiaobos demands are common enough in the free world. Despite its stiff opposition, China is projected by the comrades as a model nation.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Liu Xiaobo has been languishing in jail. By honouring him, the Nobel committee has given due recognition to a champion human rights activist. This should be a source of inspiration for others fighting for the same cause. However, some of the Left parties in India are likely to criticize the Nobel committees decision. After all, they had expressed their displeasure when Tibetans protested just before the Beijing Olympics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fantasy of the wild
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FANTASY OF THE WILD                                  DUAL IMAGE                                            
	A curious combination of euphoria and despondence characterizes governmental attitudes to the Sunderbans. Recently, the West Bengal government affirmed that India would join Bangladesh in a campaign to have the Gangetic delta recognized as one of the new seven wonders of nature. Only a year ago, however, the region was rent by Cyclone Aila. It left behind a sinking land, with angry waters straining against weak embankments. The inhabitants of the islands struggle to piece their lives back together, but as the monsoons approach, the worst situation is yet to come, says Kanti Ganguly, the Sunderban affairs minister of West Bengal. The fantasy of wonder must be preserved in the face of this devastation. A global rhetoric of conservation, many researchers feel, has been imposed on the ground realities of the region.        
	This initiative will be in collaboration with a number of NGOs, Ganguly says, we plan to carry out the campaign on the internet and through mobile phones. The media must play a role in popularizing it. In order to beat the other contender for the title, the Amazon Basin, India and Bangladesh will jointly have to raise 11 crore votes. The blueprint for this mammoth endeavour awaits financial clearance, says Ganguly. According to reports, about 72 villages in the area are expected to be involved in the campaign. Yet for a region riddled with dire social, economic as well as ecological problems, the aspiration to wonder seems a ghastly irony.         
	Ganguly argues that the Central government needs to be more closely involved in the region, especially in providing relief to those affected by Aila. The Centre had promised Rs 1,000 crore towards repairing the damage caused by the cyclone, he says, but the money is yet to come. The state government cannot manage on its own, he declares. The Union minister for environment, Jairam Ramesh, has pledged his support to the joint campaign only when the blueprint is produced. While conservation receives considerable attention, there is not enough focus on development, Ganguly feels. If successful, the campaign is likely to provide an impetus to conservation efforts in the region and, as Ganguly observes bitterly, unless the tiger is saved, the people of the Sunderbans will not be saved either.        
	The campaign may be the latest in a tradition of fantasy projected on the Sunderbans by centres of power, usually operating from urban centres. Wonder, mixed with fear, also characterized the colonial administrations response to the wild, uncharted terrains. In the 19th century, efforts at land reclamation had failed and in 1911, this waste country had not yet been brought under the census. It must have haunted the colonial imagination. In an 1875 account, William Hunter calls it a sort of drowned land, covered with jungle, smitten by malaria and infested by wild beasts. In the same year, however, the region is declared a reserved forest. The colonial administration was also quick to recognize the Sunderbans as a source of revenue. Presumably to protect natural resources, it imposed user fees and licences, setting in motion a gradual displacement of the local inhabitants, who had been using the forest resources for years.        
	Post Independence, this displacement has continued under the universal imperatives of conservation. The urban fantasy about the Sunderbans as a place of immense natural beauty and home to the Royal Bengal tiger had to be preserved. Project Tiger was started in 1973 and the Sunderbans, increasingly identified as a tiger reserve and a tourist attraction, was declared a World Heritage Site in 1997. With global systems of science and knowledge in place, critics argue, the interests of the local inhabitants have been further disenfranchised. As one frantic campaign succeeds another, however, this darker picture of an impoverished and underdeveloped region is not often allowed to intrude on the fantasy of wilderness.

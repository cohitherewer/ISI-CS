                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNQUIET FRONT                                                    
	Coming only days after the prime ministers second visit to Kashmir and his promise of zero tolerance to human rights violations, the recent spate of bloodshed in the valley has taken on a colour deeper than usual. Three youths have lost their lives in close succession and the inescapable tragedy is that the armed forces are once again linked to the deaths. Two died in routine firing and one from severe beating at the hands of the police. Together with the disclosure of the fake encounter in Machail that raised a storm shortly before the prime ministerial visit, the sequence of events is taking the valley close to breaking point. It is irrefutable that no matter how sincere the political will  of the government of India, but, above all, of the people of the valley  to get things working in Kashmir, the ham-handedness of the administration and of the keepers of law and order is definitely not helping matters. Naturally, the quiet diplomacy launched by the Union home ministry late last year to draw all parties, particularly the separatists, into a dialogue seems to have died a quiet death. The fumbling over Shopian and the consistent reluctance to bring to book the guilty among the armed forces (take the crime in Pathribal) have not only rekindled public mistrust but have also united the separatists and given them back their hold over a helpless people let down by their own government.        
	The disquiet in Kashmir perhaps could not have come at a worse time. It is bound to undermine Indias position in the forthcoming foreign-secretary level talks followed by ministerial-level talks with Pakistan during which India has decided to discuss the Kashmir question. Indias quiet dialogue with interest groups in Kashmir could have provided the requisite thrust to the re-opening of the back-channel diplomacy, involving the people, that could lead to a workable solution. Unfortunately, the ongoing violence and the deepening trust divide in the valley may continue to negate such chances.

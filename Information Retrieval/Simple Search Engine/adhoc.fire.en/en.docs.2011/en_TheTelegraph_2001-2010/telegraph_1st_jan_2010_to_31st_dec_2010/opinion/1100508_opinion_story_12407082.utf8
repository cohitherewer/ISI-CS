	Unfair rule                  
	Sir  The Duckworth-Lewis rule was introduced in one-day cricket to decide the winner in case a match failed to throw up a result due to bad weather. However, this method has often done grave injustice to one team. The latest example of this was seen during the England-West Indies match in the T20 world cup. England posted an impressive total of 191 runs. Because of the rains, the West Indies were set a revised target of just 60 runs in 6 overs, which they crossed easily. The match should have been declared a draw and the points shared equally.

	Parting ways          
	Sir  Mamata Banerjee has done it again (Alliance sinks, play for honour in Delhi, May 3). By calling off her alliance with the Congress, she has undermined the chances of her party winning the upcoming municipal elections, and her move has also posed a serious question regarding the future of her association with the national party during the assembly polls next year. It hardly needs to be reiterated that without the Congresss support, she can kiss goodbye to her chances of dethroning the ruling party in Bengal.          
	As it is, Banerjee has been a source of embarrassment for Manmohan Singh on more than one occasion. This is why she has very few friends left in Delhi  even Pranab Mukherjee has chosen to maintain a lukewarm relationship with her because of her churlish behaviour. So far, Banerjee had the backing of Sonia Gandhi. But if the former decides to take the Congress head-on in Bengal, she will soon find herself completely isolated in Delhi. The logical conclusion then would be that her chief ministerial hopes would go up in smoke.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  There is now a general perception among people that nothing will stand between Mamata Banerjee and the CMs chair after the 2011 assembly elections. The Left Front appears to have given up its hopes and the Trinamul Congress seems likely to form the next government in Bengal. But whether or not this change will translate into anything positive for the people remains to be seen. The electorate is faced with a Hobsons choice  on the one hand is the Communist Party of India (Marxist) with a poor track record, and on the other is Banerjees unpredictable brand of politics.           
	The Left Front does have some valuable experience when it comes to governance. But whether the TMC will be able to come to terms with its new pro-development role is uncertain. The people of Maharashtra had a similar experience when they voted out the powerful Congress-Nationalist Congress Party government in favour of one that was formed jointly by the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party. What followed was utter mismanagement as the new government lacked the necessary experience in administration. This resulted in rampant corruption brought in by those who were tasting power for the first time. The SS-BJP front was given the boot in the next elections. Since then, this pair has never come even close to being elected to power again.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The TMC supremo has rightly ascertained that the Congress is resorting to a double game. Mamata Banerjee deserves praise for making it clear that she will stay in the United Progressive Alliance as long as she can do so with honour. This step will boost her image as an honest leader. Her party is likely to perform well in the civic polls.          
	Yours faithfully,

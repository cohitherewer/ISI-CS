	India is a democracy without a parliament. This is, of course, an exaggerated  and many would say, absurd  claim. But only slightly so. Look at the history of this session. Parliament has not been functioning since the winter session began in early November. On every working day, it has been adjourned because the Opposition refused to allow normal proceedings. The Opposition has a single-point demand: a joint parliamentary committee be formed to probe the 2G spectrum allocation. The government is steadfast in its refusal to concede to this demand. Thus the stalemate continues and there is no solution in sight. Pranab Mukherjee, who troubleshoots for the government on every front even though he is the finance minister, has used all his persuasive skills in vain to make the Opposition climb down. Hence the statement that India is a democracy without a parliament.        
	Both sides have their respective points of view. The Opposition believes that the allegations of corruption regarding the 2G spectrum allocation are very serious and that the government is not taking adequate action against those who could be involved. It asserts that only a JPC will reveal the scale of the corruption and the truth. The governments position is that there is no attempt at a cover-up. The minister concerned has been made to resign and all necessary action is being taken. There is no need for a JPC which will be an elaborate and time-consuming exercise without appropriate results. Without prejudice it can be said that, going by past experience, the governments position has some validity. It is difficult to recall immediately a JPC on any matter that yielded swift results approximating anywhere near the truth. Moreover, it could be argued that a JPC should be an exception rather than the rule. Parliamentarians in India are quick to demand a JPC, whereas the latter should actually be a rare and, therefore, significant exercise. Familiarity has reduced the potency of a JPC.        
	Whatever be the pros and cons on either side of the great divide between the Opposition and the Treasury benches, nothing quite justifies the non-functioning of the parliament in a democracy. The standstill of the Parliament means that the representatives of the people have for a period of time no say in the running of the government of the country. It sets a very bad precedent, since it demonstrates that it is possible to govern India without an active Parliament. It takes away one aspect from the composite trio of legislature, judiciary and executive. It is difficult to suggest a solution to the impasse except to appeal to the goodwill of all concerned. Corruption, JPC et al are all very important, but the functioning of Parliament is much more important than all those put together. A functioning parliament is vital to a democracy and to its good health.

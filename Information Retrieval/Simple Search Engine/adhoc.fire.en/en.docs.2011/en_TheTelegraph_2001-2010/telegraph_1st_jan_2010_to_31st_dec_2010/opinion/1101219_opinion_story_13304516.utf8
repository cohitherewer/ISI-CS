	They prefer pretence to protest                  
	Sir  The Indian Parliament went into hibernation this winter session owing to the unending crossfire between the treasury and the Opposition over the 2G spectrum scam (Welcome to worlds best job, Dec 14). Issues of public importance were ignored, a huge amount of the taxpayers money was wasted, and people got nothing in return. A certain sum should be deducted from the allowances that members of parliament receive during parliamentary sessions to compensate for the wasted Rs 200 crore. The no work, no pay rule should be imposed in this case.          
	The charges and counter-charges that paralysed this years winter proceedings continue unabated even after the session is over. The attitude of our parliamentarians proves that they are indifferent to democratic principles. They prefer altercations to debates, walkouts to walking with the people, and pretence to protest. They are incapable of putting the interests of the people before their own.          
	The ruling party has been insensitive and non-committal towards the Opposition if it has failed to take note of the latters demands. Instead of working towards a solution to the parliamentary impasse, the government sought to project the Oppositions claims as undemocratic. Parliament is not a forum for political parties to sort out their differences. It is a forum for the people and the government in power should have remembered this fact. It is a matter of shame for the ruling alliance if it failed to run Parliament properly. The citizens of India learnt a truth from the farce that was this years winter session: when MPs fight over an issue, Parliament is laid to rest.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sankarshan Thakur has given a graphic account of the way parliamentary proceedings remained caught in an unceasing wrangle even on the concluding day of the winter session, and Rs 200 crore was wasted in the process. But one cannot agree wholly with the Union home minister, Pranab Mukherjee, who reportedly blamed the Opposition squarely for gross violation of agreed norms. Parliament is also a place for the Opposition to air its views on issues of national interest, criticize the ruling government and, when possible, force it to take corrective measures. When the entire nation is rocked by the 2G spectrum scam, the Oppositions demand that a joint parliamentary committee be instituted to inquire into the allegations is entirely legitimate and within the ambit of parliamentary norms.          
	Yours faithfully,         R. Gopalakrishnan Nair, Ettumanoor, Kerala 

    
	Steady flow          
	Sir  I would like to add something to what Sumanta Sen has to say regarding the capture of sophisticated arms and equipment from leading Maoists in West Bengal and about the terror groups link with rebels of the Northeast (Fox hunt, Dec 15). Sen expresses surprise over the fact that the police seemed to have been unaware of the links between the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and organizations in the Northeast, particularly with the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (Prepak) of Manipur, till the arms were seized. The attitude of the police is indeed baffling since it is a well-known fact that Maoists have international connections, which they exploit to purchase arms and ammunitions to be used against the Indian army and the police. The rebels are connected with terror groups operating not only in Myanmar but also in China, Nepal and Pakistan. Most of the rebels are even involved in the drug trade that ensures a steady flow of money. Extortion, robberies and bank-loots are some of the other methods used to collect capital. Besides, the Maoists have been blessed by many a political leader, who not only assist them with money but also protect them when a fox hunt takes place.          
	If anything is responsible for the rise of terrorist outfits, it is the condition of our society. Those from the backward communities tend to get involved with terrorism because they lead a harassed and hopeless life. They are so excited about bringing change because the present reality offers them no hope.          
	These people need to be provided with food, education, job and shelter, which our rich industrialists can easily guarantee. But the latter would rather keep their illegal hordes in Swiss banks than help the downtrodden. The state and Central governments have also failed to bring a substantive change in peoples lives, resulting in certain sections of the population resorting to rebellion against the State. But the rebels should try to understand that a democracy cannot be built on violence. Instead of procuring arms with foreign aid, they should help the government improve their lives.          
	Yours faithfully,

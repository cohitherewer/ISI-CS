The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Country comes first
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        COUNTRY COMES FIRST                                  Neha Sahay                              
	It was a spontaneous remark, expressing gratitude to her parents for having helped her reach her dream. When 18-year-old Chinese speed-skater, Zhou Yang, won her first gold at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver last month, she said, It is my dream. I can give my family a better life now that Ive won this gold medal. My mom used to knit sweaters for other people, and the living condition of my family was not good. Now my mom can enjoy a better life.        
	Zhou was a dark horse who ended up winning two golds at her Olympic debut. Back in her hometown, the authorities announced a 1,000-square-foot apartment for her, and named her one of the Ten Outstanding women of Changchun. But the man in charge of her career, the vice-minister for sports and the vice-president of the Olympic Committee, found the star athlete lacking in patriotism. Theres nothing wrong with thanking your parents, but first you should thank your country. Youve got to put the country first, and not simply thank your parents alone, said Yu Zaiqing, at the annual delegates session of the Communist Party in Beijing, adding that he would bring up the question of enhancing the moral education of athletes in the session.        
	Then onwards began a nightmare for Zhou Yangs parents. The media demanded they explain their daughters words, even asking whether they had done everything for her just to make a killing from her success. What should have been a period of glory for Zhou and her parents ended with Zhous mother sobbing in front of television cameras and Zhou issuing a correct reaction after the Games. What I really want to say is thanks. I thank the country for providing us with excellent conditions, for giving us the excellent conditions for our Olympic campaign. And I thank everyone who supported us, I thank our coaches, I thank the staff, and I thank my mom and dad.                
	Honest talk        
	The minister who reprimanded Zhou is 59 years old and joined the Communist Party at the peak of the Cultural Revolution when Mao was still alive and everyone sang praises to the Chairman every day. Sports in China is still a government-controlled field, where promising kids are groomed from childhood and have their careers controlled by the State. Taken together, these two factors explain Yu Zaiqings ungracious remarks.        
	But while Zhous mother must also have grown up singing paeans to Chairman Mao and the motherland, she put up a spirited defence of her daughter despite the reporters haranguing her. What Chinese person does not love their country? We raise our children to bring glory to the country! The leaders quibbles  are they really necessary? After bringing so much honour to the country, what does such a little thing matter?        
	She and her husband were plain folks who hadnt taught Zhou to talk tall, she said. She described her daughter as a shy girl, whose life was training, sleeping, eating, one who had even spent many New Years away from her family, training. Said Zhous father, The girl is still young. She spoke from her heart. Of course, the parents come first! Of course, after the parents bringing her up, everything else is for the country. Ultimately, she won glory for China!        
	Spotted by a coach when she was eight, Zhou earned only a 500-yuan stipend. Her honest words have won her support across the country. On the Chinese version of Wikipedia, the ministers entry has been changed by angry netizens to read: Yu Zaiqing, male ... no mother and no father, raised by the Communist Party. An opinion piece in the official China Youth Daily asked, How can somebody love their country if they dont even love their parents?

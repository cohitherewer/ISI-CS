	It always happens only in Bengal. Several central trade unions called an industrial strike across the country on Tuesday to protest against the rise in prices. But only in Bengal did it turn out to be another bandh or general shutdown, having little to do with the issue on which the strike was called. The reason why Bengal presents such a different picture from the rest of the country on such days has everything to do with the states politics. A partys power and popularity have come to be measured in terms of its ability to bring things to a halt. The leftists were the original sinners who used this politics as the principal strategy in their quest for power. And they saw no reason to change even after seizing power. Thus, Bengal remains the only state where the government itself helps the organizers of a bandh to paralyse life. The frequency of these strikes has made them utterly irrelevant as forms of protest, whatever the issues. All they evoke are feelings of anger at the irresponsibility of the states politicians and frustration over the effect of such politics on its economy. This state of affairs has had crippling effects on Bengals social progress.        
	Whether this political culture will change with another party or coalition taking over in Writers Buildings is uncertain. Mamata Banerjee, who hopes to wrest power from the leftists next year, opposed Tuesdays strike. But that seems to be more a political ploy than a serious attempt to end the politics of bandhs. Her party, the Trinamul Congress, had organized so many of these shutdowns in the past that it is difficult to take her new position as a real change of heart. She had been no different from the ruling Marxists when it came to a show of street power. Even more unfortunately, society in Bengal has given this brand of politics enough legitimacy for it to become the touchstone of popularity with the masses. There have been saner voices that cried foul and pleaded for all this to change. It is also possible that large sections of the people who hated this politics had to submit to the politics of coercion and intimidation. But the enormous damage this political culture has wrought ruined the common peoples hopes for a better life. A cynical submission to this politics is no answer. It is not enough to say that the people deserve the politicians they get. If the people cannot change their leaders ways, they perhaps do not deserve any better.

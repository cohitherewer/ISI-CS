	Back from the dead      
	Radhikas story: Surviving human trafficking (New Holland, 8.99) by Sharon Hendry recounts the heart-rending tale of a young Nepalese woman, Radhika Phuyal, who is both a victim and a survivor of human trafficking. Sixteen-year-old Radhika is drugged and taken to        
	India where she has one of her kidneys removed for sale. Back in Nepal, she is        
	forced to marry, gives birth to a son, and is then trafficked again, this time to Indias burgeoning market in flesh trade. Forced to live        
	away from her child by her abductors, she encounters terrible humiliation and abuse, but refuses to give up. She escapes from the hell she was condemned to, gets back her child and starts a new life at a rescue centre in her home country. Hendry, who works for a popular British tabloid, chronicles Radhikas life with just the right degree of pathos and drama. The accompanying data related to human trafficking are shocking, as are some of the incidents in this courageous womans life.                                  
	Electronic Voting Machines: Unconstitutional and tamperable (Vision,Rs 395) has been edited by Subramanian Swamy and S. Kalyanaraman, and        
	brings together political, constitutional and technical experts who raise serious questions about the efficacy of EVMs. The emphasis, clearly, is on India emulating the nations that have discontinued with EVMs because of their susceptibility to rigging. Among the contributors, Sam Rajappa attempts to provide compelling evidence of how EVMs can be tampered; T.H. Chowdary examines the international experience with electronic voting, while J. Alex Halderman delves on the danger and opportunity associated with this device. A fair election lends credence to a democracy. Hence, the questions raised by the panel of experts ought to be answered. However, a comprehensive counter-view  positing the advantages of EVMs in comparison to the paper ballot  would have made the book more balanced.                        
	Yoga in the workplace (Westland, Rs 295) by Shameem Akhtar suggests simple ways to induct a yoga regime for those who have little time for things other than their daily chores. Akhtar insists that these yoga practices make minimum demand on office time, and maximize health benefits. Not just workaholics, but the supremely slothful would undoubtedly gain by following these simple tips.

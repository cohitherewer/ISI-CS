The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The centre lies still
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE CENTRE LIES STILL                                  VISUAL ARTS: Uddalak Mukherjee                                                  
	Crossing the Road, one of the photographs in Prarthana Modis exhibition titled Still (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, till Sept 8), shows a man caught in the middle of a busy intersection. One can see shops, an advertisement board, an electric pole, a traffic signal and a bit of the evening sky, and the stationary man is surrounded by bands of light, each luminous strip representing the movement of a particular object, a bicycle, a car and so on. It is evident that the complex relationship between motion and stillness is a theme that is being explored in this image. What is also discernible is that Modi attempts to portray stillness and motion by following a specific visual arrangement. The man  a solitary point of stillness  is surrounded by objects in motion, and, as is evident in some of the other photographs, this arrangement is seldom reversed. Stillness for Modi represents the centre or core of existence, and her photographs are the fruit of her quest for locating stillness in spaces that are teeming with life.        
	A pronounced contemplative tone is noticeable in most of the photographs. Be it By the Sea  in which a solitary man sits staring into the distance on a deserted beach  or the aptly titled Contemplation (picture)  in which a woman stares intently at a circular pattern on the surface of calm waters  the prevailing mood is sombre and reflective. What is conveyed through film is a sense of unhurried calm, even content. Significantly, the camera seldom intrudes upon these deeply private moments in spaces that are, at the same time, very public.        
	Modi, by her own admission, is not gifted technically, but what is apparent about her compositions is her fascination for light. It is her use of light that lends some depth to the photographs that would otherwise be perfectly mundane (Alone at the Ghat, Evening at the Ghat). The intentional blurring of certain elements in many of these photographs is perhaps an attempt to resist the urge to identify people and places, so as to give viewers the licence to imagine and interpret them in their own ways. However, the strategy of obfuscating reality does not quite succeed as Modi fails to dispense with the captions.        
	Photography is personal because the photographer has the right to take pictures of things that he finds appealing. But the exhibition of a body of artwork is a very public engagement, and Modi certainly needs to work harder and explore more complicated themes for her photographs to endure in the viewers memory.

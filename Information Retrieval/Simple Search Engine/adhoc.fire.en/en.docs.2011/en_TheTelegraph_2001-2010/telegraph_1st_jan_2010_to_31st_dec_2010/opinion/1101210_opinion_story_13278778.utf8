	There was never any question of India not attending the Nobel committees awards ceremony in Oslo in order to please the Chinese. But there is much more to Indias decision to attend it than the controversy over the Nobel Peace Prize to the jailed Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo. It is unthinkable that India could join the company of countries such as Tunisia, Iran, Venezuela, Afghanistan or Colombia by bowing to Beijings diktat to boycott the ceremony in Oslo. A countrys foreign policy is not about pleasing or upsetting others; it is essentially about enlightened self-interest and also about the values and principles that a country cherishes. Whatever its other policy failures, a democratic India has to use human rights and basic freedoms as important tools of its foreign policy. India has far more at stake in its relations with China than most of the 19 countries which submitted to the Chinese pressure. China is not only a neighbour but also a major diplomatic and security concern for New Delhi. Also, the forthcoming visit of the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, to New Delhi may have for a brief spell cast a shadow over Indias attendance at the Oslo ceremony.         
	But that was precisely the reason why India needed to send out the message loud and clear. When he arrives in New Delhi, Mr Wen should know that he cannot expect India to be a pushover on any issue. This is not to say, however, that India needs to take a confrontational approach on the issues the two sides are expected to discuss. Beijing has moved away from the provocative rhetoric  on Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and trade issues  that marked its responses two years ago. Some analysts even see a hopeful signal in Chinas recent utterances on border demarcation with India. It is even possible that Mr Wens visit might unfold a new approach to the border talks that have been going on between the special representatives of the two countries. Whatever the issues, the important thing for New Delhi is to guard its own interests against any design of China to expand its influence in South Asia. Recent Chinese activities in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal have caused new tensions in Indias neighbourhood. Even if they do not always pose security threats, they point to a new assertiveness on Beijings part. Chinas bullying tactics on the Nobel controversy is part of the same story. India has no choice but to call the Chinese bluff.

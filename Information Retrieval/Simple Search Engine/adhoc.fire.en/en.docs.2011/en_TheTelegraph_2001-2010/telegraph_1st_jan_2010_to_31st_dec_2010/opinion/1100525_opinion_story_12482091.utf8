	Adversity creates adversaries. When organizations or countries go through bad times, the wise men who rule them wake up and think of how to prevent a repetition of the follies they have just exhibited. They come up with new prudential regulations. The regulations redistribute the burden of future bailouts. Those chosen to pay complain, and envy those who have escaped the burden. The stage is set for discord and dissension. There was much of both before the American government got Congress approval in 2008 for its Troubled Asset Relief Program. It left behind a lasting feeling that financial institutions take reckless risks and the government carries the can when they fail. It darkened the last days of the former president, George W. Bush, and put paid to the presidential prospects of John McCain, the Republican candidate. It made it easier for Barack Obama to win, but on the way to White House he had repeatedly to promise, Never again! His efforts to put in place a new financial insurance mechanism ran into determined opposition in the United States of America Congress, where complex combinations of ideology and interest lead to convoluted wars. He has won the first battle in this war. His financial regulation bill, which was adopted by the House of Representatives in December, has now been cleared by the Upper House as well.        
	The Senate has approved a bill which brings under regulation two sectors of the financial industry which played a leading role in recent crises: mortgage lenders and hedge funds. Whilst hedge funds will come under the surveillance of Securities and Exchange Commission, mortgage lenders will be supervised by a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to be housed in the Federal Reserve. Not that they were not regulated before, but earlier they were under the supervision of six regulatory agencies, none of which kept an eye on them. It is hoped that a more dedicated agency will do a better job. The US has long had the problem of having too many financial regulators. The solution would be to merge or abolish some; but no government can bear the thought of shrinking. So the new bill creates a regulator of regulators called Financial Stability Oversight Council. It would not be surprising if Obama picked up the idea from the Financial Stability and Development Council that the Indian finance minister announced his intention of setting up in his budget speech.

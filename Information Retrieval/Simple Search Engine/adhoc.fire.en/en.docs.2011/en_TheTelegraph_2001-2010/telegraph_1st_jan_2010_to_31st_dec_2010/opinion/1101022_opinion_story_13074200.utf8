	The Masque of Africa: Glimpses of African Belief By V.S. Naipaul, Picador, Rs 595        
	After enduring more than 300 pages of complaints from a peevish Sir Vidia about bad roads, horrid weather and unscrupulous witch doctors in Africa, one has to wonder why the 78-year-old chose to travel to that continent at all. But then, never at home in his native Trinidad, V.S. Naipaul has always been travelling, and complaining about the countries he visited. This time he had left home ostensibly in search of African belief, of the beginning of things. But if in 1966, when Naipaul had been a writer in residence at Makerere University in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, he had found the place eluding him, some 40 years later, the quest for the beginning couldnt have been made easier, since the wildness, arguably the essence of Africa, has been pushed further back in the intervening years. So Naipaul starts The Masque of Africa by pointing out the shiny new corrugated-iron roofs, the painted walls advertising mobile phones that meet the eye today in the course of the ride from Kampala to Entebbe, and you know that its a rough ride ahead for the man who has been described by his biographer, Patrick French, as being without loyalties.        
	Naipauls journey takes him from Uganda to Ghana and Nigeria, then to the Ivory Coast and Gabon, to end in South Africa. He interviews writers, academics, investment bankers, tribal chiefs, shamans, kings, queens and political leaders. He scrupulously records what they say, but as perhaps intended, his choice of words gives his position away. In Nigeria, he meets a Christian contractor who is a Yoruba, and interrogates him about traditional African belief. The Yoruba gods and goddesses are many, their stories involved. Did the contractor learn about them when he was a child? He said no. His knowledge came from talking to other Nigerians when he was grown up, and it opened his eyes. Later the contractor says, There is magic. I believe in [the] dark side. I am very careful. I dont upset people who threaten me. So Naipaul adds, with willing suspension of disbelief, the past here still lived. People like the contractor were closer to it, and his words (with their Shakespearean echo) gave a new idea: the dark abyss of paganism.        
	So if the foreign religions, Christianity and Islam, are like an applied and contagious illness, curing nothing , the older religion offers the solace of the abyss. Moreover, the latter is associated with sacrifices, human and animal, that always darken the magic for Naipaul.        
	The unthinking cruelty towards animals that he finds endemic in Africa pains him the most. He has no qualms about declaring that given guns, and left to themselves, [Africans] would easily eat their way through the continents wildlife. His heart bleeds for the stray kitten that wails for food, but would, in all probability, soon be food itself, for cats are eaten in Africa, like chickens. He witnesses cattle being sent to slaughter in ramshackle trucks and declares, When sights like this meet the eyes of simple people every day there can be no idea of humanity, no idea of grandeur. With devilish relish, Naipaul recounts the stories of the bats of Abidjan in Gabon. The Gabonese consume the bats, which carry the contagious ebola virus that is transmitted by the eating of these creatures. So the darkening of the Abidjan sky at dusk was not only part of the visual drama of West Africa: it was like a plague waiting to fall on the men below. The rare few in Africa who show kindness to animals and pets immediately earn his approval. In fact, in Naipauls scheme of things, goodness and love for animals seem to go hand in hand.        
	Never one to mince words, Naipaul freely censures what he dislikes. And he finds a lot to dislike in Africa, starting from the garbage-strewn, over-populated streets, avaricious locals, fraudulent witch doctors, to the Africans fondness for bush meat. His displeasure soon manifests itself physically, and the overwhelming image of the book is one of illness or injury. Already something in the air was pricking my nostrils, a sign of trouble to come. In Lagos, he hesitates to enter a soothsayers house barefoot because he is afraid of getting ringworm. While watching a traditional dance in Lope, a spark from a burning torch falls on his hand, and the burn-mark stayed for days. To one who has been following the metaphor, Naipauls conclusion about Africa wouldnt be surprising: There was obviously no special African way of dealing with, neutralising, a bad history or a bad present. It seemed more likely that it was like dealing with a very long illness.... It became all you knew; it became life.        
	The vestiges of meaning Naipaul succeeds in finding amidst the chaos of African belief seem to reside in the few sanctuaries where nature hasnt been tampered with, where the animals have not been eaten up (as in the sacred grove of the Yoruba in Osun State), and, predictably and disturbingly, in words. Throughout his journey, Naipaul keeps referring to the journals of travellers who discovered Africa  John Hanning Speke (1827-1864), Henry Morton Stanley (1841-1904), Mungo Park (1771-1806), Du Chaillu (1831-1903) and Mary Kingsley (1862-1900). The experiences of these white travellers to the dark continent become his reference points, and the spirit of Joseph Conrad, whose Heart of Darkness was famously condemned by Chinua Achebe as racist, hovers over the book.        
	Naipaul keeps comparing notes with those of Speke and Stanley, feeling vindicated when his experiences match those of the early explorers. In the course of his travels, he is able to restore the word, mumbo jumbo, to its original sense, as used by Mungo Park in his Travels in the Interior of Africa, to refer to a figure of farce, part of the comedy of the old bush culture, the masque of Africa. Do such efforts constitute the return to the beginning of things? Naipaul cannot be unaware of the implications of what he is doing  sharing the white mans standpoint while looking at Africa. It is easy to condemn him. But he does this with such unabashed indifference to political correctness, and in so addictive a language that one feels that the book refers more to itself (and its creator) than to the continent out there. This is not something one would expect in a travelogue, but Naipaul seems to be past caring. He might also be deliberately provoking readers with his rudeness, as is his wont.        
	At the end of The Masque of Africa, Naipaul finally turns away from the real landscape to that represented in books. Unlike hostile Africa, pages are familiar terrain, and it is almost with relief that he concludes with the Afrikaner novelist, Rian Malan, that after apartheid a resolution is not really possible until the people who wish to impose themselves on Africa violate some essential part of their being. Malans book, My Traitors Heart, whose detailed summary Naipaul provides here, reminds one of that other great novel set in South Africa that has a similar theme  Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee.        
	While Naipaul is silent about his fellow Nobel prize winner, Coetzee has an essay on Sir Vidia in his Inner Workings: Essays 2000-2005. If readers of The Masque of Africa have been wondering why Naipaul keeps talking about the hopelessness that he, like several other European visitors before him, was confronted with in Africa, rather than about the continents more hopeful features, then Coetzee has a possible answer: [Naipauls] subject is himself  himself and his efforts, as a colonial raised in a culture that did not (he was told) belong to him and without (he was told) a history, to find a way in the world.                          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

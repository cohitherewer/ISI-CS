                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SIGNAL OF PEACE                                                     
	The law in a democracy has a relevance that goes beyond the textbooks and the courtroom. It is germane to a society and the way that society functions or chooses to function. The law can at critical points give to society a new direction and resolution. The long-awaited judgment of the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court on the Ayodhya dispute can be interpreted to do just that. The judgment provides a legal platform for peaceful resolution of the dispute and a reconciliation of the contending parties. By passing verdict on a past and present dispute, the court is actually looking forward to the future and is also urging the litigants, as well as the whole of Indian society, to look forward instead of backwards. The judgment puts on the Indian people the responsibility of creating a situation in Ayodhya where Hindus and Muslims can live and pray together as they did in the past. The judgment harks back to the past to demand of the Indian people to retrieve that harmony. In its spirit and in its nuances, this verdict is a landmark judgment.        
	What the judges have said does not allow any party or any community to claim a facile victory or to condemn it as a betrayal. The judgment records that the mosque did not demolish a temple but the mosque was built on ancient and utter ruins of a temple. These ruins predate by many years the construction of the mosque. This does away with the claims of those who have held that the mosque was actually built after demolishing a temple. The verdict also states the popular belief among some people, without necessarily endorsing it, that the birthplace of Ram lay somewhere on the piece of land on which the mosque had been built. It will not be unfair to assume that these statements of the court are not mere assertions but based on the findings of experts like archaeologists and historians. The point is important since it leads to the critical observation that within the same compound Hindus and Muslims had been carrying out their acts of worship. It is this spirit of co-existence that needs to be underlined as a foundation for a future settlement and reconciliation.        
	The courts order for a three-way partition makes it evident that the area has no one single owner. It asks the various parties to recognize and accept the rival claims. The immediate response of the political parties and the political classes is to see the verdict not in terms of victory or defeat but as an attempt at a resolution. But outside the political process, it is paramount that the judgment be read in the context of Indias culture of religious pluralism and not within the narrow confines of legal niceties. The court has done its duty  even more than its duty; it is now up to the people of India to abide by the high standards of secularism and religious harmony.

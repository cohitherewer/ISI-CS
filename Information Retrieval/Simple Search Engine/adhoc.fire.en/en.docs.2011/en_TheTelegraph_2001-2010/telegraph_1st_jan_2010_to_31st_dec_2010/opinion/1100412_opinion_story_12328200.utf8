                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        KILLING FIELD                                                    
	Katyn remains bizarrely prone to tragedy. In 1940, the Soviet secret police executed 20,000 Polish officers, captured during the Red Armys invasion of Poland, in that cursed place. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, recently accepted his nations role behind the killings, although he has stopped short of offering an apology. Given Mr Putins record as an ex-KGB man and his avowed admiration for Josef Stalin, no one had expected him to do any better. But even as the first stirrings of understanding between Russia and Poland were taking shape, the latters top political order has been wiped off at one go. It is painfully ironic that the aircrash that killed the Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, along with his high-profile retinue, took place as the party was bound for Katyn to attend a mass in honour of the victims of the massacre. The list of those killed in the accident includes the crme de la crme of intellectuals who also played crucial roles in the European Union (which Poland joined in 2004)  so the upheavals would be all the more seismic.        
	Although mysterious security snags  an outdated aircraft, landing in bad weather and careless pilots  have been cited to explain the disaster, the Polish people would find it difficult to live down the shock. It is also possible that Polands relations with Russia will take a beating. The latter may have nothing to do with the present crisis, but the fact that it took place on Russian soil could trigger intense bitterness. In a situation such as this, people tend to clutch on to the irrational to rationalize their grief. Kaczynski being an iconic figure of Polish nationalism, his death will naturally upset his followers. The late president was not exactly a progressive, given his archaic views on womens and gay rights, but he did command popular respect for his pugnacious stand against Russia. He not only integrated Poland into Europe but also brought it closer to the United States of America, much to Russias envy. It would be difficult to find someone who can live up to his legacy.

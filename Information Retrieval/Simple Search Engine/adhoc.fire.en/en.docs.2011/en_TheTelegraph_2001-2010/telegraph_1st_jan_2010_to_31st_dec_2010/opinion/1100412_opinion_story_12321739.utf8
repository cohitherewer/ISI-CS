                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Summer offensive                  
	Sir  The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, visited West Bengal recently to carry out an administrative inspection of the state. Following the visit, he sent out a strongly worded message on the need to correct the maladies of the administrative set-up and to improve the deteriorating law-and-order situation in the state (Two birds with four bucks, April 5) . Chidambaram also made it clear that the responsibility of maintaining internal law and order, including in inter-party clashes, lies completely with the state government. The buck stops at the chief ministers table, he had said. He specifically criticized the states failure to control the fierce clashes that occurred in Burdwan and other districts a short while ago.          
	Inevitably, the state government tried to deflect the criticism , and the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seemed more irked by the home ministers alleged use of slang (Clash of clichs in Bengal Babel, April 6). The chief minister has conveniently forgotten that he had called the Congress spineless only a few days ago. The state government was also embarrassed by Chidambarams visit to Lalgarh, where he mixed freely with the people and listened to their grievances. The Left Front government usually would not allow other political personalities into the area on the pretext that it will not be able to provide protection. However, Chidambarams determination to go to Lalgarh might also have dismayed the Trinamul Congress leader and Congress ally, Mamata Banerjee.          
	It is ironic that soon after Chidambarams return to Delhi, 76 Central Reserve Police Force personnel were massacred by the Maoists in Dantewada. The home minister, forced to admit that there had been an intelligence failure on the Centres part, was prepared to resign over the matter. Only then did Bhattacharjee admit that responsibility must be shared by everyone. Stricter security measures will, no doubt, be observed. But without adequate intelligence, the situation can only deteriorate. Will the Centre follow in the footsteps of the Sri Lankan government and launch the kind of army and air force offensive that decimated the Tamil Tigers, causing an immense loss of life? It is unlikely as well as undesirable.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir In the editorial, Mind the gaffe (April 7), it was rightly pointed out that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has made a spectacle of his own ignorance by objecting to Chidambaram saying that the buck stops at his table. Our learned chief minister, for whom the phrase is a slang, is appalled that a politician could use such a term.          
	As reported earlier, the phrase, passing the buck, originates in poker. Players placed a marker, which was called a buck, in front of the person who was dealing the cards. When the buck passed to the next player, he or she would have the responsibility of dealing. To pass the buck became synonymous with transferring responsibility. It is not a slang, neither is it a vulgar term. One may not know everything, but to voice opinions based on half knowledge is folly, which our chief minister has committed.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  After the deadly Maoist ambush near Makram, the home minister has accepted full responsibility for the massacre. Chidambaram asserted that the nation would honour the brave jawans who sacrificed their lives. The compensation announced by the government to the families of the deceased is praiseworthy. The family members of the 76 jawans have been assured a compensation of Rs 38 lakh and a job for at least one family member. The government, however, should not forget other martyrs who have sacrificed their lives in similar incidents. Their families also deserve generous compensations. All jawans killed in encounters have made the supreme sacrifice for their country. They should be honoured equally.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  In a landmark judgement, the additional district and sessions judge at Karnal sentenced five to death for murdering a young couple who got married in spite of belonging to the same gotra or sub-caste (Death for honour killings, March 31). Although capital punishment has been condemned by the United Nations, the judgement upholds the individuals right to marry as he or she chooses. Honour killing is not a new phenomenon in our country. Unless peoples mindset is changed, the social curse will continue.          
	Yours faithfully,         Ranadhish Choudhuri, Calcutta

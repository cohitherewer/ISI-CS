	Anish Kapoor has finally been celebrated in India. It has taken a decade for this great sculptor to be fted and embraced in India by the National Gallery of Modern Art, a department of the ministry of culture, that has lain moribund for years. The unnecessary hurdles that hardworking, well-meaning professionals have to overcome have disabled a cultural energy and vitality that could have made India a formidable centre of ideas and creativity in Asia. We can still be the leader in the region, but only if the government hurriedly learns and accepts that only a partnership between men and women from civil society with experience and scholarship, and members of the cultural bureaucracy of the government of India can revive India as a pivotal centre of cultural activity.        
	Sonia Gandhis speech at the first inaugural of the two Anish shows  one in Delhi and the other at Mehboob Studios in Mumbai  did those in the audience proud. Her carefully nuanced and sensitive tribute was refreshing and apt, a rare skill that few in the government have. She spoke of the need to infuse the public domain with art and aesthetics, something which is essential for any society to feel secure in the knowledge that it is rooted in its habitat and tradition, and is able to move into the future with dignity and self respect. It may not be obvious, but culture is the foundation on which socio-economic and political realities are based, and when cultures are neglected, societies enter long and dark tunnels of turmoil.         
	India has allowed the realm of its culture to degrade and dilute. Be it museums, libraries, monuments, ancient cities, forts, civilizational objects  every manifestation of our centuries-old tradition and skill, art and architecture, has been mutilated and is now ruled by archaic laws. The bureaucracy, which administers these institutions, are stuck in a time warp and are suffocated by closed-door policies and unwavering positions that have encouraged internal pilferage and profound negligence.                 
	Open space        
	It is time we agitated to participate in the rewriting of the norms that rule our cultural lives. We must bring down the rigid walls that constrict people from owning, buying and selling artefacts, that compel them to beat the rules and the system because the office orders are so utterly redundant. The operators of the system are bored with their jobs that have mandated them to be the protectors of an extraordinary and diverse civilization.        
	We have to start somewhere. Let us begin by giving Anish Kapoor a public space to create a sculpture that heralds a new and emerging India. Let us acknowledge that his work in Chicago draws more tourists than does any such art anywhere in the world. Let us follow that up by giving other contemporary and folk artists the space to create.         
	The repository of our living traditions must be an intrinsic element of our metropolitan cities, towns and hamlets. Manifestations of Indias pluralistic culture will help keep the collective social and historical memory intact and fuel the creativity of new generations. They will inspire change in an environment that is comfortable, and within habitats that are secure. During the transition from a colonial subject to a democratic nation state, we failed to give culture and heritage the due they deserve.         
	It is time India and its governments put culture back on the priority list to ensure growth and development that are not based on alien and sterile international models, which have no connection whatsoever to the fundamentals of our philosophies, faiths, sciences, arts and cultures. Let us together celebrate and honour the fusion of modernity and tradition.

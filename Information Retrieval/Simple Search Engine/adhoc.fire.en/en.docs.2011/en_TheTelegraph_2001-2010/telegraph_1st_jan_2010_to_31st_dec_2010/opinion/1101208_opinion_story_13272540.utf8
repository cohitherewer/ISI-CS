	Q: Ours is a registered co-operative housing society. A member died in 2007, leaving behind his wife and two minor daughters. He had not nominated anyone to the flat. The lady has not been able to prove that she is his legally wedded wife. She has stopped paying the maintenance charges too. How can we recover the dues?        
	A.K. Das, Barasat, North 24 Parganas              
	A: According to the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Act, 1983, if there is no nominee, or the existence or residence of the nominee cannot be ascertained by the board, then the deceased members share can be transferred to the person who produces probate or letters of administration or a succession certificate establishing his/her inheritance right. You could send the lady a notice to produce any of these documents. After inducting her as a member you can claim maintenance charges from her.              
	Q: The owner of the house adjacent to ours has fixed an exhaust fan in his kitchen. The fan faces our house. As a result our bathroom and bedroom are getting very dirty from the smoke, oil and soot from his kitchen. What action can we take against this?        
	Shyamal Gupta, Calcutta              
	A: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation Building Rules, 2009, have laid down mandates on leaving open space around a residential house or building. From the facts stated by you it seems that these mandates have not been complied with either by you or your neighbour. If you are at fault then you have little option but to adjust to the situation. However, if your neighbour has violated the mandates then you could complain to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.               
	Q: My son bought a flat and registered it in his name and that of his mother (she is the second holder). How can he get exclusive rights to sell the flat in the future  either during his mothers lifetime or after her death?        
	Aurabinda Sinha, Calcutta              
	A: Your son shall acquire exclusive rights of selling the flat only if his mother executes a deed of gift in his favour, transferring her share of the flat to him. After her demise he will get the exclusive right to sell the flat only if your wife executes a will in his favour and it is not challenged by her other heirs.

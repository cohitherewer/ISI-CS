	Shivers down the spine                
	The Begums Secret ( Penguin, Rs 299)by A.K. Srikumar is a story as rich as good Dum Pukht. In lucid prose, Srikumar depicts the hunger and opulence of 18th-century Awadh, peopled with languid begums, portly nawabs, scheming eunuchs and irate colonial administrators. It is the year 1784 and Awadh is succumbing to British domination. Faced with the loss of political power, not to mention a province stricken by drought and starvation, Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah takes up an audacious project  the construction of an imambara more spectacular than any before. In a stroke of brilliance that would inspire many governments to come, his begum suggests that the thousands employed to build the imambara get food in return for work. But the begum also has a darker secret, which unfolds as the story progresses. History provides matter for romance as Srikumar captures the last surge of a culture on the wane.                        
	Known Turf: Bantering with bandits and other true tales (Tranquebar, Rs 250) by Annie Zaidi poses a key question: what do dacoits look like in real life? It is perhaps this curiosity that takes Zaidi, a journalist, into the interiors of the Chambal region, where retired dacoits pose for photographs with their rifles. It is also curiosity that leads her to the innards of Madhya Pradesh, populated with starving tribes, and to villages in the heart of Punjab, where Dalit women are still considered common property. Sufi shrines and the belligerent Dera Sacha Sauda, violence against women, and eulogies on tea jostle for space in this story of exploration. Zaidis travels reveal a landscape fractured by oppression, violence and poverty. At times, the book appears to be somewhat amorphous as the author tries to deal with a clutch of social issues. Known Turf is, nevertheless, an unflinching look at a very complex reality. Zaidi records her experiences with much verve and wit.                        
	Howzzat Butterfingers! (Puffin, Rs 199) by Khyrunnisa A. packs in all the high-voltage drama that an inter-school cricket match can supply. With the star-player injured shortly before the day of the match, the team captain disqualified and the terrifying prospect of girls on the opposing side, it falls upon Amar, popularly known as Butterfingers, to save the day. Apart from the thrill of impossible odds and a nail-biting finish, the story offers encounters with eccentric teachers and loving descriptions of cricket matches played by the characters. For many readers, it will also recall the joy of long days spent on the field. The book promises to be a great read for cricket-lovers, both young and old.                                        
	Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown (HarperCollins, Rs 250) by Ipsita Roy Chakraverti recounts the famous witchs battle with the dark forces. Zombies, necromancers, voodoo dolls and tree spirits populate the streets and homes of Calcutta. One learns, among other things, that Evil is in fact a coy woman, much like the perfidious Eve, that the ill-fated royal family of Nepal had been under an ancient curse and that a consignment of Barbie dolls dumped in the Port au Prince market had been put to sinister use. Chills, one after the other, chase down the spine. However, the book does not strike one as particularly sacred, or evil, for that matter, as long as one does not take into account Chakravartis unabashed self-promotion and trite prose.

	After the scandals comes the poor performance. But even the captains analysis of the poor performance does not go to the heart of what afflicts the Indian Premier League and the kind of cricket it promotes. The promoters of IPL  this includes the mercurial Lalit Modi, the celebrities who have associated themselves with it and the Board of Control for Cricket in India  have perpetuated certain myths regarding it. One of the more enduring ones is that the IPL is a global brand. Any definition of the term global brand would have to include first and foremost the geographical spread of the brand. The IPL exists only in India. The world has no interest in it; the global media ignores it. Its sponsors are either domestic businessmen or non-resident Indians. That the description of the IPL as a global brand is misleading is revealed by placing it next to a genuine global brand like World Cup soccer. The argument that IPL is a global brand because foreign players play in it is a specious one since these players were paid at rates far higher than the going market price. At such exorbitant rates, it could have been possible to get David Beckham to come and play for any of the leading football clubs of Calcutta. Would that make the IFA shield a global brand?        
	The entire project of IPL proceeded on certain erroneous premises. Its promoters created a financial and business model and cricket (or a form of it) was tailor-made to fit that model. Money-making took precedence over sports. Whereas in the genuine global brands in sports  say World Cup soccer or the National Basketball Association or the English Premier League  a regular sporting event was made financially rewarding through various instruments like sponsorships, prize money and so on. Commercial interests followed sports to monetize the latter. The distinction is an important one even though Mr Modi and his ilk have chosen to overlook it.        
	The IPL is a case where the baby has to go out with the bathwater because the form of cricket and the way it has been organized are causing serious harm to the game of cricket in India and to the players. The BCCI would be well advised to build up Ranji Trophy  a tournament now much neglected but the original nursery of Indian cricket  as a brand. It can be reorganized into a premier league and a first division; foreign players can be got to play for the various teams and even transfer rules introduced. The BCCI should follow its Australian counterpart and make it mandatory for all Indian cricketers to play at the Ranji Trophy level and it should not schedule any overseas tours during the domestic season. The improvement of cricket in India should be the prime motive of BCCI, not building a fortune.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Paradise lost                  
	Sir The front-page photograph in The Telegraph of July 31 that showed a woman throwing stones at security forces during clashes in Srinagar came as a shock to me. I had visited Kashmir in May this year, and had not witnessed any sign of disturbance. Of course, the armed forces were present at every street corner, but we tourists were given a warm welcome in all the places we visited. My daughter chatted with the locals, who narrated how many of their relatives and friends had fallen victim to the security forces atrocities. A journalist I met there admitted that although the armed forces are a considerable presence in Kashmir, they have failed to arrest the terrorists who are far fewer in number. Instead of killing hard-core militants, the security forces often end up gunning down civilians, he said. This is not only shameful, but it also reflects the deplorable failure on the governments part to restore peace in Kashmir.          
	To mitigate the sufferings of the Kashmiris, what is required is the human touch. The use of force will only aggravate the situation further. Kashmir  a version of heaven on earth  must be allowed to flourish so that it can attract a large number of visitors from India and abroad. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, should opt for the right course of action to bring back normal life in the valley before it is too late.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Waste not          
	Sir Mani Shankar Aiyar has rightly stated that if India hosts the Commonwealth Games properly, it might make an attempt to organize the Asiad or the Olympics in the near future (Guess wholl be delighted if Games are rained out, July 28). But a country that has failed to provide the basic necessities to thousands of citizens has no moral right to squander its precious resources by hosting an extravagant sporting event. South Africa may have organized the football World Cup but, according to some reports, many South Africans were not in a position to afford even a cup of coffee at the Soccer City. Neither South Africa nor India can augment its prestige by immersing itself in pomp and gaiety when millions in the two nations are being denied basic amenities.          
	Aiyar may have acted irresponsibly by stating that he will be delighted if the Games get washed out. But instead of taking his comment to heart, we should try and appreciate his emphasis on the proper use of resources. If Aiyar is anti-national, then the likes of Suresh Kalmadi are unpatriotic. The latter are keen to sweep the truth about the countrys poverty under the carpet and turn the nations attention to a gala sporting event.          
	Hopefully, the Commonwealth Games will be a success. But when it is over, India should accord top priority to the welfare of the downtrodden.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                
	Friendly advice          
	Sir The operation of the joint forces in Jangal Mahal seems to have put the Maoists on the defensive (Bravehearts gird up to take on Maoists, Aug 1). Ordinary villagers are now defying the coercion and terror created by the Maoist cadre. Several Maoist leaders have been captured or killed, forcing the rebels to retreat to the hinterlands.          
	However, the Union railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, has once again jumped to the Maoists rescue (Mamata lines up Lalgarh date, Aug 1). She has declared that she will visit Lalgarh on August 9 to demand the suspension of the ongoing operations and the withdrawal of the joint forces from the region.          
	Not just Banerjee but other politicians too have treated the Maoists with kid gloves. When Chidambaram proposed a coordinated operation against Maoists in Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand, Nitish Kumar, the Bihar chief minister, opposed the move. The former chief minister of Jharkhand, Shibu Soren, had expressed his support for the Maoists quite openly. As the railways minister, Banerjee has blamed the recent spate of rail accidents not only on the rebels but also on the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Now, just before her proposed visit to Lalgarh, she has alleged that the CPI(M) is making plans to have her eliminated. This allegation, in all probability, is the brainchild of her creative-intellectual friends who always provide her with advice.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Tridib Roy, Calcutta

                
	Sir Ever since it suffered a series of defeats in recent polls, the CPI(M) has been desperately trying to establish Mamata Banerjees connection with the nations greatest enemy, the Maoists. The party has even made futile efforts to sell its theory to the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram. The force of its accusations has weakened a lot after the party leaders realized that defaming Banerjee may not be enough to capture votes and, on the contrary, may be counterproductive. But the CPI(M) has not yet given up on the use of this weapon to hit Banerjee.          
	Banerjee retorted rightly when she accused the CPI(M) on July 31 of hatching plots to kill her by forming suicide squads. However, such unfounded charges coming from a responsible Union minister are bound to be described as undignified. The CPI(M)s reaction to Banerjees allegation was also more or less on this line. The party leaders chose to attach no importance to it at this stage. But they must not forget that their constant tirades describing Banerjee as a Maoist emissary have no basis in fact either. That way, Banerjee has not been wrong in paying the CPI(M) back on its own coin.                    
	Yours faithfully,

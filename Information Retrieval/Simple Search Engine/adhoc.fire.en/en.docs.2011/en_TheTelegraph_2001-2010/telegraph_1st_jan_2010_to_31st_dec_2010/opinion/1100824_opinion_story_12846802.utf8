                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TONE DEAF                                                                  
	Like a lot of middle-class mothers with daughters in earlier, more innocent, times, my mother too had a dream about me. That I would sing like a nightingale. The comparison is mine, made later when I had amassed data about the melodious bird; all she wanted was that I would sing like her idol among the best-known women singers of Rabindrasangeet  which amounted to much the same thing. My father, however, had long surrendered his soul to Indian classical music. For any serious training in music, he felt, the base must be classical, after which I could go in any direction I wished. I didnt wish, but that had very little to do with the happy understanding my parents came to. I was put into a class for beginners under a mashtermoshai who was reputed to be a connoisseur and an excellent teacher. Three evenings a week were thenceforth given over to the pursuit of the higher form.        
	Amazing to think of now, I had a high, strong voice that would take a higher scale than the others in the class. Mashtermoshai was thrilled at first. But there was a small snag. I was tone deaf. I could just manage to stay in tune with the notes on the harmonium, but that was about all. I could recognize no ragas, neither could I respond to sublimity, however hard my father tried by taking me to the best classical concerts, both vocal and instrumental. Neither did I thrill to music as my mother did when she sang in her tuneful, though untrained, voice (her home training as a little girl was terminated when she innocently complained that her teacher kept pinching her thighs and it hurt). I hated practising, failed miserably to perform in class, was humiliated by the percussionists exasperation and the teachers strained patience. I wept and chafed, pursued by waves of sound whose beauty only urged me to run and hide.        
	I dont blame my parents for taking a while to accept that their daughter was genetically alien, without an atom of melody in her make-up. They freed me of the nightmare when they realized, sorrowfully, that I was not being lazy or defiant, I was just unable. The disappointment for my mother may also have had another dimension. All girls of my background sang. Classical was not popular (eyebrows were raised when I started), but some Rabindrasangeet, or at least adhunik, was normal. There had even grown up a strange form called Rabindrasangeet on the guitar. It was too horrifying to last long, but guitars were still twanging mournfully around me when I was being introduced to Indian classical.        
	Now when I enjoy listening to music, comfortable in the knowledge that I will neither have to perform nor be a connoisseur, I feel even more sorry for my father. Indifferent to societys expectations, he had just wanted to enrich my life. It was not his fault, nor mine, that the music fairy had simply passed me by.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

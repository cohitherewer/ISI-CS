                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Great expectations                  
	Sir  The three-fold hike in remuneration has partially fulfilled the salary demands of our parliamentarians (MPs wangle promise of pay review, Aug 22). Will the raise force parents to change their mindset and coax their children to become politicians rather than doctors, engineers or management executives? It is but natural to wonder whether politicians are an economically productive class. The debate, like the one concerning housewives in the census survey, is unlikely to end soon and for very good reasons.          
	Yours faithfully,        Tapan Lal Dasgupta, Calcutta
        
	Wrong move          
	Sir  The world chess champion, Viswanathan Anand, is the pride of the nation. It is unbelievable that the bureaucrats in the human resource development ministry were ignorant of the fact that Anand is an Indian citizen (Mighty master, meek serf, Aug 25). Does this mean that they are also unaware of the fact that Anand has been the recipient of the Padma Vibhusan as well as the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award, honours that are bestowed on Indian citizens only? The delay by the concerned ministry in granting permission to the conferring of an honorary doctorate on Anand by the Central University of Hyderabad has insulted the grandmaster and made India a laughing stock before the whole world. It is surprising that Kapil Sibal, the HRD minister, chose to offer excuses for the delay and not punish the errant officials.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Sanjit Ghatak, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The doubt raised over Viswanathan Anands citizenship is yet another example of how careless and shoddy the HRD babus are in their work. To quell their doubts, all that the babus had to do was go by the rulebook. That way, they would have found out what is already in government records. A click of the mouse would have yielded all the relevant details. According to law, any person acquiring citizenship of another country would have his Indian passport cancelled. The details of Anands passport and its content are surely in possession of the immigration department. A quick check with the department concerned would have cleared the air about Anands citizenship. It is heartening to note that Kapil Sibal has called up Anand and apologized for the goof-up. Sibal may have managed to contain the damage to some extent by his gesture.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

                
	Sir  I cannot understand how there can be any confusion regarding Viswanathan Anands nationality. Anands reputation as a chess player precedes that of any other Indian sportsman in individual sport. No other sportsman has won such glory for India in recent times. How does it matter if he lives in Spain? What is important is that he continues to win trophies and fame for India. Now the HRD ministry has ended up humiliating the great man himself .                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Krishanu Baruah, Guwahati

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Tigers are killed for their skin and teeth by poachers. Their number is dwindling because of human greed. Many reserves and sanctuaries have been opened in India but the losses are mounting as a result of poor management. If stringent measures are not taken immediately, Indias national animal will soon disappear from the countrys forests forever.          
	Yours faithfully,
   Diwakar Gupta, Calcutta

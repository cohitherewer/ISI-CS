	Do Bengali-speaking people everywhere practise a particular kind of politics? Sundays hartal in Bangladesh should be familiar stuff to the people of West Bengal. What is even more curious is that Begum Khaleda Zias form of politics resembles that of Mamata Banerjee so closely. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which she leads, has been boycotting parliament and demanding that the government of Sheikh Hasina Wajed resign. The coalition led by Ms Wajeds Bangladesh Awami League had a huge victory in the parliamentary polls in December 2008. But Ms Zia has done all she can to make things difficult for the new government. Ms Wajeds government has had its failures and weaknesses. The law and order situation in Bangladesh is a major worry for the people. College and university campuses are routinely used by criminal groups masquerading as student unions. And the police and civil administration are blatantly politicized. But all these are largely a legacy of Ms Zias last regime.         
	The similarities between the political cultures of Bangladesh and West Bengal raise other worrying questions. Is it that Bengalis  and their women leaders in particular  can think of politics only as personal, vindictive and confrontational? The personal rivalry between the two leaders in Bangladesh has come to define politics in that country for nearly two decades. In West Bengal, the biggest opposition party, the Trinamul Congress, may not have boycotted the state assembly. But it has been boycotting Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government for the past few years. And, following her recent electoral successes, Ms Banerjee is impatient to force an early election on West Bengal. It is an ominous sign for democracy if leaders put personal agenda above the interest of public institutions.

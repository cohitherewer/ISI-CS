	Politicians look at the world in terms of votes. Technocrats and specialists think in terms of efficient governance. The difference in these two perspectives could be one factor in explaining differences in the rates of economic growth between India and China. In China, despite the predominating presence of the communist party  some would say because of it  the government is not run by politicians but by specialists in various fields. (This system is helped, no doubt, by the absence of democracy and elections in China.) In India, decision-making and governance is encumbered by considerations of politics and elections. It is no coincidence that the most far-reaching decision in recent history was taken not by a politician but by a specialist who was asked to head the finance ministry. To wit, Manmohan Singh. Nothing exemplifies better the way politicians look at an issue than the storm in a tea cup over the hike in fuel prices announced by the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, in his budget speech. It is clear that no major political party has any principled argument against the price rise  they know it is inevitable  but because they think only in terms of petty political gains, they have lined up to protest.        
	The point can be illustrated by the fact that when the Congress was out of government and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government raised fuel prices, the Congress in protest stalled proceedings in Parliament. Now that the roles are reversed, the BJP has opted to pay back the Congress in its own coin. The protest also enables the BJP to forget its internal squabbles and to rally round. Similarly, Mamata Banerjees disapproval of the price hike is motivated by her desire to pre-empt the protests of the Left parties. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has done what it does best  it called bandhs in Tripura and Kerala. Its failure to do so in West Bengal  the great red fortress of the days of yore  may not strike most people as odd, given the partys demoralized condition after its debacle in the Lok Sabha polls. The obvious point is that the political class in India does not think in terms of what is good for the country but only in terms of what electoral gains it can garner for itself and what political points it can score off its principal rivals. This makes for a lot of hot air but contributes nothing to governance.

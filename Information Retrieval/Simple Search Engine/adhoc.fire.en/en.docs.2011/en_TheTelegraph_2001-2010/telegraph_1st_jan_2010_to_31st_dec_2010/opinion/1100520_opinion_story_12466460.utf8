	It was in Bagram that Barack Obama had pledged to reverse the momentum of the Taliban insurgency a little over a month ago. It is not surprising that the Talibans spring offensive or Al-Faath, intended to expedite the momentum of jihad, has included in its repertoire a daring attack on the largest American military base from where Mr Obamas rousing speech to his soldiers was delivered. Before the much-publicized North Atlantic Treaty Organization operation in Kandahar commences, the Taliban needed to say a thing or two  to the people of the country as also to their chief adversaries in the West. To the first section, the new surge in the killing of prominent Afghan tribal leaders who are suspected of falling prey to peace plans and the repeated suicide attacks have conveyed the message of the Talibans invincibility. As for the next section of listeners, a startling response was in order for the dramatic build-up before the Kandahar operation. Hence Bagram, and hence also the preceding suicide bomb attack on the Nato convoy in Kabul.         
	What is most disconcerting is that among the confused messages emanating from the Hamid Karzai government, the United States of America and its Nato allies, the Talibans in-your-face message may end up getting heard, and believed, the most. As of now, there is no indication that the Afghanistan president, Hamid Karzai, has been able to convince the US of the efficacy of his reconciliation plan for the Taliban. His recent visit to the US  which was greeted at home with resurgent violence  resolved nothing except the prickly issue concerning his brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, who, apparently, will stay on as head of Kandahars provincial council despite his rather unflattering record. But the US is suddenly less sure than before about the success of its military operations now that the Taliban are trickling in again into Marjah, where it is believed to have successfully concluded its Operation Mushtarak only months ago. The dilemma is not only over how best to balance reconciliation efforts with military means, but also over the aims of the armed push itself. The Nato allies are yet to evolve a foolproof method of segregating enemies from friends among the people and to ensure that friends do not turn enemies. But their toughest challenge is to convince their new friends that those they see as their enemies are their friends enemies too.

	No reform can be effected by itself, especially if it is located midway in a system. So when thinking up the single college entrance test, the Union minister for human resource development has also had to make way for common syllabi in science and mathematics  and in commerce and economics  to be read across boards and regions in classes XI and XII. The laudable aim of the common entrance test is to reduce the burden on students, a task to which Kapil Sibal has devoted himself. Children have to sit an array of separate tests to enter a college of their choice with the subject they want to study. A student looking for options among engineering and medicine courses, and, say, physics and mathematics courses too, to name a few, would be sitting joint entrance tests as well as admission tests for different institutions. All this is not easy; besides, these tests sometimes fall just before, or during, or immediately after whichever board examination the child is sitting to pass Class XII.        
	But a noble aim by itself cannot make a reform practicable or desirable. Although the Council of Boards of Secondary Education has approved the plans for common science and mathematics syllabi from 2011, the preparation and implementation should take time and adequate thought. Haste has always caused serious problems every time there has been a syllabus change, even regionally. Besides, at the comparatively high level of classes XI and XII, do the syllabi have to tally in every detail in order to ensure that all children are up to the mark? There can be a basic standard broadly defined, with crucial checkpoints. However, the most opposition is expected in the case of the common entrance test; neither states nor individual institutions are likely to welcome this. Even Mr Sibal, with all his good intentions, has not been able to overcome the time-honoured desire to centralize education. Governments in India, whether at the Centre or in the states (witness West Bengal) cannot seem to resist the temptation to have their thumb always stuck in the education pie. Educational institutions should be left free to develop their own ethos, aims and methods of teaching once they have met certain broad requirements of standards, parameters and infrastructure. How is a nation to produce thinking individuals if its schools and colleges are not allowed to think for themselves?

	Hidden lessons                  
	Sir  I enjoyed reading Aung San Suu Kyis interview by Thilo Thielke (Freedom song, Nov 28). Suu Kyi, a champion of democracy and freedom, was released recently from house-arrest by the repressive military government in Myanmar. Since then, she has become active politically and has been demanding that the people of Myanmar be granted the freedom of speech and expression. All this may result in Suu Kyi getting arrested again.          
	It is being reported that the last election was a hoax. Even then, it is possible that the military government, frightened by the peoples persistent demand for democracy, was forced to organize the polls. In the interview, Suu Kyi stated that she hopes both China and India would support her party and not the government. At a time when the people of Myanmar are being tortured for opposing the government, India needs to extend help by supporting Myanmars freedom fighters. We should also desist from developing good relations with the military government. Along with the United States of America and the European Union, India too should close its doors to Myanmars present dispensation. Otherwise, the junta will not allow free and fair elections to take place in that country. The world media should also be thanked for helping Suu Kyi and her followers raise their voices against Myanmars autocracy.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Aung San Suu Kyis release  in the backdrop of Barack Obamas criticism of India for not speaking up against the human rights violations in Myanmar  has thrust greater responsibility on our country. India is aspiring for a permanent seat at the UN security council, but it needs to bolster its own democratic credentials first. A democratic India, characterized by fixed-term legislatures and the election of the prime minister by a secret, but compulsory, ballot comprising one-third members of the House, must be considered a role model by other nations.           
	Several other options can also be explored. The prime minister may only be removed by a process that is similar to that of his election. Moreover, only people who have not contested elections for six years should be considered for ministerial posts. Such a system will prevent regional parties from blackmailing their national counterparts. Such reforms should be speedily inducted into the elections of Indias model democracy that will be gifted to the rest of the world.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Such a long journey                                                    
	Yours faithfully,

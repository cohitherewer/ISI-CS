	A second French Revolution seems to be just round the corner. As I write this, agitating mobs have virtually brought life in France to a standstill. They are protesting against the French governments decision to introduce reforms in their pension system, the main component of the reform being the proposal to increase the minimum eligible age for pensions from 60 to 62. Of course, large sections of the population hate President Sarkozy (the hate seems to be reciprocated) because his policies are considered too conservative. This may be the more important reason explaining the intensity of the opposition to the proposed change because pension reform is inevitable not just in France, but in all countries that have a well-developed social security system.        
	The inevitability of change is because of the rapidly changing age composition of populations across the world. Dramatic breakthroughs in medicine, combined with higher incomes and hence better nutrition, have been instrumental in significant increases in life expectancy. Lifestyle changes, particularly in the West, have also resulted in later marriages and hence lower birth rates. These two tendencies mean that the worlds population is ageing. Estimates made by the United Nations show that the proportion of the worlds population above 65 years will more than double by 2050, so that every one person in six will be old. Even developing countries will experience this large change. For instance, Indias over-65 population is expected to reach 12 per cent of the total population by 2025.              
	The increase in the old-age dependency ratio, which is defined as the number of over 65s to the population in the age group 15-64, will have profound consequences on national public finances and overall government policies. It is obvious that much of our spending is age-related. For instance, the larger the number of elderly members in a family, the greater is the proportion of expenditure on medicines and healthcare. Moreover, in most families, the younger members have to provide some income support to the older members. The latter may have saved throughout their earning life, but retirement funds typically do not prove sufficient for all their needs.        
	What is true for representative families is true for the nation as a whole. Countries will have to incur increasingly larger age-related expenditures in the form of significantly higher outlays on healthcare and pension support. One estimate suggests that the average cost of providing long-term care for the aged will increase by over 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product in the advanced economies. This is in addition to the increased budgetary support required to support pension schemes. Some of the projections made of the funds necessary to support these schemes are truly mind-boggling  as high as 15.8 per cent of GDP in Italy by 2032, and 16 per cent of GDP in France by 2040.         
	Some optimists argue that the increased spending on the elderly will be balanced by a corresponding reduction on the costs of educating the relatively smaller number of the young. Unfortunately, this does not quite square with the facts. Economies are becoming increasingly knowledge-based and technology-intensive. For instance, even in relatively poor countries like India, most good schools will have large numbers of computers, much better scientific equipment than before. The implication is that there has been a huge increase in the per capita cost of education. This is likely to wipe out any potential saving that could have been achieved because of the need to educate a smaller number of children.        
	Of course, there will be quite large differences across countries. The effect will be most pronounced in advanced economies and emerging market economies in Europe. These are the countries which have social security systems that provide a broad spectrum of benefits to its citizens, as well as a significantly worse demographic age profile. Conversely, countries like India hardly have any wide social security system covering all segments of the population. If current social institutions are preserved, then there will be correspondingly less pressure on government finances. However, presumably developing countries do want to emulate some of the better features of life in advanced countries. A well-developed social security system is certainly one of the most attractive features of advanced economies. So, over time, the pressure on public finances in developing countries will also become quite acute.        
	Of course, world incomes have grown appreciably in the past because of technological progress. There is no reason to believe that similar increases will not ease the pressures in the future. The greater the increase in national per capita incomes, the easier it is to provide for the aged. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the future problem seems so severe that some appropriate policy responses seem inevitable. What are the feasible policy options?        
	One option is to scale back the amount of compensation. Of course, such a change cannot be implemented in the immediate future. Those whose pensions are sought to be reduced must be given sufficient time to ensure that they have made ample provisions for the future. This means increasing savings during the years of earning over a long period of time, and so the process must start long before people actually retire.              
	The more promising option is precisely the reform proposal that has resulted in the French agitation. The most prevalent form of pensions is the pay-as-you-go system in which payments to the retired persons are made out of the contributions made by current workers. Pushing back the age of retirement would help in several ways. First, this would increase the size of the national cake since the stock of the productive labour force would be larger. Second, this would mean that the number of people contributing to the pension kitty would be larger. Third, the number of people receiving pensions would also be smaller.        
	But why is this system fair? Why make the elderly work for an extra couple of years? The reason why at least some increase in the age of retirement is needed is that the overwhelming majority of people are today perfectly fit to work much longer. Indeed, life expectancy is so much higher today because people are in much better health and so are capable of working several more years. Old age is a relative concept, relative to the times we are in. It is worth pointing out that Leonid Hurwicz, who shared the Nobel prize in economics in 2007, was academically active till the day he died  at the age of ninety.

	A victory rally in the middle of the city addressed by the chief minister of the state because the Left-backed primary teachers association has won the district primary school council elections is surpassing strange. It may be a mark of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s pitiful lack of nerves before the assembly elections that the chief minister himself should be congratulating teachers for doing a great job. But why traffic in half the city should be thrown into turmoil because the chief minister feels the urge to celebrate a CPI(M) win in district school councils is a question that only the CPI(M) and its friends can answer. Evidently, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is only the chief minister of his party; the rest of the populace can go to the nether regions.        
	Far weirder is the chief ministers message to the teachers. They should now illuminate thousands of their students guardians about the ideologies and principles of the party, and thus launch a widespread campaign to reach the masses. This is the teachers duty, although Mr Bhattacharjee did recall for a moment that a teachers job is also to teach. This naked display of topsy-turvy priorities exposes the source of the ills the CPI(M) has wrought in Bengal. That teachers do not teach, they join political associations, they are even appointed on the basis of their politics are phenomena West Bengal has grown used to. But that open secret is now no longer a secret. Mr Bhattacharjee has also flaunted the fact that the partys reiterated desire to change is just another whopper. At the heart of the destruction of the education system lie two simple realities  the partys fathomless ignorance and teachers politicization. West Bengal fares pathetically in primary education, and numbers of children in the districts drop out in Class V because they have been taught nothing at all and cannot keep up. Few things can be stranger than having the chief minister of a state  Mr Bhattacharjee is probably a bit amnesiac here  congratulate teachers for winning a party-based election when they do not teach, and then ask them to do their duty by spreading the party doctrine among guardians. Not satisfied with destroying all possibility of education in the villages by creating a new board to garner more votes, the chief minister is now out to wreck all childrens futures and redefine the duty of teachers in the state.

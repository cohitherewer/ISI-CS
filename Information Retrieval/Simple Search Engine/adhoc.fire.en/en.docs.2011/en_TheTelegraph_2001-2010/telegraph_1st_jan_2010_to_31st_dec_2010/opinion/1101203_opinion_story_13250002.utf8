                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TAP DANCE                                                    
	The right to privacy is integral to any civilized society. Ratan Tata is therefore entirely justified in being angry that telephone conversations between him and Niira Radia were tapped and recorded. Ms Radia had been engaged by Mr Tata in her professional capacity to further his business interests. Eavesdropping on their phone conversations was a clear case of infringement of their privacy. The Supreme Court had earlier ruled that the right to privacy was part of the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution. In spite of this, recent revelations have made it clear that their conversations were being regularly listened to and recorded under orders from the Central Board of Direct Taxes. Ajay Maken, the minister of state for home affairs, dutifully reported to the Lok Sabha that interception of messages could be allowed only in the interest of public safety or sovereignty and integrity of India. This statement further highlights the violation that has been committed by the CBDT (if it did order the tapping) and other concerned agencies. Nobody in his right mind will suggest that either Mr Tata or Ms Radia is a threat to national security. Both of them are engaged in their legitimate business. The argument that the CBDT was tapping their phones for reasons relating to payment of taxes is disingenuous to say the least. There are innumerable ways of finding out if a particular individual is paying his or her legitimate dues to the State without eavesdropping on their phone conversations and infringing on their privacy.        
	There may or may not be something rotten with the 2G spectrum allocations. But this has nothing to do with any perceived threat to national security. To compound one wrongdoing, the tapes containing the conversations have been leaked to the media. Having recorded the conversations, the government could not ensure that the tapes remained in safe custody. Evidence collected for conducting an investigation has thus become public knowledge. This, on the face of it, somewhat defeats the purpose of recording the conversations, however illegally. It is apparent that the standard processes and checks and balances that should be followed have either collapsed or have been deliberately violated. The government and the concerned ministry can say whatever they like, it is obvious that the rights of citizens are not being respected. The alibi of security considerations is being used to abuse basic rights.

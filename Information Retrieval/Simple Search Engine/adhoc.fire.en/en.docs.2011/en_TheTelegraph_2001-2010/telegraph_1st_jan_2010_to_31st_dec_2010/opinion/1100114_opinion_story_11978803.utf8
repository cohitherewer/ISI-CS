	Both India and Bangladesh placed high hopes on Sheikh Hasina Wajeds visit to New Delhi. The agreements signed by the two sides suggest a refreshing change in attitude and political will. It is one thing that substantive steps have been taken to address some long-standing issues such as the trade imbalance, distribution of river water, road and rail transit, exchange of prisoners and the fight against terrorism. But more important was the spirit of accommodation and mutual understanding that informed the agreements and other negotiations. For quite some time, it was precisely the absence of mutual trust that was the worst problem in India-Bangladesh ties. Each side viewed the other with suspicion and allowed the suspicion to overshadow possible areas of mutual cooperation. Even when leaders and officials of the two sides engaged in dialogues, rhetoric took precedence over meaningful plans of action. Economic issues, such as the trade imbalance and transit facilities for goods through each others territory, became embroiled in spurious political controversies. Some issues, such as the distribution of river water and the trade imbalance, will need to be discussed further. But it now seems that the two sides can engage more openly than they have done in a long time.         
	A qualitative difference in India-Bangladesh ties is crucial to the stability and economic well-being of South Asia. Between them, the two countries have the largest population anywhere in the world, except, of course, China. For both, reducing poverty and reaching the basic amenities of modern living to their people should be the key element of State policy. Nothing can help achieve this better than mutual economic cooperation and democratic politics. If the ties between the two neighbours were strained in recent years, it was mainly because of the rise of Islamist fundamentalism and official patronage to anti-India activities in Bangladesh. Not just New Delhi, but many other governments were worried about the drift in Bangladesh. With Pakistan presenting a dreadful picture, the failure of yet another Islamic state would have been disastrous for peace and stability both in the region and elsewhere. If economy and security are closely inter-linked everywhere, they are more so in South Asia. The India-Bangladesh agreements promise a new beginning, but only sustained engagement can fulfil the promise.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A strange journey across Europe in a minivan
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A STRANGE JOURNEY ACROSS EUROPE IN A MINIVAN                              Stranded in Italy after the eruption of a volcano in Iceland, Supriya Chaudhuri recounts the many ordeals and adventures she faced while trying to catch a flight back home                        Hand of god				                                       
	A fortnight ago, I was lecturing in Naples, at the LOrientale university. In the shadow of the Vesuvius, with Pompeii only 15 miles away, an Icelandic volcano seemed very distant. The newspapers that morning carried stunning photographs of the eruption on Eyjafjallajkull, but the name  even if we could have pronounced it  did not come up in conversation. Instead, once the academic side of things was over, the talk naturally turned to the all-important Roma-Lazio game that Sunday. Inter had already beaten Juve, and my host Francesco Sferra, a noted Sanskrit scholar and Roma fan, finding me well up in the details of Serie A, took me along to the Bar Nilo for coffee. The famous Maradona shrine is no longer displayed on the wall outside, but is prominent at one end of the bar. It holds a lock of Maradonas hair, a fading newspaper cutting with a photograph of the greatest player ever to wear the sky-blue colours of Napoli and to lead them to their only two triumphs in Serie A, and a tiny glass vial containing the lacrime di Napoli, the tears of Naples after he left. As a good Bengali born in the Pele era who put her Brazil loyalty on hold during the Maradona years, I paid my formal respects at the shrine. This turned out to be a good thing. In the days that followed, I needed some intervention from the Hand of God.        
	My flight from Naples to Berlin was booked for next morning, and I was to return from there to India a few days later. I set off for the airport in the pre-dawn chill; when I arrived at Capodichino, I was told that easyJets morning flight had been cancelled. They re-booked me for that evening, and I settled down to wait. As the day progressed, more flights were cancelled; it seemed as though most European airports were shutting down. A German couple stuck there from the previous night told me that no rail tickets were available. This seemed so incredible that by lunchtime, I had decided to ask for a refund on my easyJet ticket and try the trains. After an hour in the flight cancellations queue, I was told that I could only apply for a refund online, so I went off with my luggage to the railway station to try my luck. More queues. After two hours, I got to the counter and was told that there were no train tickets to northern Europe. I said I was prepared to travel to any point in northern Italy  Milan, Turin, Genoa  just so that I might cross the border into Austria. Surely there were some ordinary trains, regional trains that didnt require bookings? Nothing is available, madam, said the man at the counter.        
	I returned to the airport, since I still had a ticket for the evening flight. By the time I got there it was cancelled too. I stood in line to book the next available flight. This turned out to be three days later from Rome Ciampino. All European airports were closing for two days. But easyJet would book me into a hotel if I waited until the bus came. At 11 pm the bus brought us miles down the Bay of Naples to the Holiday Inn at Castel Volturno, an idyllic retreat where old-age pensioners play golf. By this time, I would have been happy to have been an old-age pensioner. Instead, I was part of a strictly segregated multinational and multilingual party called the easyJet Group, fed in a separate dining-room while exchanging volcano news and ways of escape by land or sea. The atmosphere of enforced idleness was strongly reminiscent of Thomas Manns The Magic Mountain. Mealtime plans were all of hiring a bus if 50 people could be found for a single destination like London or Paris. A walk by the sea confirmed that we were trapped  the nearest railway station was miles off, and there appeared to be no local buses.              
	My niece in Germany had downloaded some programme on her computer that showed her all air activity in Northern Europe. By that night she was urging me to fly to Austria, which was re-opening its airspace. Restrictions on German airspace were still in force, though Lufthansa and KLM had conducted a number of test flights to prove that there was nothing wrong with the air. Experts disputed risk indices and the nature of volcanic ash on late-night news bulletins. Dramatic maps showed the extent of the ash layer and its composition. Financial analysts computed the airlines losses. The EU was meeting to decide whether airports could be opened or not, but some countries were opening them anyway. So I took the hotel shuttle to Naples airport early next morning and stood in a new queue with all the current cancellations for two hours, with no luck. There were no flights available to Austria, not even if I bought a new ticket. My Rome-Berlin flight the following morning was still on, though doubtful. My best bet was obviously to go to Rome.        
	Since I was booked to fly back to India from Berlin, the sensible thing was to cut my losses and ask Emirates to re-book me from Rome to Calcutta. As I sat on the train from Naples to Rome, I told myself many times that this was what I must do. Indeed I had fully intended to get off the train, find a hotel, and ring a friend. Instead I found myself magnetically drawn to the seemingly-endless line in front of the international rail booking counter. This was a more frenetic and lively queue than my earlier ones. We exchanged hold-up news and conferred on routes while touts buzzed around us like flies, offering taxis to northern European destinations at 2,600 euros, divided among six passengers. A particularly smooth operator called Toni gave me his phone number, saying that he was trying to get me companions to Munich. I told him there was no possibility of my paying 450 euros. He shrugged sympathetically.              
	Three and a half hours later, I had reached the counter. The girl said that the computer system was down, but she could work out a route for me that would involve my changing trains five times and paying 250 euros to leave Rome next morning and reach Munich late next night. I borrowed a phone and rang my niece. My easyJet flight next morning had been cancelled. I turned back to the booking counter. The computer system was still down. And down it remained, for the whole station and perhaps the whole of Italy, until that counter closed at 9 pm. There was a mini-riot outside. The carabinieri came in and looked important. There were emergency conferences. With an acquaintance from the queue, a young man in an orange T-shirt who was going to Munich, I went off to talk to the taxis directly. Since he spoke no Italian and little English, I negotiated. We went right round Roma Termini, but the lowest price we could get was 2,400 euros. I said that I would pay no more than 250, and returned to the crowd in front of the general rail counters. It appeared that the computer system was up again. The crowd moved very slowly. I continued to wait. Orange T-shirt appeared from time to time, shouting encouragement and advice to a friend of his called Karim ahead of me in the queue.        
	Just as I had reached the booking office, Orange T-shirt (his name was Amer) came to call me, indicating that he had found a taxi. Your price, he said triumphantly. I dragged my luggage out of the queue and followed him. Someone had fainted, an ambulance had arrived and he was being stretchered off. Outside, I found Amers companions: young Karim, three men in business suits and two in full Arab dress. It transpired they were Egyptians bound for the Munich trade fair. None could speak Italian. Their bookings from Cairo had been diverted to Rome because of the volcano. With the exception of Amer and Karim, possibly translators, no one spoke much English. One spoke German. The agent started explaining the deal to me in Italian: one minivan, Rome to Munich, 2,000 euros, eight persons plus driver. Half as advance, half in Munich. I was to say it was our friends van. I translated. It was 10.30 pm. We waited. No van. The agent made calls on his cellphone. The Egyptians plied me with orange juice and sweet cakes. Those in Arab dress settled down on the ground. I borrowed a cellphone and rang my niece to say I was coming.        
	The van arrived at midnight. We followed our agent to it with our luggage. The driver spoke only Italian. I sat next to him with Amer, discussing the autostrada route all night. The others dozed off at the back, Amer dozed off in front. The German-speaker had friends driving down to pick him up; I had to negotiate a meeting at Verona. At dawn we crossed the Dolomites near Brennero. The mountains were covered with snow. The sunrise was breathtakingly beautiful. The Egyptians had never been in Europe before. They kept asking me about the border and about checkposts. I explained that there were no checkposts in the new Europe. It did cross my mind  it must have crossed theirs  that a vanload of Middle Eastern men and one Indian woman travelling across Europe at night might look suspicious. But no one stopped us as we crossed into Austria and then into Germany. My Egyptian friends called my niece on their cellphone and insisted I talk to her. At 10 am we were at the Munich railway-station, where my enterprising niece had sent her fianc to meet me. I thanked the driver, we paid up, and I explained to my companions that a baksheesh was in order. They smiled delightedly at my grasp of this Arabic word and we all paid up a little more. I said goodbye and went off to catch the train to Berlin.              
	The Hand of God? Clearly he struck down the railway booking system just as I was about to buy a ticket involving five changes on Italian railways, and he sent Amer to collect me just as I was trying to buy that ticket again. I dont think he was the van-driver.

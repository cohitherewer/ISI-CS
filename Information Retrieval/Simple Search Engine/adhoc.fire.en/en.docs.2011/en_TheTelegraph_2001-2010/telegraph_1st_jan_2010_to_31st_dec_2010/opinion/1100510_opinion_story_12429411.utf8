	In Britain, a hung parliament, though not unprecedented, is still something of an anomaly. After an uninterrupted though chequered rule for 13 years, the Labour Party has suffered one of its worst defeats in the universal suffrage era. But the Conservatives, too, have not secured a clear majority. Even with a substantial rise in their seat share, the Tories stopped short of the magic number required to form government on their own. The real blow, however, was reserved for the Liberal Democrats. In spite of his impressive performance in the televised leaders debate, Nick Clegg of the Lib Dems failed to make an impact at the hustings. It could well be said that everybody lost the election.        
	The real winners were the people. The split mandate testified to the growing diversity of British society, its rejection of monolithic structures of authority for a pluralist, multiparty democracy. The voters have moved on from the question of who should be the next prime minister. They are more worried about imminent crises, especially about the state of the national economy, which is on the brink of a catastrophe. With Greece erupting in civil unrest, whoever enters 10 Downing Street will have a tough time ahead. David Cameron, the Tory leader, who has the first right to try form the government, has pledged to reduce fiscal deficit. But Gordon Brown, the incumbent Labour prime minister, who has been clearly shown the door by the people, has promised to do no less. Both men are equally vague about budget cuts and tax rises. The real kingmaker is Mr Clegg, without whose support neither the Tories nor Labour would be able to come to power. An alliance with the Tories is unlikely to serve the Lib Dems well. Mr Cameron, although tactful about other issues, is committed to the first-past-the-post system, which determines elections in favour of the highest polling candidate. Mr Brown, on the other hand, is willing to replace this systemic bias with proportional representation. So, in the circumstances, Mr Clegg may find it sensible to support Mr Brown. But whoever becomes the new prime minister will find himself in the unenviable position of having to take unpleasant decisions. This election, in particular, has been a race to become the most hated man in Britain.

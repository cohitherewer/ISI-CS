	If allegations regarding the Bofors gun sank Rajiv Gandhis boat, various accusations of corruption have drilled holes into the ship of state of which the United Progressive Alliance is the crew. This is the clear message from the results of the elections in Bihar. This is not to underestimate the stupendous work done by Nitish Kumar and the government he heads. Mr Kumars administration has brought Bihar out of lawlessness and backwardness into the world of modern India. On this achievement alone, Mr Kumar and his party would have won a well-deserved electoral victory. What the results show is not a modest victory but a triumph that has made the opposition look puny, if not non-existent. It is the scale of the victory that demands an explanation, as does the unexpectedly good performance of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the elections. The overwhelming endorsement of the National Democratic Alliance by the Bihar electorate is also a verdict against the UPA and its record of governance. Mr Kumars achievements as chief minister created the necessary conditions for the NDAs victory but that by itself is not sufficient to explain the landslide defeat of the UPA.        
	Weeks before the long-drawn-out elections in Bihar began, what had captured the Indian mind was the corruption surrounding the Commonwealth Games. An international event happening in New Delhi was perceived as a source of illicit money-making, incompetence and evidence of typical governmental procrastination in punishing the guilty. As the elections progressed, more stories of scandal and financial wheeling-dealing at the ministerial level were revealed. The electorate responded to this by voting for the NDA in greater numbers. The wind of corruption further speeded up Mr Kumars winning yacht. He thus won the electoral regatta by many lengths. The importance of the corruption factor in Indian politics is being recognized retrospectively. Witness Sonia Gandhis reiteration, in the immediate aftermath of the election results, that the Congress has never compromised with corruption. Mr Kumar too went on record to say that he would soon be formulating a zero tolerance anti-corruption law. Corruption and its synonym, the culture of avarice, are again the determinants of political fortune. No political party can afford the taint of dirty lucre.

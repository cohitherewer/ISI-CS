The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | time and again
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME AND AGAIN                                                    
	Maharashtra remains in the eye of a storm that has been raging around the state since the 1990s. Periodic blasts, communal riots, violent protests by parochial outfits  nothing can conquer the fabled spirit of resilience that is associated with the state, particularly with its capital, Mumbai. It was expected that the hooliganism of the Shiv Sena over the release of My Name Is Khan would die a natural death; however, no one had anticipated this episode to be followed by a deadlier horror. This time it is Pune that has been shattered by a powerful explosion, although the target  a popular caf in the heart of the city  is eerily reminiscent of the 26/11 attacks on Mumbais Caf Leopold in 2008. German Bakery, which is located close to the Jewish prayer centre, the Chabad House, is as august an establishment as the Leopold. A symbol of the vibrant cosmopolitan spirit of the city, German Bakery is a meeting ground of tourists (from across India and abroad), students and local residents. It is this ambience of plurality and harmony that must have made it vulnerable to the fanatics ire. The attackers strategy closely reflects the objective of those who went on a rampage in Mumbai some 14 months ago  to make both Indians and foreigners feel insecure in this country.        
	Political one-upmanship is not the best reaction after such tragedies, but Indian leaders have never failed to make hay while the horror lasts. It is symptomatic of the Bharatiya Janata Party to seize the day and urge the Centre not to go ahead with the proposed peace talks with Pakistan. This when the Union home ministry was prudent not to point fingers at any country  in spite of speculations over the role of Lashkar-e-Toiba  without substantive evidence. The Indo-Pak dialogue was suspended after 26/11, although stalling the peace process is perhaps not the best way to seek an end to the trail of destruction. The BJP, which was sent packing in the hustings last year, is desperate to salvage its image as a national party, apart from guarding its regional interests. Having lost Maharashtra with the Shiv Sena last year, it is keen to regain its hold on Bihar with the Janata Dal (United) in the assembly elections scheduled later this year. The Centre should not give in to knee-jerk reactions. Domestic security is no doubt of paramount importance; but it will remain elusive without a holistic foreign policy.

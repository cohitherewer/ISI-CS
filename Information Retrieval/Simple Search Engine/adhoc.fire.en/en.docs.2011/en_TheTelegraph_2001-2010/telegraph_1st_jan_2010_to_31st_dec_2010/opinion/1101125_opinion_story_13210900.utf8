	Thank heavens, I come to India next week. A bit of sun and colour might thin out the heavy clouds hanging over all our heads at the moment as the further implications of cost-cutting over the next few years begin to impinge. Because Im travelling, Im writing this earlier than usual in the month and, with no lightening of our financial horizons since last month, I am afraid I am continuing in the same depressive vein. Actually things seem even worse: the old are going to suffer a lot more than appeared to be the case with early news of public cost-cutting, and I am feeling older by the day. The melodramatic scenario is that we will all have to work in some shape or form almost until we die, although what at exactly is an interesting question as we know there arent the jobs to go round, and there are further cuts to those that do exist in both the public and the private sectors.         
	While, on the face of things, the National Health Service is losing less of its funding than other areas of public spending, in reality, it will have to do more with less in terms of expensive new treatments and drugs and our growing ageing population. Of course, it is possible that not being able to afford all these new treatments and getting conceivably less good public healthcare, we may all start dying younger again  a blessing perhaps if the alternative is dragging ourselves to our desks aged 85 or starving in complete penury in houses that we cant afford to heat.        
	The younger generation, fighting for a place in the ever-smaller job market, will have no time for its older relations. Benefits will disappear even faster than available jobs; pensions will depend on a full working life that will become an impossible dream  we wont be able to afford to go to get our teeth fixed even at the subsidized rates of scarce NHS dentists, always supposing you can get registered with one which is already nigh on impossible.        
	So, costs go up and service quality goes down, and we are all sitting here taking it like lambs because we are told it is the right thing for the country. We still have no doubt that the deficit needs to be dealt with fast, but are wondering now if we shouldnt, in fact, become a bit more gallic by kicking up the sort of fuss that demands answers to the questions we are all asking, starting with, is the government really getting this right?        
	One wonders if there isnt too much harking back to the wartime spirit of Were all in this together about this blanket of imposed general misery. It could be a bit like tearing up all the park railings in London and elsewhere during World War II and melting down everyones saucepans to make arms and aeroplanes. The park railings went and the pans and everyone thought that they were doing their bit, but in reality the metal produced was completely unusable for any war purpose. Do we all have to suffer to feel we are getting out of the hole we are in whether we need to or not, and are the next generation really going to have only the lees of the baby boomers bottles and of the generation who, until now, enjoyed the fruits of their successes?        
	The young people who have left university in the last two years and those leaving schools and universities for the next decade, and who knows how much longer, are hitting, or will hit, hard times. This years crop of graduates are struggling to find jobs and, at best for most, getting unpaid or barely paid internships that are increasingly unlikely to lead to full-time employment. I said last month that there needed to be more opportunity for vocational training but this is only likely to come for the foreseeable future from a private sector that seems frozen with financial fears and incapable of philanthropic initiative.        
	There is little choice available for graduates who are being forced to look at careers that fulfil their nightmares more than their dreams. The market is stagnant across the board, there is little movement in jobs and the inexperienced are missing out altogether  if they do get a job, it is first-in-first-out, and there are no guarantees they will have it by next year. You know things are bad when a good CV, A grades throughout and an Oxbridge First dont get you through the door of most offices in London. Bizarrely, the only people recruiting seem to be headhunters, so I dont know what they know that the rest of the country doesnt.        
	We have heard, since last month, more details of rising university fees as recommended by Lord Browne of Madingleys review into higher education funding and student fees. For school-leavers and their parents, they are immediately frightening. For the country, they may ultimately prove severely straitening. Simplistically, university tuition fees are mooted to rise up to threefold in the next 5 years at the same time as government funding is cut to institutions. The universities are meant then to pay their teaching costs from the fees with some government assistance in priority subjects at the same time as a new higher education council sets and enforces minimum quality standards across the system.        
	With universities able to set their own fee levels for individual courses, there will be greater competition driven by financial, rather than quality, implications. Those universities with popular courses at the right price will do well, others will fail. Students will choose courses for financial reasons rather than any other. Poorer students will be pushed into courses they dont want to do or that are less good. At the highest level, in universities with the highest fees and reputation, quality may rise but a two-tier effect will be created as less popular and rich institutions fall further behind or fail altogether, reducing university places. In any case, many, poorer or richer, will choose not to go to university at all because of shortage of places and costs at the most popular, and because even the better off find the financial implications of higher student debt dogging their footsteps for the next 30 years inconceivably awful.               
	The picture is pretty grim. The older generation will become less able to help out as they struggle to pay for their own existence, shedding any property they have to pay for old-age care and leaving little behind to inherit. Younger people will have expensive and apparently useless degrees, if they have them at all, are unlikely to find jobs, and, if they do, will then have to pay off student loans for years to come. The loans will have higher interest repayments on them than previously, at the same time as these, by then not so young, people are trying to find affordable housing and perhaps even start families. They will also have long-living elderly dependents although it is questionable who is likely to depend on whom.         
	Maybe a balance will be achieved as a generation or two realizes that it cant afford to breed and advocates euthanasia at retirement for its elders. Lets face it, quite an attractive option with little state care available and pensions attached to jobs that may not have existed for years. Why should we want to live, or to have children? Making life too miserable to be borne is clearly the way towards the ultimate solution the country really needs, less people. There might even be some money left in the kitty to pay for the student debt.        
	Can it be so bad? It looks that way at the moment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the battle of the books
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE BATTLE OF THE BOOKS                                                          
	Ray Bradburys powerfully dystopian novel, Fahrenheit 451, made into a brilliant film by Franois Truffaut, envisions a world without books. While that may not be the case just yet, a time could soon come when bookshops finally disappear off the face of the earth. So far, common readers have had enough reasons to be thankful that fanatic book-burners, masquerading as firemen, were not at large. However, it seems as though they now have another fearsome foe to contend with: the millions of uncommon readers who are putting even the grandest bookshops out of business. Who could have imagined, even a few years ago, America without Barnes amp; Noble or Britain without Borders? Yet, that is precisely what is happening, as swarms of e-readers keep shoving good old bookshops out of their way. These uncommon readers seem to savour the cold glare of handheld screens rather than the feel of a crisp new paperback in their hands. They cannot be bothered to trail through rows of books in musty, or glitzy, shops when they can order whatever they fancy with a click of the mouse. Even better, in the labyrinths of the virtual world they can browse and access an infinite Borgesian library.        
	So where does all this leave the poor common reader? What would happen to the seasoned collector, whose heart still leaps with serendipitous delight the moment he sights a precious title volume tucked away in the depths of some dingy shop that looks more like an underground dungeon? He is, for sure, left with fewer options to choose from and enough reasons to grumble. Then there is a real possibility that he may wish not to be left out of the loop. As Amazons Kindle and Apples iPad do brisk business, seasoned bibliophiles may not be able to resist, for long, the temptation of holding entire libraries in their own electronic arms. Amazon, for instance, claims to have sold more e-books than printed hardbacks in the last quarter  which definitely makes electronic ink the biggest saviour of trees in this age of global warming.        
	Yet, the extinction of the bookshop, as a phenomenon, would take a long time to travel to the less prosperous Eastern shores. If bookstores are being forced to shut shop here, that is largely due to the decline in readership than for any other reason. At the same time, secondhand and niche bookshops, which are becoming increasingly rare in the West, are still alive in the East, even though they may not be thriving as they once did. Only in these havens of obscurity does one still stumble upon the odd cache of letters, a solitary visiting card or a withered leaf that was once pressed inside the pages of some prized volume and then quietly forgotten. It is in such stores that one may discover a book with copious marginalia or with a sad or silly or sentimental inscription on its opening pages. Whatever passion the Kindle might kindle in its users hearts, it would never be able to lead readers into the private lives of books.

	Bring them down                  
	Sir  Two footbridges  one at Sealdah near the ESI Hospital and the other opposite DVC towers  are hardly used by the people. These two structures take up a lot of space and have now become the favourite haunts of anti-social elements and drug addicts. If a footbridge is constructed near the Bangur Park-Kestopur crossing on VIP Road instead, it would be of great help to the common people. This crossing is particularly notorious for traffic jams, and a footbridge would solve the problem, at least partially.

	New winner           
	Sir  Congratulations to Saina Nehwal for winning the Hong Kong Open Super Series (Super triumph for Saina, Dec 13). Nehwal registered a scintillating win over Chinas Shixian Wang in three games to clinch her third Super Series title of the year. The victory made up for her disappointing performance in the Asian Games.           
	This magnificent victory was the fourth Super Series triumph of Nehwals career. She won three titles in a row  the Indian Open Grand Prix, the Singapore Open Super Series and the Indonesian Super Series  before clinching the gold medal in the Commonwealth Games. Nehwals win will help her inch closer to the number one spot. She has made her country very proud, and we wish her all the best for the forthcoming London Olympic.                     
	Yours faithfully,        Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh              
	Sir  Saina Nehwal won the Hong Kong Open recently. The news of her victory must have brought cheer to every Indian citizen. But it was shocking to see Indias electronic media covering the incident in an unprofessional manner. After Nehwal won the tournament in Hong Kong, a number of television channels started claiming that she had become the number one badminton player in the world.           
	It is unfortunate that the electronic media do not check facts before reporting them. A large number of people depend on television channels to get information. The electronic media must understand this and execute their duties in a responsible manner.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Saina Nehwal clinched the fourth Super Series title of her career with a thumping win over her Chinese opponent in the Hong Kong Open. Nehwal has become the only Indian woman badminton player to break the Chinese stranglehold on this sport. Nehwal has brought fame to India by excelling in a sport that has been traditionally dominated by China, Indonesia and Thailand.           
	Earlier too, she had brought laurels by winning back-to-back titles as well as the coveted gold medal in the Commonwealth Games held in New Delhi this October. It is great to have a badminton player of Nehwals calibre after the likes of Prakash Padukone and Pullela Gopichand.           
	In a cricket-crazy nation such as ours, in which people seem to be obsessed with the gentlemans game, Nehwal should be considered an exception in this respect. Badminton players, athletes and other sportsmen should be encouraged by Nehwals success. Hopefully, India will have many other Nehwals in days to come.           
	We hope that Nehwal will win more glory for the country in forthcoming international events such as the prestigious 2012 Olympics.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Ilustrado By Miguel Syjuco, Picador, 5.99        
	Ilustrado started out as a single narrative, 200,000 words long, says Miguel Syjuco. Then he ripped it into ten. Syjuco recalls summarizing each segment of the novel in one line on a strip of paper, colour-coded according to the narrative thread it belonged to. These strips were then arranged one after the other, as if in a scrapbook. A story strung from fragments, Ilustrado, which won the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2008, crackles with all the energy and uncertainty of a first novel.        
	To begin with, the noted Filipino writer, Crispin Salvador, is found dead, Christ-like in the Hudson River. Salvador, it is rumoured, had been working on a manuscript that would lift the veil that conceals the evil in the government and society of the Philippines. His student, archly named Miguel Syjuco, goes looking for the manuscript. Miguels search takes him all the way to the Philippines, a country he had once left behind himself. It is a journey back to the very roots of the present.        
	The form of the novel is perhaps as fragmented as the experience it depicts. For the roots of the present lie in the fractured and turbulent history of the Philippines. Centuries of Spanish rule had led to the revolution of the late-19th century, spurred by the Ilustrado, or the Enlightened. Much like the early Indian nationalists, the Ilustrados were intellectuals influenced by Western education that the colonizers introduced in the country. The promise of the revolution soon soured, giving way to decades of American rule and then the trauma of Japanese occupation. Shaky Filipino governments were to follow, and the brutalities of the Marcos regime. Modern-day Philippines, Miguel finds, is riddled with corruption and political scandal, poverty and frantic wealth, drugs, crime and the spectre of Islamic terrorism. He finds a people torn by history and struggling to be free of it. Woven into this are the personal histories of Salvador and Miguel; both are writers and exiles from the country of their birth.        
	This range of experience is documented through a variety of forms. At times, it is an exhausting variety, perhaps exceeding the demands of the story. There are sections of books written by Salvador, facsimiles of interviews, bits of a biography of Salvador written by Miguel, fervent blogging, text messages and stock jokes about Ernesto, the doltish Filipino. Then there is Miguels first-person narrative, for some reason closely mimicked in chatty, italicized third person. Ilustrado threatens to disintegrate into a barrage of impressions, flying thick and fast.        
	Characters appear and dissolve, stories melt away. As in too many contemporary novels, it is the writers persona that dominates the story. Syjuco suggests himself in the figure of the narrator, who in turn mirrors Crispin Salvador. But one finds out less about Salvador, more about Miguel and his frankly unappealing girlfriends. In Miguels memories of the writer, Salvador tends to launch into long tracts of polemic. These, however, contain some of the novels finest moments. And write to explain the world to yourself and to others, Salvador says. Just write, and write justly.... Dont make things new, make them whole.        
	The words have a silence about them. Miguel, Salvador, and maybe Syjuco himself, have struggled to find their place in history and ways to represent it. They finally seem to forge a relationship between themselves and their world. Ilustrados in their own times, they must carve out an identity from the chaos of history. In order to do so, they must first forget it. The whole novel, perhaps, is an attempt to forget.

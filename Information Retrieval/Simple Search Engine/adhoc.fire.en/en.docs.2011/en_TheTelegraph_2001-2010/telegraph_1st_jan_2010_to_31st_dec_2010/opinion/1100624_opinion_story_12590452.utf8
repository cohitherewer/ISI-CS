	Regress report                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitras article, Hard times (June 18), is a probing analysis of the debacle faced by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the recent civic polls in West Bengal. Mitra seems to be disillusioned with the CPI(M) owing to its deviation from the ideologies that had once formed its basis. Leaders such as Hare Krishna Konar and Muzaffar Ahmed, by their selfless and steady toil, had given the party a solid foundation. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and other members of the CPI(M) had built on that foundation to create a powerful party. It is unfortunate that they ultimately led the party to disaster. The only sensible measures that the CPI(M) took during its three decade-long tenure in West Bengal were the introduction of land reforms to help peasants, and the creation of the panchayat system.          
	Long before the withdrawal of the Left Fronts support from the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre that is often considered to be the CPI(M)s major blunder, decadence had taken root in the party. Now it is on the verge of extinction, and no effort on its part to amend its past mistakes may be enough to bring it out of this critical situation. The arrogance of the party leaders, their indifference to the peoples sufferings, the greed, corruption, nepotism that plagued the party, and its abysmal failures in many fields have paved the path for its decline. As Mitra aptly states, the present Left Front government needs to terminate itself without further ado.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilip Kumar Kar, Jalpaiguri 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitras comment that the Left re-established a measure of social tranquillity so missing in the state for some time and it steadfastly kept the interests of the poor in the fore sounds biased. West Bengal has never lived in tranquillity since the CPI(M) came to power. A large number of people have died in poll-related violence. So far as the interests of the poor are concerned, the social scientist, Jean Drze, has pointed out that West Bengal has the highest rate of hunger in rural households among the major Indian states. The national average in this respect is 2.5 per cent, for Bihar it is 3.2 per cent, for Orissa it is 5.9 per cent, while in West Bengal, 11.7 per cent of rural households go hungry every day. Fourteen out of the 18 districts of the state are among the 100 poorest districts of India. More than a quarter of the states population live below the poverty line, and in per capita gross domestic product growth, West Bengal lags behind most of the Indian states.          
	Gujarat, a state not ruled by the leftists, has taken better care of its poor than West Bengal has. Gujarat has primary health centres that cater only to the poor, and the state has also provided the underprivileged with better roads, better power and water supply. West Bengal, on the other hand, has failed to give sufficient support to its poor in all of these areas. It is populist propaganda of the Left that only leftists look after the poor. The facts prove otherwise.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra seems saddened by the fact that a disciplined party like the CPI(M), which had a cogent ideology and had initiated significant land reforms and the panchayat raj in West Bengal with a futuristic vision, is now facing decline. The party had once championed the cause of the working class, and has managed to hold sway over the state for decades. Today India needs leftist ideologies more than ever before to guide it through an explosive economic growth drive, when global factors are affecting its stability. Foreign ideologies must be moulded to suit local situations. It is inopportune that precisely at this point the Left Front is losing its grip over its strongholds. The CPI(M)s failure to evolve with a changing political milieu and to deal with certain misgivings that arise out of decades of uninterrupted rule have widened the gap between the peoples expectations of the party and the partys capability to meet those expectations. A rift in the party has been increasingly evident for quite some time now. The leaders of the CPI(M) must accept the blame for having failed the party and its cause. The CPI(M) has always been stridently critical of others follies, but it has never reflected on its own. Its political allies, which never questioned its blunders in return for political support, are equally responsible for its downfall.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

                
	Never simple          
	Sir  In dealing with the suicide of a young boy allegedly induced by corporal punishment, newspaper and television reports have apportioned blame in a curiously facile way (Principal says sorry, wont cane again, June 15). This is disturbing, since psychiatrists always say that the causes of suicide are never simple or easy to diagnose.          
	The people, the media and even childrens rights organizations are not in a position to pass a conclusive verdict on this case. The school is only one part of a childs life; the environment at home also contributes to his well-being or to the lack of it. It would have been fairer to have let the reports of the investigating authorities come out before demonizing the principal of the school in which the boy studied.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayasri Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The media have reported in considerable detail the events consequent to the death of Rouvanjit Rawla of La Martiniere for Boys. The sustained one-sided campaign against the principal, Sunirmal Chakravarthi, is unfair. This may tarnish the reputation of an esteemed institution and of the person at its helm.           
	Many of us might have been punished or caned in school, but that did not make us contemplate suicide. There could be more to Rouvanjit Rawlas death that just punishment given to him in school.          
	Yours faithfully,

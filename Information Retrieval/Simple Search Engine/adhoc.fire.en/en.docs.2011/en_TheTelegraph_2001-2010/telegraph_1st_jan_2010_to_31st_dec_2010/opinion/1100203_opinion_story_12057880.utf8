The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Noise Alert
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOISE ALERT                                                    
	The West Bengal Pollution Control Board has finally realized, after carrying out an elaborate survey, that drivers in Calcutta love to put car horns to good use. Together with rickety, old vehicles spewing deadly fumes, endlessly honking traffic has been unbearably real for Calcuttans for far too long. The PCB need not have waited till well into the 21st century to decide that unregulated vehicular emission and noise levels could be fatally harmful. But now that it has acknowledged the problem, the PCB has decided to jump into the fray to combat it with great earnestness. As with the ban on loud firecrackers, it has put an embargo on honking in various areas for several hours of the day, threatening errant drivers with strict penalties. The existing rules for blaring loudspeakers have been extended to include music played on home stereos and industrial noise. While these are noble measures indeed, belated righteousness often fails to keep pace with the ground realities.         
	It is not for nothing that Indian cities are some of the noisiest in the world. The astonishing lack of traffic rules, civic decorum and safety standards often make honking indispensable on Indian roads. Indians are notorious jaywalkers. Even the most educated of them habitually ignore the green light while crossing busy intersections, show scant regard for the zebra crossing and have little patience to consider if they are alighting on the right side of the road. So, before putting the blame squarely on feckless drivers, one should spare a thought on what a noise-free Calcutta augurs for its citizens. In most Western societies, just as honking without reason is a sign of delinquency, so is walking with ones head in the clouds appallingly bad manners. Of course, the prevailing ethos in India is shockingly different: speeding after a drunken night-out, running over people asleep on the pavement, barging through check-posts and playing the car stereo in full blast are some of the common expressions of wealth, power, social privilege and machismo. Seated behind the wheel, one should be accountable for all the lives teeming around  negotiating crowded streets, lying ill in hospitals, studying in classrooms, or trying to get a good nights rest. Equally, responsible conduct in public spaces remains a basic duty of good citizens.

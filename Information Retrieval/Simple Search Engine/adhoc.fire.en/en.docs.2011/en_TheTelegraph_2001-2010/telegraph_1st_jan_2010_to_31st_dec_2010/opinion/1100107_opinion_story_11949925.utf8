The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Words dipped in poison
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WORDS DIPPED IN POISON                                  CHINA DIARY -Neha Sahay                              
	Dont bother to call the police. We are in high-level positions. The vice-colonel of a paramilitary unit said this to a security guard who had rushed to intervene after the colonels wife slapped a tour guide. The guide, just 19, had objected to the wife touching a mural at a historical site. But the guard called the police anyway, and on the testimony of the tourists present, the police demanded that the high-level couple apologize. The next day, the wife, who was a communist party secretary of a hospital attached to the corps, did apologize with obvious insincerity in the presence of all the guides. However, the video of the slapping incident was posted online, and the resultant furore led to the couples dismissal from their posts.        
	The real surprise in all this is that the colonels directive was right on top of a list compiled by the China Daily of the Top 10 darndest [sic] things officials said in 2009. Also on that list is this threat: I will have your website shut down if you dare to report it. This came from an education official when a journalist asked him about a teacher slapping him for harassing her at an official banquet.        
	Its not officials alone who treat the people with contempt. A remark by a Beijing professor became the talk of the country: 99 per cent of repeat petitioners are mentally ill, said the professor, an expert with the ministry of mental health. Talking to the media about the growing number of people travelling to Beijing from the countryside, armed with petitions against wrongs done to them by local authorities, the professor said that those who refuse to give up and return to the capital even after being sent back without redressal are mentally ill. Across the country, there was a clamour against the professor, with 200 persons signing a petition demanding his expulsion from Peking University. He had to apologize.                
	A job well done        
	Then there was the sportswoman who, offended with a journalist at a press conference, asked him, Which media organization do you work for? The head of Chinas national diving team, Zhou Jihong, had led China to seven out of eight golds at the Beijing Olympics. However, it was rumoured that she had fixed the results of the 11th National Games held in October. Asked about this, she went on the offensive. A similar question was asked by an official when a journalist questioned him about the reported misuse of public funds by one of his departments. Are you a member of the CPC (Communist Party of China)? he had asked belligerently.         
	China Dailys list reveals two things. One, the corruption and arrogance of party officials have become so widespread that it is no longer possible for the official media to ignore them. This is what one official said to a 66-year-old threatening to kill himself by jumping off the top floor if the former didnt help him with his demolition compensation claim  Its none of my business. Go straight to the fifth floor. Dont choose the first or second floor. Another official told this to a couple who had resisted demolition by throwing Molotov cocktails on the demolition squad: You are doomed to be punished if you fight against the government. Any action against the government is illegal.         
	Second, while party functionaries have forgotten their role, the restrictions on the official media have not inhibited them from performing theirs. There could be no better illustration of the distance CPC officials have travelled since the time Mao exhorted them to Serve the people than the following question that was asked by the vice-director of a city urban planning bureau. Questioned about luxury houses built on land meant for low-cost housing, he retorted, Are you a mouthpiece for the Party or the people? He was suspended from his post.

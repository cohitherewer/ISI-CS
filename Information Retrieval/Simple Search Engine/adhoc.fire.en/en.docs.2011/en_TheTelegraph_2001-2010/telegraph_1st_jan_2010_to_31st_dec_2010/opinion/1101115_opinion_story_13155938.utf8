	You probably noticed reports recently about the secret trial in Georgia of two Armenian men who tried to sell highly enriched uranium to a man purporting to be an Islamist terrorist. The apparent buyer was actually an undercover policeman and the whole thing was a sting operation from start to finish, but it offers some interesting insights into the current state of play in the world of counter-terrorism.        
	The would-be sellers of the HEU were two nave losers, a 63-year-old failed businessman called Sumbat Tonoyan who had gambled his money away, and a 59-year-old physicist, Hrant Ohanyan, who was chronically ill. They wanted to score a big win in order to finance their retirement, and they fell right into the Georgian polices trap.        
	A petty criminal called Garik Dadayan first approached Ohanyan in 2002 with a packet of metallic powder, asking whether it was HEU. Ohanyan, a scientist at the Yerevan Physics Institute, confirmed that it was uranium though he could not say how enriched it was. Dadayan was subsequently arrested trying to cross the frontier into Georgia with 200 grams of HEU.        
	Dadayan was out of jail by 2005, so Ohanyan knew where to go when his friend Tonoyan suggested that they could make a fortune by peddling HEU to terrorists. Dadayan told them that he had friends in Russia who could supply them with unlimited amounts of HEU, and suggested that they start by finding a buyer and selling him a sample amount.        
	Its almost certain that Dadayan was working for the Georgian intelligence service by this time. The fact that in the end he only gave them 18gm of HEU to take to Georgia reinforces that suspicion. And it was the Georgian police who supplied the buyer, a Turkish-speaking undercover policeman who said he was in the market for nuclear material on behalf of serious people.                
	Show and tell        
	Last March, the two mugs took the night train from Yerevan to Tbilisi, with the 18gm of HEU hidden in a cigarette box that was lined with lead strips to fool the American-supplied radiation detectors at the border. When Tonoyan showed up at a Tbilisi hotel the next day to close the sale, the police filmed the whole transaction and then arrested him and his partner-in-crime.        
	Georgias motivation in all this is clear. Prime Minister Mikheil Saakashvili is trying to rebuild the close relationship he used to have with the United States of America before his rash attempt to seize South Ossetia by force in 2008. He will do anything to make himself useful to the US intelligence services. Why do the US intelligence services want to emphasize the risk of nuclear material falling into the wrong hands? Because that would be a bad thing, of course, but also to underline the fact that thwarting nuclear terrorism is entirely their job.        
	They want us to conclude that the military should not be allowed anywhere near counter-terrorist operations, partly because the tools they use are entirely inappropriate for the job, and partly because invading countries tends to radicalize people and turn them into your enemies. The little show-and-tell in Georgia serves the purposes of US intelligence officers who know that the military must be excluded from their operations but have trouble fending them off. It also helps to justify their budgets, although the threat they are seeking to protect us from is smaller than they claim.        
	Im happy to have them play their intelligence games, because it might prevent something like a dirty bomb from exploding in an American city. If that did happen, the popular pressure on President Barack Obama to invade some other Muslim country would be well-nigh irresistible. Thats not what we need right now.

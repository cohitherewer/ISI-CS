The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Little effect
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LITTLE EFFECT                                                    True to its name, Experimenter gallery champions unusual art, although, as with experiments, the results are often hard to predict. The exhibition of photographs by Ariel Ruiz i Altaba (Minimal Landscapes, March 12-25), for instance, featured stark images in the abstract mode. The artist, a noted scientist specializing in stem cell research, has tried to capture the mystery that dwells in the interstices of science and art. Under a microscope, cellular activity takes on the aspect of a riveting map, charting the ebbs and flows of fluids, feelings and forces in the body. These spots and squiggles, printed on paper, conjure up the minimal landscapes that lend the collection its title. The effect is more anodyne than arresting as these black-and-white images, with ingenious captions like My Lovers Heart, struggle to suggest the ineffable in the viewers mind. Some of these compositions, if they can be called that, appear to be too much of a set piece, either contrived to the core or vacuously decorative, so that they leave no resonance as the best minimalist art does.

	Two hundred words is the smallest space this page allots to a review. It seems impossible to write that much on The Company Theatres The Blue Mug, sponsored by Ballantines Leave an Impression, which left no impression. Since the subject was memories and amnesia, it fits that we remember precious little. The six celebrity actors (and the mostly theatre-illiterate spectators) thought that relating personal recollections of trivial incidents creates drama; they forgot that it usually takes a playwright to put things together. Atul Kumars non-direction makes them amble around aimlessly outside the lights (why have lighting, then?) and ramble on with an unprecedented vacuity of banal experiences, supposedly based on Oliver Sackss psychiatric case studies titled The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. Evidently, the cast mistook this for theatre. Only Ranvir Shorey acts memorably, as a patient mentally stuck in 1983, repeating the same lines about himself. Sheeba Chadha produces a few interesting voice changes, but the rest merely carry out workshop exercises that novices do better. Instead of chalking scribbles on black flats, they should return to the drawing board. Birla Sabhagars delicious chaat was infinitely superior. Thats 194 words. Empty, forgettable. There, I made it.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FILMY FLAVOUR                                                    
	The Indian Premier League has pioneered a new game of cricket, but in another respect it is turning out to be traditionally Indian  it is picking up a quintessentially filmy flavour. No Indian film is complete without a hero and a villain. The IPL drama started with only one of the two, but it has found an excellent actor to play the other. In one respect it betters Bollywood. The latters heroes and villains are cardboard characters; it is impossible to mistake one for the other. But between Lalit Modi and Shashi Tharoor, the choice is entirely open; at least for now, the honours are equally divided. At the outset, the third essential element, a ravishing beauty, was not quite there. It was artificially brought in by Juhi Chawla and Preity Zinta amongst the owners. But theirs were cameo appearances; when, rarely, the camera focused on them, they waved coyly, and went back to their role as boring owners. The drama their performances lacked was made up for by the entry from the western entrance of Sunanda Pushkar; there may be doubts about her wealth, but there can be none about her looks. She has hitherto kept out of the limelight. But that is only likely to enhance the mystery surrounding her.        
	With so much juicy action going on, Indians should be dancing with joy. But here comes our killjoy element; instead of enjoying their good fortune, most spectators  especially the grown-ups  are outraged. They find something unsavoury about the entire situation; the fact that they cannot agree on what it is makes things even worse. Is it the fact that Mr Modi has not been entirely neutral between teams  some would say not entirely above board? But irrespective of whom he likes and does not, the League continues. No one except a paranoid astrologer would think that Mr Modi can influence the outcome of the matches; at any rate, the performances match the normal uncertainties of cricket, and there has been no whiff of rigging till now. And given the lack of bonhomie between Mr Modi and Mr Tharoor, the looks of Ms Pushkar are unlikely to make any difference to the fortunes of the enterprise she partly and fictionally owns.        
	There are two plays being performed before India  the League, and the Twitter. If the two were to get mixed up, they might vitiate each others outcome. For those whose faith in cricket as a gentlemens game still survives, that would be a tragedy. But a tragedy for now does not look even possible, let alone likely. True, either play may have an end not entirely to ones liking. But that is inherent in games of chance; those who do not like uncertainty should keep as far away from cricket and real-life drama as they can. For the rest of us, it is a great show; long may it go on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Like a Trooper
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LIKE A TROOPER                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	Few Britons these days doubt that Tony Blair and his hired bagman Alastair Campbell lied like troopers to drag Britain into Bushs war against Iraq. An official committee of enquiry is now asking just what went on. Its report will no doubt be a fudge; thats what governments set up enquiries to produce. Id prefer facts. Yet watching Campbell last week defy the committees pussyfooting questions, I had to admire the brass neck with which he did it.        
	He and Blair stand accused of sexing up fuzzy intelligence reports about Saddam Husseins mythical weapons of mass destruction into the hard-edged claptrap that was fed to the British parliament and people. Sexing up? No way, said Campbell flatly, and I even managed a moments sympathy as he rejected not just that charge but the very phrase itself.        
	Why do we employ so many metaphors and similes? Ive peppered the paragraphs above with them, though, with some difficulty, I kept my fingers off poodle. Look hard at the ones I did use, and just how much do they convey.        
	Take the metaphors. Campbell, after all, was not hired to carry bags into 10 Downing Street, but half-truths  Im being generous  to the media out of it. Pussyfoot, in contrast, is nicely precise: the committee did indeed slide delicately round awkward points like a cat round a chair-leg. But what has ones neck, brass or not, to do with impudence? Can intelligence reports truly grow fuzz? How does one add sex to them? Can claptrap, a theatre term originally, really have hard edges? And then be fed to people?        
	Next the simile. Why say a man lies like a trooper? Or, in another formula, swears like one? Are or were such soldiers especially prone to falsehood or bad language? I dont know. So what do I add by dragging them in? English abounds with such phrases. I readily admit to being bald as a coot  a waterbird whose head is indeed short of some plumage, though far less so than mine. Readily, maybe, but informatively? No.                
	And more        
	One can be blind as a bat, dead as a doornail (or the dodo), deaf as a post (or doorpost), dumb as an ox, fat as butter, thin as a rake, fit as a fiddle, smart as paint, strong as a horse, weak as water, bold as brass (hence perhaps Mr Campbells neck), brave as a lion (they arent very), bright as a button, clean as a whistle, cool as a cucumber, drunk as a lord, sober as a judge, dull as ditchwater, good as gold, mad as a hatter, merry as a cricket, poor as a church mouse, rich as Croesus, pretty as a picture, quick as a flash, right as rain, dry as dust (or a bone), free as the wind, brown as a berry (few British berries are), green as grass, black as night (or pitch  the old word for tar  or sin or the ace of spades), white as a sheet with fright, or as the driven snow in ones innocence. And a pair can be like as two pins.        
	And more. But whats gained by using such comparisons? When the late Princess Diana charmingly once admitted that she wasnt very clever, did she add any more than charm by calling herself, in a newer phrase, thick as two planks?        
	Some of these similes are out-of-date: church mice, Croesus and crickets  an insect commoner in Italy than Britain  are not much met these days. Of the rest, one or two are truly apt: pins really are more alike than most things. Some are odd, many obvious, a few inexplicable. Most, by now, are clichs.        
	So why do I enjoy and use them, albeit seldom in writing? You may think the reason is plain as a pikestaff and clear as crystal: Im lazy. Clear as mud, Id say, a modern irony rare among such phrases, and I wont say more: a full explanation would be long as a piece of string  any length that I chose, that is. Or that The Telegraph would allow me.

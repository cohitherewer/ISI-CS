	The great divide                   
	Sir  In the article, The divided nation (Aug 5), Sukanta Chaudhuri offers his customary balanced opinion on the issues and conflicts that the country is fraught with.          
	To begin with, the author speaks of the Central Bureau of Investigations new submission on the Bhopal gas tragedy. The furore over the recent judgment on the tragedy had prompted the govern-ment to make a show of sympathy and assess the damage caused by the accident. As Chaudhuri points out, however, The damage in question was clearly not to the Bhopal victims but to the rulers who betrayed them. Meanwhile, protesters all over the country continue to cry out for the punishment of those responsible for shielding the guilty parties.          
	Chaudhuri goes on to discuss the Right to Education Act, which is predictably high on promise. But little has been done to implement it. Elite schools remain open to those who have money and power but inaccessible to the less privileged, despite the provisions of the new act. Like most people, Chaudhuri seems to want honest adherence to laws and rules. There should be no discriminatory treatment of citizens in a democratic polity. The growing gap between promise and practice, policy formulation and its implementation, is at the root of most of the problems that divide the country.          
	The Maoist menace, for instance, has reached almost uncontrollable proportions. The governments inept handling of the situation is compounded by the irresponsible behaviour of political parties. The latter are more interested in deriving political mileage out of the crisis rather than in doing something constructive to contain the widespread violence. For years, the deprivation and hardship suffered by the tribal people have been ignored by the authorities. The growing desperation of the former has been used by political parties to foment discontent and create an ugly situation. The challenge is not confined to Lalgarh only. States like Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are also suffering from insurgency. The government has woken up too late to the problem. One cannot but agree with Chaudhuri: development is impossible in areas in the grip of continual violence.          
	The miserable plight of the people in the Sunderbans, the trouble in Kashmir and the controversy around the Commonwealth Games have put the government in a spot. As long as we  the readers (and columnists) of The Telegraph  keep mimicking the rich and the powerful, there is no escaping the inevitable doom. Disaster management is an art that few in the government, and outside it, are skilled in.          
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

      
	Sir  In his article, Sukanta Chaudhuri chooses four key issues that have divided the country. His choice of these issues seems to stem from the fact that they concern the poorest and most deprived sections of society.          
	The principle, from each according to his ability to each according to his need, is now largely dismissed as utopian. Nevertheless, it might not be completely irrelevant in the current context. The United Nations Development Programme and an Oxford-based group recently launched a multidimensional poverty index. According to the results of the survey, certain states in India ranked among the regions with the highest MPI levels.           
	In the absence of a government that is capable of dealing with the countrys problems, it is up to the people to come up with ways to smooth out the inequalities between the rich and the poor. Dwelling on the misfortunes of the last six decades will not help anymore. Effective action is the need of the hour.           
	Yours faithfully,

	All included          
	Sir  The editorial, New space (Aug 2), was thought-provoking. Bangalore University as well as the National Law School of India University must be congratulated for reserving seats for transgender candidates. One hopes that other universities follow suit. Transgender people are a reality and must be accepted by society.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I appreciate the move made by Bangalore University to reserve seats for transgender people. It follows the principle that sexual identity should not be a barrier in the admission to any institution. All people, no matter what their sexual orientation, have the right to equal opportunity. Depriving transgender candidates of educational facilities would be a loss for the country, as many of them might turn out to be great scholars.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Hena Ahmed, Howrah

	It certainly does not reflect well on the efficiency of the Indian institutes of technology that the question papers for the joint entrance examinations this year contained errors. The IITs are regarded as symbols of excellence in technical education; hence incompetence in entrance examination papers is especially embarrassing. This is apart from the fact that no institution that relies on a fair test for entry can afford to get anything wrong in its question papers.        
	Having said this, it is important to acknowledge that the creators of the standards of excellence are the institutions themselves. Errors in their question papers indicate a slip in those standards, and no one but they themselves can correct it. The IITs each has its own director, who takes on the responsibility of both achievement and failure of the institution. The kind of problem represented by errors in question papers has to do with procedural faults within the institutions. They are entirely within the jurisdiction of the directors concerned. IIT Madras had organized this years entrance test, and it can reasonably be expected that the director, perhaps in consultation with his peers, would find a way to recompense candidates for the institutions errors. It is, therefore, deeply unsettling to find that the Union human resource development minister, Kapil Sibal, has not only demanded an explanation from an IIT director for the errors, but has also set a date for the directors to declare how they plan to recompense the candidates. The minister has reportedly told the directors to ensure that such mistakes are not repeated, exactly as though they were head prefects fallen down on the job. The HRD ministrys overbearing attitude ignores the principle that it is there to frame education policies, not to interfere with the actual working of the institutions. If every expert charged with institutional responsibility has to be accountable to politicians at every step, there cannot be much scope for developing human resources or cultivating excellence. Instead, politicization would enter by the backdoor. Mr Sibals job is not to put directors and vice-chancellors on the mat, but to trust the best persons to do the jobs they have been appointed to. A separation of responsibilities is the only means of advancement. Mr Sibal will do education no good if he sits down to monitor each and every examination, irrespective of how many candidates are appearing for it.

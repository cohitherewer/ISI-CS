	THE TIGER: SOUL OF INDIA (Oxford, Rs 1,995), By Valmik Thapar, will certainly surprise readers who had expected the book to be yet another erudite rendition on the challenges to conserving tigers in India. What Thapar explores instead is the process by which the tiger got symbolically assimilated into Indias rich cultural ethos through different historical epochs. The evidence of this assimilation, Thapar argues, is manifest in the diverse art forms which remind us of the ancient bond that binds humans to this majestic animal. The earliest artistic representations of the tiger can be found in rock art, some of which still survives in ancient cave shelters in Madhya Pradeshs Bhimbetka, Mahadeo hills and Panna. Seals depicting tigers in highly stylized forms flourished during the Indus Valley Civilization, and the Atharva Veda also contains references to Indias national animal.        
	Significantly, the Mauryan age witnessed considerable interest in the tiger in Hellenistic writings as well as in Buddhist texts. Mosaics were used to portray the tiger in Roman art, while coins from the Gupta and the Chola periods contained similar symbols. However, it was the Mughal period that was the most prolific in terms of tiger art. Given the animals association with notions like royalty, power and strength, it was a favourite subject of some of the court painters. The Kota School of painting, for instance, which specialized in the depiction of tiger hunts, gained eminence around this time. Etchings, engravings and paintings from the raj indicate that the tiger continued to be an object of fascination for the Western eye. This artistic tradition has been upheld in modern times by the painters of Sawai Madhopur.        
	The tiger has inspired not only art but also rituals, myths and legends, especially among Indias tribal communities. The Worli tribe of Maharashtra holds the vagha devata (Tiger God) in reverence. Bhils, Santhals and Baghel Rajputs believe the tiger to be their ancestor and Gond folk tales are replete with references to tigers. This rich tapestry of folk narratives provides compelling evidence of the relationship that forest dwellers have forged with the tiger across ages.        
	Thapars research and anecdotal style make this book a treat for both lay readers and scholars. His shortcomings as a writer have been ably compensated by the 250-odd photographs that embellish the book, together with Romila Thapars illuminating historical commentary. Left is an 18th-century Mughal painting that shows a mendicant sitting with his disciple and a remarkably docile tiger. Top depicts an example of ancient rock art, while far right is a photograph of a man painted in tiger stripes during Dussehra. The two images (bottom) of the striped beast in calendar art and textile labels indicate that the tiger has been successfully appropriated by religion as well as commerce.

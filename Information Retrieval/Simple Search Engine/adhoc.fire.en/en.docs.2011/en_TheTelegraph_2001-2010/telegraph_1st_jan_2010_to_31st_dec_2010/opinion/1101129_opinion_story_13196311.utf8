                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        START ANEW                                  Gwynne Dyer                              
	It was a Republican president, Richard Nixon, who signed the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (Salt) with the old Soviet Union in 1972. It was another Republican president, the elder George Bush, who signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) with Russia in 1993. But it was a Democratic president who signed the New Start treaty, and that seems to be the problem. The treaty, signed by the American president, Barack Obama, and the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, in Prague last April, is a useful document. It mandates 30 per cent cuts in deployed strategic nuclear weapons by both sides, and it is the cornerstone of a new era of US-Russian cooperation.        
	The cuts are valuable in themselves, because they oblige the two countries, which together possess 90 per cent of the worlds nuclear weapons, to go down to 1,550 warheads each. The treaty also imposes a drastic reduction in delivery vehicles from 1,600 for each country under the last treaty to only 700 in the future.        
	But the symbolic importance of the New Start treaty is at least as important, as it was the first concrete step in the reconciliation of the two former superpowers. The immediate diplomatic benefits of the treaty for the United States of America have included Russian support for harsher sanctions in response to Irans alleged nuclear weapons programme, Russian logistical support for the Natos operation in Afghanistan, and a remarkable degree of Russian-American co-ordination in dealing with the chaos in Kyrgyzstan.        
	You can, of course, criticize the specific content of each of these policies, but you cannot deny that US-Russian cooperation is, in general, a good thing. Nor can you deny that it depends on mutual trust, which would be drastically undermined by a US refusal to ratify the New Start treaty. Yet that is what is likely to happen now.                
	Ill omens        
	In order to ratify an international treaty, the US Senate must pass it by a two-thirds vote: 67 out of 100 senators. That means the administration must get eight Republicans to vote for it even in the outgoing Senate, where the Democrats hold 59 seats. But when the new senators elected in the mid-term elections early this month take their seats in January, the Democratic majority will be a bare 51 seats.        
	After that, ratifying the treaty would require 16 Republican senators to vote for it, which is virtually impossible to imagine. Thats why President Obama is desperate to get the treaty ratified by the current lame-duck session of the Congress, which has less than four weeks to run. The omens are not good.        
	The question is whether eight Republican Congressmen are willing to put national interest ahead of their partisan desire to deprive Obama of his one major foreign policy success. Senator Jon Kyl, the Republican whip in the Senate, says that there is not enough time to push the treaty through during the lame-duck session, although it has already been through seven months of deliberations and 20 hearings in the Senate. Game, set and match to the Republicans, but what about the country and the world? The consequence of an American refusal to ratify the treaty would not be a new Cold War, but a deeply disillusioned Russia, which had concluded that the US was not a trustworthy partner. Cooperation would diminish in the world, and confrontations would grow.        
	More importantly, there would be no restrictions whatever on the number of nuclear weapons the two countries could produce. Worst of all, it would provide hawks in the emerging great powers, China and India, with a wonderful pretext for demanding more nuclear weapons. Why should they restrict themselves to about 180 and 60 respectively, when the older powers have several thousand of the things?

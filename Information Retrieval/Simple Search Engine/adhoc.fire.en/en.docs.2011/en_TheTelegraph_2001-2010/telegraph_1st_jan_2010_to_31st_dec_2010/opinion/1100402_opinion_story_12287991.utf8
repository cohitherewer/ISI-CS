	STONES INTO SCHOOLS: PROMOTING PEACE WITH BOOKS, NOT BOMBS, IN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN By Greg Mortenson, Viking, 12.99        
	According to a Pashtun myth, Allah patched together Afghanistan from the stones that were left over after he had finished making the rest of the world. Nothing is regular, nothing predictable in the region. This theme runs throughout the book. It holds especially true for the Kirghiz people who live at the extreme end of the narrow strip of land on the easternmost edge of Afghanistan. This is known as the Wakhan corridor. Stones into Schools is the narrative of an attempt to build a school for these people at the end of the road.        
	Till 1993, Greg Mortenson was a mountaineer. A failed attempt to scale the K2 that year made him give up this profession. But perhaps the pull of the landscape was too strong for him to return to his job in Berkeley. As he was making his way down from the base camp, he lost his way, but found a vocation  setting up schools for children in these remote areas. A spirit of adventure marks his efforts. Mortenson is, after all, a mountaineer at heart. He carries forward his mission keeping in mind one of the most important rules of mountaineering  one must make do with whatever is locally available. This has become the biggest strength of the Central Asia Institute that he runs in Pakistan and Afghanistan. All CAI schools are built with the express permission of the village elders, convincing some of whom takes years, and with the contribution of land and labour from the local people themselves. This is how Mortenson has been able to ensure that the villagers feel involved in the education of their own children.        
	Mortenson makes no bones about Americas advantage in promoting education in strife-torn countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan. He sees schools  specifically those for girls  as the most effective way to combat extremism. He argues that in Muslim societies, most young men, before joining the jihad, seek permission from their mothers for their mission. In most cases, the blessing is withheld if the mother is educated. But Mortenson never quite questions the notion of women being repositories of culture (the anthem of the book, and his justification for building schools for girls, is borrowed from an African proverb, If you teach a boy, you educate an individual. But if you teach a girl, you educate a community).        
	Schools also act as symbols of stability. Mortenson talks of how, after the 2005 earthquake had devastated most of Pakistan and Afghanistan, CAI immediately started rebuilding schools. It would have been more tempting to channel resources to relief work, considering that the people were deprived of basic amenities. But schools seemed like potent symbols of hope and showed that life was going back to normal. This was an effort to make good a loss that the earthquake had brought upon the people of Pakistan and Afghanistan: In less than four minutes, an entire generation of literate children had been wiped out.        
	This book is a gripping account of the way CAI functions. A hero emerges through the narrative  Sarfraz Khan. He is one of the Dirty Dozen (as they are fondly called by their boss) who comprise the CAI ground-staff, a bunch of renegades and misfits. Hailing from the Charpurson valley, Sarfraz becomes the point man for CAI activities in the region. His antics remain in the readers mind. He is fiercely energetic and always in control. It is eventually Sarfraz who singlehandedly supervises the school that the CAI builds for the Kirghiz.

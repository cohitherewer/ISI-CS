                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PROMISING PERFORMANCE                                  DANCE: Sharmila Basu Thakur                                                  
	The first performance of a dancer on stage is called arangetram or manchapravesh. Through this recital, the dancer gets an opportunity to display her talent, and this often becomes the starting point of a career in dance. Moreover, apart from regular practice in classes, an artist needs to perform in front of rasikas to be appreciated. An interaction between the artist and the audience enriches the former. L. Swetha, a young Bharatnatyam dancer, made her debut at Gyan Manch recently. Under the tutelage of Sujatha Ramalingam, the dancer offered a bouquet of traditional Bharatnatyam presentations, ranging from alarippu to thillana.         
	It is interesting to watch a debut performance that is lively and spontaneous. It is also inspiring to see a young dancer pursue this classical dance form with devotion and dedication. Dressed in a traditional Bharatnatyam costume, Swetha began her performance with kaali kauthuvam  which epitomizes the majesty of the goddess  and followed it up with alarippu based on mishra triputa taal. After these invocatory numbers, the artist presented jathiswaram, a pure dance number where jathis were combined aesthetically with proper swaras. Incorporating neat mudras and crisp footwork, the presentation was executed with speed and precision. This was followed by shabdam, which depicted the beauty of Shivas beloved. However, this presentation lacked adequate expression. Varnam  the most difficult element in Bharatnatyam that demands rhythm, expression and a proper understanding of the genre  was Swethas next presentation. Two keerthanais were included in the recital: one depicted the dancing prowess of Ganesha and the other narrated the lives of Rama and Krishna.         
	Swethas expression, undoubtedly, requires improvement. Classical dance is not merely about grammatical perfection and rhythm. It also requires adequate interpretation, experience and maturity. But it will be fair to say that Swetha has managed to master most of the intricacies of Bharatnatyam.         
	The programme concluded with thillana, a pure rhythmic number with sculpturesque poses and varied patterns of movements. The artist was supported by Gayatri Krishnamurthy and Siddharth Manghat (vocals), G. Suryanarayan Iyer (mridangam), A.S. Vishal (violin), B.V.S. Sharma (flute) and Sujatha Ramalingam on the nattubhangam. Kavya Iyer and Khushi Kejriwal acted as compres for the programme, which appeared tedious at times.

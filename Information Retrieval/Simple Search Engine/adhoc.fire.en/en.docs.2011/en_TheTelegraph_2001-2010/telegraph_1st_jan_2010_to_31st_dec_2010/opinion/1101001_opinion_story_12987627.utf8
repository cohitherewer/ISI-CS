	Death drive                  
	Sir  The report, Track turns jumbo grave (Sept 24), devastated me. It is unthinkable, and a matter of deep shame, that seven elephants were killed by a goods train speeding through the forests of Alipurduar in north Bengal. It is also ironic that the deaths occurred on anant chaturdashi, the day Ganesh idols are immersed after the puja. The eminently avoidable deaths make a mockery of the administrative system of the Indian Railways. In the past few months, many men, women and children have lost their lives in railway accidents and now, not one but seven animals have been mowed down by a train. After every accident, the railway minister usually denies responsibility and starts playing a blame game. In this case too, the rail ministry has found a convenient scapegoat in the forest department. Notwithstanding the controversy over elephant corridors cutting across the train tracks, one fails to understand how the railways can be so lackadaisical about the vital issue of safety.           
	Three decades of misrule by the Left Front are making their presence felt in West Bengal. But for me, being anti-Left is as suffocating a feeling as being pro-Left, given the performance of the Union railways minister, who is also the chief of the Opposition in West Bengal. The state needs change  not merely for the sake of change, but for the better. The railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, cannot go about her task with her eyes fixed on the chief ministers chair. Can political ambition be completely divorced from reality? How can Banerjee think about her career, and not about her duties to her office, when 13 elephants have died in train collisions this year?           
	The accident spot was bang in the middle of tea gardens, without any tall tree around to obstruct the vision of the driver. Since the moon was out, it could not have been difficult to spot the elephants crossing the tracks. What happened was nothing short of murder. Murder of a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act. We need a radically new way of thinking if human beings and animals are to survive.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Gone awry          
	Sir  Every time I am out on the streets of Calcutta, I hope and pray that the promised political change would involve ending the chaos that now prevails on the roads. The traffic police should know their duty, and make minibuses, buses, autorickshaws and taxis stop only at designated places. But traffic sergeants, in their smart uniforms and dark glasses, can often be seen leaning like heroes against their bikes, much to the delight of college students and young housewives, while all around them traffic swirls madly. Do these officers not have the authority to tackle erring drivers? Taxis and buses frequently hold up vehicles at the foot of the Gariahat flyover near Golpark while they wait to collect fares from passengers.           
	When the new mayor took charge of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, we looked forward to cleaner streets. The roads of such a busy and densely-populated city need to be swept at least twice a day. And if hawkers have the right to earn their living on the streets, it is also their duty to keep their places of business clean. The last mayor of Calcutta kept reiterating that all the major cities in the world have hawkers. He forgot to mention that the same hawkers also keep the streets tidy. We fervently hope that the CMC will do something to stop garbage from piling up on the streets of Calcutta, and hawkers will behave more responsibly.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Uma Majumdar, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In spite of the ever-increasing number of road accidents, buses continue to run down the streets of Calcutta at breakneck speed, overtaking other buses, and hauling up passengers from the roads. Is it not possible to fix a speed limit for buses? In the cities of Gujarat and in Mumbai, buses are not allowed to run faster than 40 kilometres per hour. Even on highways, the speed limit is 60 kmph. The state government should wake up from its stupor and save common people from killer buses.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
P.J. Kaushik, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is legally mandatory for all riders of two-wheelers and their pillions to wear helmets. Those who do not do so are liable to be punished under the Motor Vehicles Act. In West Bengal, quite a large number of riders do not care to comply with this rule, which is primarily meant for their protection. This is more so in the case of pillion riders, who never bother about wearing helmets. Traffic policemen are supposed to apprehend these law-breakers. But barring a diligent few, most traffic officers remain casual, allowing the risk-taking offenders to have their way. One can hardly see motorcyclists without helmets in the big cities and towns elsewhere in the country. This speaks highly of the riders awareness and makes a favourable comment on the effective vigilance of the traffic cops.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Rita Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The residents of Watgunge have been suffering a lot ever since the bus service in the Cathedral Church-Pan Bazaar-Watgunge-Kidderpore route was discontinued. Many of us availed of this bus service before it was withdrawn suddenly. As a result, school children, elderly people and office-goers now have to walk for about 20-25 minutes to reach their destination. Even if renewing the bus service is not feasible, autorickshaws should be introduced in the route to ease our hardships.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A. Raghuram, Calcutta

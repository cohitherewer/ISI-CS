                                                    KEEP THE FOCUS                                                    
	Being the best of their kind is the only proper job of institutions of excellence in higher education. Anything else is a distraction, and is likely to compromise the original vision of these places of specialized learning. The IITs are perhaps the best examples of such institutions in the country, and it is alarming to see that their focus on what they are meant to do faces the risk of being blurred and meddled with. The Institutes of Technology Act is being amended to compel the existing IITs to help out, in various ways, other institutions offering technical education and state governments within the zone the IITs are located in. Particularly, technical and engineering colleges that are in bad shape and unable to manage on their own have to be assisted by the IITs. This is unwise for several reasons. First, and most important, the IITs must be allowed to stick to their straight and narrow path of promoting academic excellence in their specialized fields of study. Looking after helpless institutions and advising state governments are not their job, and they should not have to expend their time and resources on these things. For the same reason, the idea of the IITs branching out into medical education is a bad one. Consolidating existing resources, rather than the diversification of roles, is the way to maintain standards.        
	Second, looked at from the point of view of the assisted institutions, what sort of ethos would such a system promote in them? These colleges, however badly they may be faring on their own, should be actively encouraged to stand on their own feet. Autonomy is as important for them as it has been for the IITs. Besides, given the proliferation of such institutes in the country, why should the IITs be roped in to save colleges that have been unable to prove that they deserve to exist at all? There is a larger question of standards here, especially when eight institutions that were granted deemed university status are being allowed to keep the tag beyond the first five-year period even after they were found unworthy of doing so. Maintaining standards within this burgeoning sector of higher technical education should not be made the responsibility of the IITs, and especially not in a legally mandatory way. Nothing should come in the way of the IITs and their principal reason for existence, and the Centre should ensure this without affecting their autonomy.

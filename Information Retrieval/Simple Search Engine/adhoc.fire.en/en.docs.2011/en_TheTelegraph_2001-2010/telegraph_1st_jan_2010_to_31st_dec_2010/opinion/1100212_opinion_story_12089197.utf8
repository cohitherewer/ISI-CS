	Headpiece filled with silly dreams                
	Dork: The Incredible Adventures of Robin Einstein Varghese (Penguin, Rs 199) by Sidin Vadukut reads like a rip-off of Sue Townsends Adrian Mole, though Robin is a good deal older than 13 years, at which Townsends cult hero began his secret diary. The plot is quite well-worn in Indian fiction in English, thanks to Chetan Bhagats much celebrated homage to the Great Indian Corporate Dream, which convinced an entire class of Indians that reading books wasnt all that bad an activity after all. The eponymous dork of Vadukuts novel is a creature of the B-School, headpiece filled with wild aspirations and not much grey matter. In a diary, written on his laptop over months, Robin charts his rise along the professional ladder, from being a lacklustre MBA graduate to becoming a bigtime loser at Dufresne, a global corporate giant. As with much else in life, Varghese also has no luck with women. Vadukut tries to be seriously funny at times, so much so that the drift of his humour appears somewhat laboured.                        
	HE SWAM WITH SHARKS FOR AN ICE-CREAM (Jaico, Rs 195) by Dhaval Bathia tries to tell an inspiring story about fulfilling your dreams and achieving success. The subtitle may indicate a self-help book, but this is not your run-off-the-mill rags to riches manual that is supposed to change your life forever. Bathia cleverly casts a hackneyed plot in the form a novel. Two young recruits at a multi-billion dollar company are sent on an assignment with the CEOs father in a tiny village during the hottest season of the year. The ber-cool B-School dudes set out grumbling loudly, only to return as changed fellows, having discovered the secret to wealth, fame and success from the retired billionaire. In between, the story veers into endless lectures, flow charts, graphs and pep talks  which, sadly, botches up Bathias clever packaging rather badly.                        
	THE PEACOCK IN THE CHICKEN RUN (Tranquebar, Rs 150) by Dawood Ali McCallum begins with the familiar reality of passengers bound for India being off-loaded from the aircraft at Heathrow airport. In the ensuing chaos, and the long wait that follows, the travellers give in to their anger, passions, grief and well-hidden prejudices. The result is a cacophony of realities jostling against one another, making up the myriad layers that accrue on this well-told tale modern Canterbury Tales. The authors eye for detail and the way he manages to infuse life into distinct voices are admirable.                                  
	BLOWBACK (HarperCollins, Rs 199) by Mukul Deva is the third in the series of thrillers set in tumultuous South-Central Asia. Having struck gold with Lashkar and Salim Must Die, Deva returns to the tribal areas of Pakistan, where American soldiers are locked in the struggle to oust the Taliban. A warlord is led to believe by the ISI that it is one of his allies  which may be a bait to trap him in the net. As the marines, the Taliban and the Pakistani army get entangled in the tussle for supremacy, layers of intrigue are revealed. The prose is taut but fluid. The influence of Cold War spy thrillers, especially of John le Carr, is evident, although Devas achievement falls short of the literary excellence of le Carr.                        
	FIRST PROOF: THE PENGUIN BOOK OF NEW WRITING FROM INDIA 5 (Penguin, Rs 250) presents the usual mix of fiction and non-fiction by upcoming writers from across the country. Since some of those featured in the earlier volumes such as Anjum Hasan, Chandrahas Choudhury and Rana Dasgupta  are now established names, one expects this collection to throw up interesting new talents as well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Love crosses all barriers 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LOVE CROSSES ALL BARRIERS                               This Above All      Khushwant Singh                        Getting closer				                                       
	We celebrated the last Valentines Day (Sunday, February 14) by welcoming the fifth Muslim girl into our extended family. The first was Indian; the second Egyptian, the next two Pakistanis; and the fifth an Iranian. As if this was not enough to boast about, the more significant aspect of these unions was that whatever reservations the parents of concerned parties might have had initially, once the marriages were accomplished, the couples were accepted with complete affection. There were no conversion from one faith to the other as all of us were agreed that conversions are demeaning. St Valentines Day celebrations were ample proof of the fact that inter-religious marriages are a healthy departure from the rigid matrimonial rules of bygone years.        
	As I said, the most recent addition to the family is an Iranian. She is a doctor, practising in the United States of America. She arrived with her parents, members of her family and close friends the week before her nuptials. The six days of reception hosted by the bridegrooms grandmother, parents and cousins were meant to help them get acquainted with their new Sikh relations. There was feasting, drinking, dancing and singing of Iranian and Punjabi wedding songs. There was a mehendi ceremony when all the girls had patterns of henna drawn on their palms. The next morning, there was anand karaj according to Sikh rites. The couple had to be put through few rehearsals of how to conduct themselves, as neither of them is Sikh. The bridegroom is my brothers grandson whose father is a Bengali Hindu married to my niece. The bride is a Shia Muslim. They will have to go through Hindu rituals when they visit the fathers family in Calcutta, and through Muslim rituals, a nikah, or a civil marriage in the US where they intend to live.        
	All this may sound unrealistic to most of my readers who had arranged marriages and plan doing the same for their progeny. They are in for many surprises. The world is shrinking fast and people of different races, religions and languages are learning to live as one community. We have to shed the khap panchayat mentality riddled with gotras, castes and religious differences, and face the realities of life. When young people fall in love, they dont give a damn for what other people may have to say; they simply get close to each other, and if possible, get married. Love crosses all barriers and always wins. Valentines Day is an annual reminder of loves supremacy.                
	Great man                
	Not many of the present generation would know much about Hardit Singh Malik. He was the most distinguished Sikh of his time and had a remarkable career as a sportsman, civil servant and diplomat. He was born into a well-to-do Sikh family of Rawalpindi in 1894. After attending school in Rawalpindi for a few years, he proceeded to England for further studies. He was then only 14. When World War I broke out, he volunteered for service in the French Red Cross, and ran an ambulance from the war front to different hospitals in France.         
	After two years, he returned to England and joined the Royal Air Force, the first non-Brit with turban and beard to become a fighter pilot. He took part in dogfights with German war planes over Germany and France. His plane was riddled with hundreds of bullets of which two pierced his legs. He crash-landed in France and while doing so, broke his nose.        
	After convalescing for many months in hospitals in England, he was back in the battlefield. When the war ended, he joined Balliol College, Oxford. He played cricket and golf for the university. As soon as he finished college, he was selected for the Indian civil service and posted to his home state. He returned home to India after 11 years abroad. He married the younger sister of his elder brothers wife. Both girls came from a Hindu Arya Samaj family. Both turned devout Sikhs. In their homes, days began and ended with recitations from the Granth Sahib.        
	Malik served in many districts of Punjab before he was appointed the prime minister of Patiala. He stayed in the post for three years till it was merged with Punjab in 1947. Jawaharlal Nehru appointed him Indias first high commissioner in Canada. He stayed in Ottawa for three years before taking over as the ambassador of India in France. After a life-time of service in India and abroad, he retired to his newly-built home in New Delhi.        
	Malik had a passion for golf. He was seen at the Delhi Golf Club every afternoon till almost the end of his life. He once expressed the wish to die on the golf course. That was not to be. He had a massive heart attack in 1984. He recovered to resume playing golf. This did not last very long. A second attack in October 1985 proved fatal.        
	Malik had no intention of writing his autobiography. He was persuaded by his wife and children to do so. It lay untouched for many years till his daughter, Harjit Malik, took it upon herself to edit it and have it published. A Little Work, A Little Play: The autobiography of H.S. Malik is now available in the market. It has an introduction by Lester B. Pearson, whom he befriended in Oxford, and who later became the prime minister of Canada. It will be a source of inspiration for the present generation, especially for young sardars, who will learn how a person can be both devoutly religious and yet gain worldly success.                
	Very particular                
	Customer to a book seller in Lahore in Pakistan: Have you got a book on general knowledge?        
	Book seller: No, sir. But we shall be getting one on General Musharraf.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Winds of change                  
	Sir  The results of the West Bengal civic elections demonstrate that people have lost faith in the Left Front government that has been in power since 1977 (Queen of Calcutta, not of Bengal yet, June 3). The Left Fronts faulty policies are going to cost it dear in the approaching elections to the state legislative assembly.          
	It is particularly surprising that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was routed in Calcutta. The Trinamul Congresss victory in the municipal elections will be a shot in the arm for its leader, Mamata Banerjee. All signs seem to indicate that she is set to become the next chief minister of West Bengal. Meanwhile, the performance of the Congress proved that it is still a strong presence in the state.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Gururajan Ramachandran, Ooty

                
	Sir  The victory of the TMC in the civic polls in Calcutta and in other parts of the state indicates the Left Fronts irretrievable erosion of popularity and signals the end of a reign that has lasted for more than three decades.          
	However, the media frenzy around the Left Fronts imminent fall bodes ill for the established practices of a democratically elected government. The next assembly election is only a year away, at the most, and people must be allowed the right to elect a government of their choice at the appropriate time. The TMCs demand for early assembly elections may also be a political ploy to mount pressure on the government. It is important in this context that the media do not add to this pressure.          
	The results of the civic elections have also revealed that the Congress still plays a vital role in determining the shape of the state government. It has still enough strength to create a dent in the votebank of the formidable Left Front and the TMC in many of the constituencies.          
	Yours faithfully,         Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta            
	Sir  With the TMCs success in Calcutta in the recent civic polls, many hope to see a change in the state government soon. But victory is not yet a given for the TMC. As the article, Queen of Calcutta, not of Bengal yet, makes clear, the TMC fared much better in Calcutta than in the districts, where the Left Front and the Congress ate into its votes. Even the tidal wave of change that seems to have swept through the state has failed to wean away certain pockets of support for the CPI(M).          
	At the risk of being dubbed a sceptic, one cannot help but wonder whether the industrial and economic potential of West Bengal would be realized under a new government. There is, in fact, the danger that whatever progress there has been in the last few years might be undone.          
	In the euphoria generated by the municipal elections, the clamour for early assembly polls has grown stronger. People are anxious to be delivered from 33 years of Left rule, which appears to have been disastrous for the state. However, certain figures would argue otherwise. In 2003-2004, West Bengal was the third largest economy of India. Food production in the state has also recovered from the low it had reached in the 1980s. These figures pale, however, in the wave of enthusiasm for a change of the ruling party.          
	Arrogance, corruption and infighting have succeeded in widening the gap between the Left Front and the majority of its electorate. Last years municipal elections in Siliguri were also a testimony to the growing dissatisfaction of the people with the CPI(M). In the approaching assembly polls, the anti-incumbency factor is likely to play a huge role in determining which party wins. One must remember that the performance of members of the Opposition in Parliament or in the legislative assemblies has not been promising, either.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Kaustuv Bhowmik, Hooghly 

                
	Sir  It was a delight to see a triumphant Mamata Banerjee in regal robes on the frontpage of The Telegraph on June 3. The winds of change in the political theatre of Bengal seem to have transformed the TMC leaders simple white saris into royal finery.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kanta Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I did not like hearing a political leader being called the Queen of Calcutta. While the performance of the TMC under the leadership of Mamata Bannerjee in the recently concluded elections is laudable, the epithet of royalty seems inappropriate in a democratic polity. I may like to see Banerjee as the next chief minister of West Bengal, but I cannot see myself living as a subject in an empire ruled by a queen.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Dhruba Basu, Calcutta

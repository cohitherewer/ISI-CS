                Iron resolve        
	 Time has not mellowed Lal Krishna Advani. The senior BJP leader is still gunning to fulfil a much cherished dream. For long, the iron man has insisted that the Congress devise a system wherein India would face a minimum number of elections. Advani suggested that the assembly and Lok Sabha polls be held simultaneously by fixing the tenure of governments at the state level and at the Centre. Having raised the debate with the prime minister and the leader of the Lok Sabha, he put it before Sonia and Rahul Gandhi as well. Incidentally, the other day, mother and son were invited to take tea in Advanis room in Parliament, when another invitation  this time to attend the BJP leaders birthday party  was extended to them. Although Madam could not make it, Rahul did turn up with a bouquet, once again in Advanis room in Parliament. Apparently, the two leaders, young and old, spent considerable time discussing Advanis proposal, and addressed each others queries.                              
	 Given the Congresss dismal performance in Bihar, Rahul Gandhi should not be averse to reviewing electoral strategies, particularly with old hands like Advani, whose party came out with flying colours. But seriously, was it sheer bravado or scant regard for intelligence that made Rahul so optimistic about his partys chances in Bihar? With the young Gandhi as chief campaigner, his close aides dismissed the possibility of the Congress coming up with single-digit seats. Now gloom has descended on the party offices. But not everyone is unhappy. Mukul Wasnik, the AICCs point man for Bihar, is, for one, grinning from ear to ear.                            
	 Staying with Rahul Gandhi: of all the criticisms brought against him by Opposition parties, probably the most ingenious one is by the CPI(M). Sitaram Yechury is apparently at a loss of words, not because he has nothing left to say, but because his favourite sayings are being hijacked by the Congress scion. These days, the young leader is routinely saying things like, There are two Hindustans. One is growing fast, while the other remains poor. Only the Congress can unite the two. Ironically, such sentiments used to be Yechurys trademark. Perhaps he ought to have taken out a patent on them, some politicians were heard chuckling.                            
	 Sleepless nights are an old tradition with the Congress. For years, important meetings were scheduled at late hours. Even press releases were issued in the dead of the night. In recent times, it seemed as though that grand old tradition had been relinquished as major events were being wrapped up by the evening. But the turmoil in Maharashtra found Sonia Gandhi up till late. It was evening when Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony flew to Mumbai to select the new chief minister. By the time they returned to 10 Janpath to confirm the final choice, the Cinderella hour was near. The prime minister, who was leaving the next day for the G20 summit, had to be consulted before the name of Prithviraj Chavan (who handled a lot of the PMOs affairs) could be announced in the morning.                            
	 But the day before Prithviraj Chavan was crowned chief minister, he met the parliamentary affairs minister, Pawan Bansal, to chalk out a strategy for the following day. Although Chavan had a fair premonition that the post of CM would be offered to him, he got cold feet in the end and wanted a few words of assurance from Bansal, who had been lobbying for him. Bansal convinced Chavan that there was nothing to worry about, which pretty much proved to be the case in the course of the next 24 hours.                            
	 Punjab is witnessing a major SMS battle these days. Supporters of the rebel Akali leader, Manpreet Singh Badal, are sending out texts about the alleged misdeeds of Prakash and Sukhbir Singh Badal. Somehow, father and son have got wind of Manpreets recipients. So moments after the messages are delivered, countermissives are sent off.                            
	 Deepender Singh Hooda, son of the Haryana chief minister, believes that Haryanvis have won medals in boxing and wrestling in the Commonwealth and Asian Games because of his states historical links with the battles of Kurukshetra and Panipat.

	 Virender Sehwag is ruing why he at all dared Shahrukh Khan to make Sachin Tendulkar dance. The badshah of Bollywood achieved this near-impossible task easily. At a sports award, SRK was playing host, when he asked Viru to shake a leg on the stage. In turn, Sehwag challenged Shahrukh to get Tendulkar to do the same. The nawab of Najafgarh even bet the actor that if he managed to do so, he would do anything for him in return. Shahrukh walked up to Sachin, whispered something into his ear, and the next thing we knew, the little master was doing a cute little jig on stage. The sight left poor Sehwag all agog. Since then, he has been trying hard to find out what SRKs magic words were. Maybe Viru should also start worrying about what the Don would ask him to do in return.

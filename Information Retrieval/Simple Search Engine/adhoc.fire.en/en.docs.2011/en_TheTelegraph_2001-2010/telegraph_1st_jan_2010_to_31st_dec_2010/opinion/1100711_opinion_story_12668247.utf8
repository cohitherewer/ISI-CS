	 Here is something more on the Amitabh Bachchan-Amar Singh encounter in a London hotel. By now, we all know that on hearing brother Amitabh was holidaying on the same premises, Amar had sent word that his daughters wanted to see Jaya tai and Shweta didi. Amitabh declined the offer of a meeting, saying that he would be returning to Mumbai soon. Now, what has come to light is this. Oblivious to the Amitabh-Amar exchange, a Bharatiya Janata Party leader had held a function on the hotel lawns. When he saw Amitabh emerge, he requested the actor to join him in the festivities. Amitabh answered, ever politely, that he was in a hurry as he was trying to avoid someone. A few minutes later, Amar was seen rushing through the same venue. The BJP neta made the same request to Amar, who told him that he was frantically searching for Amitabh. Soon, the truth about the cat-and-mouse game emerged, and everyone was surprised to see the megastar on the run. Incidentally, Amitabh reported the incident on his blog, concluding with a few lines in Urdu: Tumhen gairon se kab fursat/ Hum apne gum se kab khali/ Chalo bas ho chuka milna/ Na tum khali na hum khali (You are always with strangers/ And I live in suffering/ The prospects of meetings are now over/ Neither are you free, nor me). But is Amar in a mood to appreciate such verse?                              
	 Politicians often build castles in the air, and Ram Vilas Paswan is no exception. His last birthday, in fact, coincided with his entry into the Upper House. Expectedly, 12 Janpath was quite upbeat. The faithful were heard roaring, Dharti chuye asman, Ram Vilas Paswan. The mood was certainly infectious, and even Paswan was heard speculating that the PM might reward him with a mighty post before Bihar went to the polls. But Rahul Gandhi is keen on the Congress fighting the Bihar elections alone. Now we know why there is talk about Paswan building castles in the air.                            
	 That Jaswant Singh is back in the BJP, while Uma Bharti still cools her heels outside is stale news. As we all know, LK Advani tilted the scales in Singhs favour when the two of them took a flight together. Bharti, desperate to return to the fold, flew with Advani too, bravely ignoring her vertigo.Yet, she remains outside the fold while Singh is back home. One cannot blame Bharti if she finds her head spinning after all this.                            
	 Some BJP leaders are of the view that their chief, Nitin Gadkari, is running the party like a social organization. They would rather have the party run on corporate lines. Such murmurs gained momentum after the debacle in Patna where the partys national executive meet was ruined by the war of words between Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar. One senior leader reportedly said that the more the BJP organized such meetings, the higher were the chances of unrest. Others have joined the chorus and demanded that the BJP should hold a single annual general meeting like corporate organizations. But the move towards corporatization may pose other problems. For instance, will the old guard prefer suits and ties to their beloved dhoti-kurtas?                            
	 Manas Bhuiyans elevation as the president of the Congress in West Bengal may have come as a surprise to many party workers in the state. But Didi, apparently, was not caught napping. In fact, the grapevine has it that the Trinamul Congress chief was consulted at every step of the move that led to Pranab Mukherjee being replaced by Bhuiyan.       
	It is no secret that Mamata has had a bagful of complaints against Mukherjee. Earlier, during a meeting with Ahmad Patel, Banerjee is said to have rejected all the names, save Bhuiyans, for the state Congress presidentship. The day before the official announcement, Mukherjee tried his best to bury the past. He hosted a lunch in Banerjees honour. On Saturdays, Mukherjee normally prefers a vegetarian meal, but the rule was changed for Banerjees sake. The menu was a delectable Bengali affair. It comprised Ilish paturi (hilsa served on banana leaf), posto bata, jhinge posto, begun bhaja, aam tok and so on. There is no doubt that the railway minister enjoyed the meal. But one cannot say the same thing for Mukherjee who has had to make way for Bhuiyan.                        
	 Digvijay Singh has ended up foxing his own partymen. AICC bosses have been left searching for answers after Diggy Rajas recent utterances. Nobody is quite sure what he is up to, or his motives behind the sacrileges. First, Singh ended up criticizing P Chidambaram for the measures taken to tackle the Maoist problem. Next in Singhs line of fire was none other than the government led by Rajiv Gandhi. Singh has blamed it for ferrying Union Carbides Warren Anderson to safety. Worse followed when the Congressman ended up defending AB Vajpayees nephew and BJP minister from Madhya Pradesh, Anoop Mishra, who has been charged with a serious offence. While Congressmen remain puzzled, Singh himself has been trying to meet Madam to present his side of the story. Last heard, he has not been granted an audience yet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Awkward trap
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AWKWARD TRAP                          - In spite of billionaires, an investment crisis looms over India        Ashok Mitra                                                  
	Policymakers in New Delhi have had enough of the poverty lobby, which keeps whining about how 200 million or more Indians subsist below the level of poverty. Do not these people see anything but the flip side of things? Here then is a stick to beat this lobby with. Two of the ten top billionaires in the world, the Forbes magazine has just announced, are from India. Is not that a fact even starving Indians should be proud of?        
	An equally encouraging report, has emanated from United Nations sources. India has finally made it as one of the worlds top ten industrial nations. China has succeeded in emerging, right after the United States of America, as the second largest industrialized country, pushing Japan down to the third position. A cluster of five European nations occupies the next five slots; India is ninth in the list followed by the lone Latin American nation, Brazil.        
	Those in the country who have been dreaming of matching China in economic and industrial performance may be a shade disappointed. Even so, to be one of the industrial titans in the world is no mean achievement. And there will be others to point out that the greater concern should rather be about whether we can hold on to where we have already arrived, whether we would be able to maintain in the coming years the currently reigning momentum of industrial growth.        
	For it is an unusual framework of industrial development policy-formulators have been experimenting with. Growth has been mostly propelled by activities, which either cater to exports or meet the consumption  and consumption related  demands of the top 10 to 15 per cent of the community. Can this arrangement be viable over any reasonable stretch of time?              
	The issues are fairly straightforward. The countrys upper and upper middle classes control the polity and therefore exercise control over its economic agenda. They have an enormous hunger for consumer durables, including glitzy automobiles and a whole range of luxury items covering textiles, food, drinks, tourism and entertainment. There is always a sliver of apprehension: what if a saturation point is reached in this brand of grand consumption demand generated from such a narrow section? Such an eventuality could give rise to what economists describe as demand deficiency.        
	A slack in the domestic demand for industrial products might of course be made good, either wholly or in part, in case a spurt takes place in exports. Here too, though, problems abound. India produces a wide range of manufactures and service items for which a clientele has grown steadily in different parts of the world. The key factor still continues to be exports to the US. That country is trying to dig itself out of the hole it found itself in two years ago. But progress is halting. If the American economy grows by barely one per cent or thereabouts in the foreseeable future, India would have little prospect of raising significantly the level of its exports there. China with its superior productivity in several areas might also nibble into Indias potential share in the American market.        
	That apart, hanging like Damocles sword will be the issue of outsourcing, which has contributed in a major way to the income  and consumption  explosion of the Indian middle class. There is a built-in resentment within the American nation at the fact that the countrys administration is yet to come down heavily on the practice of outsourcing which, it is claimed, robbed qualified American citizens of employment opportunities and, instead, rewarded foreigners. Should the US economy fail to pick up soon, opposition to job losses through outsourcing might get shriller and shriller and force the authorities there to some action that could cast a pall on the prospects of demand that is crucial to sustain Indias industrial growth rate.        
	Problems on the supply side can hardly be ignored either. The tempo of growth in manufactures can be maintained only if productive capacity is adequate. In the past, the public sector had contributed substantially to the expansion of industrial capacity via investments on a large scale. Neo-liberal economic philosophy is now the ruling ideology and the role of the public sector is shrinking fast. Disinvestment, in fact, is the dominant slogan, and even the so-called Navaratnas among the public sector undertakings are being forced to shed their equity to private entities. In the circumstances, further capacity creation in the industrial sector, including in the sphere of infrastructure, will largely depend on private initiatives. This is where concern is inevitable. With tax on dividends off and continuous lowering of the overall direct tax burden, it is carnival time for Indias stock exchanges. In addition, international finance capital has arrived in strength, inducing share prices to reach dizzy heights. Even ordinary householders are borrowing from the banks to partake of the share market banquet. It is an old adage that has not yet lost its validity: when share prices rule high, savings contract and capital investment in productive assets receives the short shrift. The rate of private investment has, in fact, levelled off in recent years; investors are most reluctant to invest in industrial capacity expansion in the time of share market buoyancy.        
	There is apparently no easy way out. The countrys elite never had it so good, they are determined not to vacate the vantage position they have come to occupy. It will be excruciatingly difficult to convince them that disturbing the present arrangements, such as dampening the share market and suspending the regime of low direct taxes, is called for, really for their own sake: to ensure the viability of the class-biased economic growth model thrust upon the nation.        
	If persuasion fails and the upper and upper middle classes refuse to abdicate the advantages they have come to corner, another way out of the looming investment crisis can be thought of. This will entail refocusing attention on the farm sector. Agriculture, forestry and fisheries continue to provide livelihood to more than one-half of our countrymen. The principal policy plank of economic liberalization has been a purposive withdrawal of the State from all spheres of economic activity, including from the farm sector. With public investment languishing and no private parties ever dreaming of putting their money on such projects as irrigation, land reclamation and rural roads that are exceedingly low-yielding in nature, what could be expected has happened: the rate of farm growth has declined ominously since the mid-1990s. In case the dogma of refraining from public investment is discarded and farm production and productivity revived through State initiative, the spin-off could be a rise in the income level of more than one-half of the national population, which in turn could lead to a significant strengthening of the demand for industrial goods as well.              
	But where is the government going to find the money to invest in agriculture? Financial orthodoxy is the ruling deity: this years budget has actually promised to cut back the fiscal deficit to 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product. Providing for public investment in agriculture is likely to be an awesomely difficult task. Should the authorities seek to put the squeeze on some other areas in order to arrange funds for agriculture? But what are these areas? The defence and security budget, for instance, can hardly be tampered with; any step towards that direction will infuriate the domestic jingos and alienate both the Americans and the commission agents. Should the government then propose fresh taxation measures? We are thus back to the original problem. The direct tax burden has been purposely lowered in recent years to encourage elite consumption. Any rethinking in this sphere will be regarded as outrageous by those who matter. Is the way out then in more indirect imposts, leading to further price rise and greater immiseration of the poorer classes?        
	It is an awkward trap of a political economy that the ruling classes have walked into; adding to the number of native billionaires will be of little avail for getting out of it.

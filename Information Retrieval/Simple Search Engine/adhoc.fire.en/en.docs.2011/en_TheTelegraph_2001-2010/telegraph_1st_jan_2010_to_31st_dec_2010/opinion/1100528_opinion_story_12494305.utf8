	Coming days after the Supreme Courts conviction and sentencing of Manu Sharma to a life term in the Jessica Lal case, the tripling of the jail term for S.P.S. Rathore for the sexual harassment of a minor 20 years ago vindicates the image of the Indian judiciary as a slow but steady dispenser of justice. It also confirms the strength of an aware and active civil society in India. For, as in the case of Lal, the culmination of the Ruchika Girhotra molestation case followed a period of intense public scrutiny that was aided, and somewhat abetted, by the media. There is no denying that public vigilance has often driven the wheels of justice. This may seem an unfortunate development impinging on the independence of the judiciary. But when a system of justice is so obviously amenable to manipulation by the powerful, it is important that public pressure be allowed to play the role it has cut out for itself. It has to be remembered, however, that a combination of civil and judicial activism that some of the high- profile cases have seen lately is still a rarity. And even when such a combination reaches its pinnacle, the victory may be pyrrhic. In the present case, for example, Rathore has been sentenced to a 18-month term for sexual assault. But his equally dark role in abetting the death of a minor and scarring the lives of several people close to the victim has been ignored because of certain technicalities that have arisen owing to the flawed procedure of evidence-gathering by the investigative agencies. Little wonder the sentence seems incommensurate to the quantum of the crime committed.         
	But there is another reason why the verdict on Rathore may fail to satisfy the conscientious. This is because of the flaw inherent in the law on sexual offences that not only fails to make a special case for the minor victims but also to accord the crime the importance that is its due. The definitions of rape, molestation and eve-teasing enumerated in the Indian Penal Code do not reflect the full gamut of experiences faced by women in different situations, be it in the public or private sphere. Womens organizations have also highlighted the trivialization of the crime: molestation, for instance, is a bailable offence that merits a sentence of not more than two years. Thus, together with the Girhotra case, the law itself needs a serious review.

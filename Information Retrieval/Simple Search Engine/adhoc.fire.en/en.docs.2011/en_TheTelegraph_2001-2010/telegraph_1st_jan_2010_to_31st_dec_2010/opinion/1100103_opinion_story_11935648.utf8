	 From all indications, it appears that Telangana has finally managed to sink what the floods in Andhra Pradesh could not  K Rosaiahs chances of holding on to the chief ministers chair in the troubled state. That does not automatically mean that the decks are now clear for the late YSR Reddys son, Jagan Mohan. In fact, his candidacy for the post may be jeopardized further if the Congress decides to revert back to the party presidents tried-and-tested formula  to stem the tide by bringing in a man from Telangana to fill the hot seat. Among the names doing the rounds are those of the Union urban development minister, S Jaipal Reddy, and the AICC in-charge of Bengal and Jharkhand, K Keshava Rao. There are others lobbying for the post, many of them major industrialists who have filled the partys coffers generously over the years. All this means that it is a level playing field now with more players in it than Jagan would have liked.                
	 Telangana has scuppered the chances of many other netas. Take M Veerappa Moilys case, for instance, who seems destined to be divested of his charge of Andhra Pradesh. Moily is believed to have given a consistently bad performance since the time YSR Reddy passed away and his son started demanding the CMs post. Instead of coming down heavily on Jagan, Moily seemed to give Jagan a free rein. Telangana made things worse for Moily; he could neither manage the crisis deftly, nor keep the party abreast of developments. He may soon have to make way for either Ghulam Nabi Azad or Digvijay Singh, both of whom are known for their organizational capabilities.                            
	 Are Indias Raj Bhavans jinxed? Following ND Tiwaris ignominious exit and the deaths of a few governors in office, some Congressmen appear to have become wary of occupying the Raj Bhavans of several states, which are waiting for new occupants. Barring a few ever-willing compliers such as Shivraj Patil and Arjun Singh, veterans like Mohsina Kidwai, ML Fotedar, CK Jaffer Sharief and Sushil Kumar Shinde are having second thoughts about gubernatorial assignments.                            
	 The Delhi chief minister, Sheila Dikshit, has created a niche for herself. A section of the Congress may be envious of Dikshits success but the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, is impressed by the present chief ministers eye for detail as well as her style. Soniaji is believed to have been pleasantly surprised to see a huge uncut stone bearing her name instead of the customary polished marble or granite plaque at the foundation ceremony in Indira Bhavan, the proposed headquarters of the AICC. Dikshit is said to have got the stone from Udaipur, which is the hometown of her political secretary, Pawan Khera.                            
	 Trust the Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, to throw a spanner in the works of the indefatigable Union railways minister. Hatoyama has promised to fund the western freight corridor, and not the one to the east, which Mamata Banerjee had promised while presenting the railway budget. Banerjee now would not only fail to keep her promise, but the development of the western corridor would also compel her to go on a land acquisition drive, something that the lady is unwilling to take on before the crucial 2011 polls in her home state, West Bengal. One wonders whether this will make her irate supporters organize a rail roko in distant Japan.                            
	 The Bihar CM, Nitish Kumar, does not wear his political alliance with the BJP on his sleeve. One may even say that he is, at times, rather desperate to display his secular image. Witness the fact that when the RSS chief, Mohan Bhagwat, was in Patna last week, Kumar ensured that he was not present at the state capital. The CM took a week off and shifted to picturesque Rajgir in Nalanda district. Though it was supposed to be a year-end holiday, he did not forget to take his files along with him. Every morning, he hopped on to a tonga that took him to the hotsprings. Kumar is said to have been so enamoured by the scenic beauty of Ghorakatora that he has now decided to develop it into a tourist spot.  
	Footnote      
	 A big question mark hangs over the return of Jaya Bachchan to the Rajya Sabha. Early next year, seven members from the Samajwadi Party are retiring from UP but only two lucky ones will return. This means that Bachchan will have stiff competition from Nand Kishore Yadav, Amir Alam, Kamal Akhtar, Ram Narayan Sahu among others. While brother Amar Singh may succeed in pushing Bachchans case, he may have to contend with Mulayam Singh Yadavs idea of caste equations. If Mulayam has to counter threats from the babalogs and behenjis, he will have to play his cards well. That should mean more shake up and less make-up.

	Same old story                  
	Sir  Women are always seen as reprobates arousing the lust of men (Demon and God in 20-minute duel, June 18). If a woman is kidnapped, the matter is belittled; whether she has been sexually exploited or not becomes more important. Man-woman relationships shown in Hindi films rarely have depth, and the story of Mani Ratnams Raavan is no exception. The plot follows a hackneyed formula for easy success. The film portrays a mythical villain as chivalrous, and as having greyer tones, but fails to make an impact.          
	Yours faithfully,         Samir Chakraborty, Howrah 
                  
	Historic failure          
	Sir  Certain points need to be raised about Srinath Raghavans article, Too much control (June 17), on the 1962 Sino-Indian war. Raghavan points out that the Henderson Brooks report concluded that the higher direction of the war was out of touch with reality. He also emphasizes that this was a statement made by two not-so-senior military officers about the elected political leadership of the country. Raghavan should have made it perfectly clear that this political leadership lived in a make-believe world of Hindi-Chini brotherhood. He should have enunciated the main reason behind the governments adamant refusal to publish the Henderson Brooks report  it would have exposed an utterly incompetent and arrogant political and military leadership. Jawaharlal Nehrus remark to the press that he had ordered the Indian army to throw out the Chinese had lit the fuse.          
	Raghavan should also have mentioned that New Delhi swore by the McMahon Line because the political leaders of the time thought that the British could do no wrong. Beijing, obviously, flatly refused to accept this.          
	The only solution to this border dispute is to convert the line of actual control into the formal border. Some progress was made in this direction during the National Democratic Alliances regime, when the plan of India ceding Aksai Chin and of China disengaging itself from Barahoti, the Sumdorong Chu valley and the northern Mishmi hills on a quid pro quo basis had gathered momentum. However, this strategy was subsequently abandoned, possibly owing to the Indian political leaders fears over vote banks.          
	Apart from Neville Maxwells Indias China War, the book, Himalayan Blunder, by John Dalvi, the brigadier who commanded the ill-fated 7th Infantry Brigade during the Sino-Indian war, explicitly reveals the disgraceful performance of Indias military and political high commands.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Regarding Srinath Raghavans criticism of the governments stance of holding back the Henderson Brooks report on the military debacle against China in 1962, I would like to refer to the book, Himalayan Blunder, by John Dalvi. In this book, Dalvi recounts his first-hand experience of the Sino-Indian war as the only senior officer commanding the 7th Infantry Brigade, which bore the brunt of the Chinese assault in Namka Chu in the North-East Frontier Agency (now Arunachal Pradesh). Dalvi was captured by the Chinese after his contingent was totally wiped out.          
	The book presents a vivid picture of the war and analyses the reasons behind the disaster faced by the Indian military. The failure was caused not only by the higher direction of the war and the Indian army, but also by the Indian press, public opinion, and political leaders.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Arun Mazumdar, Calcutta

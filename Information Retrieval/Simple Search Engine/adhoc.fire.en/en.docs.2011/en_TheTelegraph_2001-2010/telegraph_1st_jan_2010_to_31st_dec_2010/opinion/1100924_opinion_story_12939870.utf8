	Daughter vanishes                  
	Sir  Human trafficking should be made into a culpable offence, to be condemned alongside such evils as drug-peddling, child labour and dowry. The state police recently disclosed that 2,500 teenaged girls have disappeared from Bengal in one year (Missing: 2500 girls in a year, Sept 18). This is just the official figure. How many more have vanished is anybodys guess. Jahura Bibi is an exceptional woman since she had the courage to move court after her daughter, Zarina, went missing from Kakdwip in South 24-Parganas. Who will fight for the rest of the girls who disappear?          
	Impoverishment and illiteracy are the chief reasons why traffickers flourish in rural areas. Non-governmental organizations must play a leading role in combating this social menace. The state government should instruct gram panchayats to be always on the lookout for suspected traffickers and to file periodic reports in local police stations. The Telegraph has done a marvellous job by reporting the case of Zarina, who now has some chance of being rescued and brought back.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Trafficking in women is not a new phenomenon in West Bengal. Yet the police have never been alert enough to the problem. Had they been vigilant, the number of victims would not have increased at such an alarming rate. No long ago, the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, called West Bengal an oasis of peace in India. Probably he has no idea of what goes on in his oasis. The state police have not been able to find Jahura Bibis daughter, Zarina, since last year. This speaks volumes about the governments lackadaisical attitude towards the problem of human trafficking. Even if special cells to check trafficking are created, not much can be achieved unless the police are made accountable and allowed to operate independently of the ruling partys control.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Most unhealthy          
	Sir  In India, laws are made so that they can be violated. Take the one that was passed two years ago banning smoking in public places. I would highlight a few instances to illustrate my point. Scene one: December 25, 2008 in Park Street, with its usual throng of people at this time of the year. I could see an on-duty policeman exhaling rings of smoke from the cigarette held between his fingers. The ban on smoking had been imposed only a few months back at that time. Scene two: the office of a government school in south Calcutta, where a senior member of the administration was seen smoking in front of students and parents. Teachers in this part of the country are said to be cigarette-addicts. But are they creating a healthy environment for their students?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Unhappy ending          
	Sir  I was shocked to read Uddalak Mukherjees Victims of a cruel spell (Aug 19). A particular question bothers me. Mukherjee says, It was arranged that Purangi would live with Birbals family till she got her job back. He also describes the expression on the face of the victim  there was unspeakable fear: the fear of being abandoned once again. But was the fear only of abandonment or also of being tortured again? What kind of rehabilitation leaves the victim in the shelter (and hence at the mercy) of the assailant? This is as inexcusable as marrying a rape-victim to the rapist and calling this a happy ending.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Correction          
	I would like to point out the following omissions in the lines from Srimanta Sankardeva, Vaishnava Saint of Assam by Bimal Phukan quoted in the article, The sleeper in the deep forest (Sept 18), by Khushwant Singh. The lines should read, Karatala kamala kamaladala nayana/ Bhavadava dahana gahana vana saiyana, to go with the translation, Thy palm is like the lotus, Thine eyes like lotus petals/ Thou art the consumer of worldly afflictions,/ Thou art the sleeper in deep forest. The second quote should read, Jagadaha mapahara bhavabhoya tarana/ Parapada layakara kamalaja nayana. The last line is missing from the published version.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Satya Brata Saikia, Jorhat

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A good man, but a bad soldier
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A GOOD MAN, BUT A BAD SOLDIER                                  Radically democratic or traitorously self-promoting  how are the State and citizens to regard the makers of WikiLeaks and their many anonymous sources?                                            
	WikiLeaks publicizing of the Afghanistan warlogs is believed to be as significant as the release of the Pentagon Papers of the 1970s, and has called for a comparison between the whistle-blowers of the two different generations. A comparison of Daniel Ellsberg, the Seventies hero, with Bradley Manning, alleged to have leaked substantial parts of the warlogs from his post in Iraq, would have been natural. Instead, it is the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who has been placed on the same pedestal as Ellsberg more often than Manning over the last few weeks.         
	Surely, Manning has more things in common with Ellsberg than Assange? Both Ellsberg and Manning were in the service of the government when they decided to leak state secrets. Both exposed the bitter truths their governments were keeping from the public, and risked their careers, if not their lives, in doing so. Assange is a whistle-blower, but there is a difference between breaking the service code (like Ellsberg and Manning) and making a career out of whistle-blowing (like Assange). Of course, Mannings relegation to a relatively obscure position can be attributed to the medias realization that giving him attention may do more harm than good to his impending trial. But such consideration seems not to have stopped the mainstream media in Mannings own country from attempting the kind of character assassination that the Nixon administration had once tried with Ellsberg, though less successfully. Manning is seen as a weakling (possibly gay), who had taken a recent break-up rather badly. Having failed as a soldier, he was biding his time till being sent back home, when the public good bug bit him.         
	Ellsberg had also witnessed similar muckraking, but somehow Mannings status as a soldier seems to have made him more vulnerable than the Harvard-educated Ellsberg, who, as part of the American thinking classes, seemed to be more entitled to moralizing than Manning.         
	Thinking soldiers are a problem worldwide, more so in the United States of America. No one had been willing to hear out Jimmy Massey, former Marine staff sergeant, when he came back from Iraq and alleged in 2005 that US soldiers were killing civilians. This was more than a year after the disclosures on Abu Ghraib, and what the US soldiers were up to in Iraq should not have been news. Yet, Massey was torn apart by the mainstream as well as the right-wing media in the US which called him a liar. To the man on the street, he was an outright traitor and an apology for a soldier. Soldiers are expected to go out there to kill, not to duck their heads between their knees.         
	It is these time-honoured notions of what constitutes the duties of the soldier, the citizen and the patriot that the US now, and most other nations with skeletons in their cupboards, will depend on to secure themselves in this new world of global communication, where governments are losing control over the way information is disseminated. These notions turn morality into a project of self-aggrandizement, making people like Ellsberg and Manning look like creatures hell-bent on self-promotion.         
	The strategy has already managed to harness the fickle ethics of hackers like Adrian Lamo to the service of the state. The increasing emphasis on the value of soldiers lives, supposed to be in mortal peril from the leaks, may also finally turn the mainstream media in the US and elsewhere from being part of WikiLeaks reckless adventure to the tame appendage of the state apparatus. Americas old fears are right there under the surface. The opposition to the mosque near Ground Zero makes this obvious. The Obama administration has only to rekindle that war-time psychology to remind people that the nation is a little more important than individuals and their moralizing.         
	The government has already started doing this. Its decision to prosecute state employees who pointed out illegal actions of the Bush regime law was meant to show that it has no special liking for whistle-blowers. The justice department also recently decided to subpoena a New York Times journalist to force him to disclose his sources. So the heroism of the press may soon be stamped out. Of course, to make matters abundantly clear, the punishment for Manning will have to be made exemplary. The longest prison sentence in the Abu Ghraib case was 10 years. Manning may get 52 years for being a good human being but a bad citizen-soldier.                    CHIROSREE BASU

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OLYMPIAN DREAMS                                  ABHIJIT BHATTACHARYYA                              
	Even before the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games 2010, some top Indian leaders considered bidding for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games. Whispers are around that if Beijing could host the 2008 Olympics, it is time for India to show its might as well. Hosting the Olympic Games in the Indian capital is indeed a lofty desire. It is to be remembered  especially in the light of the chaos, confusion, complaint and corruption of the CWG 2010  that the Olympics are no Commonwealth Games.        
	Lets take a peep at Beijing 2008. For China, the Olympics as well as the 51 gold medals won by its athletes were symbols of national pride. At the closing ceremony, the president of the International Olympic Committee called the event truly exceptional after asserting that the IOC had absolutely no regrets in choosing Beijing to host the 2008 Olympic Games.        
	Before they begin to plan anything, Indian sports administrators must recapitulate the salient features of the 2008 Olympics. Beijing was awarded the Olympics over Toronto, Paris, Istanbul and Osaka in 2001, having earlier lost by two votes to Sydney for the 2000 Olympics. China, unlike India, did not waste any time to get itself ready for the event. By May 2007, all Beijing-based Olympic venues were ready.        
	In March 2009, Beijing reported that the total expenditure on the Olympics was about $15 billion and that surplus revenues from the Games exceeded the original target of $16 billion. But controversy plagued China as well. There were allegations that millions of Chinese citizens had been displaced to make way for Olympics-related construction.                
	Readiness is all        
	To prepare for the visitors, Beijings transportation infrastructure underwent spectacular expansion and modernization. The newly-built Beijing National Stadium cost roughly Rs 1,900 crore. Compare this with the cost of renovating and constructing the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi: Rs 960 crore. A 28-year-old stadium in Delhi gobbling up close to 50 per cent of the budget allocated for a bigger, state-of-the-art, new Chinese stadium. The overall expenditure on CWG 2010 is also ridiculously high without comparable returns from advertisement, marketing or other broadcasting or commercial rights thus far.        
	It is tricky for an Indian to assess the CWG 2010 against the backdrop of some spectacular performances by Indian players. Between the results of the players and the failure- ridden sports and political bosses, spectators felt cheated for being deprived of a bona fide seat to watch the show. With its pathetic record for transparency, India simply cannot  must not  bid for the Olympics. No Olympics can be organized without the full support of the host nations government. Perhaps the 1982 Asiad model, which had a structured hierarchy, needs to be revisited. India would do better with an indigenous organization free from external intervention.         
	It would be odd to host the Olympics and hold a position between 60 and 75 in the medal tally. Here, China needs to be emulated. The Chinese did not participate in the Olympics till they were sure of being in the top five. They maintained their lead, which gave them the confidence to host the event and toast the victory.         
	Delhi should also never be the prospective Olympic venue because no event can succeed by making lives of the majority of the inhabitants unbearable. If at all, India should first identify a 25 km x 25 km area, acquire it, then develop it in such a manner as to avoid the displeasure of the common man. China may not be the best of friends with India, but Indians would do well to learn the formula for success from the organizers of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

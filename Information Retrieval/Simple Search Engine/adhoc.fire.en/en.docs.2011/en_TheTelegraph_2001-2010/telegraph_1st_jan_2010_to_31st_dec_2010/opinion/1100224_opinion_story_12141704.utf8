                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LEGAL DEMAND                                                    
	Sometimes the chief function of a law in India is to affix responsibility. The notification that education is a fundamental right for all children between the ages of six and 14 years makes failure on the part of the government to provide education legally culpable. The decision is a welcome one: it does show the Union governments concern about the countrys children. Although there are still many questions about the age limit  what happens before six and why should children not get compulsory education till they complete Class X  it is a step in the right direction. The notification will not allow state governments to remain oblivious to the facts that numerous children from underprivileged communities do not go to school or are early dropouts, become child labourers at home or outside, are married off, or are drawn into criminal activity. If parents can legally demand education for their children, it is certainly an added pressure on governments. The law can act as a spur.        
	But the fact that such a law was needed at all points to a huge failure. The number of schools and trained teachers, methods of teaching or even the availability of blackboards and textbooks  to mention a few basic needs  have not kept up with growing demands. Schemes such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan have helped somewhat, but their utilization has been wildly various in different states. With such schemes preceding it, the law has not arrived out of the blue, but the groundwork to make the fundamental right to education a reality is still deeply flawed. It is not merely a question of sufficiency of schools, but also of the quality of the content and method of education. Even when there are teachers, they are not adequately trained to teach children from different segments of the population with sympathy and patience. Neither are there enough options in the syllabi to suit different regions, especially in the rural areas. Conditions in the classroom are harsh and alienating for children from backward communities. Basic amenities, such as toilets and drinking water, are not always provided. Midday meals alone cannot  and should not  lure children to school. So in making governments responsible for school education, the law is demanding far more than appears at first sight. The notification is welcome, as is the spur to action. How soon these will work, is another question.

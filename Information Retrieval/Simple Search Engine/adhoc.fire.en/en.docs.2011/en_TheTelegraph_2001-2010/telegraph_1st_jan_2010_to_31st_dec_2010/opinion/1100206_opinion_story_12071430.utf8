                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BOLD AND RIGHT STEP                                                          
	On Indian foreign policy, there always falls the dark shadow of Pakistan. It would not be an exaggeration to add that storm clouds over Pakistan cast their pernicious influence over Indias domestic affairs. Events and escalating violence have brought Pakistan to the threshold of being called a failed State; it is also poised to be taken over by Islamic fundamentalists. This situation across Indias western border makes it impossible for any Indian prime minister to remain indifferent and oblivious to what is happening in Pakistan, and its impact on Indo-Pak relations. A durable peace with Pakistan is emerging as one of the many necessary conditions for effective governance in India. Manmohan Singh is the first prime minister to openly acknowledge this, as is reflected in the initiatives he is putting in place to resume dialogue with Pakistan. It is apparent that Mr Singh has put peace  or, at least, a lasting working relationship with Pakistan on the top of his agenda for his second innings as prime minister. Neither cynicism nor the hollow hawkishness that emanates from Indias foreign policy establishment where Pakistan is concerned has been allowed by Mr Singh to vitiate his vision for the future.        
	The first articulation of the importance that the prime minister was giving to Pakistan came in the statement issued after the meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh. What was remarkable about the prime ministers attitude was his openness and his willingness to go the extra mile to restore normalcy with Pakistan. Defending his position, Mr Singh said that he was willing to go more than half way if Pakistan acted against terror outfits. He made the simple point that despite the past, without trust there was no future for Indo-Pak relations. Mr Singh made his intentions and goodwill clear by allowing Pakistan to mention its concern about Indias alleged role in Baluchistan. Thursdays invitation to the Pakistan foreign secretary to come to Delhi for talks falls obviously within the road map that the prime minister had already drawn up. He has fulfilled his promise to travel more than half way because this invitation goes even though Pakistan has not taken concrete and demonstrable action against terrorist groups.        
	It is easy to scoff at the vision of the prime minister and his initiatives as being too idealistic. The question that needs to be asked against that kind of cynicism is what is the alternative. How long will India go on being the victim of Pakistans covert and open hostility? It is to Indias advantage to try and establish peace and a working relationship. Mr Singh has embarked on a policy of enlightened self-interest. He has nothing to lose but a peace to win. Mr Singh has set his goal and has taken a step towards it. He has cut the coils of hawkishness and cynicism.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | For a few Good leaders 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FOR A FEW GOOD LEADERS                                   Malvika Singh                              
	Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, with its delicately crafted, carved and embellished sandstone fort, sits cushioned on the sands of the expansive Thar desert. A living city within the ramparts, its skills and traditions continue despite the passage of time. But like everywhere else in India, the municipality is non-existent, perpetuating the filth, garbage, decay and corrosion, all of which is choking this gem that belongs to India and its people. Nowhere on this planet would such negligence and conscious lack of management be permitted or condoned. This strangulation of Jaisalmer is a virtual criminal act.         
	Chief ministers come and go, and they do not care. Cityplanning and conservation are terms that politicians do not necessarily comprehend, and, therefore, discount. Administrators follow their leaders instead of guiding them to do the right thing. All this is a far cry from the heady days when Indira Gandhi  who had visited Jaisalmer following the first nuclear test in Pokhran  stunned by its sheer beauty, craftsmanship and historical significance, declared it a national heritage site. Indira Gandhi understood the value of Indias treasured past, respected it, and saw in its variety the great plural strengths of India. She genuinely understood and cared for India and its cultural roots.         
	Since then, no political leader has actively intervened, nor fully believed in the desperate need to conserve and protect. Indira Gandhi never passed the buck using the fact that some of these issues were state subjects. She connected with a passion that is non-existent in the politics of today. Politicians, particularly Congressmen and women, must learn from her commitment to such issues, which they prefer to ignore and place on the back-burner of governance in their obsession to push for a growth rate that does not seem to affect the majority in India.                 
	Wrong model        
	The present-day government in Rajasthan, for one, needs to expedite the cleaning of Jaisalmer with the active participation of those who live there as a tribute to the memory of Indira Gandhi and her mission, instead of wasting money on advertisements eulogizing her and then doing the exact opposite of what she did.         
	The inability of the liberalizers in the Planning Commission and in the government to absorb traditional information technologies into the mainstream of development processes has been the single largest failure of inclusive growth in India over the last three decades. Their uninformed attitude towards real India has led to the most traumatic and unnecessary social upheavals. Sadly, the proponents of faulty growth models continue to govern without an understanding of India, its traditions and ethos. They have succeeded in disconnecting India from India.         
	The rapacious intent to break all environmental laws in the name of growth is transforming a nation that was endowed with the best resources to one that is pockmarked, diseased, maimed and chronically sick. The wrath of the gods is bound to kick in sometime soon. At another level, the talibanization of India under present-day governments, both in the states and at the Centre, is a more dangerous phenomenon than one thinks it is. How can Indian governments allow khap panchayats to carry on with their diktats unabated? Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and their generation of national leaders would have come out strongly and clearly, damning such realities and taking action against the killers. They would have addressed the nation and led from the front, charged with their fierce commitment to an India that is an ancient and profound civilization and a modern nation state. India is yearning for leadership.

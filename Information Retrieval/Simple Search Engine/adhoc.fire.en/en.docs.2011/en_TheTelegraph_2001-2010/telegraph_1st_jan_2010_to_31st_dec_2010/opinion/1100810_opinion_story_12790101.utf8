	Financial aid, like investment, is an act of faith. Indias decision to give a loan of $1 billion to Bangladesh should be primarily seen as a great leap forward in rebuilding relations between the two countries. The fact that this is the biggest loan New Delhi has ever offered to any other country indicates the importance of the agreement. And this has not come any time too soon. Relations between India and Bangladesh have been strained in recent years because of both actual events and wrong perceptions. Some events and trends in Bangladesh became matters of concern for New Delhi. Dhaka, too, was sceptical of Indias terms of engagement with it. A big push was needed to break this cycle of mistrust and misperception. The loan agreement could go a long way in doing that. The objections that some Opposition parties in Dhaka have raised over the terms of the loan are best dismissed as part of the countrys partisan politics. Obviously, New Delhi would not have committed itself to such an agreement unless it was convinced of its long-term economic and security benefits for both countries. Much will now depend on how the officialdoms in the two countries go about implementing the first 14 projects to be financed by the Indian loan.        
	Most of these projects involve development of new railways, roads and other infrastructure, and improvement of old ones. It is churlish to argue, as some Opposition politicians in Dhaka have done, that only India would benefit from improvements in railway, road and port facilities in Bangladesh. Transit facilities are not just part of todays global trade, they also bring substantial economic benefits to the country offering such facilities. For far too long, the so-called transit issue has been held hostage to Bangladeshs domestic political rivalry. True, Dhaka had its complaints against New Delhi on this count. The Union finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, has sought to address some of these complaints by offering to open India for the passage of Bangladeshs trade with Nepal and Bhutan. He could have perhaps done a little more in removing or reducing tariff in order to allow more Bangladeshi goods to enter the Indian market. If such goods are competitive enough to find their share of the Indian market, it is against the spirit of free trade to put up unnecessary barriers against them. But better trade ties are only part of the larger issue of mutual trust.

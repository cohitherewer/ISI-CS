	Instituto Cervantes, New Delhi, in association with Fundacin Mapfre, Madrid, brought Picassos Suite Vollard to India last November. This finely mounted exhibition, which closed at the institutes gallery in Delhi last month, focused on a period in the artists life when a combination of historical, social, aesthetic and market forces came together to elicit an extraordinary body of work from him.        
	In 1901, during his second visit to Paris, the 20-year-old Picasso met Ambroise Vollard, an upcoming art-dealer, publisher and gallerist, whose catalogue included van Gogh, Czanne, Manet, Gauguin, Rousseau and Bonnard. Driven by his instinct for great art, Vollard bought scores of works by these modern masters, often for a song (paying less than 400 francs for a Renoir), when they were still considered too avant-garde by most turn-of-the-century collectors.        
	Being a visionary entrepreneur, Vollard found a way of putting this revolutionary art into the public domain. From the late 1890s, he started commissioning artists who were not professional engravers to illustrate literary works. (His edition of Verlaines Paralllement with drawings by Bonnard was a classic in its time.) Soon after meeting Picasso, Vollard organized the first exhibitions of the young painters works from the blue and pink periods. As they were not very successful, Vollard asked Picasso to make a series of prints, which the latter produced intermittently until the 1910s and, in a more sustained manner, between 1930-37, when he worked on what became the Suite Vollard.        
	Since a great many of these etchings went into Vollards edition of Balzacs Le Chef-doeuvre inconnu (1931), Albert Skiras Les Mtamorphoses dOvide (1932) and Gilbert Seldess translation of Lysistrata (1934), the 100 prints that make up the Suite Vollard are charged with memories of their literary antecedents. With its baffling mnage  trois of artists, models and artworks inside a studio, neoclassical beauties being courted by satyrs or violated by raging Minotaurs, and human forms assuming animal shapes, Suite Vollard mirrors the inner turmoil of the emerging artist, striving to breathe life into the stillness of lines, curves and colours, caught in a furious struggle to infuse a dynamic sensuality into two-dimensional forms.        
	Curators generally classify Suite Vollard into several themes  The Battle of Love (5 sheets), The Sculptures Studio (46 sheets), Rembrandt (4 sheets), The Minotaur and The Blind Minotaur (15 sheets), a set of 27 sheets based on various themes, and lastly, the three portraits of Vollard himself. Picasso worked on the collection at a wildly varying pace, taking seven years to produce 27 prints or finishing 40 sheets in a creative frenzy in three months. He appeared to have no sequence in mind, and the idea seemed to have eluded his modern editors as well. Instead of displaying thematically related image clusters, the series could be rearranged to tell a grand narrative of love and loss, art and life, intellect and emotion. The structure and the movement of the sequence could be analogous to the progression of motifs and patterns in a symphony; the interplay of dark and light tones reflected by the combination of major and minor notes.        
	In Suite Vollard, Picassos lines and curves sway to the wild rhythm of black, white and grey, or vanish sinuously into the depths of paper. The serenity of nudes, drawn with sparse lines and graceful strokes, gives way to an outburst of squiggles that capture the baroque energy of the orgiastic rituals of The Battle of Love. Like the mercurial music of Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler, two of his great contemporaries, Picassos art went to the still centre of being only to plunge into a vortex of anarchy. In Suite Vollard, Picassos insistent return to cross-hatching bears testimony to this ceaseless urge to evolve an individual idiom  to tease out the face of Rembrandt from the whiteness of paper, or to fashion a torso from a jumble of scrawls, as Tagore was doing in another part of the world.        
	This volatile, dissonant grandeur makes the Suite Vollard a feat of compression, where an epic vision is distilled into minimal forms. Picasso allows the great tradition of Renaissance figurative art to interact with cubism. The figure of the sculptor, often monstrously proportioned, is seen in close communion with his muse, usually a nubile lady, who is preyed upon, elsewhere, by satyrs or Minotaurs. A genuine confusion of life and art prevails, where artists, models and artworks form an illusive trinity  it becomes impossible to tell apart life from art, the model from her mould (picture).         
	The scene is reminiscent of the last act of Winters Tale, when Leontes is overwhelmed to discover the statue of Hermione warm, breathing human passion. If this be magic, he cries out in joy, let it be an art/ Lawful as eating. Faced with the spell of Picassos interlocking realities, one can say no less.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WAYWARD                                                    
	When a minister of the West Bengal government talks of taking a balanced approach to anything it is time to stop laughing and get ready for mayhem. Legalizing the presence of hawkers on Calcuttas pavements is exactly calculated to produce this mayhem. The balanced approach is a rosy vision of space sharing between pedestrians and hawkers, a prelapsarian state of coexistence that Calcutta has never seen in recent times and is never likely to see. But the Left Fronts glibness in covering up its own incompetence has grown with the number of its failures, however squeaky that glibness sounds. The latest decision, to provide over two lakh hawkers with identity cards, is a cover-up for the failure of Operation Sunshine to remove hawkers from particular pavements, to restrict their activities to certain areas, and rid 21 thoroughfares of hawkers altogether. Even more important for the Left Front, or, rather, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), is making sure of a chunk of votes in a season in which overwhelming electoral support is beginning to look uncertain. Identity cards for hawkers is just the thing: they can now block pavements, surge on to streets and refuse to budge, harassing and endangering pedestrians.         
	But that is likely to happen only in West Bengal. The Left Front government has cited the Centres national policy on urban street vendors in support of its sudden change of approach  no more blindly clearing pavements of hawkers. The Centres policy speaks of accommodating this huge group of disadvantaged entrepreneurs which serves the less affluent customer in convenient places at lower rates. But that policy, while asserting that this would be a means of urban poverty alleviation, is very firm on regulation, proposing restriction-free vending zones, restricted vending zones and no-vending zones, together with detailed working out of fair systems in case demand is greater than space. The freedom to carry on trade should be reasonably restricted if it hinders the flow of traffic, disturbs pedestrians or causes a health hazard. The Left Front has seized on the first bit of the policy and is, as experience would tell any Calcuttan, paying lip service to the second. Restraint, regulation, law, civic sense, balance, are really not part of the CPI(M)s mental horizon. And urban order is certainly not something its leaders can conceive of.

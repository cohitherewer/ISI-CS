	The Truth About Me: A Hijra Life Story By A. Revathi, Penguin, Rs 299        
	A Revathi tells her story gently, lucidly, with an undertone of deep sadness and no melodrama. She was once Doraisamy, the youngest son in a family of four brothers and one sister, living in a small village in Namakkal in Salem district in Tamil Nadu. Doted upon as the youngest son, she did not at first realize how odd it was in a strictly gendered society to want to play only with girls or to help her mother sweep the yard and cook. As understanding dawned, her anguish grew. She was a beloved boy who only wanted to be a girl in a family in which her brothers beat her up whenever they saw girlish behaviour in her.         
	Her journey in search of the truth of her own being began early, when she was barely out of school, from initial confusion, fear and terrible loneliness to a gradual awakening to the existence of others like herself, marginalized in society, till she too became a member of the hijra community, first in a parivar in Delhi, then in ones in Mumbai and Bangalore. In many ways, the story is typical, recording the stages of life and the changing emotions of a transsexual who must ultimately undergo castration to become a woman. From an objective point of view, Revathis tale has a bitter perfection. Unlike many among the hijras who castrate themselves out of a need to belong, or because of peer pressure, Revathis desire to be a woman was passionate and implacable. Although her operation was performed by a doctor, and not by her peers as was traditional (she was offered a choice and her guru decided for her), it was a hideously painful experience. Like a second birth, this nirvaanam gave her true prestige in the community.        
	Yet, Revathis story reaches far beyond the typical. Her sad, unadorned voice, translated with unwavering clarity by V. Geetha, underlines, all over again, the cruelty of society to the sexually different being. As she journeys from city to city, happy to be a woman yet suffering acutely in the traditional occupations of a hijra, visits her family repeatedly till her siblings and parents are forced into accepting her acquired femaleness, is driven into painful sex work because she is unable to suppress her sexual desire, she also strips the life of a hijra of myth and false beliefs and creates a deeply moving human document that resonates with emotional truth. Her gift of detail brings to life not only the hijra community and its customs, its tensions and compassion, but also the society beyond that, from her birthplace to the cities she lives in. Her refusal to accept that a transsexual must be denied normal emotions leads her to develop a strong relationship with her own family, but on her own terms. That is an astonishing achievement. From the experience of everyday abuse, insult, poverty and physical suffering, from the suicide of a chela and the murder of her guru, from rape and police torture, from a happy marriage to the man she loves and its tragic dissolution, she ultimately becomes an activist and a writer, working for an organization fighting for the rights of sexual minorities.         
	Revathi makes the reader share her suffering. Yet, she does ultimately find some succour and dignity, purely because she lives in a part of India that is the home of movements keenly aware of the tragedies of existence in the third gender. But what happens to sexual minorities in other regions, in West Bengal and Orissa, for example? Can their suffering be even imagined?                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

                              Fallen through        
	 Nitin Gadkari is a Big Boy, so better stop sniggering at him! If you believed that the Bharatiya Janata Party heavyweight actually swooned at a recent rally to protest against price rise, then you were sadly mistaken. The latest bulletin from Ashoka Road says something quite different. Apparently, on that fateful day, the sole of Gadkaris shoe gave in and caught the portly leader completely off balance. But before the Nagpur man could react, partymen rushed to him from all corners, pouring gallons of chilled water on him, thrusting glucose, ORS and such other liquids into his reluctant mouth in order to rejuvenate him. Poor Gadkari, deprived of a chance to explain, could only suffer silently, getting drenched in various fluids and cursing the faulty sole with a heavy soul. Then entered the television channels and the fall of Gadkari made sensational breaking news. Last heard, ever since this dramatic turn of events, Gadkari has taken to wearing special sports shoes.                              
	 Mani Shankar Aiyar is reportedly waiting for a chance to speak in the Rajya Sabha. That does not augur too well for the Opposition. Aiyar, who has been nominated by the president in the eminent category, would be entitled to speak uninterruptedly for two-and-a-half hours. Considering his sharp tongue and penchant to rip apart his political foes, the Opposition members are probably not looking forward to hear Aiyar declaim in the House. The only silver lining, it seems, is the limited duration of such a privilege. A member is allowed this chance to hold forth only once a year.                            
	 Politics has its own way of making unlikely bedfellows find solace in each other. The latest hysteria over phone-tapping has brought the rebellious Samajwadi Party leader, Amar Singh, into the arms of the general secretary of All India Congress Committee, Digvijay Singh. Although the Singhs hail from the kshatriya caste, such an affiliation had not managed to forge any bond between them as yet. The Kshatriya Mahasabha, patronized by Diggy Raja, had consciously kept Amar away from its conventions, prompting the latter to join a breakaway faction, Kshatriya Sabha. But now, a thaw seems to be setting in. Amar has now invited Digvijay to join the phone pirit club (for sufferers of phone-tapping). Although Digvijay has not accepted the offer, Amar seems to be hopeful that this common cause will finally help him unite with his fellow thakur.                            
	 The Union minister for science and technology, Prithviraj Chavan, seems to be overburdened with work. Following the recent incident of radioactive material being found in scrap at Mayapuri in west Delhi, the minister claimed there was a foreign hand in the matter. Until, of course, it was revealed that the substance had come from the nearby Delhi University. In the mean time, a clueless Chavan was frantically underlining the need for bigger restrictions on getting scrap from abroad.      
	Congress members are, however, reasonably sympathetic to the ever affable Chavan. After all, he is currently AICC general-secretary, an important member in the Prime Ministers Office, is associated with the department of atomic energy and assists the parliamentary affairs minister as minister of state. A man of such exalted qualifications must be forgiven for these minor lapses.                            
	 The Raj Bhavan of Rajasthan appears to be jinxed. Just a few months back, S.K. Singh passed away when he was governor of Rajasthan. Soon afterwards, the former Maharashtra minister, Prabha Rau, replaced him. She, too, died under unfortunate circumstances. Rau slipped in the bathroom, took a fall, and was discovered much later by a friend, when it was already too late. After two unfortunate deaths, no one seems particularly keen to take up the same position.                            
	 Parliament in session and no ones shouting. Sounds absurd? Well, it did happen the other day as the Opposition brought the cut motion against the government. When the first round of the voting ended, every member of the Lok Sabha was eagerly waiting for the counting to get over. It took quite a while, as many had not pressed the button properly and had to fill up slips. So the entire Lok Sabha was in pin-drop silence. But soon, the usual chaos set in as the machines failed again during the next round of voting.                        
	 Shashi Tharoor could take some useful lessons from the life and times of Shibu Soren. The Jharkhand chief minister managed to speak both ways and stay afloat. Soren told a visibly agitated Sushma Swaraj not to read too much into his vote for the United Progressive Alliance government in the Lok Sabha as he was suffering from Alzheimers. To other Central leaders of the BJP, guruji harped on the need to continue their alliance because the first few months were too short a time to realize some of the promises he had made to them in his mining-rich state. Sorens vote, on the other hand, is supposed to have earned him reprieve vis--vis some of the hawkish Central agencies probing into his cases. But nonetheless, the BJP did cut a sorry figure in the Lok Sabha, thanks to Soren.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Candour, beauty and a spurt of fun
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CANDOUR, BEAUTY AND A SPURT OF FUN                                  VISUAL ARTS: Uddalak Mukherjee                                                  
	Tasveer, Magnum and the Seagull Foundation for the Arts in association with Ganjam recently organized an exhibition titled At the Movies: Magnum Ke Tasveer  Celebrating 100 Years of Hollywood (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, September 10-20). The show, described as an endeavour to document the cinema heritage of Hollywood and Magnum, featured photographs of iconic actors such as James Dean, Clark Gable, Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe and so on. The photographers included are as famous  Robert Capa and David Seymour (co-founders of Magnum along with Cartier-Bresson and George Rodger), Dennis Stock, Burt Glinn, Elliott Erwitt, Inge Morath and others.        
	Magnums relationship with Hollywood dates back to the latters golden period  the 1950s  an era that coincided with the agencys own rise to prominence. Cartier-Bresson is known to have directed films, and Capa had an extensive network among actors and directors. (The catalogue of At the Movies informs us that John Huston had given exclusive rights to 10 Magnum photographers to document the making of The Misfits.) The exhibition offered a tiny glimpse of the riches that make up Magnums Hollywood archive and its history.        
	It is difficult not to be seduced by some of these photographs. Marilyn Monroe, partially draped in a white sheet, smiles mischievously and offers a tiny peek of her left breast; Jayne Mansfield, covered in soap lather, pouts at the camera from inside an ornate tub; a nattily dressed Brando rehearses a scene for Chaplins A Countess from Hong Kong with a deadpan expression. But despite the alluring quality and the flawless composition (the photographs of Monroe and Brando were taken by Eve Arnold, while Inge Morath photographed Mansfield), this isnt quite great photography. For here, one can detect a barely concealed attempt to augment the larger-than-life-image of these actors. Consequently, it is the actor who dominates the frame, mitigating the cameras ability to capture the finer elements that lead the eye to the bigger, and more intriguing, picture.        
	The images where the subject  a Hollywood star  is merely a prop are the ones that captivate. Dennis Stocks photograph of a hunched James Dean walking in Times Square, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, is remarkable for two reasons (picture). First, Stock manages to magnify the impact of every tiny visual detail, lending a haunting quality to the photograph: the rain-drenched and desolate square, the circular puddle formed by Deans boots, the droplets of rain, an illuminated film advertisement, the huge billboards and buildings dwarfing a star, making him appear human and vulnerable. Second, Stocks magic transforms the image into some sort of a social document: a visual record of a different time, of streets, architecture, and sartorial tastes that may have all changed.        
	Some of the photographs register a more personal transformation. Burt Glinn captures a haughty Elizabeth Taylor turning away from the extended hands of beach urchins during the making of Suddenly Last Summer. Yet, the same soulless creature looks endearing as she embraces her children protectively in an Eve Arnold photograph that makes wonderful use of light. There are other examples of beauty and candour. Audrey Hepburn smiles reflectively as she watches the world mirrored on the shiny body of a car (Dennis Stock). But my favourite is Capas masterly photograph in which we see Gary Cooper walking gingerly on a fallen log, as he tries to cross a brook. The composition  light and depth  is excellent, as are the details of the landscape in the background. The slight tilt in Coopers gait, and the manner in which he uses the fishing wheel to balance himself, give us the impression that the actor who made horse-riding and gun-duels appear ridiculously easy is making heavy weather of the task at hand.        
	Creating a fantasy is also a laborious process, and this is most evident in the photographs of Ray and Chaplin at work (by Marc Riboud and William Eugene Smith respectively). David Hurns photograph of an amateur clicking a starlet in Cannes lays bare the ties that bind art and commerce.        
	It would not be correct to judge these photographs solely in aesthetic terms. They also point to an earlier, and now nearly-absent, mode of ethics that directed the work of gifted photographers. The camera is seldom an intruder here, even though there is nothing contrived about the photographs. At a time when the triumph of the paparazzi has ignited furious debates concerning photographys relationship with privacy, it is refreshing to come across a set of images that is virtually devoid of the tension that often affects the subject of the camera.

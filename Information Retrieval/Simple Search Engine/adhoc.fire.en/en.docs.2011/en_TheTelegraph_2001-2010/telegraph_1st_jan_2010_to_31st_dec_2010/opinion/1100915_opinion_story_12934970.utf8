                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        KNOWING WHERE TO LOOK                          - Why the US needs to discuss East Asia with New Delhi					 					      Diplomacy      K.P. Nayar                                                      
	This week marks the start of intense traffic between New Delhi and Washington in preparation for Barack Obamas visit to India that promises to be rich in symbolism and atmospherics. Unlike the trips to India made by two of Obamas predecessors from the White House (Bill Clintons in 2000 and George W. Bushs six years later), it would appear, as preparations start for the November visit, that the summit is open to being criticized for the absence of a lynchpin on which to build Indo-US relations cohesively during the rest of Obamas presidency.        
	However, such a lopsided vision of relations between India and the United States of America would be a disservice to the formers most important external relationship in one of its most critical phases. As yet, there may be nothing dramatic like the nuclear deal on the table as top diplomats from both sides shuttle across continents in preparation for the November summit, but there is much happening in both Washington and in New Delhi that will determine Indias place in the world during what is referred to as the current, Asian century. And the diplomatic global positioning system, which will show the way to Indias status in this century, still directs the drivers of Indian foreign policy towards Washington, notwithstanding the USs diminished place in the world and its reduced economic power.        
	Because of the way Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Bill Clinton on the one hand and Manmohan Singh and Bush on the other constructed Indo-US bonhomie in the new millennium, a lot of the substantial work being done between the two governments no longer needs high-profile or political intervention; such work is often done away from the glare of the media.              
	A few days ago, when this columnist was in New Delhi, a Japanese diplomat confided that the joint secretary in South Block dealing with Japan, Gautam Bambawale, would be in Washington this week to review developments in East Asia with Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. At the time of writing, Bambawales visit to Washington, along with a small team of officials, had not been made public by either side. Anyone who did not know the assistant secretary of state for East Asia would have assumed from the Japanese officials demeanour that Campbell is the most important person in this diplomats worldview after the occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne.        
	That, in itself, is not surprising, coming from someone in the Japanese government. In fact, when rumours began circulating in January last year that Campbell would head the incoming Obama state departments East Asia bureau, Kyodo, the Japanese news agency waxed as if the post was that of a head of government. If Campbell assumes the post, Kyodo reported, it would be favourable to Japan as he could serve as a counterweight to [secretary of state, Hillary] Clinton, who some in Japan fear would lead the US to tilt toward China.        
	But, for better or worse, Indians must realize that this is the way the world is still structured. As those who make policy in Tokyo see it, if Indias point-man for Japan is being invited by the Americans to discuss their region, then obviously India has arrived on the global platform as a key diplomatic player. It is on impressions and assumptions such as these in world capitals that India should build on as it charts its way to its status as a global power. The US cannot make India a great power, as some members of the Bush administration once promised. But Washington can certainly pave the way for Indias great power status in the Asian century, as clearly demonstrated by this episode.         
	Impressions on third countries apart, it is also a clear signal in bilateral relations that if the US feels the need to discuss East Asia at regular intervals with those in New Delhi who fine-tune the countrys Look East policy, obviously Indias reach and importance have vastly changed, in a regional context, from what it was some years ago.        
	In Washington, the desire to consult New Delhi on China is itself not new. During the Clinton administration, a feeble attempt was made to do this, but the effort did not go very far and the process itself was not institutionalized. But, in March this year, the Obama administration not only revived it, but also expanded on the idea and sent Campbell on his first visit to New Delhi as its point-person on East Asia.        
	In Campbells own words, during his talks with Bambawale in March, we talked about South East Asia, China, North East Asia and developments there.... Our desire is to continue a strong dialogue with India about their so-called Look East strategy, which obviously involves India playing a larger role economically, politically, strategically in the Asian-Pacific region. We welcome that, we support that, we think that is an important development in the next phase of Asias growth. We talked about regional architecture and the desire to see India play a larger role in the emerging architecture of the Asian-Pacific region. And I must say we were quite satisfied by our discussions and I look forward to continuing deeper discussions with Indian friends about developments in the wider Asian-Pacific region.         
	What took place in Washington this week with the visiting officials from South Block was precisely a continuation of the deeper discussions with India on the Asia-Pacific that Campbell promised when he returned from New Delhi.        
	Unfortunately, it is most likely that any public discourse in India on this weeks Indo-US dialogue on East Asia will attempt to reduce it to a discussion on China between South Block and the state department in an effort to serve vested interests who are trying on both sides to ensure that Sino-Indian tensions  real and imagined  are on the boil. However, Indias relations with Southeast and East Asia are expanding so comprehensively that at last, the Look East policy initiated by P.V. Narasimha Rao soon after the end of the Cold War is having an impact in the entire region. For instance, look at the range and depth of Indias relations with Japan which, in fact, took up a large slice of the two-day discussions that Bambawale and his team had in Washington.              
	Many years from now, when strategic issues that have a limited shelf-life are discussed, resolved and implemented, after many toasts are offered at state banquets at the Tokyo Imperial Palace and in Rashtrapati Bhavan, long after the paper on which joint statements are printed has become sepia-tinted, the Indian Institute of Technology in Hyderabad will be celebrated as an enduring testimony to Indo-Japanese relations in the 21st century. Similarly, when the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, which is being created with a financial aid of $90 billion and technical assistance from Japan, becomes a reality and transforms the lives of people living along a 1,483 km stretch between Indias two big cities, it will be the vindication of a bilateral relationship that is a repetition of how the Soviets facilitated the celebration of Indo-USSR relations through the steel plants in Bhilai and Bokaro.        
	Albeit on a smaller scale compared to Japan, similar strides have been made in relations with South Korea. Here again, the Hyundai car plant in Chennai provides hard evidence of a flowering relationship that people can relate to. The Americans realize that they have gone out of their way with the Indo-US nuclear deal to attempt a transformation of Washingtons relations with New Delhi. But, alas, they are also realizing that the nuclear deal is not something ordinary Indians can relate to. But when the Americans have to look to East Asia on how to structure their own relationship with India, it says a lot about the need for New Delhi to look east rather than west in its pursuit of a role on the world stage.

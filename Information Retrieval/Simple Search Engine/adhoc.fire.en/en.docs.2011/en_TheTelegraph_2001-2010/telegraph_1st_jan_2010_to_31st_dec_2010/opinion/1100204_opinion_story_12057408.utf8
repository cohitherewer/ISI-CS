	 The pre-pre-electioneering continues at Westminster and wherever major and minor political figures can find a platform. It is a mistake. As readers of this column have probably noticed, this country, like others, is busy reducing democracy to a never-ending, belittling scrap between parties to the detriment of our governments and governance. It is our own fault. We expect instant gratification to the extent of miracle-working from our politicians which has reduced them to giving endless empty promises and meaningless soundbites to prove they are busy on our behalf.        
	The most miracle-working of politicians, President Barack Obama, has hit the rubble of disenchantment this week as an improbable Republican challenger wins Teddy Kennedys old Senate seat in Massachusetts. The Messiahs feet of clay have been revealed because  guess what? He hasnt managed to stop the wars, to transform not just the United States of America but also the world economy, close down Guantnamo and turn healthcare in the US on its axis at the same time as accepting, debatably unwisely, the Nobel prize for peace, and appearing at every major international conference including Copenhagen  and he has had a whole year in office. O, and by the way, it will be his fault in particular, is my guess, that more deaths are being caused by the totally inadequate and now totally destroyed infrastructure that has hampered all emergency aid to Haiti this week.                    
	Our climatic ups and downs are mere hiccups in our daily existence however much we moan. We can meanwhile at least be proud of the work our teams of rescuers, our local firemen and rescue services, are doing in Haiti, and understand the need to apportion blame of our press correspondents on the spot, seeing the horror and looking for culprits for the rising death toll and the desperation of survivors. No doubt people who might have been saved in more accessible countries will have died in the chaos as the aid machine continues to crank up on the ground. The international response in terms of giving has been spectacular but the delivery bottleneck has not yet opened up. The magnitude of this disaster and the level of international involvement may however ensure that, once fully operational, it doesnt stop at the basics but keeps going to revive and rebuild not just people and buildings but a whole country. The Americans may as usual look like an occupying force as much as emergency help but with President Obama in charge and given time, they may also ensure that the Haitians have an improved future and, more importantly, are not abandoned when a newer disaster captures the richer worlds attention and resources.         
	Ongoing wars and the armies that fight them are far greater long-term consumers of resources than disasters and community or even nation rebuilding. Iraq has cost us in every way because the rebuilding of peace and the country was ill-planned and now, as we await Tony Blairs evidence on events leading up to the war, we have had Alastair Campbell, his former spin doctor, in the hot seat at the Chilcot inquiry. Chilcots stated aim is to examine the United Kingdoms involvement in Iraq and the way decisions and actions were taken. Campbell has insisted that he is proud to have been part of the decisionmaking process and has forcibly defended the so-called September dossier on Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction, the smoking gun that theoretically made the war inevitable and possibly just. It makes us all squirm that we allowed ourselves to be taken in or, if we didnt believe, still didnt yell loud enough, although if it is true that Blair had already made a pact with Bush to support a war against Saddam, we probably didnt have much chance of stopping him.                     
	On the rare occasions I have met him in recent times, Blair can still charm the birds off the trees, certainly this one, but I have a real problem with people who are convinced that they are on a higher, better plane than the rest of humanity, and these days Blair, unfettered by or uncaring of domestic public opinion that seems to slide off him like water off the proverbial duck, appears ever more determined to polish his self-awarded halo in public. I imagine that Campbells obdurate stance at Chilcot was an introduction to the self-justification of his former boss when he gives his evidence next Friday. What will come of it? Outpourings of further impotent rage on the part of the public and the press, Blair off on another lucrative lecture tour and a wealth of research and possibility for generations of future historians.

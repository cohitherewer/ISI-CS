	Pride without prejudice      
	The Final Question (Ravi Dayal and Penguin, Rs 350) by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay is a translation of the Bengali classic, Shesh Prashna (1931), by members of the department of English, Jadavpur University. Set in a middle-class Bengali milieu in Agra in the early decades of the 20th century, this late novel reinforces Saratchandras enduring relevance. The story revolves around Kamal, the love-child of an English tea planter and a Bengali widow. Like Rabindranath Tagores Gora, Kamal embodies the spirit of contrariness. Driven by reason rather than idle romanticism, she hits out at the comfortable numbness of Bengali domesticity, upsetting closely held beliefs and biases. She is perceived as brazen by women, and adored by men, secretly or otherwise. From a writer who led a nomadic existence, got to know a bizarre assembly of characters, and admired Herbert Spencer, Charles Dickens, Balzac and Bernard Shaw, this is a tale that shimmers with ideas but never fails to entertain. The full complexity of Kamals life and times comes alive in the brilliant introduction by Supriya Chaudhuri. Arup Rudra and Sukanta Chaudhuri provide valuable editorial notes, while Amitava Das adds a useful preface.                        
	Life-O-Logy (Frog, Rs 95) by Renuka Puntambekar promises to spice up the dreariness of life with a dozen short stories. Indeed a lot happens in these little tales, some of which are no better than brief episodes. Nipping the Bud, for instance, begins tamely but ends with a startling twist. However, the quality varies quite unpredictably, as with the opening story, which reads like R.K. Narayan on a bad day. Although the author has a tolerably good command of English prose, one hopes she would pay closer attention to the rhythm of the language and allow her plots to take more complicated turns. And with a title like Channelising Childhood, one presumes that not much editorial intervention has gone into the book.                        
	The Gift (HarperCollins, Rs 195) by Cecelia Ahern should only be gifted to ones enemies. In this supposedly magical tale, urban drudgery takes on a spooky aspect as the hero, Lou Suffern, encounters Gabe, a homeless man. Need one add that the most life-changing incidents follow thereafter? Moral of the story: Sometimes you have to be unravelled in order to find out who you really are.

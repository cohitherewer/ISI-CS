	Save them                  
	Sir  The demand by the traders of north Bengal that the speed ban on trains running through the Dooars be lifted reflects their indifference to the regions wildlife, particularly elephants (Traders seek lift of speed ban on trains, Nov 12). The traders are merely concerned about their own businesses, which might suffer if trains run late. They do not seem to realize that business is booming in the Dooars because of tourists who visit the forests to watch the wildlife. The Dooars does not have much to boast of except for its wildlife, and if that disappears, tourists will flock to other places.          
	Because of the ongoing political unrest in the Darjeeling hills, the entire rush of tourists is being diverted to the Dooars in the peak season. The demand for the forest bungalows is so high nowadays that one has to book months in advance. Instead of asking for an increase in the speed of trains, the Malbazar Byabsayee Samiti ought to insist on a couple of tourist trains, which would take visitors on a leisurely tour of the forests and tea plantations.          
	As it is, reduction in the speed of trains is not enough to prevent accidents. There have been too many deaths of elephants on train tracks in recent times for the railway officials to be able to shrug off responsibility. The forest department is to be blamed for this as well. Most of the watch towers promised by the forest ministry are still under construction. The fact that people continue to injure the elephants that stray into villages also reflects the forest departments inability to organize proper awareness campaigns. The government must urgently take steps to relocate the villages lying along the elephant corridors. Unless some concrete, even if unpopular, decisions are taken by the state government, the railway authorities and the forest department to save the elephants, the future of these animals will be uncertain. The sightings of these majestic creatures will become rarer by the day.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Nelson A. Petrie, Siliguri 

                
	Sir  Lifting the speed ban on trains moving through the Dooars would be extremely unfair to the animals. The elephant death toll is high this year, and it will be higher if the railways decides to think of the traders welfare. North Bengal is a haven for elephants. But with the rise in man-animal conflict, elephants are increasingly being stoned or poisoned to death. This proves that we are morally bankrupt, unlike the inhabitants of other states like Kerala where elephants are worshipped. Cannot elephants be treated on a par with tigers or rhinoceroses and get proper protection?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Janga Bahadur Sunuwar, Bagrakote, Jalpaiguri 

                
	Too little          
	Sir  A jail term of mere four years for the four seniors convicted of ragging Aman Kachroo that resulted in the latters death amounts almost to a miscarriage of justice (4-year jail for Aman seniors, Nov 12). At the same time, this is not unexpected, since a Dharamshala fast-track court had released all the four accused on bail in July this year. The fast-track courts unsolicited sympathy for the offenders had surprised everyone. People are now thankful to the Himachal Pradesh High Court, which took suo motu notice and cancelled the bail. But one wonders what will happen after four years when the boys roam free again. The four should have been given life terms .          
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

                
	Danger ahead          
	Sir  I often cross the frail old bridge over the Rupnarayan at Kolaghat on NH 6, and watch the skeleton of an incomplete bridge standing beside it. The unfinished bridge has been like this for many years. As one gets on the old bridge, one sees a board proclaiming, Weak bridge ahead. Perhaps dangerous would have been more appropriate. When your car stops on the bridge, you feel tremors, as if an earthquake is on. One does not have to be an engineer to say that this bridge might collapse any day, cutting off the road link to Calcutta, Haldia, Kharagpur and beyond. Will something be done before disaster strikes?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Let live                  
	Sir  Swapan Dasguptas A question of survival (June 11) is yet another of those pieces that justify the unjust policy of Israel. Contrary to what Dasgupta says, this is a question of survival not for the Israelis, but for the Palestinians. Israel and Palestine were both created by the same United Nations resolution. But while the former came into existence immediately, the people of the latter have been waiting for over 60 years for a Palestinian State. The United States of America and its allies call the Palestinians militants and ignore the atrocities perpetrated on them by Israel. Several UN resolutions passed in favour of Palestine have been disregarded by Israel.          
	Israel had earlier occupied parts of Lebanon and called those regions its security zone  a claim that was justified by many other countries. But the blockade of Gaza or the denial of a Palestinian State cannot be linked to concerns for Israels security. This nation feels so confident about asserting its power precisely because it has the support of the strongest country in the world.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The irony of Swapan Dasguptas article lies in its concluding sentence. Dasgupta says, for Israel, resisting religion-inspired aggression is a question of survival. Religion-inspired aggression on whose part is he referring to?          
	During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Zionists called for the creation of a homeland for the Jews, who needed to escape persecution in Europe. The formation of the Jewish State of Israel out of the British protectorate of Palestine was expedited in the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust. From the second half of the 20th century onwards, Israel has asserted itself as a predominant military power in the Middle East. In this it has been aided to a large extent by the US.          
	Israel calls itself a democratic State. But it does not tolerate dissent, although it has some token Arab members in its parliament. Dissenters are equivalent to traitors. Mordechai Vanunu, a former Israeli nuclear scientist and peace activist who opposed Israels weapons of mass destruction, was called a spy and was imprisoned for 18 years. Earlier, anyone in the West who criticized the Israeli government was branded an anti-Semite. This is no longer the case today. There is an emerging body of public opinion a large part of which is composed of eminent Jewish intellectuals who believe that Israel must change its policies to survive.          
	Israels recent policies have made enemies even out of friends such as Turkey. This has only strengthened the hands of its real enemy, Iran. Israels greater good lies in actively supporting the creation of a viable and harmonious Palestinian State. This can only happen if it abandons religious fundamentalism.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Alarm bells          
	Sir  The editorial, Hot stuff (June 10), is a timely warning to city mayors all over the world to combat climate change. If global warming is not restrained, it will destroy human civilization. The recent meeting held in Bonn on climate change is a significant step in making people aware of the problem. It is heartening to know that the mayors of Howrah and Chennai were among the delegates who attended this historic conference. That metropolitan cites all over the world consume two-thirds of the worlds energy and are responsible for over 70 per cent of the worlds carbon emission is alarming. Unless scientists evolve a method to check this menace, we will be scorched by heat in the near future.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilip Kumar Kar, Jalpaiguri

                
	With due respect          
	Sir  A number of points raised in the editorial, Dressing down (June 8), regarding freedom of expression and personal choice are no doubt correct. Nevertheless, it is expected that in a house of god not only will the devotee or visitor dress respectfully  I would not like to specify sari, salwar or any other dress  but would also go there with a basic feeling of respect, even if faith is missing.          
	One cannot go to St Peters in Rome with bare shoulders or in miniskirts and the like, and without ladies covering their heads. No man or woman can go into a Sikh gurdwara without covering their heads and, once again, without being in appropriate attire.          
	I am the chairman of four large temples in north India, all of them attracting lakhs of devotees. If a lady comes with bare shoulders, the temple guard provides her with a stole to cover her shoulders, and naturally, some similar restrictions apply. All Birla temples are open to people of all religions, whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian or any other. The only condition is that they should come in with appropriate respect. This is because I think that all right-thinking people believe that god is one, pathways to god are many, and you cannot hold back anyone from going into a house of god.          
	Perhaps I did not understand the editorial. But I am very clear on the point that, within limits, a policy dictating appropriate attire in a house of god is absolutely correct and well within the rights of the temple management.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.K. Birla, Calcutta

	Pope Benedict XVI, who is usually in the news for all the wrong reasons, seems to be drawing some positive media attention at last. In a recent interview with a German Catholic journalist  which has been included in a new book  the pope has clarified that the use of condoms may be acceptable under exceptional circumstances, especially when they help reduce the risk of HIV infections. Such a public endorsement of contraception is certainly not the usual line adopted by the Catholic Church. So there is every reason to laud the pope for making a progressive statement, albeit one that is laced with darker ironies. Last year, during a visit to Cameroon, the pope had said that handing out condoms might actually turn out to be detrimental to the cause of preventing HIV, as free distribution of condoms would further encourage licentious activities and increase the risk of sexually-transmitted diseases. In contrast to this view of the human condition, the popes recent concession could indeed be mistaken for a genuine change of heart.        
	It is easy to be persuaded by the popes quasi-liberalism if one overlooks the moral overtone of his reference to the evil of HIV infection. Even as he approved of contraceptives, the pope did not forget to include a shrewd proviso by invoking exceptional circumstances. To illustrate these circumstances, he used the case of a male prostitute, who, in any case, is more likely to be exposed to the risk of HIV infection. Tellingly, the pope chose an example where sex is involved as a professional, not a personal, concern. Obviously, he continues to feel less charitably towards sex in everyday life, where it figures as a pleasurable activity, not just as a means of procreation. His reservations are clear from his belief that sheer fixation on the condom would lead to a banalisation of sexuality. The Catholic Church, the pope maintains, does not consider the use of condoms to be a real or moral solution. So is this merely damage control?

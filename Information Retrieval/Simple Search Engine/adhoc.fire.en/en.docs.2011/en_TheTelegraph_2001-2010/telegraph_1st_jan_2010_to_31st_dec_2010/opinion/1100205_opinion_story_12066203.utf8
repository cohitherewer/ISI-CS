                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OUTSIDERS ALL                                                    
	Laughter often has a dark heart. The demands of the Shiv Sena are laughable, yet no one is really laughing. At the moment, Shiv Sena activists are busy taking down posters advertising Shah Rukh Khans new film, because the actor had said that players from Pakistan should not have been excluded from the Indian Premier League teams. But Mr Khans transgression, however inaccessible to logic, is only one in a list of offences that various people have been charged with recently, all of which violate some provincial principle such as Mumbai for Mumbaikars or Maharashtra for Maharashtrians. These are considered the magic keys to dominance by Bal Thackeray and the Shiv Sena and, ironically, by Raj Thackeray and his Maharashtra Navnirman Sena as well. Ironic because the MNS, with its violent drive against north Indians in Maharashtra, pulled the carpet by half-a-dozen seats from under the Shiv Senas feet in the assembly elections last year. So, without a single positive policy to offer, the Shiv Sena has escalated its chauvinism, nurturing violent hatred among linguistic communities just in order to be top dog.        
	Anyone who speaks up against the blind narrowness of such an approach, its absurdity, its mindless violence, its unconstitutionality, is guilty of disloyalty to Maharashtra or Mumbai, be it Mukesh Ambani or Rahul Gandhi, Sachin Tendulkar or the chief minister who breaks his promise to give licences only to Marathi-speaking taxi drivers or even someone who says Bombay instead of Mumbai. The senior Mr Thackeray would claim his nationalist colours by dividing the nation and success by inciting conflict. What is really alarming is that some people respond to this manipulation of a crude, primal chord, succumbing to the politics of hatred.         
	But the most recent stupidities, directed against some of the biggest achievers from Maharashtra, may be a desperate clawing for space, and not just because of the MNS. The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh are both distancing themselves from their erstwhile ally. Stridently divisive politics is not convenient for them at the moment. Going to polls in Bihar soon, the BJP cannot be seen to side with an anti-Hindi heartland party, especially if it is to keep its partner, the Janata Dal (United), happy. But all political parties are guilty of directly or indirectly manipulating the sense of difference, whether regional, communal or linguistic, when it is expedient. As long as regional inequalities in standards of living, educational and employment opportunities remain unaddressed, regionalism will remain an instrument of mobilization for politicians. And with money and muscle still major driving forces in politics, politicians of the Thackerays kind can continue to make mischief.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Shutting down
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SHUTTING DOWN                                                    
	If it is not factories, banks or government offices, it can be hospitals and even the high court. Strikes and shutdowns can hit any workplace in West Bengal any time. For four days, junior doctors in all the major state-run hospitals in Calcutta stopped work. What their action did to patients already in the hospitals or waiting outside for treatment were of no concern to them. Locked out from their work for an even longer period were judges and lawyers of the Calcutta High Court by the employees strike. Together, the two strikes held large sections of ordinary people hostage to the sectional interests of the strikers. These agitators were no blue-collar workers demanding basic rights. They enjoy wages and privileges that are much better than those available to factory workers or farm labourers. But their economic or social status did not stop them from behaving in a most irresponsible manner. The junior doctors demands, especially for adequate security during work, are not without merit. But none of these demands, like those of the court employees for higher wages, justified the work stoppages. The sufferings that the strikes caused to patients admitted in the hospitals and to others denied treatment showed yet again how ugly the culture of strikes in Bengal can be.        
	However, the state governments response to the strikes seemed even more sickening. The doctors strike was withdrawn after the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had warned of stern action. He should have shown the same firmness right at the beginning of the strike. If doctors acted so irresponsibly, they could do so because of a near-total collapse of administration in the hospitals. And everyone knows that this anarchy in hospitals or other workplaces is the result of blatant political interference in the administrations work. Both in the hospitals and in the high court, the chief minister thus faced a situation that his own comrades have created over the years. The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) has used its cadre in all institutions in order to subvert the system. Activists of other political parties occasionally try to beat the CPI(M) in its own game. The result is an alarming erosion of administrative authority in Bengal. So deep-rooted is this culture of political blackmail that society has come to accept this as unchangeable. But such cynicism can only make things worse.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WOUNDS AND WORDS                                  Calling rape sexual assault does not heal the pain it inflicts, writes Adheesha Sarkar                          The Rape of Europa by Titian                                  
	Rape has never been easy to define, nor has it been easy to determine the precise damage it causes and the punishment the perpetrator deserves. This is especially true of Indian society. There have been several amendments to rape laws in India, several attempts to address the ever-increasing objections towards existing laws. Now, a new amendment has been proposed by the Union home ministry in the form of the criminal law (amendment) bill, 2010, a draft bill formulated by a special committee. The amendments proposed in the bill, if implemented, would bring radical changes to the way rape as a crime is treated by Indian law. On the other hand, one of the new amendments might even make the word rape obsolete and irrelevant, at least in the legal context.        
	The bill intends to amend Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code by replacing the word rape with the phrase sexual assault. The idea itself is quite unsettling. It throws up a number of questions, especially as the term, assault, has a broader scope and is less definitive. Perhaps in anticipation of confusion and debate on this issue, a copy of the draft bill was made available to the public on the ministrys website, and comments and suggestions were invited till May 15, 2010. The media, various law clubs, bloggers and several womens organizations have since reacted to the changes proposed in the bill with sharply polarized opinions on their merits and demerits. Quite predictably, many have misread the implications of redefining rape in the legal terminology.        
	Some sections of the media speculated whether this amendment would make the crime of rape gender neutral, a question which has also bothered some activists and womens organizations. And a number of bloggers were justifiably worried about what sexual assault would come to mean legally. Would it now make having fun by passing lewd remarks or pinching females to release sexual frustration a crime punishable on an equal footing with the forcible penetration of a womans vagina?         
	Notwithstanding what should have been and what could have been, in terms of the amendment currently proposed, the answer to both the questions is no. The amendment would neither make rape gender-neutral, nor would it take away the clause of penetration as an element of rape. What it proposes to do is to broaden the purview of the law to include the penetration of the vagina, the anus or urethra or mouth of any woman by a man using any part of his body; or any object manipulated by such man. The amendment would thus bring under the scope of the law other forms of abuse on women that had so far not been considered rape. As of now, rape is defined as vaginal penetration of a woman by a man. If the bill is made into law, forcing a woman to perform oral sex or using objects to penetrate her would also be seen as rape or sexual assault. Apart from this, the bill has also recommended raising the age of consent from 16 to 18 years, increasing the punishments for various forms of sexual assault (the minimum being raised to a jail term of seven years), and imposing harsher punishments for sexual assault by relatives, police officers or people in positions of trust and authority such as public servants.        
	Of course, the reforms suggested are not without loopholes. The age of consent is in itself a murky area. Now, with a law making penetration of a womans mouth by a man using any part of his body a form of sexual assault or rape, an 18-year-old boy passionately kissing a 16-year-old girl, even with her consent, could be seen as a rapist. In the context of inter-caste marriages of young couples, the new law could even provide the khap panchayats with a pretext to misuse the IPC. However, stricter punishments for sexual crimes committed by people in positions of power and authority, such as police officers, would no doubt be a welcome reform, especially in the light of the Ruchika Girhotra case.        
	Nevertheless, despite certain vaguenesses, the bill definitely attempts to view sexual crimes in a more comprehensive way. But what is truly puzzling is why this comprehensive approach would need to obliterate the word rape. Would calling the crime by a different name intensify its seriousness? Or would it rather dilute the gravity attached to the crime? If the aim is to be more specific and inclusive about the nature of the crime and its punishment, the same could have been done by retaining rape as a term but simply changing its definition in terms of the law. After all, a word has a history and a certain social connotation that would not really change overnight with an amendment that chooses to disregard the word completely.        
	In a report published in a newspaper on the pros and cons of the draft bill, a comment by the inspector-general of the crime branch of Kochi renders a very interesting angle to the logic of dropping the word rape altogether. The officer has said that the intention behind using the term sexual assault instead of rape is to make the description more acceptable to women. According to this officer, the term, rape, is associated with violence, an idea that women are generally not very comfortable with.              
	Notwithstanding whether this was indeed the reason for proposing to change the term in the legal dictionary, the comment points to a truth darker and uglier than the crime itself. It shows why being raped is just not a physically and psychologically agonizing experience for a woman in India, but also an atrocity that paralyzes her for life. For in our society, a victim of the worst kind of violence is supposed to be careful about the acceptability of the term describing it, hiding from the law and society the raw wounds that it leaves on her body and mind. As if calling violence by another name will reduce the pain it inflicts, and knowing that she has been sexually assaulted, and not raped, would give a humiliated and violated woman any comfort.

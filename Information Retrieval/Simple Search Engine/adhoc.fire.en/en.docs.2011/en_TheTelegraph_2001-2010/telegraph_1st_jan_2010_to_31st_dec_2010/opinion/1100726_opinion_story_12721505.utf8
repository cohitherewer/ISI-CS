	There is something strangely alluring about figures. The very fact that Muttiah Muralitharan dismissed 800 batsmen in Test cricket makes most persons immediately think of him as the greatest bowler cricket has ever seen. Figures make contexts irrelevant. Thus, people forget that many more Test matches are now played than, say, when Clarrie Grimmett  in between the two world wars bowling only against England and South Africa  secured more than 200 wickets. Now cricket is played throughout the year, with many more countries playing at the Test-match level. The use of superlatives to describe Mr Muralitharans achievements needs to be heavily qualified. It also needs to be underlined that there was always a question mark over his action. This opens up the possibility that some of his dismissals may have been unfairly obtained. There was a time when the definition of an unfair delivery in cricket was left to the discretion of the umpires on the field and what they saw with their naked eyes. Not satisfied with this, the makers of cricket laws, the Marylebone Cricket Club, decided to alter the relevant law to enable Mr Muralitharan to continue bowling within the limits of the law. The point is significant since this must be the only case of a law being emended to accommodate the action of one bowler.        
	This alteration of the law is an indicator of the state of cricket and the way the game is run. In all major sports  football, tennis, golf and rugger  the conditions of play and the enforcement of rules are being made more and more stringent. In cricket, in some instances, they are being made lax. One reason for this may be the attempt to retrieve the popularity of cricket, which has been dwindling over the years. Another reason could be the balance of politics within the International Cricket Council. It may not be a coincidence that the law was changed to accommodate a bowler from South Asia, the region where cricket remains most popular and which is the biggest source of revenue for the game. These factors need to be borne in mind while discussing Mr Muralitharans achievements only in terms of figures. His accomplishments might actually lie in a different direction. He probably transformed off-spin bowling. The off spinner of yore had a side-on delivery and imparted the spin with his fingers. Mr Muralitharan bowled from the wrist with a front-on position. This is no mean achievement.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE LARGER TRUTH                                  Malvika Singh                              
	To return from a neighbouring country and read the newspapers of the past four days is enough to make you ill. To read about Lalu Prasad swearing to pull down the United Progressive Alliance government and Prakash Karat committing to do the same, although for different reasons, was much like entering an auditorium to witness a tragic farce. Both gentlemen, politicians with a fast waning presence, declaiming in high voices, came across as desperate thespians in search of a screenplay. And what a sad day for democratic politics in India. Instead of demanding a long and serious meeting with the prime minister to work out a consensus on issues, they were indulging in the failed politics of the past decade. India has changed and the new Indian voters, rural and urban, are led by a set of aspirations that these two men have not even attempted to hear, let alone comprehend.        
	In sharp contrast to the recent horrific happenings in the Rajya Sabha, dignity and graciousness marked the behaviour of the ministers and bureaucrats of Bhutan even when they disagreed with one another. Despite the fact that Bhutan is an infant democracy, the members of parliament in that Himalayan kingdom are well-read and extremely well-informed. They approach every issue with requisite seriousness and commitment, and there is no acrimony in debate and discussion. They have an intelligence level that is truly salutary. It was embarrassing for me that the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha  which were rowdy and unacceptable in civilized society  had been seen by one and all in Bhutan.                
	Look forward        
	In South Asia, India may constitute the largest landmass, but Indians have effortlessly managed to reduce themselves to a caricature. In this volatile region, we have abdicated our rightful position, from where we could have been the catalyst for calming and uniting the area, to make the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation a combination of nations that could become a formidable power. Instead, we have, with our machinations, compelled our partner countries to respect us less and less with every passing moment.        
	In April, all the Saarc heads of State will gather for regional deliberations in Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan. They will be given a most memorable reception. Bhutans king and the many first-time elected parliamentarians will be impeccable hosts. This meeting, if carefully orchestrated bearing in mind the importance of each participating nation in the larger family of South Asia, could send a strong signal of cohesion to other alien powers operating in this part of the world. In fact, if Saarc means real business in the realm of realpolitik, it should invite Myanmar and Afghanistan into its circle and play a substantial role in the larger world.        
	Will the present Saarc countries be able to come to a consensus and create a common visa like the Schengen visa? Or will the same old predictable argument be used  that such a visa would result in misuse? Today, the existing laws are misused in so far as they are not enforced properly  which makes the outcome far worse than if there were freer movement. Interactions among people are also necessary to lessen the militancy and illegalities that happen across borders. Will Prime Minister Manmohan Singh lead the group and bring about real change, generate true trust and respect among all our South Asian neighbours?        
	There will be no real peace in the region if all the players do not play the game. The only way to isolate the manipulations of foreign players that are totally out of sync with the realities, aspirations and cultural truths of the area, is to forge a unity of purpose.

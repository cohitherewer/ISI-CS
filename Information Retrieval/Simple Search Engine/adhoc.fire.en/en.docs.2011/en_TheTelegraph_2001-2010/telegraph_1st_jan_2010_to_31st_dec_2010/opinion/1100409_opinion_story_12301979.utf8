	Dress down                  
	Sir  The minister for environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh, is not justified in describing convocation robes as medieval and barbaric (Drop the graduation gown..., April 3). Perhaps the minister, accustomed to air-conditioned comfort, lost his cool in the intense heat of Bhopal. The graduation ceremony is a significant event for most people, marking the end of student life. Whatever the weather, graduates will take a photograph of themselves in their gown, a picture that will adorn their walls for the rest of their lives.          
	The environment ministers recommendation for something more Indian seems to be rooted in the attempt to reject a colonial legacy. By the same logic, shirts and trousers should be shunned, as well as eating at a dining table and the use of knives and forks. Perhaps one should eat off banana leaves.The incident is reminiscent of Lalu Prasads attempt to introduce earthen pots and clay cups in the pantry cars of trains, and to provide passengers with neem sticks instead of toothbrushes. It is high time our ministers and members of parliament outgrew such gimmicks, and concentrated more on concrete measures to solve the real problems of the aam aadmi.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  At a convocation ceremony in Bhopal, Jairam Ramesh urged a more simple dress for such functions. To begin with, students convocation is a ceremony and not just another mundane occasion. A bit of pomp and splendour is necessarily a part of this landmark occasion in every students life. Secondly, the tradition of wearing the graduation gown may have been acquired from British universities, but it is not necessarily a colonial practice that has to be discarded. The gown is popular in universities all over the world, not just in Commonwealth countries. I have seen universities in Germany, Singapore, Japan and the United States of America following the same tradition. If the concept is acceptable globally, then I see no reason why it should be rejected in India. I graduated from Presidency College in the Seventies. Calcutta University could not even give us our graduation certificates for years after we completed our degree, let alone hold a graduation ceremony. So we have no special memories of a convocation to treasure. Ramesh may have been a bit hot under the collar on the convocation day. He needs to cool down, rather than try and change widely accepted traditions that harm nobody.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Difference of opinion          
	Sir  Swapan Dasguptas comments on Indian think tanks and the media in the article, Without balance (April 2), are not without justification. The penchant of these two institutions for distorting and magnifying trifles to serve a larger agenda is well known. This is exemplified in the recent furore over the alliance between the Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, and Amitabh Bachchan.           
	The controversy may have been exaggerated, but Modi cannot be absolved of the suspicion of being complicit in the pogrom against Muslims in Gujarat. Modi has been grilled twice by the Supreme Court-appointed special investigations team for extensive interrogation. There must have been substantial reasons behind the allegations of his involvement in the most heinous anti-Muslim riots of post-Independence India.           
	J.M. Lyngdoh, who was the chief election commissioner in 2002, had chastised the Modi administration and refused to hold elections in the wake of the riots. That Modi went on to win two consecutive assembly elections with an overwhelming majority does not negate the crude, fundamentalist nature of his ideology. Bachchans statement that Gujarat is far ahead of other states in terms of industry cannot validate Modis tenure in power. There is, however, nothing wrong in his statement. After all, Indian politics is marked by a plurality of opinion.          
	The Congress may well be accused of keeping silent on Modis misdemeanours in the intervening years and of using the charges against him now to gain political leverage in Gujarat. Bachchans attempt to distance himself from the Gandhi family may have also irked the Congress. But the Big B is at liberty to chart out his personal and political courses. The Congress leadership has been shortsighted in its public objections to the Modi-Bachchan nexus. As Dasgupta pertinently observes, the Bachchan episode will be used by the shrewd Modi to his own advantage. The so-called secular diatribe will be made to appear petty and spiteful.          
	If justice is to be done, the judiciary and the executive must perform their respective duties independently, without fear or favour. The politics of aggressive rhetoric and counter-rhetoric has plagued India for long enough. Till date, no party has been able to break away from this practice and ensure that the government functions along expected democratic lines.                    
	Yours faithfully,

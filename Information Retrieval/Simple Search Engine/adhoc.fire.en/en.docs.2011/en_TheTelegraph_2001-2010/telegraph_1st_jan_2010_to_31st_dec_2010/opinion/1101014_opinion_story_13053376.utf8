	Racist humour is usually obscene. And what one set of people finds funny is sometimes beyond the comprehension of another. So, when the anchor and viewers on a TV channel in New Zealand had a raucous moment at the expense of the Delhi chief minister and other Indians, it is expected that few outside that particular cultural orbit would be laughing. But think of the universal popularity of all kinds of offensive humour. Sardars, Jews, the physically, mentally or visually challenged  none is spared. Jokes, according to Sigmund Freud, are close to the unconscious, and isnt the unconscious supposed to be an amoral and heartless creature lurking in all human beings (including patriotic or politically correct Indians)? So, it does appear to be somewhat excessive when those questionable moments on TV were followed up with a solemn diplomatic ritual between the governments of the two countries concerned. The Indian ministry of external affairs summoned New Zealands high commissioner and issued him a dmarche, with similar moves made by the Indian high commissioner in New Zealand. The same sort of thing was done when Australian police officers were caught joking over footage of an accident in India. Of course, an occasionally brutal history of racism opens up behind the police officers comments in Australia. But again, the matter became much more formal, inflated and political when made part of diplomatic exchanges between the countries. Sheila Dikshit herself took a more intelligent stand, perhaps, by playing the episode down in public.        
	An undercurrent of dubious attitudes towards cultural difference has been running through the Commonwealth Games, bubbling up here and there in stray, unguarded comments made by a range of people, from sportspersons to organizers. Perhaps the very idea of the Commonwealth, especially when brought forward into the 21st century, underlines what is not held in common as much as what was once a shared yoke. But it is all sport now, and that has been the saving grace eventually. Postcolonial relish at seeing racism punished is understandable. But governments, ministries and embassies must also remember that the Indian democracy is now mature enough, and modern enough, not to take itself too seriously.

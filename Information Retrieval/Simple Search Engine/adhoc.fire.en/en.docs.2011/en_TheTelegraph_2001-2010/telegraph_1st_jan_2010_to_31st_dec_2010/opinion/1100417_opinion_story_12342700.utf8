The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The malaise runs deep
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE MALAISE RUNS DEEP                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Minefields                                        
	The killing of 74 CRPF jawans in Dantewada has shaken us out of our stupor: we were secure in the belief that all was well with the nation and we could indulge in happy day-dreaming. Now everything seems to have gone wrong in Dantewada; the chief minister of Chhattisgarh and his administrators have much to answer for. Thousands of villagers were receiving lethal weapons, being drilled like soldiers, and yet the police of the district were caught napping. Surely, they must have known what was going on. Then why did they allow unlicensed arms go unchecked? A vast tract of forest land had been converted into a minefield and yet no warning was issued to the CRPF that its personnel were walking into a death-trap.        
	I have little doubt that if the Central government really wanted to crush the Maoist rebellion, it could do so in the space of a few days by deploying its army and the Air Force. But that would be very unwise and would only bring us peace for a few years. The malaise has gone deep because we have allowed exploiters to deprive tribals who rely on forests for their livelihood. We must not let confrontations with their armed gangs to escalate into a mini civil war. After we have deprived them of their guns, we must talk to their leaders, restore their forest lands to them, and bring them into the mainstream of life. The word adivasi has to be made into an anachronism.                
	Enjoyable waste                
	Ever since Jyotsna Varma moved to Manila to take up her job with the Asian Development Bank, she has been besotted with the writings of Haruki Murakami. She told me about him when she was in Delhi for a couple of days. On her way back, she picked up a collection of his short stories and sent them to me. I was fascinated, but felt that they had very little story content in the conventional sense, but still managed to hold the readers attention. Last month, Jyotsna was back in Delhi for the release of the book by her father, Ram Varma  Before he was God: Ramayana, Reconsidered, Recreated. She was still bubbling with praise for Murakami. And once again, on her way back, she sent me a copy of Murakamis first novel, Norwegian Wood, published in 1987. The title did not seem to make any sense. I was half-way through the novel before I discovered that it was the name of a Beatles song.        
	Murakami started his working life setting up a jazz club in Tokyo which also sold cassettes of classical and modern Western music. The enormous success of Norwegian Wood pitchforked him into the world of literature as a first-novel celebrity. Then for reasons I can only guess, he fled Japan and stayed abroad for eight years before returning home; Jap fundoos could not stomach his portrayal of the Japanese youth.        
	As it happened, I spent a few months in Japan and visited many places Murakami writes about: Kyoto (where he was born in 1949), Tokyo, Nara, Kobe, Nagasaki and Hiroshima. I spent all my time with students. I found them very proper, ever polite and straight-laced. Murakamis students are hard-drinkers taking beer, whisky and sak by the gallon. They watch porn movies and have girlfriends eager to lose their virginity. Murakami describes their exploits in minute detail and with a lot of relish, omitting no form of sexual play. Compared to the novel, Kama Sutra reads like a childs primer. I confess I was totally engrossed by it. At the end, I was not sure if the week I had spent reading it had been worthwhile. I came to the conclusion that it had been an enjoyable waste of time.                
	Face it                 
	An armed hold-up man bursts into a bank in Ireland and forces the tellers to load a sack full of cash. On his way out of the door with the loot, one brave Irish customer grabs the hood and pulls it off, revealing the robbers face. The robber shoots the guy without hesitation. He then looks around the bank to see if anyone else has seen him. One of the tellers is looking straight at him and the robber shoots him as well. Everyone by now is very scared and looking at the door. Did anyone else see my face? asks the robber. There are a few moments of silence, then one elderly Irish gent tentatively raises his had and says, I think my wife caught a glimpse.                
	Very funny                
	In a hospital waiting room: Smoking helps you lose weight....One lung at a time!        
	Seen on a bulletin board: Success is relative. The more the success, the more the relatives.        
	When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading. My grandfather is 80 and still doesnt need glasses. He drinks straight out of the bottle.        
	You know your kids have grown up when: your daughter begins to put on lipstick or when your son starts to wipe it off.        
	Sign in a driving school: If your wife wants to learn to drive, dont stand in her way.

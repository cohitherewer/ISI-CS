	Unfair tradition                  
	Sir  Usually a peaceful town, Burdwan is known to be a stronghold of the Left. Recently, it witnessed a spate of clashes between the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Trinamul Congress, as a result of which the town wore a deserted look for nearly two days (Street clash in Burdwan, Oct 28). Even stray dogs were not at sight, and the air was thick with the smell of gunpowder. I was a college student during the change of guard at Writers Buildings in 1977, but I do not remember seeing such large- scale violence. It seems that the political situation in Burdwan  Nirupam Sen represents this assembly seat  is changing as supporters of the Left switch their allegiance to the Trinamul Congress.           
	Allegations of nepotism in the recruitment of Group-D staff in Burdwan University triggered the clashes. The situation in the campus would not have gone out of control had the police intervened on time. The police stood and watched even as miscreants vandalized the university post office. After a couple of hours, a large posse of policemen arrived, forcing the violent mob to disperse. Meanwhile, the violence had spread to the railway station, and very soon the whole town resembled a battlefield as supporters of the CPI(M) and TMC hurled bombs at one another. The armed attackers were seen running with their faces covered, a large number of buses at Tinkonia bus stand were damaged and two- wheelers set on fire. If the police force and the administration remain politicized, such a situation may arise once again.           
	The widespread violence raises pertinent questions about the recruitment policy of Burdwan University, which happens to be a big employer in this town. Why can autonomous bodies not maintain transparency while recruiting employees? Before 1977, when Siddhartha Shankar Roy was the chief minister, a huge employment drive had been undertaken for the university, electricity board and municipality, and only party loyalists had been given jobs. The same tradition continues. Vacant positions are filled either by the wards of present employees or by Left supporters. Claims of unfair recruitment of university staff played a major role in the recent violence.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Diamonds and rust          
	Sir  The recent suicide by a model confirms the fact that more than any other profession, modelling produces the largest number of depressed people (City model hangs herself in flat, Oct 30). In modelling, one can climb the ladder of success quickly, but success is short-lived. Although models can become famous, the threats of ageing and intense competition prove to be detrimental to their mental peace. Dieting, too, results in complication. In the absence of proper nourishment, models health start to fail. Modelling as a career promises luxury and wealth. But it also conceals something that is sordid and disconcerting. Choosing unconventional careers sounds wonderful, but the consequences can be dire at times. As long as the young generation remains attracted to the glamour associated with modelling, reports of suicides will continue to appear in television channels and newspapers. Women professionals can become easy victims, and modelling is no exception. It seems that modelling teaches the art of surrendering instead of facing harsh realities.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Hopes dashed          
	Sir  Citizens of Siliguri had voted in favour of the Congress and the TMC in the municipal elections in the hope that the civic board under the two parties will work towards offering better services. But things have not improved even after one year. The two parties do not have confidence in or respect for each other. Given the situation, what can the people of Siliguri expect from the board members? The authorities should respect the peoples verdict and ensure that the civic board provides better services in the near future.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranabir Talukdar, Siliguri

                
	Early goodbye          
	Sir  Elena Dementievas retirement is bound to leave womens tennis bereft of one of its most hard- working and adorable players (Elena bids tearful adieu, Oct 30). Dementieva was one of the toughest players to beat. The Olympic gold medallist had been an inspiration for many players. Her decision to quit is surprising as she had an outstanding season last year. Her fighting spirit and talent turned her into an idol for her fans.           
	Yours faithfully,

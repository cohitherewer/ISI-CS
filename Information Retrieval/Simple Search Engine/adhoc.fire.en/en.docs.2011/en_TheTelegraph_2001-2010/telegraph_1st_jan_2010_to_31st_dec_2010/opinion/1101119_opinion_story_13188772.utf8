The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Beware of the Curse
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BEWARE OF THE CURSE                                  BONAFIDE: Malvika Singh                              
	The tragedy of the fast- extinction of the tiger, under the aegis of various departments of the Central and state governments, has reached unimaginable proportions, much like all else in this country, because of faulty, failed and inappropriate policies created and operated by little babus. These are opportunistic men who know little and whose minds are limited and closed, but who are mandated by the government to manage a corrupt and corroded delivery system. They firmly believe that private entrepreneurs and experts have vested interests and therefore need to be listened to but not heard. They are guilty of initiating and condoning the wholesale murder of our national animal as they play out their absurd and mindless policies. It is these men in charge, both at the Project Tiger office in New Delhi and in the ministry of environment and forests in Jaipur, who need to be relocated with immediate effect for presiding over the brutal, mindless and careless killing of Durgas vahan. The curse of the Devi will be on them.        
	Ranthambhore was a national treasure. Forest officers with limited knowledge  something far more dangerous than no knowledge at all  initiated a criminal relocation plan to populate Sariska, which had become a vast hunting ground for poachers because of unacceptable management techniques and malgovernance. The reasons to relocate this animal were totally wrong. The new home was a killing field where the reform of a broken-down, corrupt system had not begun, let alone been completed, to handle this experiment. Some of us cried hoarse but our appeals fell on deaf ears. Officials smirked every time we revolted against their madness, particularly in Delhi. Lies were communicated to political bosses, some of whom did not want to enter the fray. The babu running Project Tiger went about doing all that was wrong and destructive. He needs to be made accountable. These people must be put to pasture before they do more damage.                 
	Crazy scheme        
	A healthy, gorgeous male tiger, relocated from Ranthambhore to Sariska, has been poisoned. The forest department has put out all kinds of false stories, but the truth is that the animal was poisoned, he was not responding to signals that were being sent to his collar, and the complacent, criminal authorities paid no heed. The head of the Rajasthan forest department must be dismissed for this killing just as drivers are arrested for hit-and-run cases or builders for faulty buildings. Political protection of blatant mismanagement is no longer acceptable. We were right and will be right over and over again till the government is willing to change gear.        
	Sadly, the same officer heading Project Tiger in Delhi who has violated his oath of office by not protecting and conserving the area under his jurisdiction has another crazy scheme up his sleeves. He now wants to close the core areas to tourism  which is his flippant idea of protection. Why not start by cordoning off the Taj Mahal? Why not cover the Eiffel Tower in a shroud with naphthalene balls? Start with the correction of rules, norms and delivery systems, and thereafter address issues of relocation and suchlike, using international expertise, not the average and limited intelligence of the inexperienced and backward Indian babu.         
	India cannot respect its bureaucracy because we see how that single institution has destroyed our ethics and values, our civil society and cultural conglomerate  the natural environment, the manmade habitats and the great skills of this subcontinent  all of which have been shunned and abused by the babu. The curse of the devi will have to be averted by sacrificing those who are at the helm of tiger conservation at present.

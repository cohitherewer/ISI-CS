	Why isnt India better at football? I asked this question of a distinguished Indian historian recently. Physique, he said. Were not strong enough.        
	But youre very good at cricket.        
	Cricket is different. It depends much more on technique. Good wrists, hand and eye co-ordination, that kind of thing.        
	I was about to mention hockey  all those Olympic golds, so long ago  when I remembered a few days that Id once spent with the Eastern Railways football side and how their coach was always looking for eggs, and fitting the price of eggs into his budget. We need eggs, hed say. The more eggs the better. Meat is too dear and of course some of the team wont eat it. So we need eggs for protein, to build up the players strength.        
	I think this conversation took place inside an Eastern Railways building somewhere near Dalhousie Square, though not the building that contained the Eastern Railways public relations office, which was in Old Court Street and where the staff sometimes invited me to share a regular lunch of rasgullas and toast  not a diet to feed footballers or perhaps anyone with a long-term interest in his health. The year was 1983 and I think the month was August  the late monsoon at any rate, because I watched Eastern Railways play Mohun Bagan under a steady drizzle on the Maidan. I sat on the bench with the coach, and it was my umbrella that protected both of us when the supporters of Mohun Bagan started to throw their empty kulhars in our direction. What had prompted their anger? Perhaps an Eastern Railways player had fouled an opponent or scored a goal. The bench could be the only target; Eastern Railways had no supporters to aim at. As the coach said, Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting were the only clubs in Calcutta that had a real following; the purpose of other clubs was to play them and so decide which of the three would win the league.         
	I recognized a familiar situation, as anyone from Scotland would. Growing up in that country, I followed the team from my local town, Dunfermline. Every city and every sizeable town in Scotland had a professional football side. Glasgow had five while other cities and towns could provide two each. Some had lovely names (Heart of Midlothian, Queen of the South) that disguised their location, while others came from places so obscure (Stenhousemuir, Brechin) that only a keen geographer could find them on the map. But halfway through almost every football season, the question of who would lift the title came down to the formula either/or. Either it would be Rangers or it would be Celtic.        
	I write in the past tense, but in fact Rangers and Celtic are even more dominant now than they were in the 1960s. These two Glasgow teams have the largest stadiums, crowds three or four times bigger than their nearest rivals, and much more money to spend on players wages. They owe their success to a long and intense rivalry that has its roots in Victorian Scotland, when Glasgow boasted that it was the second city of the Empire and its industrial working class could be divided along sectarian lines, between Irish Catholic immigrants (Celtic) and native Scots and Ulster Protestant immigrants (Rangers). Scotland, like the rest of Britain, is now a post-religious country and it would be surprising if more than a small percentage of the Celtic crowd regularly attended Mass, or an even smaller percentage of the Rangers crowd heard a sermon on a Sunday. You might even argue that the two teams persist as the last badges of ethnic and religious identities that began to wither when consumerism replaced heavy industry as a way of life. Where are the shipyards and the factories now, and the Protestant foremen denying jobs to Catholics, and the Protestant skilled worker fearing for his wage rates with the influx of cheaper workers from Ireland?         
	Scottish football was born in that time as the countrys chief recreation. England may have invented the rules, but Scotland believed that it had perfected the dribbling and passing game. In population, England was ten times the size, but when the two countries played each other, England was regularly beaten. A historic moment  the day of the Wembley Wizards  came in 1928 when the Scottish team travelled south to Wembley and beat England 5-0. The Scottish forward line comprised five players not one of whom was more than 5ft 7in tall. The English defenders were much bigger and stronger, but Scotland ran rings around them.        
	So, can it really be that physique is the reason for Indias poor record at football? Think of those little Scotsmen jinking their way towards the English goalmouth. Think of where that kind of professional footballer typically came from  mining villages, or the cramped and insanitary tenements of Glasgow, where inadequate diet caused rickets, which stunted growth in children and deformed their bones. Think of what Scottish footballers then ate and drank: dripping mutton pies and sweet chocolate bars, fat and sugar, a pint of beer before kick-off, a cigarette at half-time. The wonder is that Scotland produced any footballers at all, let alone a few that in the first six or seven decades of the last century were among the best in the world.         
	On this evidence, we need a different answer to account for Indias lack of success. Mine is that in India football simply doesnt matter enough. It has never gripped the national imagination, despite Mohun Bagan beating the East Yorkshire Regiment in 1911 and finding a place in the national folklore. Fifty and more years ago in Scotland, boys from the poorest families would spend hours kicking an old tennis ball around any quiet street or patch of waste ground. They had footballing heroes and pretended to be them. New pastimes and habits, mainly indoors, have replaced this enthusiasm, and today you hardly ever see the once-familiar sight of jackets and jerseys piled to form substitute goalposts and a dozen boys scampering after a rubber ball. Consequently, Scotland breeds far fewer good footballers. To find similar sights these days, you need to travel to South America  or to India, where stumps have been painted on the walls of the meanest slums and any old piece of wood will serve as a bat. A different obsession; football in India will probably never escape from its shade. Its more than a matter of muscles and eggs.               
	************              
	Now a slightly different question: why isnt England better at football? In the days since England got knocked out of the World Cup, many column inches and broadcast hours have been devoted to perplexed inquiry. England hired a celebrated Italian coach on a salary of 6 million a year; the coach, Fabio Capello, recruited an expensive string of technical and psychological assistants (all Italian); England believed it had a golden generation of players whose skills had been honed (and bank balances massively enriched) by the Premiership, which is hailed as the most exciting and most watched soccer league in the world. And yet England struggled against lowly Slovenia, Algeria and the USA, and finally went out to a humiliating 4-1 defeat by a German team that exposed England as too old, too tired and too incompetent. No matter that I come from Scotland where hatred of the old footballing enemy is so extreme that this years favourite World Cup t-shirt says Anybody But England: the English performance could provoke only pity even in the most twisted Scottish heart.              
	Some of us had seen this coming for a while. Satellite TV has given English football enormous global audiences (so that the rickshaw-driver in Muzaffarpur knows the Arsenal-Liverpool result) and with those audiences has come stupendous revenue from rights and advertising. This has been wholly bad for the development of English football, in the sense of football played by Englishmen. In Germany, footballs profits tend to head in the direction of training young German footballers. In England, the money goes on players wages that have been inflated to secure stars or potential stars from any part of world. The result is that only 38 per cent of Premiership players are actually qualified by nationality to play for England. It is easier, after all, to buy a decent player off-the-shelf in Nigeria or Brazil than to invest in academies and technical training that in five or ten years time could produce players who are just as good. A debt-laden football club wants instant gratification, and several of them, including Manchester United, carry heavy debts due to the leveraged buy-outs of their American owners.         
	Short-termism, a particularly British component of late capitalism, is ruining English football just as it once ruined Scottish shipyards. In terms of national stereotypes, the England-Germany result could be seen as fitting. Germany invests and produces, while England buys and consumes. And then there arrives the day of reckoning

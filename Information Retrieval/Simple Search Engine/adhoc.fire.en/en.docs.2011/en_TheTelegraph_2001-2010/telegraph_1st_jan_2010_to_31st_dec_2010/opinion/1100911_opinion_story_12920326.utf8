	India has given birth to so many reformers of organized religion that one wonders if it is a natural cycle: each of them shows common people the simple but neglected path to a personal faith, but they deify him into a divine status he never wanted, establishing an institution, and the circle begins all over again. Two Bengali plays make the point that their protagonists actually had very pragmatic approaches to individual enlightenment, before their followers appropriated them as idols of worship rather than models of behaviour.        
	Bohurupees Chaitanya, written by Alakh Mukhopadhyay, tracks the mystics iconoclastic quest for God, whom he finally identifies as existing within everybody; therefore he teaches love and respect for all humanity. But his disciples transform him into a deity, which Bohurupee regards as the real tragedy. This sociocultural reading consciously contrasts with such earlier Chaitanya drama in the devotional genre as Girish Ghoshs Chaitanya Lila or Aparesh Mukhopadhyays Sri Gauranga. Where they stressed episodes of bhakti rasa (the regeneration of Jagai and Madhai in the former, or Chapal Gopal in the latter), this play selects less spiritual incidents, like anti-Brahmanical protest, Chaitanyas intellectual rigour, and the distaff tension at home.        
	Consequently, the effect is more cerebral than emotional. So, as Chaitanya (picture), Gautam Chakrabarti cannot possibly hope for the rousing response his predecessors got, though one must say he sings well, as does the entire group. Under Tarapada Mukhopadhyays direction, Bohurupees high standard of acting, even for secondary roles, remains untarnished. I particularly liked the conservative Brahmans (Sudhin Mukhopadhyay and Subhashchandra Bhattacharya) appalled by the winds of change. Chaitanyas mother and wife, however, deserved more space.        
	In Kathakritis Sraman, Nirup Mitra has dramatized Hesses Siddhartha. Here the Buddha looms in the background, preaching equality, humanism and compassion, to the extent that belief in god is unnecessary. Inspired, Hesses fictional hero renounces everything to become a mendicant Sramana seeking the truth, realizing that everyone must find his own truth for himself, like the Buddha did. Mitra more or less faithfully adopts Hesses plot of Siddharthas subsequent encounters, until he learns from a humble ferryman that life goes on forever like the river, for nothing gets lost, the water flowing to the sea returning to the river in the form of rain.        
	Sanjib Ray directs his cast unevenly. While Murari Mukhopadhyay expresses Siddharthas determination and confusion, and Gautam Sadhukhan the ferrymans ancient wisdom, Amarnath Upadhyay cannot convince as the Buddha (simply because any such attempt automatically falls short of expectations) and Dipanwita Sarkar does not have the presence required of the courtesan, Kamala. Still, the conclusion moves the viewers, as Siddhartha takes over the ferrymans job.

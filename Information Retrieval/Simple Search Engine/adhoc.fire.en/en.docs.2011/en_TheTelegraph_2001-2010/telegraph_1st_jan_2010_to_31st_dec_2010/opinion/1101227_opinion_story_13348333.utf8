	Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. Theodore Roosevelt, two-term president of the United States of America, said that, and the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, quoted him in a manifesto he wrote four years ago, adding, The more secretive or unjust an organisation is, the more leaks induce fear and paranoia in its leadership.... By that criterion, how is the US government doing after a year that saw Pentagon and the state department documents published by WikiLeaks in the tens of thousands?         
	In truth, none of the secrets that Assange has revealed is all that momentous. Defence secretary Robert Gates was right when he said: Is this embarrassing? Yes. Is it awkward? Yes. Consequences for US foreign policy? I think fairly modest. Yet, some of his cabinet colleagues are on the verge of the hysterical. The secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, declared, This disclosure is not just an attack on America  its an attack on the international community....        
	Some parts of the US government seem quite relaxed about Assanges actions, while other parts seem determined to put him in prison. We are talking about one of the most serious violations of the Espionage Act in our history, said attorney general Eric Holder. To the extent that we can find anybody who was involved in the breaking of American law...they will be held responsible. How can someone who isnt an American citizen, and wasnt in the US, have broken an American law? No way, technically, but the US might still be able to get a close ally like Britain to hand him over if it could argue that Assange was actively spying on it.                
	Domestic pressure        
	That will be hard, since he almost certainly wasnt. He had good legal advice when he set up the dead letter box where the leaks are collected, and it is designed not to reveal the sources of the leaks even to WikiLeaks itself. Indeed, Assange says that he never heard the name of the person whom the US accuses of being the leaker  the 23-year-old army-man, Bradley Manning, until he read it in the newspapers.        
	The US cannot make a case for espionage against Assange unless it can plausibly claim that he helped Manning steal the documents. Given that it probably isnt true, it can only do that by forcing Manning to say that it is true. That may not be impossible, because he has been held in solitary confinement. He is entirely alone 23 hours out of 24, and even his hour of exercise takes place in an empty room where he walks figures-of-eight. Once Manning is a pathetic wreck, they will offer him a plea bargain: a much reduced sentence for his own actions if he will also incriminate Assange. Then the US could lay a charge against Assange that might result in his extradition  although that is far from guaranteed, since nowhere do political crimes lead to automatic extradition. But does the US government really want to go all the way down this road?         
	The usual suspects out in the backwoods are howling for blood, so domestic politics demands that the administration make a great show of outrage and vengefulness. On the other hand, the grown-ups in the government know that the way to get through the WikiLeaks drama with the least damage internationally is just to ignore it.        
	That is why vice-president Joe Biden could say, I dont think theres any substantive damage from the WikiLeaks episode  then on NBC the following day accuse Assange of being a hi-tech terrorist. Its called talking out of both sides of your mouth, which is what politicians have to do a lot of the time. Which side should we believe? Obamas people probably dont know that themselves yet. Domestic politics will decide.

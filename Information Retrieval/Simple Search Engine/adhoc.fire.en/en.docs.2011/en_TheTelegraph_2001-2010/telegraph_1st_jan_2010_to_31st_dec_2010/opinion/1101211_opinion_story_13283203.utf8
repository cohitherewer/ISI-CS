The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When love goes wrong
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHEN LOVE GOES WRONG                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	After a long gap of six years, Feroz Khan returned to Calcutta, with Moving Platforms adaptation of Donald Marguliess Pulitzer Prize-winner of 2000, Dinner with Friends (picture). The hall sold out days in advance  a surprise for an English play, perhaps caused by anticipations of salacious content (the subtitle read 4 Friends, 2 Marriages, 1 Divorce) and the presence of a filmstar, Perizaad Zorabian Irani, in the cast.        
	Even though Dinner does not equal its 2001 Pulitzer successor, David Auburns Proof, American audiences took to it instantaneously. The baby boomer-flower power generation (to which Margulies belongs), marrying in the 1970s and 1980s, began to witness splits and divorces in the 1990s that they had not expected. After all, how could those who freed love possibly go wrong in love? By presenting two couples, one of which believes in commitment, and the other whose relationship seems doomed from the start, Margulies examines what makes a contemporary marriage tick or implode. Urban Indians can relate to the situation and dialogue too, for similar scenes play out in their lives. Khan Indianizes the script to make it even more accessible, though Marguliess feel-good ending for all evokes some incredulity.        
	The four friends essayed easy, natural performances under Khans direction. I preferred the actors who grew: Tisca Chopra from the shattered wife to a woman confidently entering her second marriage, and Joy Sengupta from an apparently laidback husband (not hers) to a deeply thoughtful man fully aware of marital complexities. Irani, as his wife, was basically spontaneous and emotional right through. Vinay Jain, the adulterer, argued his case convincingly, while his incensed, overlapping, cut-and-thrust exchanges with Chopra in their bedroom proved to be the dramatic high point. The hackneyed romantic music marked the low.        
	Khan also had a hand in the tenth Odeon Festival, bringing back Anupam Khers self-indulgent Kuchh Bhi Ho Sakta Hai, which I had panned in 2004, and producing Platforms one-man show Out of Bounds, by the South African Rajesh Gopie. The latter gave a touching first-hand depiction of an Indian-origin joint familys cramped but lively household in the apartheid days, though segregation itself reared its ugly head on stage rarely. Gopie enacted 28 varied roles, men and women, young and old, but compared to the virtuosic other soloists Calcuttans have seen, he needs more experience to differentiate characters fully  as his play wore on, he began to repeat some of his gestures and expressions in the later parts. Still, a novel production.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Ugly truth
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UGLY TRUTH                                                                  
	As I proceeded towards the Wipro flyover from Chingrighata, I thought I had entered Wonderland. Like the world Alice discovered after sliding through a rabbit hole, this, too, was peculiar: a wide, snaking stretch where logic had been turned on its head. First I saw a snail-like creature on one side of the road. Huge chessboard figures  pawns and knights  came next, followed by what looked like a Rubiks Cube. Finally, on seeing camels and sand dunes made of fibre reinforced plastic, I craned my neck to check whether the Great Pyramid of Giza loomed ahead. Alas, I was greeted by sari-clad, fair-skinned Rajasthani beauties carrying pots on their heads. Worse, they werent even real.        
	The snail and cube, knights and elephants, camels and village belles are part of a beautification drive being carried out by the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which, in turn, is being partnered by Encon and Selvel. Enquiries revealed that the FRP models had cost around Rs 9 lakh. The idea, however incongruous, was to add to the beauty of the pot-holed stretch (there is some kind of construction and drainage work going on, supervised by the KMRC) with a dash of regional flavour. More local themes, with Bengal dominating the core, would be added once KMRC finally figures out what it is after. Does that mean less of camels and more of women with dusky skin and beautiful tresses?        
	One might not agree with the visual aesthetic, but what can be appreciated is the transparent nature of such public-private initiatives. One phone call is all that it takes to get eager officials share frightening ideas regarding beautification. On the other hand, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is strangely elusive when it comes to sharing its views. There is very little information on its official website. But that has not perturbed the citizens who seem to be content with what is being passed around as beauty: the bust of Kishore Kumar, covered in bird-droppings, gnashing its teeth near Tollygunge, or a mural depicting Mother Teresa wearing what looks to be Hush Puppies at the Rashbehari crossing. Even the indifferent Biman Bose was recently moved by the plight of Bengals (and Indias) famous sons and daughters in stone. But the mayor has no time, busy as he is dousing flames.        
	The idea that a citys intangible resources  beauty and aesthetics  are as important as its roads, buildings and water-supply seems to have eluded most Calcuttans. They are equally oblivious to the fact that a public-private partnership in a beautification project should accord citizens their rightful place as decision-makers. And what about conserving the few remaining things that are truly beautiful: old, ornate buildings, the grey river as well as the parks and promenades littered with refuse? Why do we not hear of really inclusive public-private partnerships when it comes to resurrecting Calcuttas rich architectural legacy?        
	In fairy tales, ugly people are often transformed into things of beauty. But Calcuttas romance with fairytales is long over. Not even the touch of a fairy can make those plastic women near Sector V beautiful.                          UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

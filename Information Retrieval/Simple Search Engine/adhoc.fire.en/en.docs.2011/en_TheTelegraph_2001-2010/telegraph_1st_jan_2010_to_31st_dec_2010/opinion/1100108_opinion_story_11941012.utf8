	When darkness falls              
	Kabul Disco (HarperCollins, Rs 325) by Nicolas Wild is the first in a series of graphic reportage of life in war-torn Afghanistan. In 2005, a French writer, also called Nicolas Wild, desperate for a job and a place to live in, finds both in Kabul. His employer is the communication agency, Zendagui Media, which is working on a comic book to explain the Afghan constitution to children. On a freezing winter night, Wild lands in Kabul, and so starts his love-and-hate relationship with the land left crippled by the wars. Wilds next project for Zendagui involves working on a recruitment campaign for the Afghan army. Tortured by scruples, Wild decides to resign but it seems that Kabul, if not Zendagui, would not let him go so easily. Sharp, funny, and insightful, this a brilliant account of Afghanistan as seen through the eyes of a Western expat. At the end of the book, Wild provides photographs of his travels and sample pages of the comic book he worked on. These lend credibility to his reportage.                                 
	A Dozen Circles (Napl, Rs 225) by Shankar Sen consists of 12 short stories dealing with myriad human emotions  love, lust, hope, despair  that lend colour to life. The autobiographical voice of the author seems to merge with the first-person narrative voice of the stories. Indeed, Sen says in the Foreword that quite a few characters and incidents in [the collection] relate to real people and actual happenings with changed names to avoid recognition. The authors experiences in his travels to various parts of the world provide the content of such stories as An affair in Paris, or An afternoon in Athens. Poignant, lyrical, and suffused with the warmth of human feelings, these stories would be the perfect companion on a chilly winter afternoon.                         
	Just after Sunset (Hodder, Rs 295) by Stephen King would disappointment most fans of King, since the short stories that make up this collection are anything but scary. The opening story, Willa, about a young couple who, after getting over the initial shock of finding themselves dead, happily haunt a pub, fails to horrify by being too predictable. If animals could voice their objections to the way humans characterize them, then The Cat from Hell would probably have been banned. In this story about a devilish cat, we are told that Cats like to get babies and old people when theyre asleep. And steal their breath. For those desperate to get spooked, it would be better to watch some Ramsay Brothers films than spend time on this book.

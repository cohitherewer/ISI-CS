The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When songs speak for themselves
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHEN SONGS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES                                  MUSIC: Sharmila Basu Thakur                                                  
	The simple magnetism of baul, bhatiyali and kirtan is the essence of the songs of Atulprasad, Dwijendralal and Rajanikanta. Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre presented Tridhara, the songs of these three great poets and composers at Bharatiyam on June 28. The artist of the evening was Nupurchhanda Ghosh. A protg of Krishna Chattopadhyay, Ghosh has been playing a significant role in bringing the audiences interest back to the early-20th-century compositions of Dwijendralal Roy, Atulprasad Sen and Rajanikanta Sen.        
	The audience of the evening had the pleasure of immersing itself in the magical charm of this style of singing. The evening began with a Sanskrit stotram followed by a Rajanikanta song, Tabo charano nimne, which set the mood for the evening. While singing D.L. Roys Ma patitodharini Gange, Ghosh brought out the inner feeling of the song through her dramatic Ogo ma expression. The first four songs rendered by Ghosh along with her students were marked by adequate learning and ample rehearsals.        
	Next came Ghoshs solo recital, where she presented 10 songs of varying mood and style. It was a well-thought-out selection. The artists power to induce the drama within found a marvellous treatment in Aji nutan ratane (D.L. Roy). Her excellent tonal quality made her recital memorable. She beautifully embellished the song, Amar parano kotha jaye (Atulprasad), with restrained emotion and gentle variations. The best part of the programme was that Ghosh abstained from verbal elaboration and let the songs speak for themselves. The artist was accompanied by Dipankar Acharya (tabla), Rana Dutta (keyboard) and Pankaj Das (percussion).              
	Rabindranath Tagore painted on a large canvas where words, tune, rhythm and colours mingled. It is a creative minds vast land of expression, full of different hues and shades, emotions and expressions. This was the central theme of Rang-Rekha-Shabda-Sur, a programme organized by the Institute of Allergic and Immunologic Skin Diseases at Birla Academy on May 29. Conceived by Dr Sanjay Ghosh, the programme commenced with Ratri ese jethhaye meshe by Manoj Murali Nayar, whose tuneful singing brought out the play of light and shade convincingly.         
	Kamalini Mukherjee has established a style of her own. She developed a depth of expression that was suited to the pensive mood of Chhaya ghanaichhe bane bane. Suchhanda Ghosh did a commendable job with Rang lagale bane bane. Among the duets, Megher kole kole jaye re chole by Manoj and Kamalini was spontaneous and jovial. Sanjay Ghosh and Srabani Ghosh did the narration sincerely. The artists of the evening were accompanied by Anjan Basu (esraj), Subrata Mukherjee (keyboard) and Partho Mukherjee (tabla).

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BLIND SPOT                                                    
	The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, may well have made an understatement in Parliament when he described the situation in Kashmir as grave. The valley seems to be ploughing new depths of low with as many as 15 deaths in a little over two days and the spread of violence to fresh areas. It must be painfully evident to the state administration that the summoning of the army had coincided with the ebb in the previous spate of violence. Having shown its hand already, the Omar Abdullah administration seems to be in a curious fix when faced with the resurgence of violence in a matter of ten days. Not unexpectedly, the chief minister, in his meeting with members of the cabinet committee on security on Monday, could only press, and hope, for an augmentation in troop numbers to cope with the present crisis. To him, and to many of his backers at the Centre, the only way to tide over the immediate problem is a greater show of force. Mr Abdullah has reportedly ordered the state police to act accordingly and is hoping that the addition of troops will see him through this bad spot and give him enough respite to start the political process. Similar thinking had prompted the request for army presence, but if that could not guarantee a suitable interval to rekindle dialogue, Mr Abdullah may be said to be hoping for too much this time as well.        
	What is needed, perhaps, is a fundamental change in the way the violence that has gripped Kashmir is perceived. Since the time the current phase of protests started, Mr Abdullah has scarcely changed his outlook, blaming first anti-nationals and then anti-socials for the bloodshed. Much of this attitude is responsible for the state administrations consistent failure to deal with the violence on the street that calls for a lot more sensitivity than the state police and the paramilitary have been showing. The latter, of course, are bearing the brunt of the cumulative hatred that has built up owing to the failure of the political process in Kashmir. Instead of waiting for this hatred to die down and for Kashmir to return to normalcy, it is imperative that dialogue, be it internal or external, be carried out simultaneously. It is too important a matter to be kept on the backburner, and too critical for the people of the state to be picked up on the initiative of the Centre alone.

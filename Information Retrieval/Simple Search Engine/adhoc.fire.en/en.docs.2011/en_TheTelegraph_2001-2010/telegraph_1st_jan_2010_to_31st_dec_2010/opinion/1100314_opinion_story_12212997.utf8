	If marriages are made in heaven, human beings certainly do not know about it. This would seem to be the message conveyed by the 20-year-old bride from a village in Burdwan when she walked out of the wedding venue rubbing the fresh vermilion off her forehead. What put her off was the behaviour of the grooms father, who was demanding that he be given that bit of the dowry the brides father had left unpaid. The story was an old one, and the grooms father had probably expected the old ending. The brides father was pleading with the grooms party that he would pay the remaining Rs 15,000 as soon as possible. The visitors had a wonderful time insulting the brides family and causing an uproar. But, unnoticed, the story had changed. Walking away from the wedding seat had always been the grooms prerogative; the bride seized it and rejected the marriage. It is not absolutely necessary to marry, she also added.        
	There is reason to see this as an augury of change. The girl had sat her Madhyamik; she was educated and confident. She must have also known that dowry is illegal. She addressed the groom directly, saying that she would not go to a house where she might be killed. As important was the support she received from her neighbours. The villagers incarcerated the groom and a couple of his friends with the demand that the grooms father return the dowry he had already taken. By rubbing the vermilion off her forehead, the girl annihilated centuries of superstition masquerading as divine sanction. It was she who decided that heaven had not fixed her marriage with this particular man.        
	Change is difficult to detect in an environment of acute oppression and widespread criminality. But it is heartening to recall that it is not just schooling that gives courage; intelligence, strength of character, maturity gained through unchildlike experience can turn stories around too. Last June, 14-year-old Padma Ruidas, working as domestic help in a village in Bankura, rubbed off the vermilion placed on her forehead when the police arrived at the wedding venue a little too late to prevent the ritual. Vermilion does not make a marriage, she said. She had secretly requested her neighbours to get the police when her parents tried to get her married in spite of her objections. For the last two years, underage girls have been rebelling against marriage, and being supported by neighbours, teachers and friends. Sometimes they have a school behind them, as students from the national child labour project schools in Purulia do. But often there are no specific promises of support. Yet little girls are beginning, however infrequently, to fight for their education and independence. With supportive institutions on their way to adulthood, the old story may start changing even more rapidly. And there will be no need to fight over reservations for women in Parliament.

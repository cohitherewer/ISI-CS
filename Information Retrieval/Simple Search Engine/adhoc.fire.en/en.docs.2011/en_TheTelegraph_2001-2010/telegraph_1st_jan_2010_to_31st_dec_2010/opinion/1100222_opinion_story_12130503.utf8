	In cold blood                  
	Sir The recent attack in Shilda, which killed 24 jawans of the Eastern Frontier Rifles, reinforces the belief that launching an offensive against the Maoists may not be the best way to curb internal insurgency (Maoists massacre cops, Feb 16).           
	Maoism, which stems from the conviction among backward sections of society that they have been denied social and economic empowerment, has manifested itself in violence. No matter how large armed forces are deployed by the State, this widely held belief cannot be wiped out. Operation Green Hunt will result in more bloody battles. Only days earlier, the nation witnessed a terror strike in Pune, which has killed at least 13 people. The violence and bloodshed must end somewhere, for a peaceful environment is necessary for bringing about economic growth.          
	It is unfortunate that after the Shilda massacre, the Trinamul Congress took advantage of the situation to voice suspicions that the Marxists were involved in the attack. The allegation has come at a time when political parties need to come together to deal with the Maoist threat. The Centre has been proactive in this respect but it has adopted a faulty approach.          
	The best way to tackle such a problem is through dialogue. The need of the hour is that political leaders in Jharkhand, Orissa and West Bengal talk to the rebels and address their concerns. The activities of the Maoists cannot be condoned, but it might be worthwhile to understand what drives them to violence. The government should consider the Maoist demand for halting Operation Green Hunt and create conditions that are conducive to talks. It is also the States prerogative to ensure that civilians and armed personnel are not killed in cold blood.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The deadly attack on security personnel in the Shilda police camp is condemnable. The police top brass and the West Bengal administration seem to be powerless to solve the problem. The remarks made by the director-general of police, Bhupinder Singh, after his visit to the area, were completely unacceptable. That there is a gap in the security apparatus is fairly evident.          
	The Left rule is to be blamed for this, as in its 33-year tenure, the government has crippled the police force by politicizing it. Most high-ranking police officers were appointed in return for favours done to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), especially during elections. It is high time the Centre assumes direct command of the operation against the Maoists. The spineless state administration and its police are clearly incapable of tackling the situation.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir The Maoist attack in Shilda comes at a time when the media and all the political parties are preoccupied with the blast at the German Bakery in Pune. With 24 jawans killed and weapons looted, the incident proved that civilians as well as security personnel are vulnerable to guerrilla attacks. The jawans lost their lives but their sacrifice seems to have been taken for granted.          
	The Maoist leader, M. Koteswar Rao, also known as Kishenji, termed the attack on the EFR personnel Operation Peace Hunt, the Naxal reply to Operation Green Hunt. While the jawans were massacred in a matter of minutes, only three Maoists were killed in retaliation. The success of the attack, which must lift the morale of Kishenji and his men, is an acute embarrassment for the West Bengal government as well as the Centre. A probe needs to be initiated in order to establish where the authorities fell short. Officers found guilty of neglecting their duty must be punished immediately. Moreover, the government should not waste any time in launching an offensive against the Maoists. The jawans lives should not have been lost in vain. I also extend my sympathies to the families of the brave jawans.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,Faridabad               
	Parting shot          
	Sir Indians have become familiar with the sluggish pace of the legal machinery in the country. Yet news of the slow progress made in the cases pertaining to the anti-Sikh riots that rocked Delhi in 1984 never fails to shock.          
	After 25 years, the prosecuting agencies are still deliberating on which sections of the relevant act are to be used for charges against the perpetrators of atrocities. It is hoped that the courts would speed up the process, and justice would be done to the victims of the riots.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	An unprecedented situation is a good way to mark new beginnings. Or conclusions. The Delhi High Court has ruled that the office of the Chief Justice of India should come under the purview of the Right to Information Act. By so doing, it has arrived at the concluding stage of a tussle that was initiated in 1997 regarding the declaration of judges assets under the RTI Act. This is also a rare case in which a high court ruling has gone against the trend favoured by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has consistently argued against judges declaration of assets by maintaining that too much transparency would affect the independence of the judiciary. It had defined its position against the Central Information Commissions statement that the CJIs office should fall within the ambit of the RTI Act. This happened in 2009, and was followed by the Supreme Court moving the Delhi High Court against the CIC order. The central issue in the argument seems to be twofold. On a practical level, there is wariness about the misuse of the RTI Act regarding the judiciary, with concomitant hair-splitting about information that is personal or held in trust. On the plane of ideas, the issue is linked to independence and dignity: the knowledge of details about judges as citizens may harm the sanctity of the institution of justice.         
	Yet, a possible misuse, or a potential misapplication, of the RTI Act was scotched recently by the Supreme Court when it ruled that a judge cannot be asked to reveal the reasoning behind his judgment. Misuse can be blocked if there is a will to good. Rather, as the high court judgment has pointed out, and as some judges proved by declaring their assets voluntarily, greater transparency will only lead to greater dignity and independence. The judiciary is entrusted with an onerous task by the democracy. The RTI Act, whether used to make judges declaration of assets mandatory or to glean information about judges appointments, would demonstrate that such trust is honoured by making the governors accountable to the governed. The aura of overall transparency that a modern democracy requires would be created from the top. In that sense, the Delhi High Court judgment could be pointing the way to a new beginning.

	Choose with care                  
	Sir  The Maharashtra state education rules have been amended to let school students adopt their mothers maiden surnames if their parents are divorced. Parents often wait for their children to leave school before getting divorced so as to spare them humiliating queries from others. If a students surname is changed while he or she is in school, the child may face awkward enquiries from fellow students. Mothers should choose the time to change their childs last name carefully.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Prudent words          
	Sir  The controversy over Shashi Tharoors remark about Saudi Arabia being a possible interlocutor between India and Pakistan is unwarranted, and makes a mountain of a molehill (Heat back on Tharoor, March 3). The Indian prime minister signed 10 pacts with Saudi Arabia, of which a few were very significant for Indias national interests. Hence, it may not be wrong to see Saudi Arabia as a friendly country. The word, interlocutor, refers to one who takes part in a conversation. Sometimes, a conversation can be a useful diplomatic tool as well.          
	The present situation between India and Pakistan is quite charged; another major terror attack may even trigger a war. Pakistan has been aggressive and defiant towards India for long. The talks between the two countries have failed miserably. So, other influential countries should apply pressure on Pakistan to solve this problem, which might even threaten the whole of Asia. Saudi Arabia is a powerful Muslim country with considerable influence over Pakistan. It may be wise to seek its help. This is what the prime minister sought to do during his recent visit to Saudi Arabia. One fails to understand why some politicians are targeting Tharoor for his rather prudent observation.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Govind Das Dujari,Calcutta                              
	Dropping names          
	Sir  The editorial, Name to honour (March 3), is quite appropriate, and should act as an eye-opener for the railways minister. There is hardly any point in changing the names of Calcuttas Metro stations as it only adds to the confusion. Mamata Banerjee should also ensure that pending work is finished before announcing new projects. The completion of the Metro extensions to New Garia and Shahid Khudiram stations is long overdue. Instead of talking about a concrete date for the completion of these projects, the minister is busy announcing fancy new names for Metro stations. Long-standing demands for public toilets, parking space, escalators and facilities for physically challenged passengers have fallen on deaf ears. One does not mind Banerjee keeping an eye on the elections, but it will not help her in the end if she cannot fulfil the lofty promises she has made.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh,Calcutta              
	Sir  Nothing but confusion will ensue from renaming Metro stations. It is surprising that the railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, has not yet set her eyes on stations other than those belonging to the Metro railway. One also wonders whether the districts of West Bengal and the state itself would be renamed if Banerjee were to become the chief minister.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
J. Kumar, Calcutta

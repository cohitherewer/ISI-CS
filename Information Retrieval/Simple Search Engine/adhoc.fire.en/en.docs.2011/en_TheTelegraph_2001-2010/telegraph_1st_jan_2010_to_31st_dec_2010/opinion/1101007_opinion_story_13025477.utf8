                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A LONELY JOB                                                    
	When the search committee was formed to select a vice-chancellor for the newly-formed Presidency University, there was alarm and optimism. The fear was that the committee would follow the hallowed practice, begun by Anil Biswas, and appoint a party loyalist to the job. The hope was that merit would be allowed to prevail over politics and a scholar with an international reputation would be appointed. In the event, both the apprehension and the hope were belied. The person appointed may not be of international renown but is a serious academic and certainly has no known political affiliations. There is no necessary correlation between eminence as a scholar and success as a vice-chancellor. The emphasis on international reputation was based on the assumption that such a scholar was more likely to be familiar with global standards of academic excellence. There can be no denying that such standards will have to be rigorously applied if Presidency College, in its new avatar as a university, is to retrieve and outreach its former glory. It is entirely possible that the new vice-chancellor will be strict in her pursuit of excellence. It is also within the realms of possibility that the search committee did speak to scholars abroad and to scholars in India who have international recognition, and found such persons were not interested in the job.        
	The new vice-chancellor joins her job with very high expectations of her. She has one year to establish that the new university will be an institution of distinction not only in India but also in the world. In other words, it will be what Presidency College was in its halcyon days. Her first hurdle will be the Presidency University bill, which is a replica of the Calcutta University Act, and therefore it is politically, rather than academically, driven. Her second problem will be the present teachers of Presidency College who are all employees of the government of West Bengal. These teachers believe that they should become part of the faculty of the new university whereas the reality is that none, or very few of them, meet the standards of excellence that is expected from the new university and its first vice-chancellor. Amita Chatterjee faces a tall order even with the assumption that the present political dispensation will allow her a free hand. Her first task is to establish that she will work without fear and prejudice and repudiate all undue interference and influence.

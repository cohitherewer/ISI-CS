	The Georgians took down the last statue of Stalin recently. There used to be thousands of such statues all across the old Soviet Union, but the communists themselves tore almost all of them down after the great dictator and mass murderer died in 1953. They left the one in Gori, in northern Georgia, because thats where he was born and the locals were proud of him.        
	Even after Georgia got its independence, the six-metre-high statue of Stalin continued to stand in Gori. But now, just when you might think that the Georgians would be starting to approve of Stalin (after all, he was responsible for the deaths of more Russians than any other Georgian, or indeed anybody else), they go and tear his statue down. Theyre planning to replace it with a monument for the victims of the Russian aggression in the 2008 war, so the history theyre peddling in Gori will still be based on lies. (It was Georgia that started the war with Russia in 2008.) But the bigger lies will be told in Russia, and they will be told mainly about Stalin.        
	Two weeks ago, a group of politicians and academics met in Moscows main library to discuss how to make Russians proud of their history. The answer? Get an upbeat history book into the schools. The politicians were from Vladimir Putins United Russia Party, and they wanted the academics to come up with a single history textbook for use in all Russian schools. It should downplay the crimes and failures of 74 years of communist rule and concentrate on the glorious epic of the Soviet victory in the Second World War. Which means it must rehabilitate Stalin.                
	True lies        
	Start with the proposition that the Soviet Union played a key role in defeating Hitler (true), and that the war was a heroic victory against great odds (false). This is the first place where you wind up having to give Stalin some credit, because he was the man in command throughout the war. Then, to justify the terrible cost of the Bolshevik revolution and the subsequent civil war, and to slide past the purges and famines of the 1930s, you have to argue that those horrors were what allowed the miracle of high-speed industrialization that laid the groundwork for a Soviet victory in the war. Once again, Stalin gets the credit, for the industrialization happened on his watch.        
	Its all lies and distortion. The Soviet Unions population was twice that of Nazi Germany, and its industrial power and technology were not significantly inferior. If Stalin had not murdered most of the Red Armys senior officers in the purges of the late 1930s, and if he had not stupidly let himself be surprised by the German invasion, the war would not have lasted so long and killed so many Russians.        
	As for the alleged miracle of rapid industrialization, it was only needed because most existing Russian industries were destroyed by the revolution and the civil war: industrial output in 1922 was only 13 per cent of that in 1914. If there had been no revolution and no Stalin, and Russia had just started growing again after the First World War at the same rate as other capitalist countries, it would have been far too strong by 1941 for Hitler to dream of attacking it.        
	Russias history in the 20th century was an unmitigated and unnecessary disaster. Even today, Russia has not regained the rank among the developed countries that it held a century ago. What can one do with such a history but deny and rewrite it? One can tell the truth. Germanys 20th-century history was also terrible, and Germans had to bear a burden of historical guilt far heavier than anything Russians should feel for the crimes of their own imperial past. If todays Germans can see their past with clear eyes and still feel pride in their present and hope for their future, why cant the Russians? But the omens are not good. If Georgians no longer need that Stalin statue, maybe theres a market for it in Russia.

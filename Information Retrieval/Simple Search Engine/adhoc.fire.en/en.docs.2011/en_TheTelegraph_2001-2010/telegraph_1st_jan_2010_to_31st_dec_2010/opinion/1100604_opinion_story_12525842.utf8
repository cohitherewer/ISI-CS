	Before it can persuade others to believe in it, a political party has to believe in itself. Out of power for over three decades, the Congress in Bengal lost the will to restore faith in itself. The just-concluded civic polls in the state have now given it another opportunity for self-renewal. Fortunately for the party, some of its leaders showed enough courage and political sense to squarely face a challenge posed by Mamata Banerjee. The party had to choose between accepting a dishonourable offer from Ms Banerjee and rejecting it in order to preserve its dignity and morale. Given the long years of the partys decline in Bengal, it was not an easy choice to make. The results of the civic polls clearly indicate that the partys show of determination has paid off. The party never had much hope of winning a large number of civic bodies outside its own areas of influence. All it hoped and battled for was to hold on to its forts and prove that it was still a player in Bengal politics. As far as Ms Banerjee was concerned, the one point the Congress wanted to make was that she needed the Congresss help to end the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s long reign in Bengal. Her partys victory in only one-fifth of the civic bodies on its own shows how well the Congresss strategy for the polls has worked.        
	However, the important thing for the party is not the number of municipalities it has won by itself or the large number of hung bodies where Ms Banerjee will need its help to form the boards. The crucial test is what the party does with the message from these polls. The success of the Bengal leaders strategy to go it alone clearly signals that the party has to rebuild itself, irrespective of the Trinamul Congresss current domination of the political scene. And that involves addressing two main problems the party has long faced in Bengal. It lacks mass leaders of Ms Banerjees stature. Pranab Mukherjee, whose strategy for the civic polls saved the party from humiliation and further disintegration, is more an administrator than a mass politician. His responsibilities in the Union cabinet also force him to stay in New Delhi most of the time. But a much worse problem is the Congress high commands long tradition of neglecting the partys interests in Bengal. The compulsions of its alliance with Ms Banerjees party should be no reason for the partys central leaders to write the Bengal unit off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When fantasies take on quirky forms
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHEN FANTASIES TAKE ON QUIRKY FORMS                                  VISUAL ARTS: Rita Datta                                                  
	Studio 21s monsoon show is, as the title states, quite a mix to meet different tastes (Monsoon Mix, till today). To begin with, there are Anand Prakashs abstractions which construct a tectonic theatre. Exploring the dynamics of tone, texture and shape, they appear to be landscapes, though he doesnt use greens at all and only allows flecks of browns. Indeed, his palette is an improbable but persuasive spectrum of reds and rust, inflected with tears and veins in lighter shades. A strategy that evokes a beguiling tactility. One of the canvases is quite large and concentrates the weight of the image in the lower half. A hefty mass with jagged angles and diagonal planes yet insinuate the slow, deceptive prelude to an underground heaving. The motion picks up in the other work, turning into a kind of fluid churning in the top half while a formation of interlocking blocks and angles at the bottom leaves a small aperture into the receding depths beyond.        
	Hemant Raos abstractions, by contrast, are marked by a low-key, calibrated spatial drama, with pale grounds and floating forms: ovoids, small rectangular dashes and curlicues. Thus, a sense of layered space and vertical motion is induced  as though the small patterns were wafting down  accentuated by the shape of the canvas.        
	Though animals inspire both Anup Mondal and Goutam Khamaru, their approaches are very different. The former, in depicting what he likes to call Blakes Lamb  as a model of innocence, presumably  combines wood carving for the animals head and a tight tangle of curly aluminium wires for its luxuriant fleece in the only sculpture on view. Khamaru, on the other hand, seems to have dredged the subterranean regions of the mind where lurk, especially in children, strange, never-never creatures of delicious terror that sometimes slip into their reveries and nightmares. Delicious because of the cathartic excitement that can be relished in the safety of the real world where these dont exist. The images may recall the bison but are, in fact, fantastic beasts in both form and vivid colouring.        
	Sougata Das, however, locates the beastly in men. The utter vulnerability of women when confronted with the brutal strength of men is stressed as they are seized like objects, turned upside down, broken into parts, trailing hair trampled upon. The influence of Guernica, inescapable in depicting dramatic agony perhaps, may be glimpsed fleetingly in the artists handling of the human form but results in overcharged emotions.        
	Harish Ojha judiciously leaves the paper ground quite bare to lend buoyant life to his motifs. Motifs that are playfully gauche but seem imminently, yet not quite, recognizable. Sambaran Das, however, appears burdened and brooding in his sketches. This is because he imparts tension to impromptu lines by multiplying them, as though they were shaken and trembling. This is best seen in Dissolution, with its sculpturesque contours and darkly smudged face, and in Crucifx, where the three heads of a figure look in different directions in what seems like nervous agitation.        
	But both Gauri and Sourav Chatterjee are primarily concerned with paint, its colours and the versatile expressions teased out of it in different ways. The former artists keen feel for colour gives her semi-abstract works an assertive presence. Dense and flat and relieved with tiny squiggles, the arrangement of colours hints at known forms without articulating them clearly. In Chatterjees triptych whats noticeable is a surge of energy and an artful blend of textured colours.         
	Rahul Wagh and Satyadheer Singh attempt to give form to their fantasy largely through lines. Waghs mixed media montage of lithe images amuses with the quirky nonsense of its imagination. As things and beings morph into different identities, you are reminded of both Carrolls Wonderland and Sukumar Ray. Singhs scaffold of fine lines in his lone work on view could reference myths, such as that of Leda and the swan.        
	Sayak Mitras print is, despite its strident tone, quite affective. Reacting to the power of the State  exposed in Singur, Nandigram, Jangal Mahal, as none too people-friendly, despite we the people being its source  he seeks an emblematic image to summarize the agony of those helpless before it: a scream, replicated many times over with the insistence of desperation as it were.         
	Sujit Karmakar, showing large portraits of adolescent urchins, isnt any less political for all his reflective calm, while Sunil Chandra Paul, quite tongue-in-cheek, seems to cherish visual curiosities: a street performer dressed as Shiva earning the devotion of passers-by (picture) or a leopard  hounded out of its habitat, perhaps?  lounging regally on a four-poster.

	Left out                  
	Sir  In Wrapped up in pride (Nov 22), Ashok Mitra writes, In an almost orderly sequence, country after Latin American country  Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador  have voted Left in free elections contested by a multiplicity of parties. The learned author could not have not known about the reverses Left governments suffered in the erstwhile Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, East Germany and Czechoslovakia as well as in Poland, Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia. John D. Rockefeller is reported to have said that America might turn communist some day since it has experienced the evils of capitalism, and that the USSR might become capitalist since it has witnessed the evils of communism. Significantly, America has not turned communist yet, but east European nations, including those that made up the former USSR, have rejected left-wing governments.          
	Mitra also says, Fidel Castro is no longer referred to as that scoundrel of a rabble-rouser; he is now a father figure, widely revered and respectfully listened to. But Castros decision to transfer power to his brother, Raul, was largely undemocratic and displayed his political insecurity. Moreover, Fidel Castro is said to have admitted that the Cuban model does not work anymore, and that the Cuban revolution has been a failure.          
	Despite having huge natural resources, Latin America will never be able to achieve economic prosperity unless it frees itself from the grasp of leftist ideology. The euphoria over the victory of communist parties in Latin America may turn out to be short-lived. This joy may soon give way to frustration.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra points to the political changes occurring in Latin America, and predicts that the second half of this century will be dominated by South America and West Asia. His forecast is a bit too optimistic. The resurgence in the economies of Asian countries like Vietnam, Korea, Thailand and the Philippines should not be undermined. The growth in Indias economy has also been exemplary.          
	It is true that economic growth in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, has been exceptional. But the Latin American countries have long been affected by political instability. They have now shown their preference for leftist parties in the hope of political stability. It remains to be seen whether leftist ideology can bring stability and economic growth to the region. Left forces are sometimes successful in bringing social change. But they also fail miserably. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the developments in Vietnam are cases in point. In India too, the leftists have not been able to become a potent political force. Neither have they been able to bring about economic prosperity to the regions under their rule. Here, the leftists have become synonymous with disturbance. In West Bengal, for example, the Left Fronts long rule has resulted in chaos, underdevelopment and even barbarism.           
	India does watch Latin America and admires the political developments in the region. Whenever Fidel Castro and Hugo Chvez have visited our country, the government of India and the Indian leaders have welcomed them warmly. India has a strong intellectual bond with Latin America as well. But a stronger economic relationship among India and the Latin American countries is needed urgently.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Empty threat          
	Sir  During his recent visit, the president of the United States of America, Barack Obama, acknowledged Indias economic prowess by describing the country as emerged. In his article, Lightweight superpower (Nov 16), Ashok V. Desai has put forth statistical details of Indias real military potential. While agreeing on the steady economic growth that we have achieved, Desai points out correctly that India is lagging behind in terms of the military strength required to become a superpower. The country has seldom ventured beyond its borders, both militarily and politically, and the Indian armed forces are mostly kept busy handling internal security threats. This has limited Indias scope to enhance and organize its military powers. The country is surrounded by a host of antagonistic neighbours, which makes it all the more necessary for it to have an assertive military.          
	Through a comparative study of the military strengths of some of the superpowers, Desai has shown that India occupied fourth position in 2004, with the US, China and Russia ahead of it. Desai still seems sceptical about the legitimacy of Indias claims to being a superpower. This is because India lacks qualitative superiority in strategy and administration as well as sophisticated weaponry and hardware that the recognized global superpowers possess. Even though Indias military strength in quantitative terms seems to be greater than that of many other nations, it has not acquired advanced weaponry. Neither has India been able to develop sound strategies related to its military needs, and the process it has adopted to modernize the military seems to be flawed. Radical ideas and immediate action are required to bring India out of this awkward situation.

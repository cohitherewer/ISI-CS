The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | So who is the real boss?
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        So who is the real boss?                                  THIS ABOVE ALL: KHUShWANT SINGH                          Carnivalesque                                        
	When I was an editor (I edited quite a few weekly and daily papers in my time), I was content to describe myself simply as editor because I was the boss. Nothing in the journals I edited appeared without my approval. Consequently, I find it somewhat amusing to see present-day editors assume honorifics like Chief Editor, Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, Executive Editor and so on. What really matters are not these grandiose titles but who ultimately decides what should and what should not go in the journal he or she edits.        
	I was in for a rude awakening when the proprietor of a weekly journal I had edited with a modicum of success sacked me without ceremony and ordered me out of my office a week before I was due to retire. I was mortified and swore I would teach him a lesson he would not easily forget. I was unable to do so. But I did have the malicious pleasure of seeing the journal dwindle to extinction a few years after I left.        
	Since then, I have woken to the reality of editing journals. Editors, no matter how inflated their egos, how much they are sought after in society, and the fringe benefits they get in trips and travels abroad, are a dispensable lot and dependant on the whims of proprietors. There is much truth in the adage  he who pays the piper calls the tune. In turn, the proprietors primary interest is to earn as handsome dividends as they can get from their investments.         
	For them, owning a newspaper is much the same as owning a fertiliser plant, cloth or sugar mill but with the extra advantage of being able to promote or belittle politicians, chief ministers, ministers and others who matter. They are fully aware that Central and state governments are the single largest advertisers in the country. They must be kept on the right side. You can see this phenomenon every day in the journals you read. One day, frontpage carries the news that Mayavati, who owned next to nothing when she launched herself into politics, now admits she is worth 88 crore rupees. Pages later, the same paper will carry a full page advertisement, with a large photograph of Mayavati and a text detailing the great things she has done for Uttar Pradesh. And a page later, pictures of poor children eating mud with swollen bellies. Pick up any paper published in Punjab and you will find four of five half-page insertions put in by some department of the government with photographs of the Badals  father and son and the minister concerned, telling of the rapid strides made in the state  whereas the reality is that Punjab has fallen from being the leader down to being fifth or sixth and is heavily in debt. Ministers of the Central government do not lag behind state governments in promoting their images. Pictures of Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh and the minister concerned are a must. It has become a symbiotic relationship: ministers concerned are a must. It has become a symbiotic relationship: ministries feed on newspapers, newspapers feed on ministries. So where do the editors come in? They are mere cogs in the machinery of governance.                
	The IPL reinvented                
	The new commissioner of the Indian Premier League replacing Lalit Modi will be an IAS officer, 1989 batch, transferred from the Food Corporation of India. Mayavati will demand, however, that the new chairman should be her own candidate, Mr Dalit Modi.        
	The name of Mumbai Indians will immediately be changed to Mumbai Manus. It will, naturally, field only Maharashtrians (preferably, Maharashtrian Brahmins). All other players will have their legs broken.        
	The Chennai Super Kings will be renamed Dravida Cricket Kazhagam. Subsequently, one faction will break away and the team will split into DCK(DMK) and AIADCK, owning allegiance to Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa respectively.        
	Each political party will have its own team: BJP Bandits, Congress Cobras, CPI Cadres, Samajwadi Strikers, CPM Challengers, Trinamul Tigers and so on.        
	Auction of players will be replaced by teams calling for tenders for players. The lowest-priced players will be picked.        
	Sonia Gandhi will insist that 30 per cent of each team should be reserved for the women. Mayavati will demand that SC/ST players be allowed to run for only 18 yards instead of 22 yards between the wickets.        
	Third umpire requests will have to be filled in triplicate and duly notarized. All third umpire decisions will be referred to a joint parliamentary commission.        
	IPL tickets will henceforth be available at all post offices and BSNL centres from 10 am to 12.45 pm. The facility to purchase tickets on your cellphone will immediately be withdrawn.        
	Cheerleaders will be replaced by retired Air-India flight attendants. These new cheerleaders will perform the folk dances of the states they represent during breaks.

	Different skill                
	With our railway minister in the lead
  There could not be any stampede.
  May be a few were killed,
  But they were not skilled.
  To face the crowd in times of need.

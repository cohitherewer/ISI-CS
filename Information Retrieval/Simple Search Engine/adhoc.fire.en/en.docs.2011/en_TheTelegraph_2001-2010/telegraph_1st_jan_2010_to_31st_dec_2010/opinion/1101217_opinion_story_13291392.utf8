	Dubious freedom                  
	Sir  Shyamal Datta is comparing two very different elements when he sets the achievements of the communists of West Bengal against those of the communists of China (Dazzled by the jewel in the crown of Asia, Dec 9). The Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal works under a democratic system whereas China is a totalitarian State. I think it is unfair to compare a state within a country to a nation.          
	Did Dattas visa allow him free movement within the whole of China, as is customary in democratic countries like India, the United States of America or the United Kingdom? It seems that he visited Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai. From the sentence, It was a pity that we could catch only a glimpse of the Chinese countryside while travelling by train and car down to the outskirts of the cities, one might infer that he could not travel freely in the countryside. Let alone tourists, even Chinese citizens cannot move freely in their own country. The cities, which awed Datta, do not allow non-residents to enter without permits. This was also the case in the erstwhile Soviet Union.          
	According to Datta, 70 per cent of Chinas 1.3 billion population live in villages, and the government wants to shift people from villages to cities since life is not safe in the countryside. In India, too, almost 70 to 80 per cent of the population live in villages. The policy of our government, unlike that of Chinas, is to improve life in the villages, and considerable progress has been made in that direction. Instead of paying temporary unemployment allowances, as China does, our government provides guaranteed jobs to villagers for 100 days every year under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. Much of the social unrest in Chinese villages is caused by the government forcibly occupying land without paying adequate compensation to the landowners. When people in the villages or elsewhere break out in riots against such injustice, they are quelled by a powerful police force.          
	Chinas reaction to the conferring of the Nobel Peace Prize on Liu Xiaobo speaks volumes about its governments attitude. Liu is a supporter of democracy, and for this fault he has been serving an 11-year sentence. Rather than being a jewel in the crown of Asia, China, for me, is a hell of a place to be in.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Wasted funds          
	Sir  After a gap of a few months, I went for a morning-walk along the Dhakuria Lakes. The entrance, opposite Jatin Bagchi Road, was extremely dirty, with heaps of rubbish and dry leaves all around. The southern part, adjacent to the railway tracks, was the dirtiest, with an overpowering stench of faeces. I noticed the presence of the poisonous weed, Parthenium Hysterophorus, in front of Vidyasagar Academy, a school run by non-government organizations within the Lake area. This virtually indestructible weed can cause several diseases like eczema, asthma and dermatitis. The Lakes might soon be overrun by the weeds if they are not destroyed right now. I also saw at least three rowboats tangled in the floating islands of water hyacinths. I had read that much money has been spent on the beautification of the Lakes. I was dismayed to see this landmark at its worst.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The progress of work for the Vivekananda Road flyover is dismal. The utility of this flyover was always in question since a major stretch of this flyover is a one-way road. But I guess that there was money under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission to be wasted, and the project was made into a prestige issue by some politicians. Keeping aside the question of utility, the design of the flyover also seems to be faulty.           
	Two-lane flyovers are usually constructed on single pillars but the Vivekananda Road flyover is built on two pillars on both sides of the road. Building two pillars requires not only more money but also a larger area. Further, the flyover at some places will touch the buildings on either side. It will damage the buildings since most of them are quite old. The people residing on the floors adjacent to the flyover will also enjoy 24 hours of pollution.          
	The concerned authorities should modify the flyovers design so that only one pillar is constructed at the middle of the road, as has been done in the Chowringhee and the AJC Bose Road flyovers.                    
	Yours faithfully,

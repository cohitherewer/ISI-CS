The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A view from the middle ground
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A VIEW FROM THE MIDDLE GROUND                                                      Henri Rousseau, The Dream (1910)                             
	The Education of a British-Protected Child By Chinua Achebe, Penguin, 14.99        
	Chinua Achebe, now 80, enacts the role of the elder statesman of African literature with confidence. Famous for his inexhaustible table-talk, Achebe loves to berate, at every opportune moment, those who foisted the imperialist project on Africa. As he is highly active on the global lecture circuit and gives endless interviews, he does get many such opportunities indeed. Even so, from time to time, he considers it his duty to make a short book out of these occasional rebukes, which is what this volume turns out to be. As in his earlier volume of essays, Hopes and Impediments (1988), Achebes signature style is evident here as well  seeds of a few powerful ideas, stray personal reflections, rambling thoughts, fire-and-brimstone prose, abrupt endings. And, of course, there are the inevitable repetitions of ideas, pet theories and bte noire, but that, Achebes unapologetic style seems to suggest, is part of the deal of reading him. It is not for nothing that he has been acknowledged as Africas greatest indigenous novelist.        
	Ironically, Achebe has paid a steep price for his gift of story-telling. Since his first novel, Things Fall Apart, was published, to much critical acclaim, by William Heinemann, in 1958, Achebe has never quite managed to equal his early achievement. Although he did write a sequel, No Longer At Ease (1960), and a number of other compelling novels, he was called upon to embody a certain image of the Western-educated African intellectual who straddles the interface between two irreconcilable cultures, and spends the greater part of his life articulating his feelings on having to embrace this special fate. So Achebe spent long years demystifying Africa to the world and the world to Africa, gradually turning himself into an expert on his people, when the more proper role for a novelist would have been that of an explorer who deals in uncertainties instead of delivering useful discourses in the manner of a skilled interpreter. In the words of Emmanuel Egudu, the prototype of the African writer who appears in Elizabeth Costello, a novel by J.M. Coetzee, this is precisely the kind of danger that the African writer is fated to deal with  the danger of being turned into an expert in the same way that an elephant is an expert on elephants.        
	Achebe describes his perspective as a view of events neither from the foreground nor the background, but [from] the middle ground. This is a sensible position for any intelligent writer to adopt, as the middle ground is neither the origin of things nor the last things; it is aware of a future to head into and a past to fall back on. But burdened with the trappings of race and ethnicity, a writer could end up using this vantage point to settle scores with his historical enemies, as Achebe does unabashedly, often with deliberation. He seems to be perpetually looking over his shoulder at his foreign readers, especially from the Western world, cringing with unmitigated guilt as they are lashed by his acerbic prose. And truly, there can scarcely be any doubt that the white West deserves every bit of its comeuppance. However, when a supposedly world-class writer makes it his lifelong mission to upbraid his historical Other, he does tend to miss out on a certain edge of his art. Literature is not a sociological document or angry propaganda or a fertile ground on which fashionable theories can grow.        
	This is why Achebes virulent denunciation of Joseph Conrad sounds utterly audacious. In essay after essay, he returns to his hatred for the Polish-born British writer, whose 1902 classic, The Heart of Darkness, is, for Achebe, nothing short of poisonous writing. Achebe feels that Conrad abetted the reign of terror launched by the Belgian king, Leopold II, in the Congo for 21 years. Between 1885 and 1906, an estimated eight million natives were killed in a cold-blooded genocide orchestrated by Leopold, who belonged to the league of Hitler and Stalin. Conrads feelings on the Congo were more complicated than what Achebe insinuates.        
	In 1890, Conrad enrolled as captain on one of the steamboats in Leopolds company operating out of the Congo. Six months into his job, sickened by the prevailing system of ruthless torture, he fled back to England. Only nine years later did he write his story, told in the voice of Charles Marlow, whom Achebe takes to be Conrads mouthpiece. This is odd because in one of his own essays Achebe speaks disparagingly of people who read novels as if novels were history books. Taking the autobiographical basis of Conrads novel for granted, Achebe goes on to quote the choicest passages of racially insensitive comments to repudiate a long dead writer who had confessed that Before the Congo, I was merely an animal. Marlows gradual change of heart, as he wakes up to Mister Kurtzs atrocities, and the latters violent death are too ambiguous to figure in Achebes black-and-white reading of this elusive novel.        
	On matters more prosaic, Achebe can be quite incisive. He writes an impassioned but disenchanted account of what Nigeria (a huge lumbering giant) means to him. He exposes the innate shallowness of the political system, run by leaders who had never crossed the threshold of a university, offers glowing tributes to Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigerias first president, and to fellow crusaders for racial equality like Martin Luther King, James Baldwin and the anthropologist, Stanley Diamond, who lent active support during the devastating Biafran War. In a brief essay, Achebe discusses the opposing, though decisive, influences his father and grand-uncle had on him. There are exciting stories about Olaudah Equiano, the slave who bought back his freedom in the 18th century, about mbari (ritual celebration), and about good colonizers (like William Simpson and James Welch, Achebes first teachers). The title itself alludes to the status conferred on Achebe by his first passport in British occupied Nigeria.        
	Finally, there are fairly standard reminiscences of racist encounters while travelling through Rhodesia, and a spirited reply to Ngugi wa Thiongo, who accused Achebe of betraying his Igbo roots by choosing to write in English. The point of Achebes self-defence is somewhat confusing, as he is reportedly working on an Igbo translation of Things Fall Apart now. Perhaps it is time Achebe started writing the African novel for Africans, instead of worrying too much about its effect on foreigners.

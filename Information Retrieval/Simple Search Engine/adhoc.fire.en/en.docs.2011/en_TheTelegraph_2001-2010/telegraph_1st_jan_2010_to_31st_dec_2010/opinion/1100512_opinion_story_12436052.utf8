The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fear and foreboding
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FEAR AND FOREBODING                          - The Union home ministry should stick to its own turf					 					      Diplomacy      K.P. NAYAR                        A different approach				                                             
	Pulling up Jairam Ramesh, the minister of state with independent charge of environment and forests, for his comments on the Union home ministrys paranoia over China will not solve any problem. It will only push a legitimate issue under the carpet and only for the time being.        
	The problem of the home ministry in its present incarnation is far more complex than anything that can be addressed in a mere phone call from the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to his minister for environment. Ramesh has merely scratched the surface of a larger issue that has the potential to eventually eat into the fundamental structure of the Indian government and destroy the countrys integrity as a State, which respects the rights of its citizens and residents.        
	The environment minister has obvious worries about the home ministrys alarmist approach to China, but what ought to be more alarming is that the Union home minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, has so egregiously eroded the functional independence of the ministry of external affairs that there is now a logical case to merge the foreign and home ministries into one entity.        
	For that matter, tangentially, the home ministry has in recent months been steadily encroaching on what ought to be the domain of the commerce ministry, the flow of foreign investments into India and the work of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Deliberately or otherwise, the prime ministers office and the cabinet secretariat have also ceded considerable space to Chidambaram since he took over as home minister.        
	Take, for instance, S.M. Krishnas dogged effort since assuming office as external affairs minister to simplify and expedite the issue of passports. Consular services represent the public face of the MEA, and Krishna has pursued his mission as part of a belief that travel should be a basic right of every citizen of modern India without having to grease the palms of flat-footed policemen for a dubious clearance before the issue of a travel document.              
	Krishna went about implementing his vision of 21st-century passport offices, emboldened by the success of his effort as Karnataka chief minister in transforming Bangalore into an Asian version of Americas Silicon Valley. But Chidambarams ministry has stopped Krishna in his tracks by refusing to dilute the power of policemen to ultimately control the right of ordinary Indians to a passport.        
	Indias consular and citizenship rules are at their best archaic. Among the web of rules is one in fine print which says that if a passport expired more than a year ago and its holder is applying for a new passport, the application automatically becomes what is known as a citizenship case. What it means is that a new passport cannot be issued until the officer handling the case is satisfied that the hapless applicant has not acquired another countrys citizenship during the period when his passport was not valid.        
	It was a rule that nobody bothered to invoke until recently. But it is a reflection of the fear that the Union home ministry has now managed to spread  even in ministries and offices outside North Block  that those in government who take decisions which affect the lives of Indians are increasingly implementing the letter of the law. The result is a situation across the board in which man is made for the law and not the other way round, as it ought to be in any democracy.        
	That feeling of fear is perhaps only to be expected when a home ministry resorts to Orwellian behaviour and not only tries to seize control of the visas and passports process from the MEA, but even of the right to think itself from the ICCR, the ministry of human resource development and other similar agencies which ought to have nothing to do with Chidambarams turf.        
	In February, the Union home ministry issued an order that scholars from Iran who wish to attend any conference of an academic nature must get prior clearance from the home ministry before they can be granted a visa by the Indian embassy in Tehran. The external affairs minister announced last month that he would travel to Iran in May. He is on a mission, which has the signature of the prime minister. The visit also has the explicit approval of Sonia Gandhi. Krishnas trip is an effort to improve bilateral relations, primarily on account of the worsening situation in Afghanistan, which urgently demands greater regional coordination.        
	If Krishna had not been an inherently decent man and did not have the experience of a chief minister and a governor in handling affairs of State, he too would have told the media before his trip or in Tehran that the home ministry is alarmist and paranoid about Iran, a country which has proved in the past to be Indias friend in need.        
	Indias high commissioner in Colombo recently told South Block that the Sri Lankans are extremely upset about a similar rule which requires Sri Lankan scholars to apply for a visa six weeks ahead if they plan to visit India for any seminar or workshop, so that the home ministry can suitably vet the visitor and flag a green light to the high commission. Because a McCarthy-type atmosphere reminiscent of the United States of America in the 1950s is now incipient in India on account of the actions of the home ministry, this high commissioner did not want to put any of this in writing. He is related to a prominent leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party and whispers in South Block speak of fears that the modern day McCarthys of North Block may well have used that connection to have their way on this issue over the envoys objections.        
	If the ICCR or the ministry of human resource development or the MEAs division dealing with public diplomacy were to organize an event on the Bengali poet, Kazi Nazrul Islam, those coming from Bangladesh too would have to be pre-cleared by the home ministry before an invitation can be extended to them. The choice of words by Ramesh  alarmist, paranoid  are understatements when the home secretary, G.K. Pillai, pompously claims, as he did on Monday, that our interests, our policy is to ensure that national security is protected considering what such mindless vetting of some Bangladeshi scholar may reveal about Nazrul Islams poetry.              
	Incidentally, Ramesh may not have been aware, when he spoke to Indian journalists in Beijing, that Chinese scholars too are covered by this February fatwa by the home ministry. He was certainly not aware, nor was the prime minister, that the very first Chinese scholar who was recently approved to visit Sikkim since it became a part of India in 1973 and was duly given a visa was unceremoniously stopped by minions of the home ministry as she crossed into Sikkim on her way from Bagdogra airport. It required a very high-level intervention from Indian diplomats in China before she was allowed to proceed to Gangtok. Does one need any bigger proof of the home ministrys paranoia about China when it chooses to selectively recognize visas issued by Indian missions and posts in China?         
	Commercial officers at Indian consulates in the US, Canada and the United Kingdom are frustrated that business ties between India and these countries are being jeopardized by the home ministrys ham-handed visa policies since Chidambaram took charge of the ministry. But they too dare not commit these problems in writing. And mostly, their bosses are unwilling to challenge the home ministry in the current atmosphere of fear of retribution for speaking their minds.        
	An Indonesian conglomerate, which has invested in India and wanted to expand its operations, has its plans put on hold after the home ministry expressed reservations about the companys plans to bring in some employees from Taiwan. What Ramesh did not know, it appears, was that the home ministry is paranoid not only about China but about anyone with Chinese features. Elsewhere in the world, this would be called racial profiling, but in the home secretarys dictionary, it is known as protecting national security.

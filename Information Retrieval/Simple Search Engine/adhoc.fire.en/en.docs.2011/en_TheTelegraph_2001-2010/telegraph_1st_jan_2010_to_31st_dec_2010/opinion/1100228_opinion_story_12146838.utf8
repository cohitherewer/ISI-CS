	Make peace                  
	Sir  The editorial, Peace hunt (Feb 24), rightly emphasizes the need for a concrete policy to make peace with the Maoists. A peace process is crucial to ensure the progress of the tribal areas. The government should employ its strategy for talks with the Maoists intelligently; care should be taken to secure the lives of citizens as well as to initiate programmes to promote welfare among the underprivileged. However, the State should not make any compromises with the Maoists in order to bring peace to the region.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Rathin Kumar Chanda, Chinsurah, Hooghly

      
	Harsh punishment          
	Sir  The unnatural and untimely death of W.R. Varadarajan is a loss for the communist and trade union movement in India (Suppressed anger at WR funeral, Feb 24). A highly qualified man, Varadarajan quit his cushy job and struggled to bring up the party. He went on to become one of the tallest communist leaders in Tamil Nadu. The episode involving Varadarajan could have been handled better by the politburo and the central committee. Varadarajan did not have a corruption or criminal case against him, nor did he take undue advantage of his position. If the state committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had a reason to recommend action against him, it should have tried to settle things in Chennai before taking the matter up with the central committee.           
	Prakash Karat, the party general secretary, should have also taken adequate time to probe the matter, and given Varadarajan sufficient opportunity to prove his innocence. It is not clear why the central committee was in a hurry to remove Varadarajan, when it had taken a lot of time to address the conflict between Pinarayi Vijayan and V.S. Achuthanandan, an issue that had affected the party adversely in Kerala. Karat should have remained impartial and attempted to find out if Varadarajan was a victim of party infighting. With the rectification programme being discussed in the party, one wonders whether the drive will be used by party members to settle scores with popular leaders. It has been reported that Varadarajan committed suicide. If this were to be true, the Tamil Nadu government must investigate his death and punish those who had abetted this act.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Balasubramanian, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is shocking that a leader of W.R. Varadarajans stature committed suicide. It is not correct to single out any individual for Varadarajans ouster. Everyone, from the state to the central level, was responsible. The former state secretary of the party, N. Varadarajan, described the departed leader as an asset. This may help calm agitated minds in the party.          
	Yours faithfully,      
C.T. Suresh Kumar, Chennai

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Khushwant Singh often gives his readers wrong information. In Behind the sweetness and light (Feb 13), he writes that Agha Shahid Alis poetry first appeared in the United States of America. As a matter of fact, Alis first two books were published by Writers Workshop, Calcutta: Bone Sculpture in 1972 (when he was 23 years old) and In Memory of Begum Akhtar (1979). Singh obviously knew nothing about him then, but reads him now only because Ali made a name in the US and his collected poems have been published posthumously. Singh belongs to the very group he criticizes as not appreciative enough of Indian poets in the country of their birth.          
	Yours faithfully,

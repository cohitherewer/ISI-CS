JAYAL                                                            
	Last month, the president of the United States of America and commander-in-chief of the US armed forces sacked General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of the US and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation coalition forces in Afghanistan. This rare step  repeated after the erstwhile president, Harry S. Truman, fired the general, Douglas MacArthur, at the height of the Korean war  was prompted after an article appeared in the Rolling Stone magazine profiling the general. The article included many unflattering and mocking comments that the general or his aides had apparently made in casual conversations among themselves in the presence of the journalist. The reported comments reflected a degree of frustration that the general and his close staff felt towards the higher levels of the civilian leadership, including the US vice-president and even the president. Once such comments became public, the US presidents decision became inevitable.        
	It cannot be anyones case that in a democracy, where the armed forces work strictly under the civil authority, senior soldiers and commanders should voice dissenting opinions in public. It would be equally nave to believe that the military brass does not have the intellect to form their own opinions in the field of their command, irrespective of whether they conform to the opinions of their civilian leaders or not. Indeed, differences will arise, but under normal circumstances they must remain strictly within the confines of a restricted environment and never be aired in front of outsiders, least of all the media.              
	It would appear that the error that the general and his aides made was to allow unhindered access to a journalist in an environment that should have remained exclusive to those involved in operational matters. One can recollect a similar instance when the Indian army allowed access to mediapersons during the Kargil conflict only to regret adverse consequences. One template that still needs to crystallize in free societies in the information age, where military forces are being committed in sub-conventional conflicts, is the right balance between information and security in conflict zones and environments.        
	What is intriguing is why an experienced and battle-hardened general, who was hand-picked by Barack Obama to take command of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, should want to allow a journalist from a rather obscure magazine such unhindered access that the journalist was able to take on record every snippet of the conversation of the general and his aides during de-stressing in an Irish pub in Paris. It is conceivable that this was neither some indiscretion on the part of the general as some have made it out to be, nor some aberration in an otherwise well-established concept of civil-military relationship. Such simplifications would be to underestimate the level of professionalism and maturity that is the hallmark of military leadership in the US, and the more complex nature of challenges within institutions of governance in free societies faced with sub-conventional conflicts.        
	Clearly, the answer may lie in Afghanistan where the US and Nato forces are committed to battling an insurgency against heavy odds. Even as military casualties mount by the day, it is well known that there are differences of opinion within the US presidents senior advisers on how exactly to handle the Afghan government, the operations, the AfPak region, the many Taliban factions and the USs most favoured and recalcitrant non-Nato ally, Pakistan.        
	There is little doubt that having convinced the president of the counter-insurgency strategy to be followed, McChrystal then found that his hands were tied. Not only was he granted far fewer troops than he had asked for, but acute sensitivity to civilian casualties also led to very strict rules of engagement being enforced on his commanders and field units. This not only led to increasing casualties, but began to seriously undermine the morale of the troops in the front line.        
	In a directive issued in July 2009, McChrystal had written: The Taliban cannot militarily defeat us  but we can defeat ourselves. When we reward troops for not defending themselves  and take away their air and artillery support  that appears to be exactly what is going on. Yet the wide gap between those making policy in Washington and those executing it in the hostile Afghanistan terrain is best exemplified by the institution of a Military Medal For Courageous Restraint to be awarded to those who demonstrate restraint in the face of threat. No commander worth his salt would want to commit his troops to danger with their hands tied and to offer decorative inducements for such suicidal restraint.        
	If battling an insurgency in faraway Afghanistan with a fragile and corrupt government and institutions, a tribal culture, multiple complexities of drug and warlords and an ally across the border playing a double game were not challenges enough, McChrystal must have found it frustrating that there were differences among the presidents senior advisers on Afghanistan.        
	To execute counter-insurgency operations, the strategy must encompass many diverse subjects such as governance, economic development, public administration, law and various cultural, religious and other ethnic complexities. By their nature, COIN operations need persistence, are long-drawn-out and require patience and staying power. In his book, Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice, David Galula stipulates that essential, though it is, military action is secondary to the political one, its primary purpose being to afford the political power enough freedom to work safely with the population.        
	Lack of clarity regarding the challenges at the political level and poor civil-military integration down the chain of command hardly made McChrystals task any easier. In this respect, Obamas approval of a counter-insurgency strategy along with an exit strategy is a contradiction that has not been lost on the wily Taliban and other factions, including the ally, Pakistan. In the face of these contradictions, it is plausible that the general chose indirectly to vent his frustration, knowing full well its consequences.        
	The deeper import of this unfortunate episode is not about individual generals or civil-military relations, but about democratic institutions and the challenges they face with the changing nature of war and the growing importance of sub-conventional warfare. It is here that the episode may have valuable lessons for India, where the Indian army, which is a force trained for conventional warfare, has been engaged in internal counter-insurgency operations since the 1950s. An estimate by the home ministry identifies nearly half of the total districts of India as being afflicted by insurgencies of one form or another. These cover Maoist activities, different insurgencies in the north- eastern states and the Pakistan-backed proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir. Not surprisingly, the prime minister has identified this as the greatest security challenge. Yet, over the decades, the politics seems to have handed controls to the military and fallen asleep at the wheel.        
	Criticizing successive governments for harming the countrys internal security apparatus in a paper titled, Counter-insurgency: some myths and principles, Ajay Sahni, a globally acknowledged expert on counter-terrorism, writes, If effective counter-insurgency (CI) policy and strategy is to be designed within this degraded system of institutions and capacities, its core leaders and principal respondents will have to discover a greater clarity of assessment, purpose and intent than is currently evident.              
	Not only is such clarity lacking, any proactive move very soon falls victim to either institutional or political wrangling and remains a non-starter. Witness the endless political differences, even within the ruling coalition, over tackling the Maoist insurgency. Mercifully, the army has so far been spared this debate, although the Indian air force was briefly dragged into it when the air chief sought permission for his helicopters to fire in self-defence. Human rights activists were quick to present this as the IAF wanting to unleash its air power, prompting the air chief to soothe nerves.        
	Public memory being short, few will remember the Manipur agitation in 2004 against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, targeting the security forces. A similar voice is again being raised by elected representatives in the midst of continuing disturbances in Kashmir. Vested interests paint the army as the villain that wants the act in place in order to perpetrate human rights violations. The Central government, rather than defending a statute of which it should be the upholder, and the army, which acts under its charge, vacillates and promises to make the act more humane  a euphemism for more insurgent-friendly, politically appeasing, which, consequently, is costly for the army.        
	Little surprise that the army chief was compelled recently to go public with his opposition to any changes in the AFSPA, rightly claiming that demands for a dilution of the act were being made for narrow political gains. Not unexpectedly, the very system that has failed to check decades of insurgency is quick to criticize the army chief. Commanders, who see their men and women doing a thankless job, paying with their lives and yet not enjoying the support and confidence of those whose chestnuts their troops are pulling out of the fire, cannot be faulted for empathizing with General McChrystal.

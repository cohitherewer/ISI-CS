	Compulsions of populist politics can make leaders do unpredictable things. Even his own followers must have found Bimal Gurungs latest call for a new status for Darjeeling rather incomprehensible. The tribal people whom he wanted to win over to his side, however, have refused to be taken in by his ploy. If the people of the Dooars and the Terai do not want to be part of any set-up that would have Darjeeling as its centre, it is because they see no benefit from it for themselves. In fact, the tribal people of North Bengal see Mr Gurungs proposal as a threat to their own aspirations. They have their own grievances and want a council under the Sixth Schedule to take care of them. It is debatable whether any such council is the right answer to their problems. But the ethnic and other demographic factors in the Dooars and the Terai make the people in these areas very distinct from the people in the hills. Mr Gurung has clearly made a proclamation without realizing the fallacy of it. Worse, he has made his own people confused and his neighbours suspicious about his territorial ambitions.         
	It is not difficult, though, to understand what prompted Mr Gurung to suddenly raise such an unrealistic idea. He has been negotiating with the Centre and the West Bengal government for a new set-up for the Darjeeling hills. The talks had proceeded on the basis of his own argument that this set-up would be an interim arrangement till December 31, 2011. Both New Delhi and Calcutta had refused to accept his demand for the inclusion of large parts of the Dooars and the Terai in the proposed interim set-up for Darjeeling. But the differences had not closed the negotiations, nor did they prompt Mr Gurung to raise the demand for a separate state at this stage. If he has suddenly changed track, it definitely has much to do with the events in Darjeeling following the brutal murder of Madan Tamang, president of the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League. The popular outrage over the killing seems to have unnerved Mr Gurung. Tamang had openly opposed any idea of an interim set-up and demanded Gorkhaland instead. He had to pay with his life for this, but a dead Tamang could continue to pose a threat to Mr Gurungs control over the masses. The call for a Gorkha Adivasi Pradesh is thus primarily Mr Gurungs ploy to keep his flock together. He would do better to see reason and return to the talks table.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PROMISED LAND                                                     
	If politics is the art of the possible, a Bengal without bandhs may yet happen some day. As of now, though, Mamata Banerjees promise of that golden age sounds too good to be true. If anything, Tuesdays shutdown makes it difficult to hope for such a paradigm shift in the states politics. For as long as one can remember, the cult of hartals has defined Bengals politics. The Leftists, who once rode to power on the back of bandhs, set a bizarre example by using their own government to force all kinds of shutdowns. Unfortunately for the state and its people, the Opposition played much the same game. Ms Banerjee herself seemed to compete with the Marxists in organizing bandhs. The vicious cycle has had a free run for so long that any promise of an end to it must inspire some hope. Ms Banerjee may have her own partisan reasons to offer the vision of a bandh-free Bengal. It is absolutely predictable of her to try and score points over her arch-enemy, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). But if she is serious about her promise to not organize strikes, that alone can secure her a place in Bengals political history. If she succeeds, it will be a far greater achievement than anything else she may be hoping for.        
	Ms Banerjees promise comes at a time when she stands a real chance of becoming the states chief minister after next years polls. It is no secret that bandhs are enforced in the Left-ruled states only with the collusion of the governments. If Ms Banerjee lives up to her promise, the ugly and patently unconstitutional practice of government-sponsored shutdowns may end after all. Even the Leftists can no longer deny that the politics of forcible shutdowns has lost all credibility. In fact, their use of the government machinery in forcing strikes shows how little they trust the popular responses to strike calls. Ms Banerjees recent electoral successes have all come from her promise to change Bengal. Before she can actually work on that promise from Writers Buildings, she has to prove that she can change her own ways. The popular anger at the Lefts political culture offers her a real opportunity. The question is whether her new opposition to strikes is only a strategy to ride to power. If it is only a new device for an image makeover, nothing much may change in Bengal even if she takes power from the Left. A realistic vision of the future requires that she makes a complete break with the ugly past.

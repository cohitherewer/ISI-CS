	The housing sector in the United States of America is sending out distress signals once again. In July last, home sales were down 12.4 per cent on June, dropping to 276,000  the lowest since records began in 1963. About 10 per cent of US households with mortgages are defaulting on their payments. The governments making home affordable project was supposed to protect three million homeowners from foreclosure. However, only 422,000 loans have been permanently adjusted so far. The rate of adjustment is slipping every month, and 616,000 trial modifications have ended in failure. Thousands of repossessed homes have been put on sale by banks at knockdown prices.        
	The longest recession in US history sharply reduced the revenue of the State and the local governments. The record $787 billion stimulus saved the US financial system from collapse. It took care of the troubled assets by recapitalizing the banks and did contain unemployment from rising. But it did not reduce unemployment because the stimulus could not match the colossal scale of the crisis. Neither has there been a second stimulus. The subsequent recovery was feeble, and there has been little improvement in the finances of the State and the local governments. They are cutting back even on essential services like public education, maintenance of roads and so on. The laid-off teachers and workers are taking up jobs with little security and are unable to pay the mortgage installments contracted earlier. No reliable estimate is available of this vast body of the underemployed, but it is increasing with new entrants joining the workforce.                
	Close call        
	The US needs to grow annually at about 2.5 per cent to keep unemployment from rising. The irony is that the federal government, which can still borrow at just 1.04 per cent by selling inflation-protected, long-term bonds, is not cash-strapped at all. But it is providing little help, because reducing the budget deficit is the top priority of the Congress. The result is there for all to see  unemployment, underemployment, foreclosure, the negative factors are all ascending. The roads are crumbling and a nation that was among the first to provide basic schooling to all its children is laying off teachers. Consumer price inflation is around 1 per cent and the economy is just a step away from deflation.        
	The entire process is to be seen against the backdrop of rising poverty in the US. The overall poverty rate climbed to 14.3 per cent in 2009 from 13.2 per cent in 2008. So, one in seven Americans now lives in poverty. The percentage of people without health coverage increased from 15.4 to 16.7 percent, mostly because of the loss of the employer-provided health insurance during the recession. The Congress did pass a health overhaul law this year to address the rising numbers of the uninsured, but the main provisions will not take effect before 2014.         
	Had the US social security system been of the core European standard with free schooling and healthcare for all, a large number of the homeowners would not have defaulted on their payments and foreclosures would have been far less. The banks are now getting saddled with houses at rock-bottom prices. In many cases, prices have fallen by more than 60 per cent. Predictably, the banks are failing at a faster pace this year than last year, which saw the highest failures since 1992. Till mid-September, 127 banks had failed this year. The list of problem banks climbed to 829 with $403 billion in assets at the end of the second quarter from 775 in the first quarter. At this rate, the US banking system may become sick sooner than later, and the country could be in recession once again, though with less severity than the last one.

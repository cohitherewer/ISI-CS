The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The battle against the heat beast
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE BATTLE AGAINST THE HEAT BEAST                                                                  
	Heat, any sensible physics textbook will tell you, is the transfer of energy from one body to another through contact. It follows the laws of thermodynamics. It is measured out in Joules or calories, in sums like coffee spoons. Clearly, this has nothing to do with that thick, sulphurous presence which sucks out all other senses. A beast with a smell like sterilized needles that bleaches the sky and courses through the city along the livid concrete. Drying throats, taps and leaves in its wake, it pounds on windowpanes with the insistence of a very determined canvasser before the elections. Now that, every Calcuttan knows, is heat.        
	Every thought crowds around it, all conversations return to it. Each summer is believed to be the hottest one there has ever been. Unfortunately, given the grim predictions of climate watchers, it probably is. Calcuttans are a breed shaped by heat. By noon, curtains are drawn and windows closed. As people huddle in darkened rooms, most of the smaller streets wear a deserted look. Though thoroughfares are frantic with traffic, the only ones outside are those who have to be. Calcutta is a city under siege.        
	Left to the mercy of the heat for years, certain features have evolved in the city. Ways and means to fight the heat that might almost amount to a culture. Calcuttans have developed an arsenal of umbrellas, pocket-handkerchiefs, preferably doused in eau de cologne and placed on the head, and hand-held fans. Flimsy incarnations of the Japanese fan, which open out like a skirt, create little more than a flutter; more robust pankhas, fitted with silk and carved wooden handles, need to be spun violently to produce a breeze. Your best chance is with the light fans made from palm leaves, perfect for long spells of flapping.        
	Calcuttans have also chosen to rebuke the heat with what they know best  food. They invoke shukto. A mixture of vegetables, usually including bitter gourd, in a thin white gravy, it will cool your stomach and help with digestion. They invoke aamer ombol, made from unripe mangoes, chilled and pale gold, so sour it will set off cartwheels in the jaw. For the conscientious, there is always curd-rice, eaten plain or with curry leaves. For the adventurous, there is chuski, crushed ice on a stick, sold in flavours such as orange, lime and an untranslatable one called kala khatta. Or crushed ice in a plastic tube, somewhat derivatively named Pepsi.        
	Heat may be effectively combated with dreams of the cold, usually cold mountains. There are snowpeaks and fireplaces. If Bengali films are to be believed, there are charming local inhabitants, romance and adventure. Feluda shoots at villains in the snow. Suchitra Sen takes a holiday in the hills and falls in love, all the time indulging in that ultimate luxury  an overcoat. Hence, perhaps, the famed fetish for monkey caps and the chanting of names like an incantation  Darjeeling, Kurseong, Kalimpong, Gangtok, maybe even Shimla. Potent names, all, dimming the glitter of the midday sun. For the citys more affluent inhabitants, the ritual of the annual holiday in the hills is probably as much a part of summer as the heat.        
	In recent years, however, colder climes have visited the city. The advent of the air-conditioner has been a more decisive answer to the heat than anything else. The AC has extended its realm, in malls and offices, in many of the curtained bedrooms and in the brief comfort of ATM booths. People float about in the cool interiors wearing a look of calm triumph. This agent of the cold, however, has also intensified the heat outside, and the city is split between extremes. On some afternoons, Calcutta seems to be two cities at the same time. A city within, of arctic splendour, gleaming counters and the absurdity of having to use blankets at night. And in the city without, a riot of sun and sweat, the drum of many million Joules; the realm of the heat beast, straining to get in.                    IPSITA CHAKRAVARTY

	The seven stepsisters                  
	Sir  The whole of the Northeast, comprising Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Nagaland, is called the Seven Sisters. These states had cordial relations in pre and early post-Independence days. During the Ahoms rule, representatives of these states used to pay homage to the swargadeos (kings) in the lawns of Rang Ghar. This bonhomie is no longer there, due mainly to a few unscrupulous politicians. The states have become stepsisters, and Assam in particular has been shabbily treated.           
	Yours faithfully,        Ashim Chowdhury, Guwahati 
        
	Unequal world          
	Sir  The article, The ugly face of the nation (Aug 5 ), by Archis Mohan about the Delhi governments beggar eviction drive before the Commonwealth Games reminded me of a Senegalese novel, The Beggars Strike, by Aminata Sow Fall. The novel shows how, in order to develop tourism in Africa, beggary was banned and beggars were shifted to the outskirts. Later, society had to pay a price for the ban. Consequently, beggars were once again included in the mainstream.           
	This discourse is not confined to the Senegalese socio-cultural space. Nearly all third-world countries share the same experience. Beggars remain the Other in every power structure  be it colonial or postcolonial. In preparation for the CWG, beggars are being hidden from view in Delhi. But begging as an institution will always remain in society.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Newspaper reports say that the number of beggars in our towns and cities is rising. In metropolitan cities, this rise may not be discernible since there are so many people around. However, in small towns and rural areas, this trend is apparent.           
	In metropolitan cities like Mumbai, begging is largely an organized activity with territories earmarked by syndicates, which maim or disfigure poor people to make them eligible for begging. In smaller towns, beggars are real in the sense that they are compelled by circumstances to beg for their daily meal. Certain sections of the regional press have been quick to suggest that begging syndicates are coming into being in small towns as well. This view is in keeping with what the majority thinks about beggars. Instead of showing compassion, we try to make the topic of begging a part of dinner table conversations. But if reality be confronted, we must acknowledge that beggars are an indication of hard times to come.           
	As in the days before the Bengal famine of the 1940s, nowadays people come to our doors begging for food. With the unabated rise in prices, those living on the margins of society are finding it difficult to procure food and must take recourse to begging. The number of beggars will increase while the second United Progressive Alliance government puts its emphasis on growth without caring to find out what the consequent inflation is doing to the poor. More and more people are being added to the BPL list every month. Even when the Supreme Court ordered that foodgrain be distributed among the poor instead of being allowed to rot, our Union agriculture minister ignored the directive.           
	In his first term of office, the prime minister had assured us of development with a human face. The slogan seems to have been forgotten now as India emulates developed economies in pursuing growth for growths sake. Unless the government stems price rise and opens soup kitchens for the poor, we will have more and more beggars lining the streets.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Over a year ago, the Institute of Development Studies in Sussex asserted that India was an economic powerhouse and a nutritional weakling. As was only proper, it considered the combination improper, and suggested ways of improving nutrition. It accepted the approach of the government, which has concentrated on children, and proposed some improvements in the Integrated Child Development Scheme  basically, handing over its management to local communities, and a focus on outcomes rather than inputs. That this scheme calls for some change is obvious. Few realize that the scheme was inaugurated on October 2, 1975; that it has not been able to bring Indian childrens weight up to normal in 35 years is damning enough evidence. But the scheme is already locally managed. It is in the hands of anganwadi workers, who are under local authorities. They are supposed to get fixed amounts of money per child and per lactating mother in their neighbourhood, buy food with it and distribute it. And a focus on outcomes was first suggested by P. Chidambaram when he became finance minister six years ago; he had even tried to make ministries report on outcomes. His initiative died before long.         
	This leads to the question: how is outcome to be measured, and if it falls short of target, what should come next? An anganwadi worker can justifiably argue that while she controls inputs, she cannot ensure that children grow faster or mothers become healthier. If it is found that her inputs have no impact, should she be dismissed, given more food to distribute, or should the approach be changed? It should be recognized, after so many decades of failure, that improving health and nutrition is not like building an airport. The only evidence of health or nutrition comprises statistics and judgments. They are difficult to collect, difficult to audit, and take long to assemble. An easier path to better nutrition should be looked for: food should be made cheaper for the common man. One way of doing it is to subsidize food. The government does it on a large scale. But subsidies inevitably lead to rationing, rationing to dual prices, and dual prices to corruption. The government has no way of ensuring that the subsidies go to deserving persons, any more than that food supplements go to the right children.        
	That leaves one more alternative: to create incentives to reduce the cost of the production of food. It obviously implies that incentives to increase its cost of production, such as cost-based price support programmes, must be given up. But more important, a vibrantly competitive market in every kind of food must be created. Every farmer should be able to sell whatever he produces anywhere in the country, without any interstate barrier, and with minimum transport costs. That may sound radical, but since everything else has failed, it might as well be tried out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Beauty and the modern city
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BEAUTY AND THE MODERN CITY                                  While civic authorities are content to look after a few parks, the presence of millions living in squalor on the streets, deprived of hygiene and security, complicates the vision of a beautiful Calcutta                                            
	Beautification may not be the most beautiful word in the English language but it features prominently in the civic vocabulary of those who administer Calcutta. From planting a few saplings to keeping a park clean, all kinds of rudimentary municipal activities are often brought into the fold of an exalted beautification drive. Every modern metropolis aims to inculcate a unique aesthetic identity by staking claim on its history, art and architecture. But such ambitions make sense only after the primary battles with power and water supply, road safety and illegal settlements are won. So, with a lumbering system of delivery, the authorities responsible for the city try their best to hide the unruliness under a patina of modernity. Hence, the guise of beautification.        
	Last month, at a seminar on the role of art in public space, a spirited panel of curators, art historians, artists and architects had confronted civic authorities on the need to look beyond a public works department brand of aesthetics. In their defence, the officials spoke of the good work they do by looking after the city parks. One gentleman even offered several roundabouts to artists who may wish to beautify these places with artworks (although he tactfully kept silent on how these projects were to be funded). But can a city, which a recent survey declared to be the least liveable Indian metropolis, be made beautiful by a few well-maintained parks or works of art in strategic places? The key to a beautiful modern city lies beyond what meets the eye.         
	Public space in post-colonial countries is necessarily mixed up with private lives. In Calcutta, poverty is abject and undisguised. People are born and die on the streets, live in shanties, in filth and squalor. Deprived of basic hygiene and security, the presence of millions complicates the vision of a beautiful Calcutta. The State has so far managed to come up with cosmetic measures at best (like allowing little ghettos of slums and colonies to grow up in certain areas) and twisted face-savers at worst (the underdevelopment of Calcutta, its old buildings and crumbling infrastructure, are often talked about in a rhetoric of noble gloom, and praised as a brand of aesthetics peculiar to the city, and having its own quaint charm).        
	Around the physical reality of public space there is the less tangible domain of public sphere, charged with ethics, morality and decorum central to civic life. Pollution control, proper disposal of garbage, and efficient traffic management are some of the fundamental duties of the modern State, which must then be instilled into, if not strictly enforced on, its citizens. In India, people are habitual jaywalkers, they relieve themselves, spit, or make a litter, everywhere. Thus individuals, educated or otherwise, claim a private ownership on public spaces in a way that goes against the first principles of any meaningful public enterprise. So public art projects become vulnerable to damage, theft and defacement, thanks to this nexus of public-private neglect and disregard for the rules.              
	Calcutta, teeming with history, timeless yet unpredictable, has much to offer to the creative eye. Ever ready to jostle the senses, the city provides an ideal platform for public art, but maybe not the most suitable conditions yet for such a project to flourish in.

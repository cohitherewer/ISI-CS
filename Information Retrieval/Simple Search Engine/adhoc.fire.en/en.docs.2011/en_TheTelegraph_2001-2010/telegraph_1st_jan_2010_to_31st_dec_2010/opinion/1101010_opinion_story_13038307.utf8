The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Victorian interlude
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        VICTORIAN INTERLUDE                                                          
	There is an unmentionable in the woodpile. Right in the heart of the Calcutta High Court, the glory days of the raj flashed by for just a few minutes as the courts Central public information officer actually argued that the high court had been established at the time of Queen Victoria under letters patents and could not bow to the jurisdiction of such a Johnny-come-lately as the Central Information Commission. The CPIO did not descend to calling the CIC childish names; his sniff was audible in the premise that the Calcutta High Court was not established by the Central government and was not under the Constitution of India. So strong was his hallucinatory sense of the royal majesties presence that it had erased the last 63 years from his memory. He had to be reminded, with admirable restraint, by the former chief information commissioner that in the context of the present, so-called Majesties have ceased to exist.        
	Rip Van Winkles soulmates are somehow immensely lovable and foolish. That may be one reason for overlooking the staggering impropriety of a court official acknowledging an authority outside that of his government in an official matter. (That the authority has become a figment of the past and a few statues makes his loyalty more touching.) That one small snag apart, the episode has the lucent aptness of a fairytale. How right that Calcutta should nurse such a Rip Van Winkle in its bosom, with his misty eyes turned backwards, his dogmatic assertion of irrelevant facts, and his adamant refusal to let silly things like the right to information disturb the age-thickened cobwebs festooning the impenetrable shadows of one of the citys most prized Victorian structures. Anyone born later than that redoubtable sovereign might be tempted to ask why such a feisty knight against the RTI should have been asked to grace the position of CPIO in the court at all  but that is all part of unassailable Calcutta logic, as unique as its chromosome.        
	Undoubtedly, the CPIO is well on the way to becoming part of Calcuttas inimitable pantheon of the aggressively ignorant. He is a perfect candidate, given the love of obfuscation and concealment among the citys high and mighty. According to this privileged breed, dominating officialdom and babudom alike, no one has the right to know anything; babus and their officers alone are the keepers of all mysteries. The RTI is just a passing aberration: ignore it and it will go away. It is possible that they guard these mysteries so jealously because they do not know anything themselves, not necessarily because they do not wish to reveal embarrassing facts. It is unlikely that they know what is embarrassing. But Queen Victoria might. As the CPIO waxes eloquent on letters patents, her majestys bronze hem may be stirring gently in the grounds of the Victoria Memorial.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LONG VIEW                                                    
	As the northern hemisphere shivers under a blanket of snow, sleet and fog, concerns about global warming are the last thing on peoples minds. In any case, the minister of state for environment and forests had already excused India and blamed industrial countries for having unleashed billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the air. After that exculpation, India could expel billions more tons without feeling guilty. And for once it was comfortable to be in the same boat as China, which is belching out even more carbon dioxide. Their boat sailed to Copenhagen with a red flag, and fired a broadside on the summiteers. They gave up without a battle. India and China are the great carbon emitters of tomorrow; if they did not join the emitters of the past, the latter might just as well go home, sit like Canutes on the beach, and watch the sea rise.         
	India is used to leading the developing nations in their verbal battles against the developed world. But this time it faced a rebellion, for there are people in the world who cannot take such a devil-may-take-the-hindmost attitude. There are islands which will lose much of their arable land, and where people will have to go and live on trees  as long as trees survive the advancing waves. Vanuatu, the tiny nation of 83 islands in the Pacific, led the rebels; its neighbours, Tuvalu, Tonga and Samoa, followed. An Alliance of Small Island States was formed; by now it has attracted 35 members and four observers.        
	This opposition will not go away; and it will not be a good idea to dismiss it as consisting of insignificant islands. For one of the countries that would expect to lose considerable land is Indias neighbour, Myanmar. We may hope that the crore or two who may be displaced from there will go east. But we cannot entertain such hopes about the crores of Bangladeshis; if their villages are inundated, they will turn to India. And the continentals inland who make Indias policies do not realize that India has 7600 kilometres of coastline; Indias vulnerable coastal population exceeds the population of Bangladesh. If the sea rises, Indians will have nowhere to go but to Pakistan and beyond. Hence it is necessary to rethink Indias stand on global warming. This stand was not Jairam Rameshs alone; the government relied a good deal on advice from The Energy Research Institute. It is a remarkable fact that while the government supports many institutions and researchers in natural and social sciences, it has depended so exclusively on one institution in climate change policy. That institution is facing questions abroad on its finances; the questions need to be answered, for its head is the governments principal adviser on climate change. Even if the government is loath to question him, it should take broader advice on climate change.

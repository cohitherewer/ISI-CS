                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PRIVATE LIMITED                                  Under what circumstances can an individuals right to privacy be violated? Hemchhaya De looks for some answers in the light of the publication of the Niira Radia tapes                          TALKING POINT: Corporate lobbyist Niira Radia is at the centre of the controversy                                  
	The publication of the sensational Niira Radia tapes  conversations between an influential corporate lobbyist and a number of top notch journalists, industrialists and politicians  has held the country in thrall for the past few weeks. But as the public wondered whether an unholy nexus exists between corporate interests, journos and the political establishment, another prickly issue has came to the fore. Was the publication of the tapes, which were recorded by the income tax department, a breach of the right to privacy of the individuals concerned? In fact, the whole incident has triggered a debate on a persons right to privacy and how far the media is justified in infringing that right to highlight matters of public interest.         
	Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata group, and one of those whose phone conversations with Radia were caught on tape and published in the media, has already moved court against this alleged violation of his right to privacy. Invoking Article 21 of the Constitution, Tata has petitioned the Supreme Court to stop the tapes from being leaked any further and asked for a probe into how the tapes, which were part of an income tax department investigation, could make their way into the public domain.         
	The right to privacy is, of course, not an enumerated fundamental right, but only a logical extension of personal liberty under Article 21. It is subject to the procedure established by law or subject to laws that reasonably provide for its infringement. Besides, the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885, and newer laws like the IT Act, 2000, and its amended version in 2008 also deal with issues related to privacy.        
	In the past Article 21 has been invoked a number of times to establish a citizens right to privacy. And the apex court has decided on the issue depending on the merits of individual cases. Take the Supreme Court judgment on the Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu case in I994 where state officials tried to stop a Tamil magazine from publishing the autobiography of a criminal called Auto Shankar, raising the issue of right to privacy. They moved court because the autobiography exposed the criminals close association with several IPS and IAS officers.        
	Deciding on the case, the Supreme Court observed, The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article 21 None can publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent whether truthful or otherwise... If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages. However, it added that the rule doesnt hold if the publication is based on public or court records.         
	The Supreme Court ruling on the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) vs Union of India (1996) case is yet another landmark judgment. It revolved around top politicians complaints of phone-tapping by government agencies. The judgment noted, the right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of ones home or office without interference can certainly be claimed as right to privacy. It also laid down that only the home secretary of the central government or the state government could give orders to tap someones telephone.        
	Says Rajindar Sachar, former chief justice of Delhi High Court, who was a counsel for the PUCL, This was the first case where the Supreme Court clearly stated that phone-tapping is an invasion of privacy. But tapping is permissible under certain circumstances. Officials can pass an order of interception only after they are convinced that it is expedient to do so in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of an offence.        
	Erstwhile Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh had also been a victim of phone tapping when his private conversations with film stars and top industrialists were leaked to the media a few years ago. Singh moved the Supreme Court, which at one point during the legal proceedings, directed the media not to publish the tapes.               
	Cyberlaw expert Pavan Duggal feels that the concept of privacy has evolved in India with the changing social circumstances of our times. With the proliferation of digital platforms in the beginning of this decade, the significance of right to privacy is being reinforced, he says.        
	Furthermore, the right to privacy has been acknowledged in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with prevention of arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family, human or correspondence or honour or reputation. Says Shameek Sen, assistant professor, The West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, According to the international covenant, an individuals privacy is not absolute in itself. But any infringement of the right cannot be arbitrary  it can be encroached upon only if it goes against national security, public safety, prevention of disorder and crime and protection of health and morals.         
	So was there a breach of privacy insofar as the Radia tapes are concerned? Many feel there wasnt. Says Sachar, These tapes pertain to fixing ministerial berths and government contracts. People have a right to know about these.         
	Civil rights groups agree. Wed oppose any attempt by state agencies to trample upon any individuals right to privacy arbitrarily if it doesnt compromise national interest, says Mahi Pal Singh, national secretary, PUCL. The Radia-Tata tapes show how a lobbyist is trying to influence government policies in favour of corporate interests. I wouldnt mind if tapes are further leaked as the dealings go against public interest.         
	Nevertheless, some feel that the privacy laws are still outdated in India. We need dedicated legislation or specific legal provisions which will put the burden of responsibility on the government for keeping intercepted private conversations secret. That is, unless their disclosure in the public domain is necessary in the interest of national security, the countrys sovereignty and integrity, public order, etc., says Duggal.        
	Others feel that there needs to be a balance between an individuals right to privacy and the medias right to do an expose. Unless there is an overriding social purpose being served by an expose, the media should not be allowed to infringe on an individuals right to privacy, says Sen.         
	But experts argue that over-regulation of the media by the government is not a good idea either. There are already so many laws governing the media  Cable Act, Information amp; Broadcasting rules, etc. We dont need any extra laws, says Aniruddha Bahal, editor-in-chief, of the online magazine Cobrapost, and the man behind a media sting operation on politicians in 2001.         
	Well, only time  and the outcome of Tatas petition  will tell if more media regulations concerning right to privacy will come into force.

	Q: I have purchased a shop on the ground floor of a three-storeyed building. I park my two-wheeler in the common area inside the premises and pay Rs 100 as maintenance charge. There is no garage or parking space on the premises. Recently, the secretary of the building told me that I was not allowed to park there. He also threatened me with legal action. Am I doing something illegal? If not, what legal action can I take against the secretary?        
	Bhiswa Sen, Calcutta        
	A: In buildings without garage or parking space, residents or guests are required to park their vehicles outside the premises. This is because parking ones vehicle in the common areas may hinder the free egress and ingress to the building, which is not permissible by law.         
	Q: My grandfather passed away without making a will. My father and uncle are the co-owners of his property. We have been staying in a portion of the house for the past 20 years and would like to have that portion registered in our names. However, my uncle does not want the property partitioned and is not co-operative on other property matters either. Can we go for a forced partition? If yes, what is the procedure?        
	Aditya Mullick, via email        
	A: To begin with, your father can send a notice to your uncle, declaring his intent of partition or separation from the joint family. If your uncle agrees, both could execute a partition deed. If he refuses, the only option for your father would be to file a partition suit before the civil court with the appropriate jurisdiction.        
	Q: My father bought a plot in Calcutta almost 20 years back. He has all the legal papers. The plot has been occupied illegally for a long time. We had not pursued the matter before. But now we wish to reclaim it. How should I proceed? Is it true that the other party can get false papers made for the same plot? In that case will going to the courts help?        
	Indranil, via email        
	A: You may file a civil suit for ejection of the illegal occupants on the ground that they are trespassers and also claim restoration of possession. If the other party has false legal documents in their possession, you could file a criminal case against them for offences of forgery. You could also institute a civil suit to get the fraudulent documents declared void.

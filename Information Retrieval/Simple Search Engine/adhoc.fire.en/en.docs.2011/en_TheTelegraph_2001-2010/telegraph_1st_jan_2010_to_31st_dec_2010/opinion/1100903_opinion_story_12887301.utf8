	It has been proved, many times over, that weapons of mass communication have the potential to become weapons of mass destruction. So the Indian government has very good reasons to worry about the misuse of BlackBerry smartphones. Three years ago, France took the initiative of banning government officials from using the device. Barack Obama had to give up his precious BlackBerry after taking over as the president of the United States of America. And recently, the United Arab Emirates issued an ultimatum to Research In Motion, the Canadian manufacturers of the BlackBerry, demanding, like India, a certain degree of access to encrypted messages sent from these devices. Apparently, this last facility could allow terrorists foolproof cover to exchange information that could seriously undermine national security. So RIM is in the unenviable position of having to compromise the trust of its users in order to gain the governments goodwill. And it does not really have a choice in the matter, if it wants to carry on doing business in Asia. But either way, RIM is going to be the loser, as is already indicated by the falling share prices of the company.        
	Indias anxiety over the BlackBerry is probably not unfounded. At the same time, objections are bound to arise when robust democracies, having constitutional provisions to safeguard individual freedoms, start demanding the licence to pry into the private lives of its citizens. While remaining firm on its negotiations with RIM, India is also planning to ask Google and Skype to operate using indigenous servers, which would make the task of monitoring information exchanged on these networks easier. It is perhaps logical that the States suspicion of the uses of information technology should be directly proportional to developments in newer modes of communication. China, for instance, with its draconian internet regulations, has given a whole new edge to the notion of online surveillance, forcing Google to shut shop in the country. At the height of Mahmoud Ahmadinejads brazen attempt to retain power, Iran came down heavily on Twitter users, who exposed the atrocities of the regime to the outside world, thus undermining the credibility of the government. It would be most unfortunate if a quest for security led to a bigger crisis, as it happened with the implementation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

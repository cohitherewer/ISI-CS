The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | CAuse for concern
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CAUSE FOR CONCERN                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	For several years now, the approach of Independence Day is marked by a sense of panic in Assam. This has often been an occasion for the United Liberation Front of Asom to make its presence felt through mayhem. The fear of Ulfa depredation must be present this year as well although the authorities, both the home ministry and the state government, claim that terrorism in the Brahmaputra Valley and in the Northeast in general is under control. On the face of it, that does seem to be the case. Following the surrender of the Ulfa chairman, Arabinda Rajkhowa, the rebel outfit today is a divided house. What is more important is that Bangladesh has clearly indicated that anti-Indian forces will no longer be allowed to operate from its soil. The absence of a safe haven across the border makes any terrorist bodys task that much more difficult.        
	Yet fingers must be kept crossed. The Ulfa may not be the force these days, but it most certainly is not out altogether. Indeed, it cannot be, as it remains a tool in the hands of those who have no interest in bringing peace to this country. Only the blind optimist can argue that our western neighbour is serious about mending fences with us and needling India is no longer on its agenda. The home secretary, G.K. Pillai, might have spoken out of turn when he alleged the involvement of the Inter-Services Intelligence in the Mumbai blasts, but this does not mean that the ISI is no longer a menace as far as India is concerned. The ISI, as is common knowledge, has always been active in Bangladesh, training and funding Indian terrorists. In Dhaka, the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, may truly be sincere when she insists that her government will no longer allow such activities, but the activities may continue despite her. It should never be forgotten that there is a strong anti-India lobby in Bangladesh, and that lobby has its sympathizers within the Bangladesh army. That lobby keeps harping on how the big bully is ill-treating Bangladesh.                 
	Powder keg        
	The current complaint is about the sharing of the Teesta waters, and even Wajed has not been able to ignore this. An organization like the ISI can only be expected to keep the fire of resentment burning, so that the case for anti-Indian operations is kept alive. With Pakistan and China seeking to play a major role in the Afghan situation, it is only logical to assume that India will find itself busy with these issues in a way it might not quite like.         
	So the Ulfa is not wholly without its backup strength, and that should continue to be a cause for concern. Right now, it may not be blowing up bridges or causing explosions in the streets of Guwahati or elsewhere but extortion of money, particularly from the tea industry, continues. And surely, these funds are not for personal consumption. A part of the booty, of course, always goes to friendly politicians, but the bulk is used to fund unwanted activities, which obviously are going to continue.        
	And the problem is not just with the Ulfa. There are indications of it seeking a tie-up with others to create a wider area of unrest, especially in the northern parts of West Bengal. Within Assam, there is the outlawed National Democratic Front of Bodoland, which too may not be waging wars on its own. The Barak Valley has its own secessionist forces, as do other states in the region. The entire Northeast continues to sit on a powder keg.        
	Unfortunately, there is no indication that New Delhi has the Northeast on its list of priorities. It has always been like this. The threat from across the border has always been seen as concerning north India more than the east. It is time that this perception changed, particularly since the same force continues to be as active across the eastern border as in the north and west.

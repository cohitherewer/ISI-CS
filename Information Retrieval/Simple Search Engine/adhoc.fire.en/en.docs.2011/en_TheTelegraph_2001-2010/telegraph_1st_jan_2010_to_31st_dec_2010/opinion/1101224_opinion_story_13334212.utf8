	Professional circumstances press scholars to publish early and abundantly. But only one out of ten manuscripts submitted are properly examined by publishers and of these only an infinitesimally small percentage actually get published in their original form. Is it because publishers have their hands full with earlier commitments, or the submitted manuscripts do not suit their publishing programmes? Or because authors havent submitted their work in a format suitable for publication? What should authors do to get their scholarly books examined and, hopefully, published?        
	Most scholarly manuscripts submitted to publishers are original doctoral theses, overwritten, crammed with footnotes and other paraphernalia of scholarship that are of interest only to a specialized readership. Very simply, they do not make for a viable commercial proposition at a time when the market decides what is good, bad and ugly. But that is not the only reason why the author isnt given the courtesy of being read or even cursorily examined before rejection. Apart from the market, there are three more weighty reasons that the author must take care of before submitting the work to the publisher.        
	First, no matter at what stage of his career, the author would do well to ask his colleagues, especially other experts in the field, to read and assess the work, to advise on whether the manuscript is appropriate for publication and to recommend possible publishers. While such readers would not be able to gauge the marketability of the book, they could provide useful comments on the intellectual and scholarly issues, on the organization and development of ideas and the cogency of the argument. But this is not the only reason: all publishers turn to outsiders for their expert advice and if the author has taken care to have this covered, acceptance becomes so much easier.        
	Second, a work is ready for submission to a publisher only after a formal editorial review has been done. This includes, among other things, confirming the accuracy of all paraphrases, quotations, bibliographic references and textual citations. This nitty-gritty tends to be left to the publisher, who is invariably not equipped for it. The result is delays and, often, rejection.        
	Third, every publisher has an editorial house style which dictates other features of scholarly presentation. The house style sheet is usually provided to the author before the submission of the manuscript. But there are differing opinions on how closely it should be followed and whether the final word is the authors or the publishers. According to the Chicago Manual of Style, which is taken as the authority on the preparation of a manuscript for publication, there can be departures from a house style provided there is consistency in the presentation of details like figures, dates and names. With more and more multi- authored books, like anthologies of all kinds, this freedom has now been accepted by both publishers and readers.         
	There are two other questions that crop up as the book nears completion: who is responsible for the acquisition of illustrations and the preparation of the index. Few Indian authors are competent to handle these two requirements. But what the author should do is provide the necessary sources or the secretarial help.         
	What Indian authors must realize is that while their concerns are many and wide-ranging, they include not only intellectual and scholarly but also stylistic and technical questions for which they must provide all the assistance that publishers might require. Good publishing is a collaborative effort between author and publisher from start to finish.

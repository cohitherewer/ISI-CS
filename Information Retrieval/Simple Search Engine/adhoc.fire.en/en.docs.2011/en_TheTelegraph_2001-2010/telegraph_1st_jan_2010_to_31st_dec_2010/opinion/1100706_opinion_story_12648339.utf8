	The film industry of Mumbai, popularly known as Bollywood, has never had it so bad. The principal reason for this is that when every single industry across the world was going through unprecedented bad times because of the depression, Bollywood decided that it did not need to tighten its belt in the manner of other industries. This decision may have been related to the fact that Bollywood makes its profits by peddling in illusion. The price of that is empty studios and idle post-production laboratories. The knock-on effect of this plight can be easily imagined because Bollywood provides employment and livelihood to not just the stars who grab the limelight but also to thousands of anonymous men and women. It is ironic that such people will have to face hardship at a time when people in other industries, globally, are seeing the light at the end of a long and dark tunnel. The makers of illusion are being hit by reality because they refused to face reality at the appropriate time and in the fitting manner by cutting costs and increasing productivity.        
	It would be simplistic to see these adverse conditions as a function of the failure of films like Kites and Raavan, which were complete flops. The fact of the matter is that the corporate houses that had been acquiring films in 2006-7 stopped making acquisitions in 2008-9. But there was no cutback on the extravagant fees that the stars commanded and the producers were willing to pay. The result of this was predictable. The production companies, pampered by the acquisitions of the corporate houses and now facing high expenses, are unwilling to make films at their own costs. Big budget films have thus become a thing of the past. The sellers of dreams have suddenly discovered that their dreams have turned sour. The small films with low investments are making more money than the so-called blockbusters. The stars have not disappeared but, if Bollywood has to survive and flourish as business, they may have to prune their demands according to the needs of the time. The economics of movie-making in Mumbai has undergone a transformation. This transformation has been forced upon the industry by circumstances that are by no means special to India. Awareness has come late to Bollywood, and this will probably lead to a change in the order of priorities for all those who are involved in the business of making films.

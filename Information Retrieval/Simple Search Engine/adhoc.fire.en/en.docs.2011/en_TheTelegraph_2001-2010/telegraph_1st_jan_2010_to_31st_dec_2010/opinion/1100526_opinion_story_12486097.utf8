	The man is the style. This inversion of the common statement is the best way to describe the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. His press conference on Monday morning to mark the completion of one year in office of the United Progressive Alliances second term in government showed that his style of interacting with the media is no different from his persona: low-key, serious and cerebral. A press conference is not quite the occasion to inspire people with a vision and Mr Singh very correctly limited himself to clarifying issues and answering queries. The impression he left was that of a prime minister committed to getting on with the job because he was conscious of his responsibilities and sure of his own position and abilities. He oozed an air of quiet and dignified confidence, which was rooted in his many successes going back to the time when he was, somewhat unexpectedly to most people, entrusted with the top job of the country by his partys president, Sonia Gandhi. Mr Singh is, of course, no stranger to ministerial responsibilities and to initiating major changes in policy. As finance minister, he changed the contours of Indias economy, and as prime minister the first time round, he gave Indias foreign policy a new direction.        
	In his press conference, he reiterated and explained the new content he is bringing to Indias relations with Pakistan. Despite the ambience of cynicism that shrouds Indias talks with Pakistan, Mr Singh has taken steps to repair what he calls the trust deficit with Pakistan. He told his audience that without normal relations with Pakistan, Indias growth prospects will be hampered. About the Maoist threat, he was similarly realistic. In fact, on most issues that were raised, Mr Singhs answers were informed by a cautious optimism. Nothing was overstated. Yet, he conveyed a sense of engagement. It was a performance that commanded respect. The word, performance, in the previous sentence is deliberately used since a press conference is a piece of theatre. Mr Singh and his audience know that what is of substance is the work the prime minister and his colleagues do away from the media limelight. A press conference is only the occasional public face of that work and responsibility. It is to Mr Singhs credit that he did not reduce that theatre to a series of rhetorical flourishes.

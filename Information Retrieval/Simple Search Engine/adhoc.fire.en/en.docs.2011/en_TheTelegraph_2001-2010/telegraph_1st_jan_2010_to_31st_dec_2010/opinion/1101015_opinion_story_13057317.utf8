The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Ending Well
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ENDING WELL                                                    
	The exhilaration  or simply the relief  of being able to pull it off in the end is no mean thing. Most Indians following the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, together with all the participants, their countries and the organizers, would admit to a roller-coaster ride through a whole range of conflicting emotions over the last few weeks. The twists and turns in the unfolding of the Games, and in the worlds perception of them, have been dramatic. Revelations and apprehensions salvaged by spectacle were followed by a sporting and athletic experience that threw up surprises, pleasant and unpleasant  occasions for exultation, disappointment as well as critical reflection. India finished second in the tally of golds, beating England. Saina Nehwals win, the closing extravaganza and a hugely spruced-up capital will probably outlast the cobras and the corruption in public memory. But, if India has proved itself to the world with the Games, then this heightened visibility also demands an ability to learn from experience.        
	First, the world and its own people will expect more scruple, accountability and efficiency from India and its politicians, bureaucrats and administrators when organizing an event of such dimensions. Before starting to make Olympian noises, India must return to the corruption exposed during the run-up to the Games and deal with that mess without covering it up with success. Second, a modern democracy cannot afford to forget its commonest, most powerless, citizens when preparing for glory. India must think through the human costs of displacement and labour as it delivers the state of the art in urban infrastructure and beautification to the world. Finally, perhaps the single most important lesson of the Games has been to rethink the entire hierarchy of glamour and privilege on which the politics and economics of sports are founded in India. The glory of the Delhi Games was embodied in Indias shooters, wrestlers, boxers, weightlifters, archers, discus-throwers, runners and shuttlers, many of whom are of the humblest origins. Busy, most of the time, with the golden boys of cricket and their debonair antics, the countrys sports bodies, ministries, media and lovers of sport must work together to create a space for these quieter and less visible men and women so that the balance might be tilted a little more justly towards their efforts and struggles.

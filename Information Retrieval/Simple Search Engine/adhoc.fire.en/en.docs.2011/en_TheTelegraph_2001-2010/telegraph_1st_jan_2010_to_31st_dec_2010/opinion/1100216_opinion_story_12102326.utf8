	Storm and stress                  
	Sir  While I agree with S.L. Rao that organized, systematic and vicious attacks by powerful and well-funded lobbies exist, I wonder how R.K. Pachauri and his Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change can be equated with India (Too hot to handle, Feb 8). Raos comment, India is experiencing such an attack for the first time, is totally uncalled for.           
	The glaciologist, Vijay Kumar Raina, who blasted the false alarm induced by Pachauris declarations, served the Geological Survey of India. Raina used data supplied by the GSI to expose the truth of the matter. He also emphasized that the GSI is the only organization in the world that has amassed the most exhaustive data on Himalayan glaciers over the past several decades (Some like it hot, Jan 31). So he has good reasons to wonder why the IPCC did not approach the GSI for data on Indian glaciers.          
	Rao claims that Teri is perhaps the best managed research-consulting-action institute in the country, without providing any objective data to support this. His personal impression is unacceptable as he was associated with Teri. Moreover, he should not have made light of the serious charge brought against Pachauri  of diverting IPCCs research to Teri. Rao also asserts that The IPCC (like Teri) has excellent procedures. Then why it is faltering again and again?          
	This is not the first time that the IPCC has been accused of misdemeanour. One of its earlier reports, which warned of an accelerated rise of sea level, was debunked in a 2003 publication, authored by Nils-Axel Mrner, the president of the International Commission on Sea Level Changes and Coastal Evolution, and his colleagues. Christopher Landsea, a hurricane expert currently with the National Hurricane Center, Florida, ended his association with the 2007 assessment report, accusing the lead author of the chapter he was contributing of exaggerating the impact of global warming on hurricanes.           
	Genuine mistakes occur once in a blue moon. When they appear regularly, one tends to see a design behind them.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  S.L. Raos piece makes one ponder the purpose behind an article where the author spends a paragraph introducing himself  and then claims it to be a disclaimer. Be this as it may, Raos intention is quite clear. He wanted to show that The attack on climate-change scientists is motivated, although most may not agree with him. The IPCCs faux pas was first pointed out by Indian glaciologists, international criticism came later. The Indian scientists, especially V.K. Raina, deserve praise for their efforts. Their revelations would ensure proper coordination, monitoring and scrutiny of sensitive reports not only in the IPCC, but across other organizations as well.          
	Rao also focuses on Teri, an organization that is headed by R.K. Pachauri, and where Rao has been, by his own admission, a distinguished visiting fellow. Rao has written at length on Teris expertise in combining natural and social sciences for developing policies and methods to promote sustainable development. I believe that neither has Teri been criticized nor R.K. Pachauris integrity questioned. Rao seems too keen on defending Pachauris chair in the IPCC.           
	One point must be clarified. The constructive criticism was to alert the IPCC officials, particularly the compilers of reports and the supervisors. When the faux pas was revealed, Pachauri regretted the error in the media. But he did not take any moral responsibility. His assertion that the IPCC has a robust procedure to generate credible scientific data has certainly taken a beating. Did the IPCC not know that the GSI has a wealth of credible data on Himalayan glaciers that no other organization in the world can match? If it did not know this, then the procedure of collection and collation of data on glaciers has not been robust.           
	The question remains why the IPCC employed a researcher and a reviewer who were not experts on Himalayan glaciers, and then depended on their work. Even if one agrees that such errors will occur in all research, Pachauri cannot absolve himself of the responsibility of clearing a report containing unsubstantiated information that brought disrepute to the IPCC.           
	However, Rao need not worry too much. Neither the countrys scientific community nor the government would want Pachauri to vacate his chair in the IPCC or in Teri. The Centre will suitably deal with the bullying of the Western lobbies but Pachauri should have been more forthright about his duties.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  S.L. Rao aptly condemns the attack on R.K. Pachauri in the foreign media, and the objective behind such slurs. Martin Evanss report, Climate crusaders legacy (Feb 7), helps to understand the matter better. It is heartening to note how Pachauri has been the cynosure of all eyes since the evil game plan of some Western countries was defeated in Copenhagen, thanks to the initiative of some developing nations like India. Such controversies targeting Teri, which Pachauri heads and helps raise funds for, were created to defame Indias positive role in matters relating to climate change and future economic policies. The Indian media should be united in combating such moves.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Another reason          
	Sir  Gwynne Dyer says that It is Israel, not the White House, that controls Americas policy on Arab-Israeli issues due to its huge influence in Congress (For one mans whim, Feb 1). Theoretically, it is always a big State that influences a small State, not vice versa. It is true that the Jewish population in the United States of America is generally rich. However, Jews constitute only a tiny fraction of the US electorate. US elections, as in many other countries, are funded by public donations, ranging from individuals to industrial houses. There are no records to show that the Jewish people are the largest donors. The US gains little by supporting Israel. Israel has neither minerals nor oil to offer to the US in return for its support. The US would have gained far more by supporting Palestine and getting a hold over the Arab worlds natural riches. That way the USs expenses on internal security, to check Islamic terrorism, would have reduced drastically. The USs support to Israel seems to me to be a hand of friendship  a sacrifice made to help a small country in distress, surrounded by hostile States.

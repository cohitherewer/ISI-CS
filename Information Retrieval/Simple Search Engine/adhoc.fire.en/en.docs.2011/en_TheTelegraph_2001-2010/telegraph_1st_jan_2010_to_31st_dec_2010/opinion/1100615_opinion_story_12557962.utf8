The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A report in translation
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A REPORT IN TRANSLATION                          - The government should be less impressed by big sums        Writing on the wall -   Ashok V. Desai                                                        
	A belief has pervaded the United Progressive Alliance government that it must aim at tangible improvements and must monitor its achievements. This was the idea behind the outcome budgets introduced by P. Chidambaram when he was finance minister. They died out when he handed over to Pranab Mukherjee. But the idea survives in the form of the UPAs report to the people. It is beautifully produced, and reads well. But it tells another story if we read between its lines.        
	It is now June 2010; till now, the government has no data on most things later than 2007-08. The report tells us that by April 2008, 8,700 primary health centres and 19,000 subcentres were functioning. It does not tell us that the government had laid down a standard of having a health centre for every 30,000 people in the plains and 20,000 in the hills as long ago as in 2003. So it should have at least 30,000 PHCs and 180,000 subcentres. It had roughly a quarter as many PHCs and a tenth as many subcentres. They had delivered 83,000 babies. Supposing that was over just one year, I reckon that somewhere between 10 and 15 million babies are delivered every year in villages. So the subcentres had served less than one per cent of pregnant women. The government has doubled rural sanitation coverage  from one to two households? One to two crore households? It could be anything.        
	For cheap medicines, the government is reviving Hindustan Antibiotics and Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals. Both were so inefficient that they went bankrupt; they are hardly the companies to choose to make cheap medicines. Since the government is satisfied with what it has done, it certainly does not tell us when, if ever, it is going to reach its own standards. Since it has set up so few centres, it must have chosen the locations; it does not tell how. Incidentally, the idea of health centres was given by the Bhore committee in 1953; the idea was so incompletely implemented by 2007! That is how fast our government works.              
	The government has increased freedom fighters pension from whatever it was to Rs 10,000 a month. Assuming that the last freedom fighter went to jail in 1945 and the youngest was 20 then, freedom fighters would be 85 and over. I wonder how many are still alive. The government was giving Rs 600 a month to their eldest daughters and Rs 350 to other daughters if they were unmarried and unemployed. That caused jealousy amongst the various daughters, so the government has raised their rewards to Rs 1,500 a month. That is what a domestic servant gets today in a city. The youngest of the daughters must be 35, so not many can be unmarried.        
	The government announced that it would give a lakh of rupees and a letter of appreciation to every member of Arzi Hukumat, the ragtag army under the leadership of Shamaldas Gandhi that invaded and annexed Junagarh in 1947. It forgot that Shakeel Ahmad, its own minister of state, had gone to Junagarh in 2008 and announced the award of Rs 100,000 to the same people. Assuming that they were 20 then, they would be 83 today; not many of them can be alive either.        
	The government boasts that it has allowed old people income-tax rebate on health insurance premiums. It should ask the insurance companies if any of them provide the old with health insurance, and what premiums they charge. When I go abroad, I take health insurance for a week or two. Only one insurance company offers it, and it charges the earth for it. None of them would sell me life insurance in my seventies.        
	The government waived loans of Rs 60,000 crore to farmers  the entire loan if the farmer had less than two hectares, 25 per cent of it if he had more. It does not tell us whether any farmer declared having more than two hectares, or whether all subdivided their holdings to get the full waiver. Having given the signal that loans will eventually be written off if farmers forget to repay them, it gave another Rs 225,000 crore in agricultural loans in 2007-08, and planned to give 280,000 crore in 2008-09.        
	The government tells us that work on the east-west corridor is on the way. It belongs to the national highway development programme of the Bharatiya Janata Party; Atal Bihari Vajpayee laid its foundation stone on January 6, 1999. The BJP finished the north-south corridor, but lost before it could complete the other corridor. Maybe it will get a chance to complete it when it comes back in 2020.        
	The prime minister laid the foundations of the 3,000 megawatt Dibang project and a 750 MW gas-fired project in Tripura. The report does not mention that most of the power supply systems are owned by the state governments, which have neither the money to expand the systems to keep up with the demand nor the guts to charge electricity prices which would attract private investment.        
	The government is building 5,000 two-room flats for those whom it calls migrants from Kashmir; it shies away from calling them Pandits, four lakh of whom left the valley between 12 and 20 years ago. It shows that the government will do something for any victimized group if it waits long enough, and that it will do something for only some members, not all; that way it can choose favourites.              
	The report says that legislation to introduce limited liability partnerships is about to be introduced in Parliament. The government does not know what it has been doing. Actually, the act was passed long ago, and was notified on March 31, 2008. But it is pretty useless because the government notified only a few sections.        
	My list could go on forever. But assuming that the government wants to do good for the nation and tell the nation what good it has done, the report should be framed differently. The government should be less impressed by big figures and sums, and should look instead for quantitative indicators of whatever it is trying to achieve. If it is trying to send girls to school, it should find out what proportion of them do not go to school; more importantly, what proportion of girls over 16 can read a book, write an essay, go into a shop and work out if they are being cheated, or write a tolerable love letter without grammatical errors. Second, it should get an idea of how much needs to be done, how much of it has been done, what it would cost to do the rest and when it would be finished. It is obvious from the figures I gave above, for instance, that the government would simply not have the money to set up health centres for every 20,000 people. Finally, the questions I am asking should not come from outsiders; the government should have people within itself who would question what it is doing. The government is full of well-intentioned do-gooders; but they have no idea how to do good, or how to find out how much good they are doing.

	For Mahinda Rajapaksa, elected president of Sri Lanka for the second time with a thumping majority, the winning formula has worked. Mr Rajapaksa had preponed the presidential elections by two years in order to cash in on the euphoria generated by the successful conclusion of the war against the Tamil rebels in the north. It was a promise made to the electorate in 2005, and kept. The overwhelming gratitude of the population, predominantly Sinhala, was expected to translate into substantial support for the presidents continuation in office. This simple calculation was upset by the belated entry of Sarath Fonseka into the fray. As military commander of the operation, General Fonseka laid equal claim to the success, and, therefore, its dividends. The election results show that he either failed to convince the electorate about the justifiability of those claims or the justifiability of claiming the post of president on the basis of those claims. For, whatever the rhetoric, there ought to be no confusion over the fact that the electoral contest in Sri Lanka was fought under the shadow of a single, overarching agenda  the evaluation of the war. The promise of hope and welfare for the minorities was the fringe element, as were the minorities themselves. If they at all entered the scene, it was because of the fear that the predominant population would be unable to give a clear verdict. It was this fear that drove the incumbent president to hasten rehabilitation and impelled his principal opponent to make pious promises.        
	Contrary to fears, however, Sri Lankas electorate has been able to give a clear verdict. What made this possible was perhaps the complete lack of guile of the opposition  left, right and centre  which hurriedly clambered atop Mr Fonsekas bandwagon. The patchwork coalition of widely disparate political parties and the confused picture it presented could not diminish Mr Rajapaksas popularity in vast stretches of rural Sri Lanka, although in urban areas and in the Tamil and Muslim north and east, it did build up an anti-incumbency and anti-corruption trend. That is where Mr Fonsekas votes came from, and also where his political future lies as a self-proclaimed proponent of greater democracy. Mr Rajapaksa has returned to office buoyed by an enormous Sinhala mandate. Hopefully, that will not discourage him from promoting welfare of the minorities and their political inclusion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Small change, big move
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SMALL CHANGE, BIG MOVE                          - Repeating truisms will not make education world-class        Tapas Majumdar                                                  
	Recently we have had some excellent common-sense suggestions on education emanating from within the academia. I hope these are not voices in the wilderness, though there is also a surrounding cacophony that may drown these voices. The noise comes from experts who seem to think it is necessary to go on reiterating a few indisputable (and undisputed) propositions as parts of education policy.        
	Nobody can have a dispute with truisms. What may be disputable, however, lies around the question of their relevance for deciding what needs to be done now and in the immediate future, and how feasible the projected outcomes are within the promised time span. The usually allowed truisms of the kind two plus two make four by themselves will not take us far: factual projections have to go a little further and examine the feasibility of what is being targeted within a projected time frame. To give an example, what I call only a truism is currently in vogue. It has caught the attention of the policymakers mainly because it is simple to remember and easy to repeat without any fear of contradiction. It goes as follows: a large number of richly endowed national universities (all world-class) will serve Indias needs in the higher education sector better than a small number of meagrely endowed universities that we have now got.              
	Who has ever disputed that? If a very large number of new world-class universities (say 30  the suggested number goes on swinging around it) have to be set up in India  most of them from scratch  covering every state of our republic, as has been promised, then that would be an excellent thing. If, moreover, these could be run from places (like Noida, for example) hitherto unsuspected of the capability of running institutions of postgraduate teaching (not to speak of postdoctoral research), the new world-class universities would be nonpareil in the whole world. If these could be fully functioning even in five decades and also be given credible world-class leadership (with vice-chancellors of the standing that one associates with world-class universities and professors, some of whom would be their academic equals or even better, as it happens in Oxford, Cambridge or London), then that indeed would be wonderful and beyond all praise. But how wise would it be to chase wild geese with the kind of human resources we have? Let me tell you a funny little story I had once heard to embellish this.        
	The president (the American version of the vice-chancellor) of a well-known American university was being taken round a famous Oxbridge college. The president was particularly impressed by the beautiful college lawns that appeared to be laid out regularly in two tints of green apparently out of the same grass. How was this done? The president was eager to know. Only the head gardener knew, he was told. So the head gardener was called. He came and explained how easy it was. You just had to mow the grass in one direction from one side and in the opposite direction from the other side and go on mowing like this. The president was amazed. He wanted to buy off the gardener and hire him on the spot. And how long will this take? he asked. About a hundred years, I reckon, replied the head gardener.        
	Going by my own past experience, the only example I have been fortunate enough to witness in my lifetime was one conglomeration of vice-chancellor/director and nearly a dozen world-class professors engaged in building a truly world-class institution. The latter assembled at the Delhi School of Economics at the University of Delhi. Many of them had been persuaded to join the DSE mainly by V.K.R.V. Rao. Even this effort had to fail after a period of what may be called the DSEs golden age. The reasons for that failure will have to be completely sorted out one day.         
	The only other venture of this kind that I have heard of was at Calcutta University much earlier  around the 1920s. This one had covered a much larger canvas over a number of disciplines in the arts and sciences. The most illustrious of the Calcutta University professors then were hand-picked from all over India (and in the case of Arabic and fine arts from outside India). Moreover, the induction of C.V. Raman from the Indian finance service itself was another courageous venture without which the world probably would have gone without at least one other Nobel laureate. Those moves had been made under the leadership of Ashutosh Mookerjee. I still remember Hiren Mukerji (no relation) once gently exhorting some of his comrades at the Jawaharlal Nehru University to follow this example of building a truly national university. This was at one of the earliest sessions of the JNU academic council (or perhaps the court) about 40 years ago. Some of the listeners looked startled, for they had possibly been expecting a harangue from Hiren Mukerji decrying the rightist elitism of our great universities. But Calcutta Universitys glorious years too began to fade away soon after the death of Sir Ashutosh. The dream finally had to end. Even the glimmer has now gone.        
	Let me move away from grand national policies. Far less spectacular than the grandiose plans, there are some genuinely useful ideas, though somewhat less breathtaking. We owe these to some of our better-known academics (like Sukanta Chaudhuri, April 1, 2010, Dipankar Dasgupta, April 13, 2010 and Andr Bteille, April 22, 2010 in this column and many others elsewhere).        
	To ones relief, our thinkers are ready to think out of the box and are obviously not prepared to go by the normally unquestioned and predetermined official agenda. The contents of that box in official hands are, of course, routinely rehashed, but seldom re-examined or changed with change of government or of important ministers. We are always in such great hurry for big things that we are left with little time for small ones.              
	I will now end with another of my stories. And this is a true one. I wanted to sell a cost-saving idea to the then minister of human resource development. I failed. I had already sent my idea to an even higher authority who had responded kindly and sent me a long, gracious. and friendly reply. But again, as the English put it, No joy.         
	What was my idea? It was a childishly simple one. I pleaded and am still pleading for a small change. This was to reintroduce a practice that was not only prevalent in India in our schooldays but is also seen today in many schools, colleges and universities in many countries. This was pleading for fast track routes. Everybody should join the education system down at the bottom. But anybody (a) found working significantly harder to join the workforce ahead of others or (b) found to be of extraordinary talent should be given the opportunity of short cuts like double promotion (even treble promotion) to reach the top earlier than the rest. Instead of being allowed to go faster, even our best students are forced now to wait for at least three or four years and earn a couple of extra degrees to be allowed to start being world-class. Those like Amartya Sen and Sukhamoy Chakravarty now are losing those vital years. Nobody is gaining anything by this. India, in fact, the world, is losing out. To my mind fast-tracking was a real cost-saving device in education. However, it promised no five-yearly dividend to any political party for advocating it.

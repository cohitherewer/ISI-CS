Jayal                        Follow the script				                                             
	There was never any doubt that sooner rather than later, terrorists would strike again. It is also known that there are terrorist organizations allergic to any improvement in Indo-Pak relations. These would have been factored into the governments decision to reverse its earlier stand and invite Pakistan for secretary- level talks. Yet, when the inevitable terror strike does take place, the government finds itself in a classical dilemma: damned if you talk to Pakistan and damned if you dont.        
	To a nation that does not think and plan strategically, the latest dilemma is an inevitable consequence and certainly not the last. In the 1990s, George K. Tanham of Rand Corporation, in a published study called Indian Strategic Thought: An Interpretive Essay, had concluded that Indian elites show little evidence of having thought coherently and systematically about national strategy.         
	Historically, on issues relating to foreign policy and national security, statecraft has been missing in our governance. During the first war in Kashmir, our forces saved the Kashmir Valley from the invaders, but were ordered to halt their advance when the invaders were on the run. We ignored the larger security implications when the Chinese annexed Tibet. We termed our commanders alarmist when they raised warnings about the Chinese threat prior to Chinas aggression in 1962. We chose to repatriate 93,000 Pakistani prisoners of war without having Pakistan sign a clause  that was drafted  to convert the Line of Control into the international border. We have closed our eyes to massive infiltration from Bangladesh. We patronized the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which then turned on our soldiers, killing over 1,200 of them. Even our response to the audacious Kargil misadventure was cautious and apologetic.        
	In more recent times, the January 2004 joint statement by A.B. Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf was carefully negotiated in spite of Pakistans reservations, and Pakistan committed itself to stop cross-border violence and to ensure that no part of the territory under its control, including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, shall be used for terrorism. This was in return for a sustained dialogue between the two countries. Inexplicably, in 2005, the joint statement by Manmohan Singh and Musharraf accepted that terrorism will not be allowed to thwart the peace process, thus giving Pakistan the licence to continue with its policy of terror even while supporting dialogue. In Havana, we even co-opted Pakistan as a fellow- sufferer from terrorism and in Sharm el-Sheikh, we accepted the inclusion of Baluchistan as a joint issue. If all this is part of a strategic plan, the people of India deserve to be told so: otherwise, to them, these are flip-flops.        
	Not surprisingly, India was duly rewarded for its supine policy with a military-style commando attack on Mumbai, an attack that could only have been planned and executed with the Pakistan armys backing. We paid with over 170 lives, including many foreign ones, and with egg on our Gandhian face. The best that a miffed India, with the fourth largest military in the world, could do was to stop any further dialogue with Pakistan until the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack were brought to book.         
	Unlike India, Pakistan plays to a script and it has used the past 15 months to let India drift back to its soft ways. Under pressure from the United States of America to play a more active role in the AfPak region, it has pleaded its inability because of threats on the Indian border. It knows only too well that the US and its allies in Afghanistan need its support, and it is extracting every ounce from them at Indias cost.         
	When India suddenly has a change of heart and invites Pakistan for talks, not only are the people of India taken by surprise, but there are whispers that India is acting under pressure from the US. Faced with a proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir and repeated terrorist attacks across India, the people are being led to believe that appeasement and dialogue are the only options left with us. War is not an option has become the soft mantra.         
	Certainly our use of soft power to help development in Afghanistan is a wise move that will pay dividends in the long term. But Indias reluctance to contribute to elements of hard power to prevent the Talibanization of Afghanistan has resulted in India being completely sidelined in the evolving international dialogue on Afghanistan. For the present Pakistan is laughing, although it remains to be seen for how long.         
	None of this casts a particularly bright light on the abilities of Indias national security and foreign policy institutions to further our own national security and strategic interests. Pakistan, on the other hand, persists with its policy of bleeding India through a thousand cuts while being in denial. Its international friends and allies have accepted this duplicity, partly because of their own interests and partly because it did not directly hurt them. Until 9/11 happened.         
	Today, engaged as they are militarily in Afghanistan, the US and its allies are facing the same duplicity that India has for decades. The US continues to pump aid into Pakistan, knowing full well that Pakistan is going soft on the Taliban. Pakistan continues to be selective in engaging terrorist organizations and persists in its use of terror as an instrument of State policy towards India. Both sides know the duplicitous game being played on the AfPak and regional geo-political chessboard, and both are planning future moves. India remains a hapless bystander, uninvited to the chess table and merely bearing the consequences.        
	The Pakistan army has held sway over the country for six decades or more. Every important functionary of the US, from the secretary of state down, while making pro forma calls on the president and prime minister, ultimately knocks on General Kayanis door. Today, the army is deeply involved in both politics and commerce in that country. Its intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, is a State within a State, and the various terrorist groups and the Taliban are all its creations and are dubbed as strategic assets. The stakes for it as an institution are too great to let go of its unfettered power and pelf. It is in the Pakistan armys interests, therefore, to keep the bogey of threat from India alive. India should be in no doubt that if Kashmir and other issues were to be settled, new ones will erupt.         
	Under General Zias patronage, elements of religion and hate were introduced in the Pakistan army and the government school curriculum. Today, there is a whole generation of children from government schools in Pakistan that has been brought up on a diet of Hindu India planning for the downfall of Islam and the destruction of Pakistan. Add to these, products of the madrasas who are bred on even deeper fundamentalist and hate ideologies. The army itself is far more radicalized. So dont be surprised to see crowds of thousands cheering speeches of venom against India, delivered from a stage adorned by terrorist leaders. These are by no means the innocuous rent-a-crowd types that our political parties are used to; they are genuinely baying for Indian blood.        
	From the Lahore peace process to Kargil, and from Havana to Mumbai, Pakistan continues to deceive the mighty Indian foreign and security establishments  not to mention its allies in the war on terror. Rather than work to a strategic plan, we are back to knee-jerk reactions shunning institution-driven foreign and security policies. A non- institutionalized approach is more in keeping with dictatorships and not befitting the largest democracy in the world. Worse, it is a recipe for disaster in a highly unstable region where major international interests are directly in contact with regional ones. This leaves the hapless people of India confused. Terrorists strike at will, the government continues with its flip-flops without taking them into confidence, the Parliament is disinterested and political parties use any opportunity to score brownie points.              
	This writer is by no means a hawk. Yet, for a nation with the fourth largest military in the world to be bullied by a failing state like Pakistan makes one wonder what has happened to the Chanakyas of today. It is time for India to get real and face the incontrovertible fact that unless the Pakistan army changes its anti-India mindset, things will only get worse for Pakistan and India. This is the bottom line. Talk we must. But there must be a strategy and script. Since the US and Pakistan both profess to be engaged in the war on terror, and India is a victim, let there be tripartite talks between the US, India and Pakistan. The sole agenda will be the elimination of terror from the region and internationally, and let each put their money where their mouth is. For once, we will be walking the talk rather than endlessly talking about talks.

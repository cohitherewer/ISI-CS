	The greatest art form of the 20th century has not been well served by those who write about it. As a source of entertainment and education, films have had a greater impact than literature and music, or even sport. Yet, at least in India, writing on cinema veers between two equally unpalatable extremes  gossip and scandal about film stars on the one hand and jargon-ridden exercises in political correctness on the other.        
	A sterling exception to an otherwise depressing trend is the work of the documentary film-maker and writer, Nasreen Munni Kabir. Her biography of Guru Dutt, her cultural history of Bollywood, and her published conversations with Javed Akhtar wonderfully illuminate the place of film in the life of modern India. I have just finished a book that, by looking at images of India in films made abroad, complements Kabirs work. Entitled From Rajahs and Yogis to Gandhi and Beyond, it is written by Vijaya Mulay, who  like Nasreen Munni Kabir  is at once a scholar, practitioner, and fan. A pioneer of the film society movement of the 1950s, Mulay has also won awards for her documentaries. Her book draws on the experience of seven decades spent watching, making, promoting, and writing about films. It uses an extraordinarily wide range of materials: documentaries, docu-dramas and feature films of varying length (and quality) made in a dozen languages, here sourced from libraries and archives all over the world. These visual sources are supplemented by books, articles and some unpublished and most revealing letters.              
	As Mulay shows, in films made in Europe in the early 20th century, India was portrayed as an exotic and colourful land of spiritualists and seers. It was an Other to be surprised, puzzled, and enchanted by, not (contra Edward Said) an Other to be suppressed or mocked at. Made by Continental (not British) directors, these films featured sets full of palm trees, arched balconies and domes, where were enacted various forms of mesmerism, spiritualism, [and] mysticism. A certain Danish film, featuring an improbable romance between an Indian Maharajah and a white-skinned European beauty, was made in no less than three different versions, with the Indian ruler becoming progressively more debauched and degraded.        
	At the same time, a different tradition was inaugurated by the Durbar film, that showcased imperial spectacle and pageantry, with viceroys mounted on large elephants being accompanied by obsequious Maharajas on smaller ones. The Durbar films were followed by commercial features made by Hollywood that likewise sought to honour, commemorate, and (at a pinch) glorify the British connection to India. Here, unruly and disloyal tribes were brought to heel by dashing English officers upholding a public school code of loyalty and honour.        
	The titles of some of these films  Lives of a Bengal Lancer, Gunga Din, Soldiers Three, The Black Watch  give a clue to their underlying ideology. The villains were sometimes rival colonial powers, such as the Turks or the Russians, from whose perfidies the British had to protect the innocent or foolish Indian. Notably, these films presented Muslims in particular in poor light, as cruel, backward and barbarous. The pejorative portrayals were not always taken lying down  thus, in one case documented by Mulay, nationalists from all communities protested against the showing of one particularly anti-Muslim film in Bombay in 1938, picketing theatres and holding public meetings.         
	The British left the subcontinent in 1947, but the interest of Western film-makers in Indian subjects continued. In two fascinating chapters, Mulay deals with the films made on Indian themes by the Frenchmen, Jean Renoir and Louis Malle, the Italian, Roberto Rossellini, and the Swede, Arne Sucksdorff. Their films showed empathy and understanding; free of clich, they were also devoid of any Maharajas, elephants, or tigers. Malle in particular threw himself into Indian life, studying themes as different as classical dance and tribal rituals. Other subjects covered by him included pastoralists, mine-workers, labour strikes, State family planning campaigns, and the game of kabaddi. A film made by Malle on Bombay had shots of the Haji Ali Mosque, a Parsi marriage, a policeman controlling traffic, and an interview with the then relatively young and obscure Shiv Sena leader, Bal Thackeray. A film on Calcutta had shots of betting at the race course, of women at a protest demonstration, of Puja festivities, and of students learning to play the sitar.         
	In a diary of his cinematic journey, Malle said his Indian films expressed a coming to terms with the vivid presence of an ancient civilization where order prevailed, a certain order, unjust, hierarchic, sufficiently subtle to fragment society into myriad pieces. An abiding memory was of shooting a left-wing demonstration in Calcutta and seeing the slogan-shouting radicals fall silent, to meekly make way for a religious procession.        
	Like Malle, Roberto Rossellini successfully shot films in India, yet his work was overshadowed by his eloping with the wife of a Bengali cameraman assigned to help him. The glamour and scandal of that romance has long faded  what endures, through these pages, are the Italians assessments of Indias pre-eminent political leaders.        
	Rossellinis interest in this country was awakened by a visit to Italy by Mahatma Gandhi in 1931. As he wrote later, Gandhi, during the 1930s when the world was like a pot about to boil open, carried immense symbolism. He represented the power of the spirit. He represented destitution and weakness, capable in their redoubtable meekness of making legions retreat and shaking an empire. And again: There was nothing detached or immaterial about him, rather the sensation of a presence awake to the world. The holy man was like a clever mouse, adroit and rapid. The cat had to watch out.        
	Rossellini admired Jawaharlal Nehru as well. Seeing him in action in the India of the 1950s, the Italian visitor wrote astutely of how in this bogged down country, engaged with such gigantic problems, with everything needing to be done at once, the temptation to resort to the radical methods of dictatorship was constant Every nation has a pot of dictator sauce simmering on the back burner. How much greater is the desire to make use of it when poverty is sitting at peoples bedsides? Yet Nehru, trying to build democracy in a situation demanding dictatorship would write newspaper articles under a pseudonym attacking himself. (This assessment, we may note, comes from one who experienced Mussolini and fascism at first-hand.)              
	The chapters on the great European film-makers of the 1950s are followed by crisp assessments of the films on India made by their successors, who included Richard Attenborough, David Lean, and the James Ivory-Ismail Merchant combination. With the exception of Attenboroughs Gandhi, Indians have not really got to see the films analysed by Mulay, another reason why her book is so valuable, as an analysis of how this land and its peoples have been portrayed in the most powerful medium of the 20th century.         
	Vijaya Mulays book is the film studies equivalent of Sujit Mukherjees Foster and Further, which was a superbly rendered account of how India has been represented in novels written by Westerners. I closed her book with one desire and one regret. The desire is to see Malles documentaries on Calcutta and Bombay shot in the 1960s. Although they have sometimes been shown in film festivals, might not there be a market for their DVDs? Will some enterprising individual at least put them up on the Web? The regret is that Rossellini did not make a feature film on Gandhi. Judging by his comments, had he tried his hand at a biopic of the Mahatma, it would have certainly been more nuanced and subtle than Richard Attenboroughs later portrait, if perhaps not quite so popular.

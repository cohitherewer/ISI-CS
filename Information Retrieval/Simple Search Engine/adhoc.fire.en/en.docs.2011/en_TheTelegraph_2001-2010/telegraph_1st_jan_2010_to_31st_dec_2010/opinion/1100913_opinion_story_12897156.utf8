                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Short road to success                  
	Sir  It is shocking that so many Indian sportspersons are testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs (B samples of six wrestlers positive, Sept 7). In a bid to stay ahead of competition, people are capable of doing anything to improve their performance. The countrys reputation was in jeopardy when four wrestlers and two shot-putters, who were selected for the Commonwealth Games, tested positive for methylhexanamine (Four wrestlers fail dope tests, Sept 3). This reminds one of the match-fixing that happens among cricketers. It comes as a big blow to sports enthusiasts when an Arjuna award winner like Rajiv Tomar is found to have used performance-enhancing drugs.          
	The only heartening thing about the episode is that the Wrestling Federation of India has selected new wrestlers to participate in the Games, instead of challenging the results of the drug tests. The Board of Control for Cricket in India, too, should implement stringent rules for cricketers. Stern action should be taken against sportspersons found guilty of taking drugs, so that it serves as a warning to others who may be inclined to take recourse to such unfair means.          
	Yours faithfully,        Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad              
	Sir  Each time a match-fixing or dope scandal is revealed, sports organizations in every nation strongly condemn the athletes and players involved and demand severe punishment for them. However, the outcry soon dies down and no action is taken against the guilty parties. They are even allowed to participate in national and international tournaments. This is the reason for their indiscipline. Swift action against the guilty, like imprisonment or a lifelong ban from participating in sporting events, is required. Every sportsperson should be aware that no one is above the law. The fear of punishment is the only thing that can arrest the widespread corruption in sports.                    
	Yours faithfully,        M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh                    
	Sir  Dope scandals in the world of sport are no longer surprising. There are two kinds of sportspersons who take to performance-enhancing drugs  young athletes who are eager to win titles early in their careers and prove themselves, and older athletes who are past their prime and do not wish to fizzle out. The sprinter, Ben Johnson, who was stripped of his Olympic gold in 1988, reminds us of the first kind, while Marion Jones and Shane Warne belong to the latter category. These unfair methods not only impede the smooth functioning of sporting events, but also adversely affect the morale of committed sportspersons. Even the physicians of the players who are found guilty should be punished.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Terror alert          
	Sir  We live in a dark age where the fundamental right to freedom of expression is overruled by heavy-handed political tactic (Cadres break reporters arm, CM responds: I dont know, Sept 4). The meaning of politics seems to have been reduced to the seizing of peoples land and wealth by employing muscle power. The chief ministers silence on the news of the reporters arm being broken by party cadre can either mean that he cannot do anything, or else, that he does not wish to do anything. The capturing and recapturing of land are part of the ruling partys strategy. It is more important for the party to display its power than to think about the needs and safety of the people.          
	The leaders who mobilize these cadre are using strong-arm tactic on members of the press to show off their power. The role of the media is to protect human rights and to act as the conscience of the common people. We need an environment where people can avail themselves of their right to expression without the threat of violence lurking over them.          
	Yours faithfully,        Uttam Kumar Bhowmik, Tamluk              
	Sir  The violence inflicted on Pronab Mondal of The Telegraph by Left followers, and the threat of drowning faced by an official of the fisheries department from suspected Trinamul Congress supporters (Jheel assault on official, Sept 4) are clear examples of the slipshod manner in which matters of public concern have been addressed over the past decades. This is what the people of West Bengal can anticipate if the approaching elections herald a change of guard. The aforementioned events are proof of how the TMC and the Left function. They have always indulged in a mutual blame game, supplemented by frequent shows of muscle power to prove their strength. The state can, at best, expect a new set of administrators, no different from the present lot, to take over in the future.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Diptimoy De, Calcutta

                
	New name          
	Sir  For want of something better to do, politicians, under the pretext of honouring eminent personalities, have decided to invest their time and the publics hard-earned money in the renaming game (Name game, Aug 27). Cities, streets and parks, in various parts of the country, have fallen victim to this new plan, losing their identity in exchange for one that baffles most people. Keeping in mind that Calcutta has become synonymous with bandhs, maybe our esteemed leaders could rename this state as well. Hitherto, West Bengal has been called Paschim Banga. But given the predominance of bandhs in this state, it would perhaps make better sense to rename it as Paschim Bandha. That would capture the ruling spirit of this state effectively.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kamalini Mazumder, Calcutta

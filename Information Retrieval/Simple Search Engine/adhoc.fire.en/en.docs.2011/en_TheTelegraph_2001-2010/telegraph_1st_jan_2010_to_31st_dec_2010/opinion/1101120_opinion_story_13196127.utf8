	Classical dance is based on a restricted code of communication conveying certain accepted meanings. On this, there is a unspoken agreement between performer and audience, moulded by tradition, habit and custom. Such a grammatical codification raises the question of relevance  has the figure of the classical dancer eternally yearning for her beloved become a stale motif devoid of resonance?        
	Only few dancers are able to transcend this limited code through their passion and creativity. Alarmel Valli is one such Bharatnatyam dancer, who has the rare gift of technical perfection and the ability to interpret her art in her own way. She created the magic of rasanishpatti through her mesmerizing performance at Kalamandir on November 13. The evening began with an invocation celebrating shringar. Using lyrical movements, the petite dancer painted the mood of spring with colour, rhythm, pattern and poise.        
	Trained in the Pandanallur tradition, Valli took her audience on an eclectic journey through the theme of love, using poems in Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, English and Tagores Rodono bhora e basanta. From the nuanced 19th-century padam and javali to contemporary poems, the artist unfolded a celebration of Indian classical dance. Even while performing an ancient javali, she turned a codified idiom of gesture into the authentic language of the self. Her abhinaya went far beyond the stylized expressions of Bharatnatyam and created was out of her own vocabulary. The way Valli altered her gait in order to portray a teenaged nayika was amazing.        
	However, a versatile dancer like Valli could have done away with the literal translation of Rodono bhora e basanta. In Only until the light fades, a poem by Arundhati Subramaniam, music and recitation were blended beautifully. Rajkumar Bharati composed excellent accompanying music. Valli concluded with nrityalahari, where her distinctive style of movement was revealed. Speed, precision and above all her enjoyment in the dance lent a poetic appeal to her performance.

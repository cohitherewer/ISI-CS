	If you have scanned the lists of new books published in the last decade or so, one fact will become immediately apparent: brilliance and originality, by themselves, wont qualify a book for publication. What are preferred are familiarity and simplicity of language and style which the common reader doesnt have to wrestle with to get a hang of what the book is all about. What this means is that books for the niche market are being rejected in favour of the mediocre and the commonplace. What then is the future of scholarly books?        
	There are three basic reasons for the decline of scholarly books. First, university presses, which supported scholarly books because they were an integral part of the universities, are themselves in deep financial crisis. Apart from the Ivy League American universities that are richly endowed, every other university has to be subsidized by outside funding.         
	Second, university libraries, which were the main market for scholarly books, now have to restrict their purchases to highly recommended books. This has meant lower print-runs, higher prices and lower sales, creating a vicious cycle from which the only way out is to cut back on publishing programmes.        
	Third, a great deal of scholarly publishing survived because of the global market or because of co-publishing between the original publisher and other publishers in different territories of the world. Co-publishing meant not just the sharing of markets but also of costs that ensured affordable prices. With the global market shrinking, co-publishing deals have slimmed down too.         
	In this bleak scenario, what does the scholar, who has spent years on his research, do to get his thesis across to his peers for whom the book is primarily written?        
	First, arrange for private funds that would be required to subsidize publication. Let it be said loud and clear: no scholarly book which has a potential market of 500-750 copies is published only at the expense of the publisher today. There is a quid pro quo and it is this: pay the costs of production or arrange for an off-take of half the printing at a price determined by the publisher. There are some other details to be sorted out but the essential point is that the scholar has to arrange for funding if the book is to be published. And this is the case not just in India but all over the world.        
	Second, which is becoming increasingly common, is to place the basic findings on the internet with an offer to send the mimeographed copy on request against a small fee. Cyberspace is free and there are no limits to the space you occupy. If you check out the reading lists of scholarly books and publications, you will find that quite a few refer to the electronic files that are available on the internet. In fact, a Google search on a particular topic will give both the print and electronic editions, complete with author, year of publication and other details that are required to cite research sources for studies.        
	Clearly, in future, the traditional form of scholarly publishing will have to be combined with electronic forms that are freely available on the internet. Scholars will simply have to accept the technological changes that have come about in the last decade. There is no going back to the print format alone.

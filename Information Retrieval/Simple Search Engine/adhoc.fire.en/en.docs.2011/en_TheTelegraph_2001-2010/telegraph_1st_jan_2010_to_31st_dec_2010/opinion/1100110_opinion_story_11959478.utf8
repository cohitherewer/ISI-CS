	 When it comes to probity in public life, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh comes second to none. Just the other day, his daughter, Upinder Singh, a professor at Delhi University, was one of the recipients of the inaugural Infosys Prize. Chosen in the category of social sciences, Upinder was being honoured for her outstanding contribution to ancient and early medieval history of India. Although the proud father attended the ceremony, he firmly, but politely, declined the organizers request to give away the awards. It was even suggested that the function be held at his Race Course Road residence. But that too was turned down, and the organizers were asked to look for an alternative venue. Manmohan seemed determined to set aside his august political mantle for the day. He decided to follow the proceedings from the sidelines, not as the leader of the nation but as a loving father, watching his daughter receive her award from Vice-President Hamid Ansari.                
	 After scores of chintan baithaks, fiery exchanges and finally a change of guards, the Bharatiya Janata Party is supposed to have made a fresh start. But a pan-Indian vision is certainly still not its USP. With Nitin Gadkari taking over as the president, the Maharashtra lobby of the party has been set all aflutter. Regional sentiments have come tumbling out of the closet. The race is on among the leaders in Maharashtra to curry favour with the new in-charge. From Prakash Javadekar, the party spokesperson, to Bal Apte, the vice-president, to Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, an academic, everyone wants to be in Gadkaris circle of trust. From having to reckon with only one R all his life (the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), the big man is learning to deal with a new R (regionalism).                            
	 Change is indeed the flavour of the season in the BJP. As new faces come into the picture, old hands seem to be fading away mysteriously. It has suddenly struck some that the suave and smooth-talking Nalin Kohli of the BJPs media cell has not been seen for a while now. In the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls last year, the Wholly-Solely-Mr Kohli was all over the place, making his colleagues quite redundant. But since the washout of his party, hes gone into hiding. Some say hes gone off to Mumbai or to Sri Lanka, waiting to make a comeback. Last spotted, Kohli was in Sanchi in October last year, accompanying the Sri Lankan prime minister, Ratnasiri Wickremanayake, to the inauguration of a Buddhist prayer centre.                            
	 Meanwhile, Nalin Kohlis mentor, M Venkaiah Naidu, seems to have taken on his protgs mantle. These days, Naidu is butting in everywhere, even when he is not particularly wanted. He is desperate to make his presence felt with the new dispensation, which means a lot of running around. If he is in Dehradun one day, hes off to Indore the next. Never mind if there arent any garlands to greet him, Naidu is a good sport: he carries one with him for the local leaders to do the honours.                            
	 While some have been struggling to return to the limelight, Lady Luck seems to be smiling down on others. Think of Anil Sharma, the state Congress chief of Bihar. Recently, his detractors were lobbying hard to get rid of him  only to be shocked out of their wits. In spite of their best efforts, Sharma has been given the responsibility of leading the party in the assembly elections, coming up later this year.                             
	 The Union home secretary, Gopal Krishna Pillai, is believed to be suffering from the foot-in-the-mouth disease. The good bureaucrat is in the habit of blurting out the truth, however inconvenient it might be. That explains why Pillai has made a name for himself for jumping the gun. First, he hurriedly announced that Hyderabad would be the capital of the proposed state of Telangana. (Till now, the division of kingdom seems like a remote possibility.) Before the embers of one controversy had died down, he went on to make another explosive statement, this time on the Maoists. While it may not exactly be faux pas to say that the Maoists are stocking up on arms from China, Pillai was forced to clarify that he was not referring to the Chinese government. But even there, he could not resist a rejoinder, saying that the Centre would soon launch a massive attack on the Maoists. Which is all fine and well  only such plans are best not touted around with great fanfare. Looks like Pillais much-worried boss, P Chidambaram, has a new worry on his mind.

	 Narain Dutt Tiwari has a way of dealing with the media. The other day, a scribe confronted him in Dehradun with the news that a Delhi-based lawyer is now claiming to be his son. To which, the ever graceful Tiwari replied without batting an eyelid, Desh ke lakhon, caroron naujawan mere bete hain (Hundreds of young men all over the country are my sons). While in Dehradun, Tiwari was also spotted reading a newspaper carrying a long report on the president of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, getting married to his fifth wife, Thobeka Madiba, in the village of Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal. It may be making too much out of nothing, but a Tiwari supporter was heard gushing excitedly about liberal social norms in South Africa. To which the elderly man nodded his full approval.

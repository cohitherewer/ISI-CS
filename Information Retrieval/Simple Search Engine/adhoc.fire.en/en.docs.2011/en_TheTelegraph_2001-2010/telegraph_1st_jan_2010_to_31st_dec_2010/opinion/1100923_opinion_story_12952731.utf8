	Final call                  
	Sir  The Allahabad High Court has taken the right step by refusing to postpone the Ayodhya verdict (In glow of emergency lamp, chorus for Ayodhya verdict, Sept 18). The nation is eagerly awaiting the verdict, which will be delivered 60 years after the lawsuit was filed. The judgment will help the people of India put the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhoomi dispute behind them. One hopes that on September 24, when the court will deliver the verdict, the nation will accept it in the right spirit. Although certain groups headed by religious fanatics and political leaders look for every opportunity to create a furore, the common man, whether he is a Hindu or a Muslim, is unlikely to challenge the court order. The aam admi is more worried about issues such as inflation, food and water scarcity, civic amenities, healthcare, the threat to security from Maoists, terrorists and so on  problems that affect him directly, and on a daily basis.          
	The government should take strong measures to ensure that no more blood is shed in the name of religion. Hindu and Muslim leaders should not exploit the peoples sentiments and instigate them to violence after the court has passed the judgment. Such unrest is totally undesirable, especially as the Commonwealth Games are just a few days away. India will be able to achieve development, peace and harmony only when its political and religious leaders learn to accept the court judgment with an open heart.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Allahabad High Court is all set to announce the final verdict on the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhoomi dispute. The people of India have been asked by the government to maintain peace and order. However, owing to provocation from religious and political leaders, Hindus and Muslims might indulge in violence, thereby posing a huge threat to law and order after the delivery of the judgment. The outbreak of communal clashes before the Commonwealth Games would adversely affect the event and dent our national pride.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Eighteen years after the demolition of the mosque in Ayodhya, the Allahabad High Court will pass an order concerning the Ram temple issue. Hopefully, its verdict will be just and unbiased. Given the slow pace of justice in India, court cases remain unresolved for decades. Even when a judgment is delivered in a particular case, it is often vague and inconclusive. The high court must be careful while dealing with the Ayodhya case as the issue has been heavily politicized. It is evident that political parties care very little for the common people and their suffering. The demolition of the Babri Masjid created severe religious tension in several parts of the country. Yet, no measures have been taken by the government to stop politicians from luring voters by exploiting caste and religious differences. The Indian citizens hope that justice will be delivered on this occasion.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is heartening that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has advised members of the minority community to exercise restraint after the court order. Leaders of the Hindu outfits should also advise their followers to maintain amity with their Muslim brothers. Violence in the name of religion must not be encouraged under any circumstances. Both Hindu and Muslim leaders should request fanatical religious elements to give up violence and resort to peaceful demonstrations to voice their grievances.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Empty promise          
	Sir  A political leader of Mamata Banerjees stature must desist from making irresponsible comments (Mamata job promise in CPM bastion, Sept 19). This time, she has announced that if she is voted to power, she will create jobs for at least one member of every family that has suffered at the hands of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). This promise displays a very partisan attitude. It is unbecoming of a leader who aspires to be the chief minister of West Bengal. One is tempted to ask Banerjee whether she would do the same thing for families that have been victims of violence perpetrated by her party. Banerjee should think of holistic development and shun petty politics if she is to win the forthcoming polls.                    
	Yours faithfully,

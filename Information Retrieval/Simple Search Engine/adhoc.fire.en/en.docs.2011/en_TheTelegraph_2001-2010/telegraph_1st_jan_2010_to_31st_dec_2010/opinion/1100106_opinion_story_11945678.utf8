	More than anything else, mutual trust can make all the difference in relations between two countries. If relations between India and Bangladesh have not been very constructive in recent years, it was clearly because of a trust deficit. New Delhi has an opportunity to initiate a course correction during the forthcoming visit of Bangladeshs prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, to India. True, for many years, India had reasons to be worried about certain developments in Bangladesh. The growth of Islamist forces there posed a major security threat to India. New Delhi had concerns over militants from Indias Northeast having their arms-training camps or hideouts within Bangladesh. But then, Dhaka too had its complaints about Indias policies, especially over trade-related issues and sharing of river water. Some political parties in Bangladesh may be keen to whip up anti-India sentiments for their partisan interests, but there is no denying that India has not done enough to earn the confidence of policymakers and of the people in Bangladesh. There is a general impression in Dhaka that India demands too much from it and is prepared to give too little in return.         
	The large imbalance in India-Bangladesh trade would surely figure prominently in Ms Wajeds discussions with Indias prime minister, Manmohan Singh. Bangladesh may not have many goods which will find a large market in India, but India can lower the tariff and non-tariff barriers on imports from Bangladesh. And the Indian offer has to match Dhakas wish list. In the past, New Delhi withdrew the barriers on some Bangladeshi items, but those were not the items that were high on Bangladeshs priority list. A more flexible Indian approach on trade can go a long way in making its relations with Bangladesh more fruitful. Yet another Bangladeshi complaint  about access for its goods to Nepal, Bhutan and to Indias Northeast  should be addressed by New Delhi seriously. If India wants transit through Bangladesh for shipping its goods to the Northeast, Dhaka can logically expect a similar facility through India for its goods to reach out to Nepal and Bhutan. In both countries, the transit issue raises questions about security and sovereignty. What New Delhi offers to Ms Wajed will be important, but a changed mindset and a regular mechanism for cooperation could be more useful.

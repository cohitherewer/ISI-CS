Nayar                          Manmohan Singh at the fourth IBSA summit, April 15, 2010                                              
	If help in times of need is the test of friendship, South Africa has just proved to be Indias friend. If such assistance is among the criteria to judge the worth of one of the new, nascent, exclusive clubs in international diplomacy, then the India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum has won its first test.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was in Brasilia when transatlantic air travel was almost entirely halted and international civil aviation severely disrupted on account of ash from Icelands Eyjafjallajkull volcano last month. Singh was to fly from Brazil to Germany and halt in Frankfurt on the way home from back-to-back IBSA and Brazil-Russia-India-China summits, when word came that Europe had closed almost all its airports.        
	It is well known by now that the prime ministers special plane was re-routed through Africa on its flight path from Brasilia, but the intense diplomatic efforts behind the scenes, which made it possible for Singh to undertake his return journey as scheduled, was a key test that IBSA passed.        
	On the face of it, re-routing a plane might appear to be a routine task; nothing more than a detour during a drive to avoid a roadwork. But when a prime minister travels, especially one who is as carefully protected as Indias head of government, a VVIP flight change requires weeks or even months to plan. It is entirely to the credit of the commerce minister, Anand Sharma, that the prime minister, who dislikes staying out of the country even for a few hours more than required, was not only able to return home as planned, but landed in New Delhi several hours ahead of schedule to expeditiously deal with the IPL crisis in his council of ministers.        
	On the morning before Singhs departure from Brasilia, as the prime ministers aides presented an unedifying spectacle of being at sixes and sevens following Europes airport closures, it was the commerce minister who came up with the plan that the VVIP flight should be diverted to Johannesburg. When the idea was greeted with scepticism and confusion by those who should have been actually planning the prime ministers travel, Sharma, as the senior-most member after Singh on the Indian delegation to IBSA and BRIC summits, took charge.              
	The special protection group, which is in charge of the prime ministers security, demurred about going to Johannesburg without its advance party rehearsing Singhs minute-by-minute movement in South Africa that has become the norm for prime ministerial travel since the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Even after the prime ministers flight eventually landed in Johannesburg, the SPG did not allow Singh to leave the aircraft and go down because the cars that would have ferried him anywhere had not been security cleared. The SPG also objected to Singh going into any part of the terminal because it had not been sanitized for security.        
	Air India complained that Johannesburg was not an on-line station for the airline: it does not fly to South Africa. That meant there would be no Air India personnel at the airport, and the VVIP flight would be entirely at the mercy of South African Airways ground staff once it touched down. If something went wrong, there would be hell to pay, and heads would roll as they inevitably do on such occasions.        
	But Sharma persisted and showed leadership by getting everybody to agree on the diversion. In any case, the others had not come up with any viable alternative. They only did not want to take risks or shoulder responsibility. The commerce minister then spoke to the South African minister of international relations and cooperation, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, an old friend from the days when she was South Africas high commissioner to India for six years. She told Sharma straight out to consider it done.        
	But the hard work, which was to last throughout that day and well into the night before the prime minister emplaned the next morning, was only beginning. The Air India special flight would have to overfly five countries  Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia and Madagascar in addition to South Africa  and permission was required from all these countries at short notice. Vivek Katju, secretary (West) in the ministry of external affairs, who was in Brasilia, spoke to the heads of Indian missions in these countries and they immediately approached the foreign ministries and other authorities in their jurisdictions for the necessary clearances.        
	It was fortuitous that Vikram Doraiswami, consul general in Johannesburg, who was private secretary to the prime minister during his first term, was in Brasilia and on board the VVIP flight. In terms of local contacts, his presence made up for the drawback that Johannesburg was not an on-line station for Air India.        
	Although IBSA passed its first test last month, and the prime ministers flight made its way through Africa without any hitch after obtaining all the clearances in an impressive 24-hour cycle, the entire episode raises questions, which have a bearing on IBSAs future.        
	Connectivity is one of the major handicaps in the way of realizing the promised potential of cooperation among India, Brazil and South Africa. While Air India has been unable to use bilateral air-service agreements between India and South Africa on the one hand and India and Brazil on the other, in addition to IBSA air-service agreements, Emirates airline has exploited the opportunity offered by a growing traffic and is flying Indians to Brazil on its extremely convenient non-stop service from Dubai to Sao Paulo. For that matter, where Air India should have stepped in, leading European carriers have been tapping into the ethnic traffic to Latin America by flying Indians to Sao Paulo, which has become the commercial aviation hub of the entire Latin American region.        
	At one time, Air India considered starting a Delhi-Johannesburg-Sao Paulo flight as a political message in the spirit of IBSA. Perhaps Sharma could show the same initiative which he showed in pushing through the prime ministers flight and get Air India to start this service as something that is in the commerce ministrys interest as a way of easing the connectivity handicaps within IBSA.        
	Because this service was not there, and Johannesburg is not an on-line station for Air India, the airline could not get any relief crew to replace those who had flown the VVIP plane from Brazil to South Africa and served their maximum duty time permitted under the rules for cabin and cockpit crew. The crew led by captain Atul Soman was clearly showing visible signs of strain by the time the prime minister reached Delhi, but it was one of those occasions when the much-maligned staff of Air India performed admirably.        
	Just as the SPG did not allow Singh to leave the aircraft for security reasons in Johannesburg, it did not want Air India to bring any relief crew from any home station to South Africa because they had not been security cleared. Ironically, one set of crew, which had the necessary security clearance, had already been flown to Frankfurt and was waiting there to relieve those who had flown Singh from Brasilia. But once Europe closed its airports, these crew members could not fly anywhere out of Frankfurt and were stuck there.              
	If a Delhi-Johannesburg-Sao Paulo service had been in place, Air India would not have had the problem of not having its people on the ground for the special flight carrying the head of government. Eventually, Air India flew in some ground staff from Nairobi via Lagos at the eleventh hour. It was yet another sign that IBSA had passed its first test when the South African government allowed these Air India personnel to be transferred directly from their plane to the location of the prime ministers plane without going through immigration and customs at Johannesburg. Without that gesture, the ground staff would not have made it to the VVIP aircraft.Once they found out that the prime minister would stay put on the aircraft during refuelling, the South Africans made special efforts to speed up the refuelling process even at the dead of night by using hydraulic pumps instead of the usual ground platforms.        
	Unexpectedly, the detour which was forced on Singh has started a debate about prime ministers stopping in Europe instead of Africa on their transatlantic travel. As a Congressman who grew up believing in the core values of the party, Sharma may want to persuade the prime minister to stop over in Africa instead of the richer West European cities as a way of reaching out to that continent ever more.

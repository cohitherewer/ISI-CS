	All for Bengal                  
	Sir  One cannot accuse only the Lalu Prasads of being biased when our own Mamata Banerjee is so. She has inaugurated some 40 trains from Howrah in the last few months for the benefit of Bengalis. Even the Duranto trains have been introduced to appease Bengalis, who are in large numbers in cities like Bangalore, Pune and Mumbai, where these trains go. Banerjee was eager to have the Tatas leave Singur, but now wants the Indian Railways to set up factories in Midnapore. If this is not parochial, what is it?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Future plans          
	Sir  Instead of dealing with Pakistan with an iron hand for nurturing terrorists, the US administration, headed by Barack Obama, plans to increase the aid to Pakistans military (US offers Pak army $2bn aid, Oct 23). It is ridiculous that when the Obama government is claiming to fight terror groups, it is helping a country like Pakistan, which is almost synonymous with terrorism.           
	It is not that the United States of America is unaware of Pakistans intentions. It probably wants unrest to prevail in South Asia so that Indias progress is hampered. We do not know whether the USs proposed aid to Pakistan will be discussed during Obamas visit to India next month. But we should not expect lasting peace in South Asia until the US alters its policy of following double standards.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Barack Obama is going to visit India early next month. Large-scale preparations are being made for his visit. The hope that he will bring about rapid solutions to the problems besetting India is unfounded. Our leaders should rather try to understand the USs weaknesses, and make it agree to our demands on our own terms. It is unfortunate that our leaders, unlike those of China, whimper before the US. Historically, the US has never been Indias closest ally. Despite increasing evidence of Pakistan- sponsored terrorism, the US has not taken any action against that country. On the contrary, it has been continuously providing Pakistan with aid.           
	The US is primarily interested in its own commercial gains. It can even support dictators like the former Pakistan president, Pervez Musharraf, if that suits its financial interests. So the USs claim to being a champion of human rights is actually false. India should not expect much from President Obamas visit. We should instead set the condition that if the US does not support us on certain issues, we will boycott American products and cancel all trade agreements with it. We should remember that a cordial Indo-US relationship is more to the advantage of the US than of India. The US is bound to India by trade ties, which it cannot afford to sever.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Its a shame          
	Sir  The Shiv Sena has lived up to its reputation by forcing Mumbai University to drop Rohinton Mistrys book, Such a Long Journey, from its BA syllabus (Young blood, Oct 20). If thats a shame then its a pity that the university vice-chancellor, instead of resisting the Senas strong-arm tactics, complied with the demand. Such instances of cowardice embolden those who hold civil society to ransom.           
	Yours faithfully,

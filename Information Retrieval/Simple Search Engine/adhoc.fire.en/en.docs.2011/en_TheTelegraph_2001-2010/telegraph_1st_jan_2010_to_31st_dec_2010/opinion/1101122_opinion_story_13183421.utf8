	People love historical analogies. So its easy to think of Aung San Suu Kyis release from house arrest as Myanmars Mandela moment. When Nelson Mandela was freed from 27 years of imprisonment in 1990, it marked the start of a process that saw the negotiated end of the apartheid regime, followed by genuinely free elections in just four years. Maybe that sort of thing will now happen in Myanmar too.        
	That would be nice, but it would be unwise to bet the farm on it. The Lady, as everybody in Myanmar calls her, has the same combination of saintly forbearance and tough political realism that enabled Mandela to lead the transition to democracy so successfully in South Africa. But her situation is very different.        
	South Africa was utterly isolated politically, and its economy was crumbling under the impact of sanctions. The Myanmarese regime has diplomatic relations with its trading partners in Southeast Asia and a powerful supporter in China. Myanmarese living standards are dramatically lower than those in neighbouring countries due to 40 years of corrupt and incompetent military rule. But the economy is growing.        
	And the most important difference: when the South African president, F.W. de Klerk, freed Mandela in 1990, he already knew that the apartheid regime was doomed. He wanted to negotiate a non-violent transition to a democratic system that would preserve a place for South Africas white minority. Mandela was the best negotiating partner he could hope for.        
	The regime that has just released Suu Kyi, by contrast, does not think it has lost, and a transition to a genuinely democratic system is the last thing on its mind. It has just finished an elaborate charade of elections under a new constitution. It already has all the democracy it wants.        
	Why did Myanmars military rulers bother to construct a pseudo-democratic faade like this? After all, their power really rests on their willingness, demonstrated again three years ago, to kill unarmed civilian protesters. They dont care about being loved, so long as they are feared.                
	Uncertain route        
	But they are as concerned about preserving the countrys independence as any other Myanmarese, and that makes it desirable to end Western sanctions against the regime. They are hugely dependent on China as an investor and a market for their raw materials, and that is not a comfortable position for any Myanmarese to be in. If Suu Kyi can persuade the Western powers to end sanctions against Myanmar  and she has already hinted that she will help  then the regime can use better relations with the West to counterbalance Chinas overweening influence in the country.        
	Obviously, the regime is betting that it can use The Lady in ending sanctions without risking its own hold on power; and perhaps it is right. She faces a hard task in rebuilding her party, which split over the question of whether to participate in the recent bogus elections. Even if she succeeds, the generals can always arrest her again and lock her away for as many years as they like. But they could still lose their bet.        
	The citation for Suu Kyis Nobel Prize in 1991 called her a shining example of the power of the powerless  and that power is real. It could be seen in the adoring crowds who came out to see her when she was freed. Like Mandela in apartheid South Africa, or Vclav Havel in communist Czechoslovakia, or Gandhi in colonial India, she is a realist about power and fear.         
	Despite all odds, those other heroes of non-violence got what they were really struggling for in the end: a free and democratic country. Suu Kyi could ultimately achieve that too, even though it is hard to see from here the precise route that might lead her to that goal.

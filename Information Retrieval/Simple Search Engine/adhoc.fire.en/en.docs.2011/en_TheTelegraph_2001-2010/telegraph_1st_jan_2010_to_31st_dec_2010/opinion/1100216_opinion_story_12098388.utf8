                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FINANCE MINISTERS DAY                          - It is difficult to duck the Indian hysteria about the budget        Bhaskar Dutta                                                          
	For several years, much of Britain would lapse into Henmania in the fortnight before Wimbledon, as everyone wondered aloud whether Tim Henman would become the first local after Fred Perry to win the Wimbledon. (Somehow, Murraymania does not sound quite as catchy, and perhaps that is why the word has not entered the lexicon, although Andy Murray seems to have an even better chance of changing British fortunes at Wimbledon.)        
	India has its budgetmania and it lasts much longer than a fortnight, starting almost immediately after the new year and ending only when the finance minister has finished his budget speech. It is impossible to open a newspaper nowadays without reading speculations about what unpleasant surprises the finance minister will spring on us, matched in equal measure with suggestions about what he should do. If you cant beat them, join them. So, what are Pranab Mukherjees plans?        
	He is certainly batting on a better wicket this year than he was around this time last year. The Central Statistical Organisations latest estimate of economic performance for 2009-10 claims that the economy will grow at 7.2 per cent, and this despite a global meltdown which was the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Moreover, this growth has been balanced with practically every sector other than agriculture growing at close to its long-term trend rate of growth. Now that much of the developed world is also recovering from the slowdown, the Indian economy should be able to reap the benefits of positive synergies. This suggests that the finance minister need not worry so much about providing massive doses of the fiscal stimulus required to sustain the domestic economy. Obviously, this frees up a lot of resources and provides him with some latitude.              
	Ironically, I am writing this on the day when the Indian cricket team suffered a crushing innings defeat in Nagpur. Unfortunately, there was no devil in the wicket  the Indian team was just bad. This raises the million-dollar question: how good is Mukherjees team? Here I am not referring to his team in the finance ministry. And how can I? After all, his chief economic adviser is a close friend of mine.        
	I am referring instead to some of the non-Congress members of the United Progressive Alliance team. In particular, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Trinamul Congress are relatively more concerned about their electoral fortunes in their home states than about the state of the Indian economy. So, any measure that seems even remotely unpopular is shot down by these two parties.        
	Consider, for instance, the recent report of the Kirit Parikh committee, which recommended a steep hike in prices of petroleum products. The committees recommendation was based on elementary economic logic. The current prices of petroleum products are significantly below the costs incurred by the oil companies because of the high price at which they have to import crude oil. It makes sense that the users pay for what they consume. Why should the poor farmer subsidize the urban housewife who uses liquid petroleum gas to cook elaborate meals?        
	However, Mamata Banerjees instant reaction to the Parikh committee report was that there should be no hike in prices in order to protect the common man. The deficit incurred by the oil companies has to be covered one way or another. If petroleum prices are not increased, then a part of the deficit will have to be financed from budgetary resources. This will be in addition to the current level of subsidies which already account for over 10 per cent of total government expenditure.        
	As a matter of fact, Mukherjee has very little flexibility as far as the composition of government expenditure is concerned. Salaries and pensions, interest payments and defence expenditures along with subsidies account for roughly 60 per cent of government expenditure. So he does have to exercise a great deal of control over government spending on other items. Judging by recent trends, spending on social sectors will probably account for a significant fraction of discretionary spending. The government will also increase spending on infrastructure. Unfortunately, the increased spending is unlikely to be even close to what is required.        
	Mukherjee has slightly more flexibility in so far as raising resources is concerned. There is a strong possibility that the government will increase excise taxes. The government had slashed the Cenvat rate for excise duty from 14 to eight per cent in two rounds starting in December 2008. These reductions were effected in order to provide a stimulus to domestic industry. Since the overall prospects for growth are much brighter today, the finance minister may well withdraw a part of the stimulus in order to boost tax revenue. A more desirable instrument for raising resources must surely be some degree of disinvestment of public enterprises. Unfortunately, the DMK is opposed to disinvestment, and so the extent of disinvestment is likely to be small.              
	Perhaps the most important element of the budget will be the provisions relating to the implementation of the comprehensive goods and service tax. The GST will enable the Indian corporate sector to get much-needed relief from a multiplicity of state and Central taxes. Practically every entity is in favour of an early implementation of the GST. However, several critical issues need to be resolved before it can be put in place. The finance minister must utilize this opportunity to effect a smooth transition to this new system.        
	Apart from the move towards the GST, I expect the budget to be a damp squib. Income taxes  both personal and corporate  have remained virtually unchanged for several years, the only change being the imposition or removal of surcharges. These rates are already quite low, and so no one can expect the finance minister to reduce them any further. Similarly, there was also a large degree of stability in the structure of indirect tax rates during the last decade. The only major changes have been policy responses to very specific needs  for instance, the lowering of excise taxes as part of a fiscal stimulus package.        
	The absence of major changes is neither surprising nor unwelcome. The Indian fiscal system has attained some kind of maturity and stability. So why should we want to deviate from it? In fact, what is quite amazing is the amount of hype and frenzy surrounding the budget  I know of no other country where there is so much public hysteria about the national budget. Henmania was so much more fun.

	Lost freedom                  
	Sir  In the article, Anarchic legacy (Aug 7), Sunanda K. Datta-Ray rightly says, But ordinary folk have yet to be persuaded that government is, indeed, of, for and by the people. In many cases, the government has taken decisions that were not for the greater good. Its utter neglect of the tribals welfare and its failure to bring development to regions such as the Northeast have brewed discontent among common people. The corrupt and inefficient State has failed to deliver on its promises.          
	This has destroyed the peoples sense of belonging to the government and has alienated them. Sometimes, foreign agents have misguided the people and encouraged them to become unruly. People have thereby destroyed public property in the name of protests and battled against the States forces. The recent incidents of violence in Kashmir are an example of this phenomenon. When the army or the police retaliate with brutality, the situation becomes worse. This has been the case in places such as Lalgarh. Also, sometimes the peoples misplaced anger, such as that against foreign multinationals, is a result of the propaganda carried out by political parties. India has faced widespread anarchy owing to backwardness, illiteracy and exploitation. It is perhaps not right to blame only the legacy of the freedom movement for the prevailing lawlessness. The government has failed to project the image of a welfare State. In the last decade, many development schemes have been introduced but few have been implemented properly. So peoples interests have continued to be neglected. As a result, the peoples perception of the State has remained negative.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The article by Sunanda K. Datta-Ray is an epitaph for our so-called democratic nation. True, Indians fought to achieve independence and rightly adopted parliamentary democracy as their form of government. But the precious independence they achieved became meaningless as they forgot to imbibe and practise the basic principles of democracy. As Datta-Ray points out, the large pockets of backwardness do indeed constitute what the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, calls Indias biggest internal security threat.           
	This is a priceless observation; we should take it to heart. Mahatma Gandhi was certainly one of the greatest leaders of India, but he too had feet of clay. He preached non-violence as a means to achieve independence, but exposed his followers to widespread violence from the British imperialists. The dichotomy within Indians is acute and alarming. We admire and propagate great principles but never practise them in reality. This is why we always try to pass the buck when it comes to assuming responsibility. We need to change ourselves, as the Americans, the Chinese, the Japanese, and other nationalities have done.          
	But all is not lost. India is changing, growing and developing, quick and fast. The Quit India Movement was indeed a Himalayan blunder, as Mohammed Ali Jinnah called it. But to say that India and Indians are where they were in 1942 will be a gross exaggeration. We have corrected ourselves to a fair extent. One hopes that Indians will be able to further change the face of the country in the future. We must feel proud as Indians, and justify our pride through our deeds. Thinkers are few and far between in this country, and they seldom speak up and inspire. But we must respect and appreciate such men, learn from them, and implement the lessons they teach.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Deceptive law          
	Sir  Mukul Kesavans article, Deceit and its uses (Aug 1), was interesting. It threw light on certain strange aspects of the judicial system of Israel. The Jewish law does not apparently discriminate between Palestinians and Israelis while dealing with rape cases. But it does consider whether the accused had concealed his communal identity to get the victims consent. If this be the case, then Israeli law classifies the offence as rape as such concealment is seen as amounting todeceit in sexual intercourse. In other words, consensual sex would be treated as rape by the Israeli law if it involves the deceit factor.          
	Various complications can arise from such a law. Moreover, as the verdict delivered in the case of Saber Kushour suggests, this law favours women over men. Because if a woman accuses a man of using deceit to have sex with her, thereby raping her, the man may find it difficult to prove his innocence. The woman, on the other hand, does not face punishment for her rashness in agreeing to have sex with a person without being sure of his identity.          
	However, Kesavans observation about a similar hypothetical situation in India where It isnt hard to see a Dalit convicted of rape by deceit if his dupe was a Brahmin woman and no possibility at all of a case being brought if the roles were reversed sounds a bit exaggerated. Indian laws do not discriminate on the basis of caste or religion when dealing with rape cases.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta            
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The revelation made by WikiLeaks that the Inter-Services Intelligence has been double-dealing with the United States of America is a well-known fact that has so far not been openly acknowledged (Leak ties ISI to Afghan terror groups, July 27). The US, for its own strategic interests, had funded Pakistan. This backfired for the US as Pakistan grew more powerful. Pakistan has now become a threat to the US itself.          
	Yours faithfully,

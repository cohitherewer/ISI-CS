	The Third Man: Life at the Heart of New Labour By Peter Mandelson, Harper Press, 25        
	Unlike Andrew Rawnsley, Peter Mandelson does not believe that New Labour has died  and he is right. The inventors and leaders of the early days of New Labours expedition to the summit of popularity in British politics may have crashed, with their party, from those heights. But those most likely to inherit the leadership were created first in the New Labour crucible and are too closely associated with the immediate past for more than minor reinvention.        
	On the face of it, this book tells us little that we dont already know of the top three men of New Labour. Blair, charming, populist and flaky; Brown, increasingly and frighteningly unbalanced; both focused on the leadership of their party and the country above all other considerations. In Browns case, as we are all too aware, to the extent of losing touch with the reality of the countrys economic and political situation. On top of this, the sense of the press and politicians morphing into one another as spin and counter-spin began to rule politics and run the country.         
	Mandelson himself, the arch-manipulator, was in many ways the most vulnerable, the meat in the sandwich and the whipping boy on whom everything could be blamed both by his two fellow protagonists and their party and press as a whole. Tony Blairs speed in sacking him for the second time, egged on by Alistair Campbell, in the overblown feeding frenzy over the Hinduja passport scandal, before any inquiry into the matter, was an act of extraordinary disloyalty, even cruelty, to a man who was his friend and responsible, in part at least, for his own Teflon-coated success.        
	Mandelson neither is, was, nor pretends to be, entirely infallible; his judgment in allowing this book to be picked over for the most damning stories of his colleagues has poured further bile on his head. The book inevitably has elements of self-justification; later historians will pick embellishment from fact. The mea culpa moments are all there, such as his admittedly mistaken house loan from wealthy Paymaster General, Geoffrey Robinson. It is more of a surprise to find a man of far shakier confidence than has publicly appeared, and one feels at times a somewhat disingenuous appeal for understanding from a politician who seemed to hold all the strings, keep the balls in the air by whatever trickery, and be impervious to the hatred that was directed at his person from his own party.        
	The style of writing  how much of it actually Mandelsons, one occasionally wonders  is off-putting at the start. How to get away from the first person? The I is too present and this makes an ultimately fascinating account, read like the ghosted biography of a minor starlet; likewise the overdone name-dropping. Fine, I stayed with Serena and Jacob Rothschild or whomsoever else of the glitterati but not always, my good friends followed by pointers to their purported grandeur or wealth. Likewise, a photograph, Relaxing in the company of Sabrina Guinness and Mick Jagger. Well... wow!        
	Do you have to do this to show the breadth and height of your life even if you are pretty well at the top of your chosen career and born into the higher echelons of a major national political party? Perhaps you do, if you are, or feel yourself to be, in the end, always the backroom boy or the middle-man.        
	Mandelsons is, on the other hand, a good story, whether or not we think it one we have lived through all too long. His clear affection for his family and the warmth of his upbringing reach the reader. The accounts of his education and early adventures in the political world are presented with a light touch; the less well-known detail of his time as Northern Ireland secretary, a difficult enough seat to fill and more so as successor to Mo Mowlam, of particular interest.        
	While glossing over some more uncomfortable personal details, he tells his tale with some humour and brightens it with vignettes in which others are sometimes the unexpected stars. The battle with Old Labour in the person of Eric Heffer, when the Red Flag, historic emblem of socialism, was replaced by a red rose, characterized by Heffer as disgusting and, Mandelsons realization that, red rose aside, modernizing his party was less a question of changing a landscape and more like draining a swamp. Picture, too, Sinn Fein and former IRA leader, Gerry Adams, at Hillsborough Castle, the hated seat of English government in Belfast, offering to find the new secretary of State a dog, his own best aid to thought; an offer unimaginatively or perhaps over-imaginatively vetoed by his security detail.        
	Mandelsons obvious love for the dogs he later acquired himself must, like other expressions of his feelings in this book, slightly damage the horns of the Prince of Darkness. Irritants of style and repetition aside, it is worth reading, perhaps especially for those who have not lived daily so close to those events, in spite of the inevitable shortness of the view of very recent events. This is an instant narrative account that has not been given time for the further processing that one rather hopes Mandelson as well as others will provide in later accounts of these years.        
	The rush seems to be on at the moment and he has beaten his fellow New Labour architects to the bookstalls. The next excitement will be the convergences and divergences between the accounts of three men whose extraordinary and endlessly changing relationships with one another have been at the heart of our British political story for the last 15 years. The great book to come is the one that finds the truths and lies in all three.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Strong coffee and opinions aired
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STRONG COFFEE AND OPINIONS AIRED                                  Life in the city has changed, but the adda still lives in its coffee shops and on its computer screens                                            
	One does not need to rack ones brains to figure out why solitary confinement is considered such a brutal punishment. If there is one thing people must do, it is talk to one another. After all, as is evident from observing some people, it often seems as though much of the pleasure in having an opinion lies in being able to air it. From early risers who exchange spirited views over a cup of tea after their morning walks, right up to idealistic students who regularly give classes a miss in order to get embroiled in heated debates about the government, conversation  banal or scintillating  is an essential part of ones existence.        
	Adda, as we know it, undisputedly claims the crown for versatility. I would never finish if I were to list the range of subjects (with varying degrees of seriousness) on which my friends and I held forth during our college years alone. Claims of adda being the pursuit of the idle notwithstanding, it does drastically improve ones knowledge about things. Being in conversation with other people gives one an insight into their minds, their complexities, and quirks. It is also a whole lot of fun, I might add.        
	Any talk of adda that lasts beyond five minutes cannot escape from the mention of Calcuttas Coffee House seeping in, no matter how many times it may have been spoken of or written about before. The present generation has grown up hearing stories from its grandparents  who, invariably, were Coffee House frequenters  about the experience that was quite unlike any other. Teeming with budding poets and authors who never failed to garner an audience, mathematical geniuses who remained seated for hours solving complex sums with a piece of chalk upon the table top, or young men with fire their bellies, dreaming of revolution and change, all over a cup of strong coffee and a mighty delicious snack  the faraway, nostalgic look in the eyes of the people reminiscing about the old Coffee House speaks volumes. They remember how the place buzzed with debates of a myriad strains, the old-world ambience accentuated by the peeling paint, the worn furniture and the slogans on the walls.         
	The renovated Coffee House does not look or feel like the one I had heard about. It seems cleaner, but some of the old delicacies on the menu remain unchanged. Even now, you can clearly hear the conversations going on at the tables near you. The difference lies in the fact that these are natters you would much rather not hear during a quiet cup of coffee. Theyre uninteresting, uninspiring and often downright irritating, making you want to get up and firmly ask the people to speak more softly  a far cry from the luminous conversations that immortalized Coffee House.        
	But even though Manna Deys Coffee House-er shei addata aar nei is a tune that conjures up the places glory days, it does not really make me wish for the adda and the people that it speaks of. This has got nothing to do with the effectiveness of the old song, and everything to do with the fact that I have not witnessed the Coffee House adda that evokes his wistfulness. You cannot miss what you have never had. It would have been hugely interesting to experience first-hand the adda that those days saw. However, those of us who never got that chance have had conversations and debates of our own  exchanges that have fired us up and inspired us  in places that are just as dear to us. This is the adda that we will look back upon with nostalgia when wide-eyed youngsters ask us what it was like in the old days.

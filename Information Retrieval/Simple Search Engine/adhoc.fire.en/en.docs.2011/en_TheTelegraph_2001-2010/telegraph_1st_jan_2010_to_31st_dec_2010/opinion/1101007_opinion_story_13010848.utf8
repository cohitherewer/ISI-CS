	Two worlds                  
	Sir  In A Pakistan tragedy (Sept 27), Ashok Mitra offers a comprehensive analysis of the contrasting lifestyles prevailing in different parts of the world. The gap between the rich and the poor has widened as a result of globalization. The electronic media have enabled ordinary people to take a peek into the grand lives of the privileged few. This has made the disparity between the two economic classes all the more apparent, especially in the eyes of the deprived.          
	Countries that have failed to reap the benefits of globalization and have been left with unstable economies and internal dissent are characterized by glaring disparities of income among different social strata. The underprivileged section, in a constant struggle to attain the standards of the wealthier class, often resorts to unethical and illegal means. As Mitra points out, the normal earning of Pakistani cricketers is just a pittance compared to that of their Indian counterparts.           
	Of late, the formers opportunities to participate in international cricket have also become limited. Pakistani cricketers have been denied the chance to make money in the Indian Premier League as well. These disadvantages have made it difficult for them to resist the temptation of earning a little extra  which is why they had fallen into the trap laid by the bookies so easily.          
	However, despite the circumstances, the actions of these cricketers cannot be justified. They must be duly punished for their misdeeds. Cricketers from certain other countries are also treated shabbily by their cricket boards and get few chances to play matches at the international level. But that does not always drive them to corruption.          
	The real tragedy of Pakistan lies in its poor and inconsistent administration. There is no efficient system to check corruption in cricket, and cricketers involved in scams often get off the hook too easily. In the present context, if Salman Butt, Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif manage to evade the charges of spot fixing brought against them, the true spirit of cricket will be stifled. At the same time, it would be a sad loss for the game if this scam results in the careers of these talented players being truncated in their prime.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In his enlightening article, Ashok Mitra talks about the stark contrast between the lives of the rich and the poor in a globalized world. Mitra has referred to the spot-fixing scam involving Pakistani cricketers in this context. But there are many other examples of this disparity not only in Pakistan but also in India. When one visits India as a tourist or returns to India from the West, one is bound to notice how dirty the Indian cities are. And this despite the facts that India is now considered an economic power, and the countrys rich possess and flaunt enormous wealth. It might be difficult for many to admit that a major section of India lives in unhygienic conditions, but denial would not make this truth disappear. India is spending millions on the Commonwealth Games. After the Games are over, the government will do well to spend some money on the construction and maintenance of public toilets across the country.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Held to ransom          
	Sir  The editorial, Shutting down (Sept 30), has aptly painted a gloomy picture of bandh days in West Bengal. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) under Jyoti Basu had propagated the culture of strikes in Bengal which has been carried forward through the decades by the Left Front government. The situation has now deteriorated to such an extent that a strike is called at the slightest pretext. The recent strike called by junior doctors in the major State-run hospitals in Calcutta made many critically ill patients suffer badly. And the employees strike in the Calcutta High Court held the judicial system to ransom.          
	The rot in the work culture has gone very deep, and no one really cares about the development of the state. The politics of disruption has become the norm here, with the government itself supporting this rigmarole. Bengal, after 33 years of Left rule, is saddled with mismanagement, backwardness, poverty, unemployment and lack of investment opportunities. One hopes that the wave of change that has rocked West Bengal will revamp the prevailing system.          
	Yours faithfully,

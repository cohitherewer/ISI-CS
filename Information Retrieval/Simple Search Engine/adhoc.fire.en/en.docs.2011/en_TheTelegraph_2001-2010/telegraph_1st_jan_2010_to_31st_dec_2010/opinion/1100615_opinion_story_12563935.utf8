	Bihar under Nitish Kumar has almost fallen off the familiar map. It is difficult to remember when the last caste riots rocked the state. The various caste armies, which virtually held the administration to ransom for years, seem stories from the past. If Bihar has been in the news recently, it has been mostly for a long-unheard story of a turnaround in economic growth. All this should have given a big boost to Mr Kumars confidence in the run-up to the assembly elections in October. But the chief ministers worst fears are not about his political foes, but about his ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party. That is why he was so upset about an advertisement that showed him holding hands with the BJP leader and his Gujarat counterpart, Narendra Modi. Mr Kumars public expression of anger over the advertisement has a dramatic element to it, but it basically shows how uncomfortable he has been about his partnership with the BJP. The saffron brigades response to his anger and its defence of Mr Modi are predictable. Its rhetoric about not compromising the partys self-respect is familiar stuff of election-eve bargains between partners.        
	However, what the BJP seems to be unwilling to face is the fact that the fundamental nature of its politics makes the party a rather risky partner anywhere. Naveen Patnaik realized this before Mr Kumar, took the bold step of ending his alliance with the BJP before the last assembly polls in Orissa, and was hugely rewarded for his judgment. The political equations in Bihar are very different from those in Orissa, where the main opposition party, the Congress, has long been in a state of decline. The caste line-ups of political parties also make the electoral scene in Bihar rather complicated. But both the electoral arithmetic and the larger political issues make it increasingly clear that only inclusive politics can win polls and ensure good governance. The problem with the BJP is that its politics is fundamentally exclusivist. An alliance with the BJP is thus always an uncertain affair for another party because it carries the risk of alienating not just the Muslims but also large segments of secular voters. Mr Kumar will surely weigh his electoral options before he snaps his links with the BJP. But he has already expressed his lack of confidence in the alliance in no uncertain terms. The end of the affair may now be only a matter of time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | time to face the facts
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME TO FACE THE FACTS                                  Malvika Singh                              
	How many more explicit examples are necessary for the government to introduce a radical reform of mechanisms, processes and delivery systems so as to ensure a more efficient governance where truth and integrity take precedence over blatant corruption and lawlessness?         
	When will the political and administrative bosses step out of the comfort zone of sheer denial, having no accountability whatsoever? Have the shock and embarrassment of the corrupt management of the Commonwealth Games 2010 been the final straw in a chain of horrific truths? Will there be a return to the drawing board to rewrite the norms for managing such events and other cultural soires? Will the politician be kept out of non-political bodies and institutions?        
	If India is to capitalize on its fast-moving rate of growth and gradual emergence on the world stage, the rules and regulations that govern life, work and living in the organized and the unorganized sectors will have to be rewritten. Equally, those who manipulate the levers of power will have to unlearn what they have been taught, and undergo extensive training on how to encourage India to liberate its mind and soul from the corroded practices that have reduced the country to a bungling nation state, where insurgency, violence and mediocrity have taken centre stage, killing its extraordinary legacies.        
	A restructuring of the bureaucracy is the only way out of this all-enveloping morass. We did not need the CWG to tell us the sordid story of corruption in bodies such as the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, nor was this expos the first on the land shenanigans and endless manipulations of the Delhi Development Authority. Rules have been twisted by all such government bodies for decades and the citizens have suffered the consequences.                 
	Danger ahead        
	Bribes are normal for getting no-objection and completion certificates, even for getting tax-refund cheques, for legitimate electricity connections and more. There is not a single area where the long arm of the government does not forcibly extract its illegal pound of flesh.        
	Illegitimate intrusions into the private domain of citizens, laced with dollops of insidious, often veiled, blackmail and threats, are the norms whenever a citizen raises a hue and cry or does not comply with the corrupt practices. There is no quick point of reference which will uphold and protect what is right. The political bosses and their babus form the class that is exempt from this horror. To live an honest and hard-working life is most stressful in India 2010.        
	Instead of opening up this Pandoras box, exhuming the rotting realities, and spelling out an honest set of operating norms, new laws are being devised to perpetuate these growing pools and potential areas for more arbitrary corruption. New taxes on watches and inherited artifacts are being introduced. A draft for a fresh Antiquities Act suggests that if you change the frame of a painting that is over 100 years old, you will have to get the permission of the Archaeological Survey of India. Whats worse, a cop can invade your home and book you for not doing so. Unbelievable, but true.        
	This kind of dictatorial and unthinking governance has made Indians feel ashamed in a modern, liberal world where excellence is celebrated, where legacies are protected, where pride is nurtured and where the State is not all-invasive and policing every individual and private moment. A corrupt State, which is on the verge of trespassing on the human liberties that are emphatically enshrined in the Constitution, presents a hugely scary picture. Some one leader must bell this dangerous cat and restore the dignity of India.

	When I returned after finishing my studies in America in 1982, I was determined to break up the Republic of India. At least, I was enthusiastic about contributing to the dismemberment of the Oppressive Psuedo-Democratic State (democratic state being the greatest oxymoron under which humanity laboured) and to making sure it was replaced by a positive, dynamic network of local Anarchies, where each citizen would be genuinely free, equal and non-hungry, where all people would have the wherewithal to have lots of parties and group and one-to-one sex and to make art and live, like, heavily peacefully with one another and with the planet.        
	Id been dunked in a vat of multi-hued Anarchism in a small, counter-cultural college in a very beautiful, green, cold, ecologically pristine northern part of the United States of America. When I joined my college in Vermont, the state was about to go for a plebiscite: the Union, it seemed, had promised the citizens of Vermont in 1879 that, in return for a temporary membership of the US, they would allow their descendants (and whoever else lived in Vermont a hundred years from then) the right to finally decide on whether to secede from the US and form their own country (uniting with adjoining Canada was apparently not an option in the treaty). For a couple of months during my first semester, there were various groups who quite seriously campaigned for Vermonters to vote for secession; these ranged from Libertarians who hated the draconian US gun-laws to Hippies who wanted the unfettered right to grow the very good ganja they knew the fertile Vermont hills could produce. I watched with interest as the voting took place, keeping away from the polling station despite many people urging me to exercise my voting right as someone then living in Vermont. Having witnessed the passion of the pro-secessionists, it came as some surprise that Vermonters decided by a landslide to stay in the Union.        
	That didnt stop my various teachers, ecologists, lesbian and gay-rights advocates, poets, glass-blowers and cross-country ski-instructors from unfurling the beauty and power of Anarchist thought and theory before us wide-eyed students. Kropotkin, Sacco and Vanzetti were portrayed as heroes and, by the time I graduated, I was clear that our worst enemies were the Capitalists and the Communists, followed by anyone else who desired, advocated or defended the Nation-State.        
	In the years after I first returned to India, the cruelty and craziness of the State were amply in evidence: I-Gandhi and her recently expired Son had pulled out an obscure fanatic from a gurdwara in Ahmedabad to counter the Akalis and things in Punjab were going from bad to worse. The Communists in charge of Bengal were already showing signs of the venality and brutality they would institutionalize over the next three decades. Gujarat, under a Congress government, was targeting poor Muslims as were the UP-wallahs. One Dhirubhai Ambani was sitting in Bombay, ruling the world of business. A few weeks after Indira was consumed by the evil she had let loose, the lives of thousands were consumed by the Bhopal gas-mass-murder. Under, around and above all this was the new cancer of Religionists, spreading from Dallas, Tehran, Riyadh and Islamabad, but also from our Hindu maths, all of them looking to establish a Branded God through the capture and control of Nation-States  the US, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh. It was an especially bad time for a wannabe film-maker to be advocating Anarchy, but I never lost faith.        
	History manages to teach even the most obtuse of its students by the simple dint of happening around you every day while you try and work out the theory and practice of the trek to Utopia, and I was no exception. Heres a short collection of the main lessons or, if you like, the bad-tasting truths that people like me have had to stomach.         
	Lesson : Local Anarchies may not be possible as dreamt of by my teachers in Vermont, but new models that deliver the basic principle of local power for local decisions, smaller groupings of people who make the big decisions about their own lives, knowing personally or, at least, at not at such huge distances, the people who represent you politically and economically, all of this is closest to being achieved in post-Cold War Europe. Despite the recent spurt of right-wing governments coming to power, western Europe and its citizens are the closest in the world to achieving some semblance of the true democracy envisioned by the Anarchists of the past  not very close, mind, but the closest. When you now cross a border in Europe, the language on the signboards changes but the border guards are no longer there to usher in the change of language, road design, the change of foodstuffs in the small local shop, the move from one post-Westphalian state to another. It is a good thing and one we must shamelessly aspire and strive towards: in the time of Westphailure, to be able to drive from Rangoon to Rawalpindi without a single border check and  perhaps ambitiously, but what the santoor  to be able to take a (green-powered) bus from Bangkok to Basra with only the minimum of Official Immigraine.        
	Lesson : Until generations and processes take their due alchemical time, a Nation-State such as India does serve a temporary but important purpose. To be clear, even as the Indian State defecates on the lives of a large number of its citizens, its presence also protects other, far larger numbers, from the fate that has befallen most people of most of the countries around us. Make a broad list of the immediate neighbourhood and compare India to each country. Iran. Afghanistan. Pakistan. Tibet. China. Nepal. Sri Lanka. Bangladesh. Myanmar. Now ask yourself, even as you demand to secede into some happening, tensile, febrile, mobile, one-person Celebrepublic, which of these countries histories would you rather exchange for that of Evil Bharat- Mahaan? Whose State Apparatus would you rather have stand up against the State Apparatuses of the G-8? Whose murderous, rapist army would you rather have than our no doubt very murderous and undeniably rapist fauj?        
	Dont want an Army in the first place? Dont like people in uniforms? People with guns? People in uniform, toting guns? People with weapons of any kind at all? Im, like, so totally with you, Comrades, I cant even begin to tell you. But if youre okay with revolutionary or azaadi types who use weapons and not okay with the armed nasties run by Thalaivar Chidambaram then thats a Rubiks Cube for your political conscience that only God or Mao can help you solve. An AK-47 is an AK-47 and, while it may feed some people some of the time, it has never, for any long term, nourished the free soul of a people.        
	A friend recently worked very hard and successfully on a government committee to stop a big industrial project from destroying a thriving tribal community and its fragile forest environment. The government decision to cancel the project was the result of a long struggle by local people and their supporters, a struggle that remained peaceful despite serious provocation. After the news of the cancellation spread, my friend was accosted in the local market by a Maoist-leaning academic who informed her that the government decision was actually bad news for The Revolution because it showed the State in a good light.         
	How utterly stupid. Lesson 3 is: There are many ways to change the State and not all of them involve the use of IEDs and armaments. Every small, non-violent struggle by poor, dispossessed Indians and Subcontinentals which changes how the State deals with its citizens is likely to be more long-lasting than the spectacular annihilation of battalions of the CRPF or the Assam Rifles.              
	I too look forward to the day when the Indian tiranga is finally taken down as a symbol that has done its job. But the Anarchist in me now understands that the only way to permanently move that national flag into the museums of History is to do it the slow way, the unspectacular, hard way, through democratic negotiations that have nothing to do with the dramatic encounters so desired by the enemies of peace, whether they be wearing the uniforms of the State or the garb of Statists-in-Waiting.

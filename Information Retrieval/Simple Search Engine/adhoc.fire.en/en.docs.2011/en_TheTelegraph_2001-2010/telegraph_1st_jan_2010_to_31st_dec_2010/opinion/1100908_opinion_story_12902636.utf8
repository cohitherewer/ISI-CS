	Important visit                  
	Sir  Kanti Bajpais Preparing for Obama (Sept 2) made for exhilarating reading. As pointed out by Bajpai, Barack Obamas forthcoming visit assumes added significance as no other American president has been to India during his first term in office. Bajpais analysis of the real purpose of the visit deserves to be studied in some depth.          
	Bajpai is right in saying that the Americans will try to dispel the perception that the relationship between the two great democracies has suffered since Obama took charge in the White House. Both sides would have to agree on crucial issues, although they may reserve the right to disagree where such disagreement is unavoidable. That Obama has reiterated his wish to do so bodes well for both nations. Some irritants will be encountered in the process, but, given the existing ground realities, they need to be handled diplomatically.          
	Chief among the irritants are the unseemly developments in Pakistan and Afghanistan that threaten stability in the subcontinent. Strategic partnership, the buzzword in Indo-American ties, has to encompass a whole range of issues, including China, Pakistan and Afghanistan. China is no longer the China of yesteryear. Its dispute with India over parts of Arunachal Pradesh continues. Indias unambiguous statement that no part of Arunachal Pradesh would be surrendered under any circumstances testifies to the hard stance the government has taken on this sensitive issue. Hopefully, China would not commit itself to anything that might impair mutual ties, which have been partially repaired after years of mistrust and hostility since the conflict in 1962.          
	It is true that Obama has turned out to be different from the man who had generated considerable goodwill during his presidential campaign. He has held on to his predecessors policies in Iraq and Iran. Obama has promised to come down hard on the terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan has become a haven for militants and India must include border dispute and infiltration of terrorists in its agenda while holding a meaningful dialogue with America.          
	The two other critical issues are those of American endorsement of a permanent seat for India in the UN security council and strategic arms sale to India. As noted by Bajpai, doubts persist in these matters as well. The United States of America suspects Indias intention to honour an end-user agreement, while India is circumspect about Americas reliability as an arms supplier. New Delhi must demand that Obama give a clear signal to remove the doubts at the earliest.          
	I agree with Bajpai that the Obama visit will not be iconic. Indians had pinned their hopes on Obama after his victory in the presidential polls. Now Obama has an opportunity to rectify errors and enhance his credibility. If both sides succeed in reaching a broad consensus on key issues, only then can the Obama visit be called a success. Americas friendship with India has to be real and not imaginary.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In all likelihood, India will again be exposed to the two extreme points of view held by two different lobbies when the US president, Barack Obama, comes calling to India in November this year. One group, as usual, will be opposing anything that has to do with the US. And the other will come out in support of everything that the Americans say. Not only that, members of this contingent will jostle to have their photographs taken with Obama.          
	Politicians, members of the press and the people in general should learn to cope with the visits of foreign dignitaries dispassionately. This is because the frequency of such international visits would increase as India continues to grow economically. India is gradually making its presence felt on the international stage, and there is no reason to fear that the country and its people can be arm-twisted to carry out an agenda that is favourable for some other nation.          
	India ought to develop a relationship with the US in various sectors without forfeiting its own ideology or interest. Neither should it compromise its relations with other countries for the sake of friendship with America. Indias territorial integrity and national security are vital, and it has to find its own solutions to the problems that it faces instead of banking on the supportive words of visiting heads of state.          
	In other words, we should not behave like a vulnerable woman in awe of a rich and flamboyant suitor, nor in a manner that resembles a starry-eyed maiden awaiting the arrival of a knight in shining armour.                     
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Chaotic exuberance
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CHAOTIC EXUBERANCE                                  VISUAL ARTS: Rita Datta                                                  
	Like many young artists, Meenakshi Sengupta  who showed her work at the Society of Contemporary Artists Gallery (in Kasba) recently  is all keyed up to look back at tradition. Not in anger, though, but with an irreverent wink. And tradition to her is both the culture she grew up in and the art she came to learn about, whether of India (particularly, the miniatures, Kalighat pat, the Bengal School) and Asia (especially, Japanese stylization) or of the West. Thus, her menu is eclectic and her manner a parody of genres and famed names.        
	The ploy of inserting references has itself become something of a tradition and she does it here with a spunky sense of fun. Her eclecticism, however, is informed by rather arbitrary visual quotes that seem to lack a considered strategy. Hence, what results is a pastiche, but her tone of cheeky banter is quite infectious, nevertheless.        
	When Krishna plays the flute to serenade Matisses Blue Nude, it refers, with impish humour, to Romeo and Juliet; and, leading from the archetype, to the chestnut of yearning lovers separated by the yawning distance between balcony and mansion grounds. If the dark god is caught dallying with a Rajput miniature maiden in colourful skirt, it is not Radha, but the artist herself, her face pasted on the painted body. But the title, 108 Missed Calls, matching Krishnas 108 names, shows her urge to impose rather than invite allusions.        
	If her Ladies Hostel posts figures in different styles  that of Kalighat pat, for example, or of Jogen Chowdhury  at each window and displays a clothesline with womens innerwear, the risqu undertone is unmistakable. But the artist is, in her youthful defiance, also anxious to offend middle-class propriety in Kamcome. Both in the suggestiveness of the name and the explicit erotica of the images.        
	Perhaps Sengupta is groping towards a style-less signature as isms turn into rituals, shorn of the churning they evolved from. Now, however, it appears as chaotic exuberance. Where she goes from here and how her mature idiom is moulded is an answer that lies in the future.

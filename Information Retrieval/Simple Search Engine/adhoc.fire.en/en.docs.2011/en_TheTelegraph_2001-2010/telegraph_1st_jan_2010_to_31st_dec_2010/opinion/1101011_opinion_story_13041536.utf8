	The government, then seized by reformist zeal, permitted investment in Indian capital markets by foreign institutions in 1992. In that xenophobic age, the step looked revolutionary. Nationalist jitters were controlled by setting up a licence raj: every foreign institution that wanted to invest had first to get approval from the governments own Securities and Exchange Board of India. How it was to decide whom to favour or disfavour was not specified. Those were days of delegation, and it was left to Sebi to make its own rules as it went along. Sebi, in turn, resorted to devolution; it decided to approve any foreign institution that a foreign regulator of its own kind had approved. Soon foreign institutions found that they could avoid Indian taxes if they invested through Mauritius, to which Indira Gandhi long ago had made a gift of a double taxation agreement. They went to Mauritian law firms, which suggested an even better solution: they would get foreign institutions, whichever country they belonged to, registered with the Mauritian regulator. Thus almost all foreign investment in the past 18 years has been made by institutional nationals of a single country  Mauritius.        
	The government worried from time to time: what if those ostensibly Mauritian investors were actually Chinese bankers or Pakistani politicians? It should not have mattered, for money knows no colour. But some people in the government are paid to worry and to create problems. To address their concerns, Sebi has required that the money invested by foreign institutions has to come from real persons, and has asked them to tell it who the persons or organizations are. Some of the foreign institutions began to arrange share transfers amongst their own customers. It did not go down well with Sebi; it asked to know who they were, and then stopped the practice.        
	Now, after all these years, the government has woken up to an easier solution: if it allowed the original investors themselves to invest in Indian markets, it would not have to write letters to intermediary institutions and ask them to provide the identity of those investors. This brilliantly simple idea, however, is bound to run into a hurdle. There is a precedent against it, which has lasted almost two decades; can it be overturned at the drop of a hat? Surely, whoever kept individual investors out of India then must have had a reason for it. The reason may be lost in antiquity, but that does not make it any less reasonable. Let them be reassured. The reason was that Sebi assumed that foreign regulators would have vetted the institutions registered with them. So many of those institutions failed in the past three years that the vetting is seen to be ineffective. Letting the investors in directly will remove a useless intermediary. More important, it may persuade the worlds plutocrats to take an interest in India.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOUSE OF SHAME                                                    
	Footwear, chairs and blows flying as thick as verbal abuse on the floor of legislatures is not exactly new to the Indian version of parliamentary democracy. But what happened in the Bihar assembly for two successive days is a record of sorts. That as many as 67 Opposition members were suspended from the House tells only half the story. It is difficult to imagine a greater abuse of an institution that is supposed to capture the essence of democratic politics. What is even worse is the fact that members of both the ruling and the Opposition benches played their parts in the ugly drama. Yet, the issue that triggered the pandemonium in the assembly is of crucial importance to governance in any state. The Patna High Court had ordered an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation into alleged irregularities involving the withdrawal of over Rs 11,400 crore from the state exchequer between 2002 and 2008. The Opposition had every right  and a constitutional duty  to seek the governments answer to the charge. But the manner in which Opposition members went about it not only defeated the Oppositions cause but also exposed its inability to handle important issues of public interest.        
	The next assembly polls in Bihar are due in October. It is obvious that electoral interests, rather than a genuine concern for probity and transparency in governance, prompted lawmakers on both sides to indulge in such unseemly behaviour. The shameful episode casts perhaps an even darker shadow on the final days of Nitish Kumars current spell as chief minister. He has been widely acclaimed for his attempts to lift Bihar out of its long spell of violence and despair. The states reputation as the ultimate symbol of lawlessness seemed to be changing. Incidents of caste violence that had long crippled the rule of law in Bihar are no longer rampant. Even its economy started showing signs of a slow recovery. Mr Kumar could rightfully claim credit for ushering in many of these positive changes. He would do a lot of good to his own image, as well as to the state and its people, by clearing the air of charges of financial irregularities. His government need not try to shield itself, as the assembly Speaker has sought to do, by arguing that the court cannot interfere in the working of the House. Such arguments only confirm suspicions that the government is trying to hide uncomfortable truths.

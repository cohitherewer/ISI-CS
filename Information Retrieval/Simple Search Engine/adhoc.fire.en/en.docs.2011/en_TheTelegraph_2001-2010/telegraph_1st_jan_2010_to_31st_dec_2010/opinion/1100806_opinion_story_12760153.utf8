	Enemy state                  
	Sir  The Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, may well be apprehensive about the outcome of the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, especially now that it has been proposed that the case be shifted outside the state (Modi invokes Gujarat pride, Aug 1). Pushed to a corner, he is railing against the Centre and the Congress for treating Gujarat like an enemy state.          
	The Modi government has turned the state into a hub of religious fanaticism. The chief minister tries to hide this unpleasant truth behind the faade of economic prosperity. It is a pity that the states former junior home minister, Amit Shah, who was responsible for enforcing the rule of law, made a mockery of it by resorting to extortion and murder. To make matters worse, Modi and the leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party are trying to protect him now.          
	The way in which Sohrabuddin was shot down reminds one of the system of justice that prevailed in Saddam Hussains Iraq. Is that what Modi wants in the progressive state of Gujarat? The Central Bureau of Investigation must be well aware of the fact that as long as trials are held within the state, all the wealth and power of Gujarat will be used to impede justice. The proposal to shift the case outside the state is not an insult to the judicial system of Gujarat but an attempt to bring justice to the victims.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  The fact that some supporters of a senior BJP leader distributed sweets on the day Amit Shah was sent to judicial custody speaks a lot about how Shah is viewed within his own party.          
	One might choose to ignore rumours that the marble traders lobby conspired to eliminate the extortionist, Sohrabuddin, or to buy the theory that he was an extremist gunned down in an encounter. It still does not explain the murders of Kausar Bi, Sohrabuddins wife, and Tulsiram Prajapati, the only other witness to the encounter. Only time will tell if Narendra Modi himself was involved in the incident. However, it is evident that the killers knew that the shooting was illegal. That is why the two witnesses were silenced.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It would appear that the Congress has initiated the CBI probe on Amit Shah and other officials in Gujarat in order to destabilize the BJP government in the state. It is worrying that several CBI probes have not resulted in prosecutions, even when there was overwhelming evidence against the accused. There was damning evidence against Lalu Prasad in the fodder scam, for instance. But the former Bihar chief minister and ally of the United Progressive Alliance government went scot free. Perhaps the Centre should leave Modi and the Gujarat government alone.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Narendra Modis attack on the government at the Centre was a tirade that has now become usual by his standards. The chief minister has established the practice of using the people of Gujarat to justify his actions. His aim, no doubt, is to win voters by telling them that they have been insulted and that he is the only one who can defend them. This time, he has conjured up the bogey of an insult to Gujarats judiciary.          
	Modi claims that the Centre treats Gujarat like an outsider and an enemy. Assuming that this is true, why should he be surprised when, by laying stress on Hindutva, he has gone against the grain of the secular Indian State? He has claimed a separate and distinct identity for his state. At the same time, he has clung to the political power conferred on him by the Indian polity. It is this power that enables him to commit atrocities and still escape unscathed.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Mukul Dube, Delhi

                
	Sir  By playing up the concept of Gujarati pride, Narendra Modi and his associates have attempted to deflect attention from the gravity of the Sohrabbudin case. But the crime of murdering someone in a staged encounter is a serious one. It is a subversion of the legal system and a violation of all democratic principles. When it comes to bringing criminals to justice, the rule of law should prevail.           
	Modi is now waxing eloquent on the image and pride of 5.5 crore Gujaratis. The prestige of the state and its judiciary, he claims, is at stake. This is nothing but a ruse, part of his desperate bid to escape the natural course of justice.           
	Such inflammatory comments are bound to play on regional and communal sentiments. Leaders like Modi may well become a liability for their party and for the sangh parivar as a whole. Moreover, forces hostile to India would be able to use such explosive statements to establish that Hindu terror is a threat to the nation.          
	Yours faithfully,

	No two insurgencies are quite the same and the strategies to fight them cannot but be different. The Maoist peoples war, therefore, poses challenges to the Indian State that are different from those encountered by the authorities in Jammu and Kashmir and parts of the Northeast. But no counter-insurgency offensive can be effective without two primary conditions  a reliable information network and an ability to change strategies and tactics as and when necessary. The failure of the anti-Maoist campaigns in Lalgarh has largely been due to the authorities inability to garner precise information and act on it with precision. The success of the joint forces in their operations against the rebels early on Wednesday morning shows how adequate preparedness can achieve results even in difficult circumstances. It also points to the failures of the past and to the priorities for the future. More than anything else, the West Bengal police seemed to have been unequal to the task of containing the Maoist campaign because of the collapse of their intelligence network. That again was largely due to the fact that the police and the administration in the state had long been made to serve political interests of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist). The result is a sharp decline in the efficiency of the police that makes the force utterly incapable of tackling serious law-and-order problems, let alone a full-blown insurgency.         
	However, the authorities have no reason to sit on the success of their latest campaign. It is almost certain that the Maoists would try to hit back in their own ways. There is thus a need for constantly reviewing the state of preparedness of the forces. The Maoists audacious attack on a camp of the Eastern Frontier Rifles at Shilda last February exposed the gaps in the planning of the counter-insurgency measures. With presidents rule in Jharkhand opening up new possibilities for the battle there, the West Bengal government needs to coordinate its strategies and actions better with those in the neighbouring states. All sides agree that the battle is going to be a long and hard one. But defeating the Maoist rebellion is not just a question of superior strategy; it is ultimately a commitment that the State has to fulfil. Political rhetoric has often clouded this simple truth. The Maoist challenge cannot be a matter of political one-upmanship.

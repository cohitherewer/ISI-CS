	March is the cruellest month for the Indian book trade. It is the end of the financial year, when the years performance comes under review, plans for the next year are drawn up, and, above all, past dues and future liabilities are assessed. Indian publishers always complain. Yet, the ground picture tells a different story: new publishers are born every year, more American and British publishers get represented here and more titles are published, either in collaboration or as originals, than ever before. So, what is the overall situation of the Indian book industry?        
	Three facts are indisputable. First, even medium-sized Indian publishers and distributors have a turnover of around Rs 100-150 crore every year, with a 20 per cent increase in two or three years. Smaller publishers, some of whom also double up as wholesalers and booksellers, do anything between Rs 20-50 crore, with prospects of doing better next year.        
	Second, more American and British publishers are coming in, either on their own or in collaboration with Indian publishers. In fact, no American or British publisher goes unrepresented in India now. Even European publishers with an English section, like Hachette, Martinus Nijhoff and Springer Verlag, are represented.        
	Third, Indian printers working exclusively for books are full of export orders. Some Indian printers have turned entirely to export jobs. There is much more potential, provided they increase their print capacity to cope with the growing demand.        
	The reasons for this sudden burst in business prospects are better institutional funding for libraries and a growing awareness that education matters in a competitive environment. Moreover, the growing number of bookshops and, therefore, easier access to books, along with affordable prices (owing to special prices for India), have helped increase volume sales in recent years. But the crucial question is whether more copies sold actually lead to higher profitability. With a rise in overhead costs, is the Indian book trade more prosperous than, say, a decade ago? It is, because there is far more cost consciousness today: all frills are out, discounts and extended credits have been cut to the bone. For locally published books, inventories are limited to holding stocks for a maximum of 6 months. If this means cutting down on the number of copies printed, and therefore, slightly higher prices, so be it.        
	But more than cost cutting, two other factors have contributed to the buoyancy of the Indian book trade. Successful business is always a question of an artful mix  of imported books with clear margins of profit and indigenous publishing. Also, while prices matter in the Indian market, what is equally important is the relevance of a book in fulfilling a badly felt need.

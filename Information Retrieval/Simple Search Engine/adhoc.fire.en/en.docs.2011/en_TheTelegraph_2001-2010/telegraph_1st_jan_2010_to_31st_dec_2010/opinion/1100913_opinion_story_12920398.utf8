	The prime ministers cabinet is divided on land acquisition for industry, mines, airports and other developmental purposes. Ministers charged with making India an advanced country want to acquire large tracts; the ministry of environment, about the last ministry in the government with powers of licensing, often prevents them from advancing. This has led to a civil war between Jairam Ramesh and other ministers. What the media see is just the skirmishes; the real battles are fought in the cabinet and in file notes. Being at the centre of these battles, the prime minister can hardly have missed the fact that land use is the cause of the deepest rift in his government.        
	He addressed the issue in his press conference with his usual deftness. Since he is an economist, it is not surprising that he leaned towards development and industrialization. He decried the licence-and-permit raj of the environment ministry; but intriguingly, he also advised trade and industry to accept it. This tendency to see merit in opposing positions makes him a good chairman of the cabinet of ministers. But it is also the main factor behind his public image as a mild, unassertive and indecisive prime minister. Neither image does him justice, for he is not a particularly communicative person; what he says gives a rather flat, two-dimensional view of a multifaceted personality. What he said, however, suggests that he has not given adequate attention to the raging controversies around environment. The least that is necessary is to separate the vague and universal issue of environment protection from that of livelihoods and cultures. On the first issue, it is obvious that a country with Indias large and rapidly rising population cannot protect pristine environment everywhere. But it can and should protect it somewhere; and there it should give environment effective immunity from human intervention. An example is the protection of tigers. The government has created a number of habitats where they should survive and multiply. But in fact their numbers are inexorably declining. Ineffectual protection is worse than no protection.        
	On the second issue, it may make sense to say that a few primitive tribal people cannot hold up the march of miners into the mountains of central India. But the tribal people see no redress in Indias political processes, and have taken to fighting for their habitat. Surely a better solution is required than an assertion of the primacy of development. The prime minister may, on his next trip abroad, profitably make a detour to Alaska, made notorious by Sarah Palin. This state of the United States of America created a fund by putting aside a quarter of royalties on natural resources, to be used to generate income (not to develop the state). This Alaska Permanent Fund has grown from $734,000 in 1977 to $35,135,800,000 on September 3. India needs a similar fund, whose use should be decided by the victims of development.

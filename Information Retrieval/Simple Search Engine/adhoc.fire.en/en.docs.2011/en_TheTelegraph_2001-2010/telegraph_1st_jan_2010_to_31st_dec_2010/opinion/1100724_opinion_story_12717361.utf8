	How overtly should one contemporize classics if one wants to express their immediate relevance? Spoonfeed spectators with topical imagery or let their minds bridge the temporal gap  since classics, by definition, must have meaning for us. If not, they cease to be classics. Modern theatre rightly discarded historical realism a century ago, replacing Julius Caesars togas with combat fatigues or concept designs that reflected a plays central theme. Then modern-dress itself became the fad, in turn rejected by postmodernists who shredded text and form, which has become the latest fashion.        
	Ultimately, there is no correct method to do a play, but directors must be wary of imitating trends. Another cardinal rule: avoid reducing the complex to the simplistic and obvious. Kalyani Kalamandalams reworking of Oedipus Tyrannos, its most ambitious production, shows both what can be done and what should not. It uses projected video liberally  an overdone gimmick now, which often dwarfs business on stage, as happens here. Novel news bulletins update us on the kings fortunes; whereas lengthy prefatory footage at an eye hospital looks ridiculously irrelevant. The first Oedipus-Creon exchange turns into a live televised debate. Clever, but is cleverness the point? Dattatreya Dattas scenario is stronger when he translates faithfully. We can accept cuts, but not embellishments that alter the original, of which I noticed several. Notably, Creon sends Oedipus packing at the end (picture), contrary to Sophocles. Frequently lost in such concepts is the acting, exactly what befalls director Santanu Das. In his determination to depict a despotic Oedipus, he forgets Oedipus heroism, integrity and truth-seeking completely. A disinterested Jocaste and a self-interested Creon do not help matters. The chorus, however, performs in unison.        
	Meanwhile, postmodernist deconstruction possesses Parnab Mukherjee. His latest, banglanatak.coms Performing the Periphery at Harrington Street Arts Centre, billed Heiner Mllers Hamlet-Machine and Aim Csaires A Tempest as sources, but the fragments of which proved blink-and-miss. Instead, Mukherjee roamed around hollering, I am not Hamlet, and we thought thank heavens for that, but then why invoke Shakespeare at all? To grab eyeballs? So, false pretences marginalized the main act  Dhunda Mahatos chhau dancers from Purulia and patuya singer Manimala Chitrakar from Paschim Midnapore  and came dangerously close to appropriation of their talents (for instance, forcing the unlikely equation of Behula with Ophelia). Madhumita Pal was the only urban performer who impressed. The connection between all these disparate elements remained tenuous at best.

	Lesson not learnt                  
	Sir  Students often opt for private tuition to score good marks. This is because of negligence on the part of teachers in schools. Students are also afraid of delays in the completion of syllabi or teachers skipping chapters in class. Teachers, on their part, are more interested in juggling school and private tuition to earn some extra money. Students should not need private tuition if lessons are taught properly. The school authorities should keep a close watch on teachers to see that they are doing their job properly.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Power play          
	Sir  The 12-hour bandh called in South 24 Parganas by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on January 13 affected Calcuttas southern fringes (Bandh on city fringes, Jan 13). The CPI(M) cadre called the shots in Garia, Patuli, Baishnabghata, Jadavpur, Santoshpur, parts of Kasba and on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. They placed road barricades used by the police at key crossings to stop the traffic. Red flags fluttered over the barricades, which bore the initials of the West Bengal Police. The partymen themselves sat on charpoys beside the barriers, and stretched their limbs over cups of tea as patients, office-goers, school- children and pilgrims suffered throughout the day. Every moving vehicle had to bear the brunt of the cadres ire. Schools along the E.M. Bypass remained shut.           
	The bandh enforcers stormed into the Vidyasagar Hospital in Behala and stopped officials from working. As for the policemen, most preferred to stay indoors. At some important crossings in Calcutta, the muscle-flexing cadre waved lathis to stop vehicles. Even doctors cars were not spared.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
P.K. Sinha, Kharagpur 

                
	Sir  The people of Calcutta have realized that bandhs and rallies are futile. But party leaders still seem to harbour the notion that such forms of protest are essential to create political awareness (Time to act, Jan 15). Politicians call bandhs to criticize other parties actions, demonstrate their power, mobilize public support as well as to justify certain agendas. The bandh on January 13 was called by the CPI(M) to protest the murder of its supporters in Canning. Did the bandh restore the lost lives? While bandhs cannot remedy ills, they inevitably lead to political violence, resulting in more deaths. Buses are set on fire, causing damage to public property. Roads are blocked and even ambulances are not allowed to ply. The State incurs a huge loss whenever a bandh is called. In a three-hour road blockade carried out by the Trinamul Congress just a day before the CPI(M) bandh, a fire engine on its way to put out the flames in a slum in Ultadanga was stopped. The slum was almost reduced to ashes as a result.          
	Yours faithfully,         Nishan Mukherjee,Calcutta                    
	Sir  Bandhs have become a menace for Calcutta. Even if the people dont approve of bandhs, they have no option but to remain indoors since most forms of public transport are forced to stay off the roads. Unruly supporters belonging to different political parties rule the roost, while students, patients and office-goers suffer in their hands.           
	It does not seem likely that Calcuttans can do much to defy bandhs. Some are helpless because they are poor, while others refuse to get involved fearing retribution. All they can do is watch the political game played in the name of the aam aadmi, and wait for the next bandh.                    
	Yours faithfully,

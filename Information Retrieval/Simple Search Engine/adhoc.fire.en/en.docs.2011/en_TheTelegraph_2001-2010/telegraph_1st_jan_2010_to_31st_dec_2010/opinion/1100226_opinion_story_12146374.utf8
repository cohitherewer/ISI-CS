The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fury at close quarters
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FURY AT CLOSE QUARTERS                                                                  
	Decoding Intolerance: Riots and the Emergence of Terrorism in India By Prateep K. Lahiri, Roli, Rs 395        
	This book deals with Hindu-Muslim riots and tries to decode the intolerance that has crept in Indian society. Scores of communal riots have taken place after Independence between Hindus and Muslims. Several books have been written on the subject over the last two decades. But this is the first by a civil servant, who, in his long term of service has seen Hindu-Muslim conflicts in different states from close quarters. Coming from one who has had the opportunity of handling communal flare-ups in significant capacities, Prateep K. Lahiris opinions require serious thought. He has tried to fathom this frightening aberration of social life by delving into the past as well as examining the immediate causes to show the appalling shortcomings of our administrative system.        
	Lahiri focusses on five important communal riots, some of which he handled closely  Jabalpur in 1961, Indore in 1969, Bhagalpur in 1989, Bombay in 1992-93 and Gujarat in 2002. He presents the problem to the reader in a manner in which only his civil service background could have helped  the reader can form his opinion about the intricacies of the sensitive problem without getting emotionally involved. Lahiri divides the book into five parts. He begins with the examination of the problem and ends with the optimism that there is still light at the end of the tunnel.        
	Instead of treating the topic of communal riots in isolation, Lahiri takes up related issues and links them with the subject. The decoding of intolerance includes an assessment of the nature and extent of the damage incurred in these unfortunate incidents. He takes into consideration the ideas of social and political scientists like Paul Brass, Ashutosh Varshney, Steven I. Wilkinson and so on, thereby providing a synthesis of the different perceptions which results in a holistic approach to the topic. Lahiri arrives at the conclusion that riots are not widespread, but confined to a few pockets in urban areas. Fortunately, a majority of the rural areas still remain unaffected by this menace. He points out the losses of both the communities, deals with the role of the State and the police, and questions the neutrality of the police in dealing with the events. He even gives some practical suggestions for both the administrators as well as the police.        
	Lahiri takes up controversial Muslim issues like those of a uniform civil code, terrorism and fundamentalism, as well as questions of hard-line Hindutva. Muslim deprivation, the Sachar report and an interesting chapter about Huntingtons idea of the clash of civilizations also come within the ambit of Lahiris discussion. Religious fundamentalism is discussed together with the perceptions of Indian Muslims in the changing political scenario of the world.        
	Lahiri is forthright in his criticism of people and parties responsible for the tragedies. He does not mince his words. With statistics from all over India, he proves that Muslims suffer considerably more casualties in these riots than Hindus and that police discriminate against them (Muslims) with regard to law enforcement as well.        
	Lahiris book, a dispassionate portrayal of a touchy issue, is one that makes us ponder. Its data can satisfy academics and the books humane quality will appeal to the general reader. It is a book that the new generation needs in order to give a befitting reply to those bent on upsetting our system.

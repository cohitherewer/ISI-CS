	The latest craze is the business correspondent, the fancy name banks have given to postmen whom they use as mobile tellers. The postmen recruit villagers as depositors, and give them elementary services, including some interest, as banks representatives. The number of such bank accounts is approaching a crore. The compulsions that are driving this development are twofold. The banks are under pressure from the populist government to extend their services to villages; using the post office is a low-cost alternative that makes it unnecessary to open branches, recruit staff, or persuade them to go to villages where there are no decent schools or hair-dressing saloons. The post office has been offering banking services to villagers for more than a century, but cannot decide how to develop them.        
	What this makeshift arrangement is sabotaging is innovation in rural banking. About a half of Indias population, including every woman, child and hermaphrodite, has a cellphone. New technology makes it possible to use these cellphones to store cash, just as in a bank account, and to pay people, just as with cheques  all without any use of paper, any human intervention, and need for bank-style red tape. Telecommunications companies would gladly offer this service to villagers; so would new entrants such as PayPal. All that prevents them is the Reserve Bank of India. It is petrified that this low-cost competition will hurt the banks business, expose the enormous profit margins they charge, and eventually drive them bankrupt. That cannot be allowed to happen according to central banking orthodoxy. That would be financial instability  the most undesirable eventuality a central bank has to face. So the RBI has set its face against it.        
	It is not clear what the post office gains from offering business correspondent services. It already offers extremely efficient depository services to villagers. But it does not know what to do with the money. It deposits the money with the finance ministry; the ministry, which is the mother of all government banks, has money pouring out of its ears and does not want the few thousand crores that the post office brings. The deal with banks pre-empts the options of the post office, and prevents it from finding a creative solution to its problem. There are two possibilities. One is that it may itself start lending to villagers. No one knows villagers better than the post office. If it starts giving loans to those it considers the soundest and most promising of them, it will generate economic activity and employment in villages, and achieve repayment rates much higher than banks ever can. Or it can lend the money for infrastructure development  for instance to builders of ports and airports; they will give it much higher return than banks can. It is to be wondered why the post office is shying away from these solutions and running after banks.

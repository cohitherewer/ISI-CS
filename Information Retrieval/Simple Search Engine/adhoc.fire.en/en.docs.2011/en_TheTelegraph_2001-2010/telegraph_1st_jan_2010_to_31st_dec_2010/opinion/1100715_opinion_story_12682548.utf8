The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A different ending
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A DIFFERENT ENDING                                  Most societies are still not ready to confront euthanasia, either as a matter of personal choice or in administered form, writes Rita Bhimani                                            
	When Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Guzaarish releases in theatres later this year, we will be exposed to the issue of euthanasia. The contentious subject of the film might force people to be engaged more actively in debates about the merits and demerits of mercy killing.        
	The reality is that we are still not willing to confront the notion of euthanasia, either as a matter of personal choice or in administered form. Euthanasia can also be voluntary, but that is something that is fraught with problems related to its feasibility, theological aspects, psychological pressures, implications on inheritance, and so on. The case of Aruna Shanbag  who has been living in a vegetative state for 37 years  is an example of how issues surrounding euthanasia remain unresolved. Shanbag, a nurse at Mumbais King Edward Memorial Hospital, was raped by a janitor who used a dog chain to throttle her. This resulted in the blood and oxygen supply to her brain being cut off. Her comatose state has generated intense discussion: religious leaders have hailed the decision to keep her alive, while the media are agog with experts debating issues such as the morality, logic and legality of euthanasia.        
	Legalized euthanasia is, unfortunately, limited to a handful of countries like the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg as well as the states of Oregon, Washington and Montana in the United States of America. South Australia is trying to legalize euthanasia. It is, in fact, scheduled to host a conference of the World Federation of Right to Die Societies in Melbourne this year.        
	When I asked Derek Humphry  founder of the Hemlock Society and author of Final Exit: The Practicalities of Self-Deliverance and Assisted Suicide for the Dying  in an emailed correspondence why we were not making more progress with voluntary euthanasia, he retorted that, It takes time, a lot of effort, and buckets of money to bring about change. Our main opposition comes from religions, none of which supports us. Thus politicians are afraid to back us for fear of being boycotted at the polls by religious voters. Hemlock Society, the oldest and the largest of the right-to-die organizations in the US, attempts to provide information to those willing to consider euthanasia, and to pass legislation permitting physician-assisted suicide with accompanying guidelines to prevent abuse.        
	In India, as in the West, with healthcare expenses being what they are, the right to determine if a patient wants to live or die should be premised on informed choice. But what are the implications of life choices? And of individual volition in ending life when it becomes untenable due to prolonged and incurable illness or old age?        
	My first brush with voluntary euthanasia was when Minoo Masanis strong belief in the right to die with dignity almost convinced many of us to want to sign an intentional pledge. This would be in the form of an actual vow on paper, while still in possession of our senses, to give those around us the right to remove life-support systems in the event of our entering a brain-dead state. Family conflicts and apprehensions about life-at-the-brink decisions could be resolved, argued Masani, if a clear document were to indicate that a patients life could be formally ended should the vegetative state become a curse for the patient and his suffering relatives.        
	Arguments in favour of such action are based on the increasing levels of suffering brought about by new cancerous syndromes, the swelling numbers of accident victims, and the drug-induced derelictions. Such a step can save families years of agonizing wait and mounting expenses that many can ill afford. But then, premeditated postures are one thing. Such a decision invariably puts the patients relatives in a dilemma. This often results in religious groups, medical experts and legal practitioners consider euthanasia iniquitous and unethical. Often, one sibling could be in favour of a parents right to die with decorum while the other might want to cling on for purely sentimental reasons.        
	Most of us are still unclear about the differences between euthanasia and the voluntary administering of it. Euthanasia programmes were also conducted during Hitlers time. Codenamed Aktion T4, they were administered to newborns and very young children who exhibited symptoms of mental retardation or physical deformity. Soon, the programmes were expanded to include older, disabled children and adults. Physicians are estimated to have killed over 70,000 people who were judged incurably sick, by critical medical examination. Later evidence indicated that lakhs of people had been exterminated under this programme.        
	There is also the widely publicized instance of Jack Kevorkian in more recent times. His claim to fame was as an active euthanasia advocate whose assisted suicide campaign ended the lives of 130 people. Some of these people were terminally ill; some others were disabled or chronically ill. On the face of it, he could look like a redeemer. But his actions were not looked upon as acceptable, and he was arrested and convicted of second-degree murder. The irony of it all is that Kevorkian himself was reported to be terminally ill and was paroled for good behaviour in 2007 on the condition that he would not help anyone else die.        
	But we are still left battling with the differences between euthanasia  which can be termed as an intentional killing by act or omission of a dependent human being for his or her alleged benefit  and voluntary euthanasia, which is when the person who is put to death has actually requested for such termination. There is also the matter of physician assisted suicide.        
	There are historical precedents of well-known people fasting unto death. In our time, there is Acharya Vinoba Bhave who decided to end his life. In another era, there was Chandragupta Maurya, who retired to the Jain pilgrimage centre at Shravanabelagola and starved himself to death.        
	This could well be one of the earliest instances of the Shwetambari Jain practice of santhara in which those wanting to die did so in a ceremonial manner, giving up food and drink and then allowing themselves to die peacefully. What is debatable here is whether the practice of santhara or sallekhana can be equated with suicide. Human rights activists have filed public interest litigations, claiming that sallekhana is a social evil and should be considered as suicide under the Indian legal statute. But Jains belonging to that particular sect claim that the slow suffering that people choose to endure when they are approaching the end is what makes them strive to find greater peace and purification.        
	Today, terminal patients continue to suffer and the community of relatives endure the vicissitude brought about by uncertain decisions. Given the situation, will Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code give credence to merciful approaches? Are we going back to the basics? Or are we moving forward in the spirit of Sherwin Nulands book, How We Die, Reflections on Lifes Final Chapter, in which he says that a doctor should be prepared to psychologically and practically help a long-time patient slip off the scene in relative comfort?              
	Even as we continue to argue about active versus passive euthanasia, assisted as opposed to non-assisted suicide, lethal injections versus non-intervention, opting for palliatives or getting on with mercy endings, could we not think of genuine feelings and reactions to brain-dead situations with an unpremeditated stance? Whose life is it anyway?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A daunting business
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A DAUNTING BUSINESS                          - Of passports, visas and the trials of foreign travel        The Thin Edge: Ruchir Joshi                          Restricted entry                                              
	Preparing to travel abroad again, it came home to me last week that I was actually nothing more than my passport. I could be a famous exponent of Kuchipudi, I could be the best poet of blank verse in Maithili or I could be a columnist writing for major Indian publications; I could be a business pundit who regularly scratches his beard on national TV or a practitioner-critic invited to jury documentaries and first novels; people could call me Saar or Da or Doctor; but the moment I step out at the other end of an international flight from India I am reduced to a well-worn, deep blue booklet, or in my case, now, a pancake-stack of them that are stuck together. This stack does nothing to reduce the impact of my sudden paradrop into anonymity, it just increases the time and suspicion the immigration darwan deploys to rifle through the document.        
	My Siamese-tripletted passports are precious to me, and I hate the way the immigration thulla or thullette in whichever foreign country fingers the pages with intimacy and a sense of complete and easy proprietorship. Leave that page alone! I want to say, when they finger the embossing on the Swiss visa from 2008, That was for my film tour!, What are you looking at? I want to snap when they start counting all the different Schengen visas, Cant you see Ive entered the golden walls of your fortress many times but never ever tried to stay? But none of it ever matters, the accumulative weight of visas and stamps only whets the curiosity and suspicion whereas their scarcity in a thinner, newer passport would immediately raise doubt. For the immigration thulla, the default mode of looking at someone proferring a passport from a subaltern country  and thats what India still very much is, make no delusional mistake  is to treat them like a criminal about to enter your precious house and burgle benefits and unwarranted, illegal domicility.              
	I began to travel to the West just after the golden period of free entry for brownies was chopped off under racist clamour from the likes of Enoch Rivers of Blood Powell in the early 1970s. Suddenly, from being a welcome labour force and valuable intellectual resource imports, we subcontinentals had become a massed swarthy threat to the economies, the social stability and gene-pools of all the Have-countries. Travelling from here to Euromerica meant first having to run the gauntlet of interrogations by sundry, loser, consular number threes deeply resentful of their combat-posting in a backwater. Despite the extremely plush life, the fully air-conditioned apartments, the membership of the best clubs, the non-stop parties and dinners, this resentment at being in a dump like Calcutta came out in different ways: the English would be supercilious, running you through hoops of accent, vocabulary and grammar to see if you could keep up; the French, in their charmingly decrepit chambers off Park Street would be bored, slowly and deliberately rude, especially if you flaunted your English too much, and the word non was their favourite, unless of course you happened to be a good-looking young woman, in which case the oui on your visa application would often be coupled with an invitation to dinner and a foretaste of France; the Americans didnt do either superciliousness or seduction, they knew a US visa was the crown jewel of any Indians passport and they would do their level best to deny it to you. I still remember the anger and contempt that was part and parcel of all those US consulate interviews on Ho Chi Minh Sarani. The third or fourth time I went there was a visa officer who was black and I made the mistake of imagining that he might be a tad more sympathetic; but not a bit of it, this was a man trying to climb the diplomatic ladder in the Reagan era and he was determined to outdo all his white colleagues in terms of hardness. In any case, it seemed to make no difference who was in the White House at the time, from Jimmy Carter to Condi Rice, the instructions remained the same: you knew the visa interviews were designed, deliberately calibrated, to fill you with anxiety and to humiliate you. As an Indian you knew from the outset that this was a lose-lose game for you: lose your temper and you were out, with no chance of getting into Fortress Amerika; keep your anger in check and you would walk out feeling shamed and soiled that your need to travel to America outweighed your self-respect and pride. You also knew that the humiliation and the shoot-at-your-feet questioning would be repeated at the US airport where you landed by someone even less well-disposed and far more illiterate than the Visa Officer.        
	But you put up with this s***, whether it came from Amricans or Europeans. Maybe you had relatives waiting over there, maybe close friends, maybe a lover with whom you were in deep, joint, viraha-mode; maybe it was just the taste of croissants and coffee at a particular caf, or blinis or a Frozen Margarita, stuff that you knew had nothing, nothing at all, to do with the visa-darwans and the teetering structures they were fronting. So you shut your mouth and kept your eyes straight and ignored the blood rushing between your ears. You carefully packed your dark blue booklet and went. Over the years, like money accumulating, the visas and entry stamps began to make a fine mesh of ink and forgery-proof paper and, at least, at the visa-applying end of it, things became a tad easier. Suddenly the yokels sent to guard the golden borders of their diamond lands began to understand, began to be able to decode in the simple language they understood of multiple entry visas and stamps of arrival and departure, that perhaps, you were one of those rare ones who actually didnt want to slip into their country like lice does into scalps, that perhaps there was something here in this maddening place that pulled you back like a non-immigrating yo-yo.        
	Recently, applying for a new visa to one of the countries I visit regularly, I found myself actually missing those bruising encounters. Now the old loser-diplo visa-darwans were replaced by slippery natives fronting what was primarily a business operation. The first thing they smilingly took from you was money, amounts you could not get back if the visa was refused or if the visa granted was of a shorter duration than the one youd paid for. It was against all fair business practice, a kind of official lottery sanctioned by the Have-country. This was the new humiliation, quite bloodless and efficient, that you went through, and the worst part of it was that it was run by locals who looked, smiled and acted like airline staff  there was no chance of you actually meeting one of the visa officers and, if it came to that, look in the eye the person who was refusing your visa. After an over-long period of naivety it became clear to me how much this whole business was about money rather than any notion of national purity. If you were rich enough to gamble crazy money and not mind losing all or a part of it, you were welcome to play the lottery; if your circumstances were at all dicey, you now fell off the edge.              
	All in all, it brought back to me with force the story a friend told me recently. Travelling from India to Germany for the christening of his brothers son, my friend was hauled up at Frankfurt by immigration who rudely demanded to see the invitation card to the ceremony, something my friend almost hadnt carried with him. A month later, the same friend happened to be returning to Germany from England, but on a private jet hired by some friends working in the City of London. Same airport, same passport, same visa, completely different treatment: the immigration officer drove up to the Learjet, came in and quickly began to put entry stamps into peoples passports, apologizing profusely all the time for having held them up by seven minutes. Looking again at all the visas and entry stamps in my passport I suddenly felt very lucky  even without the advantage of private jets and such, I was actually a man of considerable substance, especially compared to all the thousands who try and travel to the great West with their life and passports hanging by a thread of a first, single-entry visa.

	Get worse                  
	Sir  It is good news that the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization has been prompt in banning rosiglitazone, a drug commonly used to treat diabetes (Diabetes drug ban, Oct 8). The substance is known to cause heart attacks. In the past, drugs banned in the West were dumped in India and doctors were given incentives by pharmaceutical companies to prescribe these medicines to patients.          
	Anoop Mishra, an endocrinologist, says that rosiglitazone can easily be replaced by newer drugs. However, I am of the opinion that no drug can be more effective in treating certain types of diabetes than metformin, which was first used in the 1920s. This drug does not seem to be appreciated enough in India. It is also inexpensive, which means that pharmaceutical companies gain almost nothing by persuading doctors to prescribe it.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is well known that medicines banned abroad are sold in India (Hazardous abroad, sold in India, Oct 29). Despite repeated warning from the World Health Organization about the sale of drugs that are counterfeit or past their expiry date, the trend continues unchecked. India seems to take the lead in illegal medical practices. It teems with clinics and laboratories operating without licences as well as with doctors and nurses who have questionable qualifications.          
	The system of controls is quite inadequate in India. The CDSCO, which is riven with corruption, seems powerless to stop the malpractices. When a certain drug has been certified dangerous by foreign regulators, why must the CDSCO doubt this decision? The notion of pharmacovigilance is a sham in this country.          
	To begin with, drugs banned in foreign markets are available over the counter in India. What makes matters worse is that some doctors and chemists concoct new and harmful mixtures with these drugs. A few years ago, my daughter was prescribed Nimulid, which is not sold in the overseas market. The side-effects of the drug were so severe that she had to be hospitalized. There is an unholy nexus between various medical associations, drug stores, doctors and pharmaceutical firms. This cannot be ignored any longer and must be investigated.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Life in India is bleak indeed. Chemical substances such as phenylpropanolamine, thioridazine, tegaserod and rosiglitazone are still being sold in drug stores in India. These medicines have raised the risks of heart attack, haemorrhagic stroke, liver failure and cardiovascular problems. The Centre must punish the organizations involved in manufacturing and marketing these medicines. If people are to get proper treatment, the culprits should be apprehended without delay.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Uneasy peace          
	Sir  It was amusing to see the Left Fronts discomfiture over Liu Xiaobo being awarded the Nobel Prize for peace (Wrong model, Oct 9). The human-rights activist has been kept imprisoned by the communist government of China, after all.          
	Communists, whether Indian or Chinese, do not seem to value democracy. The communist governments in Soviet Russia and Czechoslovakia were repressive and authoritarian. In China, the government ruthlessly cracked down on protesters in Beijings Tiananmen Square. Perhaps it was the same urge to destabilize democracy that prompted members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to attempt to topple the first United Progressive Alliance government.          
	Most communist governments have either disappeared or adapted with changing times. In India, the old vanguard, comprising the CPI(M) general-secretary, Prakash Karat, and others like Sitaram Yechury, Brinda Karat and Biman Bose have kept the red flag flying. But the Lefts power has dwindled over the years. Even in West Bengal, where it has ruled for decades, its prospects look bleak now. Perhaps that is why the comrades are uneasy about supporting Liu. Severely under threat in India, the party seems to look to the Chinese government for support.          
	When Moscow catches a cold... Calcutta sneezes, observes the editorial. With most traditional communist bastions crumbling, Indian communists do not know whom to turn to. Without China, they would not even know when to sneeze.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The Nobel Prize committee is to be congratulated for selecting Liu Xiaobo for this years peace price. It refused to be intimidated by the Chinese governments belligerence. Earlier this summer, the Chinese vice foreign minister, Fu Ying, had warned the committee against awarding the prize to Liu. More recently, a spokeswoman from the Chinese foreign ministry had said that Lius actions were diametrically opposed to the aims of the Nobel Prize. But the Nobel committee is no stranger to criticism from Beijing. One must remember that in 1989, it had awarded the peace prize to the exiled Tibetan leader, Dalai Lama.          
	Liu, who took part in the Tiananmen Square protests, is now a political prisoner in China. Given recent developments, people all over the world hope that the Chinese government will set him free. Meanwhile, who will go and collect the Nobel Prize in Oslo this December remains a matter of conjecture.                    
	Yours faithfully,

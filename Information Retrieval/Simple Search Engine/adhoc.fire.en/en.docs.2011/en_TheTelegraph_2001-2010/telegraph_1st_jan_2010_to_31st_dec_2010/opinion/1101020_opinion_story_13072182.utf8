                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WATCH OUT                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	Bihar is all set for the assembly elections, which will be held in six instalments spread over a month. Election in a major state evokes interest throughout the country, and Bihar is no exception. This time, there is, however, a difference. Earlier, the pre-election scene would see newsmen from all over India descending on Patna, wanting to know from local counterparts which are the areas they should visit for first-hand accounts of the mayhem that was an integral part of the Bihar polls. This time too there may be trouble, but the focus has shifted. The outside world is waiting to know whether the claims of development are true and whether Nitish Kumar will be able to steer his alliance to victory on that single plank.        
	Already the chief minister has won a victory with the prime minister taking note of his claims. When Manmohan Singh chose to debunk Nitish Kumar by saying that the development that has taken place in Bihar is with Central assistance and the state can claim no credit, he indirectly admitted that the state is on the move. As for Singhs argument, it is heard every time a Congress prime minister campaigns against a ruling party which is in the opposition at the Centre and, therefore, does not cut much ice even with ordinary voters. Indeed, in Bihar, the voters may well point out that such assistance had also been available during the 15-year-old Lalu Prasad-Rabri Devi regime and yet nothing had happened then.         
	The better-informed may further say that the Centre was not doing the state a favour when it opened its purse strings, that it was merely fulfilling a constitutional obligation. The real issue was whether the money was being spent properly or not. While one will have to wait till the end of November for a definite answer, the fact that even the prime minister had to resort to a time-worn argument in the absence of anything better does seem to speak a lot in Nitish Kumars favour. For the first time in recent memory, development has become the central issue, and this would not have happened if Nitish Kumar had not been different from his predecessors.                
	Rather lost        
	The election outcome will be keenly watched for other reasons too. The Congress decided to go it alone in Bihar, largely at the behest of its young general secretary, and it will have to be seen whether Rahul Gandhi has been able to marshal his troops effectively  not to come to power but to acquire some degree of respectability. If the party is able to do that, it can be expected to take a fresh look at the alliance question. The state of the Congress in Bihar being what it is, even a few seats will make it happy.         
	That the party is finding the going tough is evident from the way in which it has lapped up support from unsavoury elements, and from the way Rahul Gandhi is desperately trying to convince minorities that Nitish Kumar is not secular. What the young man perhaps forgets is that while keeping the Bharatiya Janata Party company, Nitish Kumar has always kept it under his thumb, and has even stopped men like Narendra Modi and Varun Gandhi from campaigning in the state.         
	More than the fate of the Congress, it is the fate of Lalu Prasad that is to be watched. It is important to find out whether the alliance with Muslim leaders will work for him. The same goes for his tie-up with Ram Vilas Paswan, who is looking rather lost now. The two will be well advised to celebrate Chhat and Diwali in a big way, as there is unlikely to be much joy for them in the days to come. When it comes to development, Prasad has nothing to say for himself. While he is going to town advertising how he maintained communal harmony, Nitish Kumars track record in this regard has been no less inferior to his, that too while the latter had the champions of Hindutva as his coalition partner.

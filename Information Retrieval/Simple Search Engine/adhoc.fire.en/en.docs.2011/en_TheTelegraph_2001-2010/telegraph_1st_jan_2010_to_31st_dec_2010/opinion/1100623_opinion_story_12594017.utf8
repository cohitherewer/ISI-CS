The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Yuan rise
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        YUAN RISE                                                    
	The Peoples Bank of Chinas announcement that it would allow its currency  the yuan  to appreciate is being taken with three pinches of salt. Cynics see the move as a diplomatic hat tip to the upcoming Group of Twenty meetings in Toronto. For more than four years now, the global imbalances that the world has been trying to deal with have much to do with Chinas artificially set exchange rate. After the initial euphoria that came with the announcement, the Chinese government was quick to say that the appreciation would be gradual; the rupee  benefiting from a sentiment rally (the belief is that other Asian currencies would benefit as their exports would become cheaper vis--vis Chinas)  appreciated nearly 10 per cent on the first announcement, but lost it all on the second. Other currencies fared similarly.        
	As most China watchers know, the Chinese governments own economic and political motivations are prime movers. The appreciation will help producers in China: producer prices in May went up 7.1 per cent year on year, mainly because of commodity prices. Exports in May grew 48.5 per cent resulting in a trade surplus of near $20 billion for the month, but profit margins were less than two per cent. A study by the China International Capital Corporation suggested that cheaper imports in yuan terms would have a greater positive impact on those margins than revenue losses in exports. In other words, a stronger yuan benefits those who import and sell into the domestic economy. A stronger yuan could help on the inflation front. A significant import is coal, which is priced in dollars; a weaker currency increases energy input costs for China significantly, especially if one takes Western economists estimates that the exchange rate of the yuan is between 30 to 40 per cent lower than its actual value. The Chinese government intends to keep economic growth chugging along strongly  which means greater energy input  and more coal imports for power plants; a stronger yuan will contain inflation in energy costs, and that will keep overall inflation down.         
	In the trade-off between benefits for domestic producers and exporters, a stronger yuan would make products in store chains like Walmart and Home Depot  which import heavily from China  more expensive. That could create an increase in US inflation, and potentially dent a recovery in US consumption growth. But that depends upon the pace in which the yuan appreciates. Some analysts suggest that it could be about six per cent a year. A three per cent appreciation would save the Chinese government $5 billion in oil, iron ore and copper which is not exactly small change.

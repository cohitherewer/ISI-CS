	Too much pressure                  
	Sir  The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony to honour the jailed Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, was held on December 10 in Oslo, where the winner of the award was represented by an empty chair (Ovation fills Liu vacuum, Dec 11). The reaction of the Chinese communist party to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu has been aggressive, as Ashok Ganguly says in his article, How fragile is China? (Dec 9). China has forcefully condemned the decision to award the prize to Liu, who is serving an 11-year jail sentence just for co-authoring a petition that calls for democratic reforms in China. It would have been a sign of maturity on Chinas part if it had taken pride in the fact that a Chinese citizen has won the Nobel prize. However, not only has Lius wife been debarred from attending the ceremony, but some other people have also been prevented from going. Zhang Heci, an Australian citizen of Chinese origin, has been reported as saying that he was detained at the Shanghai airport for 24 hours by Chinese authorities as he was on his way to the awards ceremony. He was not allowed to call his wife or the Australian consulate, and had to go home.          
	Chinas open defiance of the world stems from its fragility and private fears. It had the temerity to warn various countries not to attend the Nobel awards function. It is good that most countries  with the exception of a few, like Russia  have ignored its threat. The bullying tactics of the Chinese communist party are now all too evident. If there were an award for arrogance, oppression and aggressive nonchalance, it would have surely gone to China.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Gangulys article exposes Chinas weaknesses and fear. Although China has attained military supremacy and has become the fastest-growing economy, it is afraid of losing its position of dominance. Besides denying its citizens the freedom of expression, it has also violated human rights in order to maintain its supremacy. It believes that economic prosperity is a direct result of military strength. China has willfully turned a blind eye to the damage it will do to India by diverting the flow of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. This selfish, coercive policy is contrary to the real principles of communism, which believes in the united struggle of all people against oppression. Communist Chinas double standards are proved by the fact that Liu Xiaobo has been jailed for his dissenting views, and prevented from accepting the Nobel prize.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, Fear of freedom (Dec 9), is a rational analysis of Chinas belligerent and desperate attempts at suppressing civil rights and the freedom of speech in light of the Nobel awards ceremony held in Norway. Since China has kept Liu Xiaobo imprisoned, it views the conferring of the Nobel Peace Prize on him as an attack on the sanctity of its judiciary. The culmination of Chinas anger occurred when it almost threatened various nations with dire consequences if they attended the ceremony.          
	It is true, as the editorial says, that democracies of the West like Great Britain and France were restrained in their reactions to Chinas wrath. Their responses hinged primarily on their commercial interests. However, Chinas threatening approach may not always work. Even the military junta in Myanmar, notwithstanding its undisputed power, had to release Aung San Suu Kyi  another recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. India, the biggest democracy in the world, did not succumb to Chinas pressure tactics, and was represented at the awards ceremony. It would have been a historic blunder and a betrayal of democracy if India had not attended the function.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The report, 19 countries to miss Nobel ceremony (Dec 8), shows that China has been able to deter some of its allies from attending the Nobel awards function. The last time a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize was unable to make it to the ceremony was in 1936, when the German journalist and pacifist, Carl von Ossietzky, was not allowed to leave Nazi-occupied Germany to receive his prize. The free world should not condone China. Although India accepted the invitation, there was pressure from China on India to boycott the event. By attending the function, India made it clear that it would not be coerced, and would always stand up for free speech.          
	Yours faithfully,

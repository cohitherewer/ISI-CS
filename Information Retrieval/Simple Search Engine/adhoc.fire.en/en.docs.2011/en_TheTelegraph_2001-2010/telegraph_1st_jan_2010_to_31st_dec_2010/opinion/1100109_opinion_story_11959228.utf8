The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | East Asia comes to grips
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        EAST ASIA COMES TO GRIPS                          - India is still not working on the Look East policy        SUNANDA K. DATTA-RAY                                Eisuke Sakakibara				                                             
	Mani Shankar Aiyars indiscreet comparison of Indias impoverished Northeast with Chinas simply spectacular development in south-west Tibet (reported in last Mondays Financial Times) would have appealed to many participants of the Regional Outlook Forum 2010 that Singapores Institute of Southeast Asian Studies organized on Thursday. Not because they were game for a bit of India-bashing but because their yardstick was emphatically economic.        
	That is only to be expected in a region that proudly achieved a high standard of living but recently suffered the worst global downturn since the Great Depression. Having known peak and trough, Asians are now convinced, as Eisuke Sakakibara, a former vice-minister for international finance in Japan, reiterated in his keynote address, that the 21st century will be the Age of Asia. In effect, he also offered India the choice of belonging to either a stagnant South Asia or a dynamic East Asia. The difference is substantive as well as stylistic. East Asians are not given to verbal flourishes. Nor do they propagate flamboyant nationalism. But though none of Thursdays speakers threw down any kind of gauntlet, the common thread was a steely determination that Asia would have to be master of its own destiny to complete recovery and avoid further mishaps.              
	Lee Kuan Yew recounted during an Indian tour that 19th-century India and China jointly accounted for 45 per cent of the worlds gross domestic product. Sakakibara, who used to be called Mr Yen for his ability to move financial markets, once warned that the West must now learn to respect the environment and values of other civilizations and that Asia had been the worlds centre for 4,000 years. Other presentations at ISEASs 13th ROF confirmed that the goal Asia has set itself is to recapture that past. The presence of a number of Western diplomats accredited to Singapore and other countries testified to the significance that Asia-watchers attach to this annual event. By that token, the absence of any Indian official revealed the continuing insensitivity and indifference of Indian diplomacy.        
	Western interest was not confined to Asias economic nationalism. Two Europeans asked about sustainable environmental protection to which the only delegate from India, Y. Venugopal Reddy, a former Reserve Bank governor, pointed out the perils of the entire global population aspiring to the lifestyle of 300 million Americans. He quoted Gandhis belief that the world has enough for everyones need, not greed.        
	It would not have been in the style of either the Association of Southeastern Asian Nations or the ISEAS to say anything suggestive of a showdown with the United States of America. There was only a low-key reiteration of practical measures to stimulate stagnant economies, curb inflation, increase savings, encourage consumption, improve infrastructure and boost trade. And, indeed, enough recovery has already been made for the circumspect Reddy to suggest that Asia is not emerging but re-emerging. Indias checks, balances, self-sufficiency and high level of poverty blunted the edge of the crisis. But Southeast Asians remember Thais forced to auction their Mercedes saloons in the streets of Bangkok when the second disaster struck. The dispassionate view, articulated without emotion or recrimination, was that recession was the price of excessive dependence on the West.        
	Asia doesnt demand economic swaraj, which would be unrealistic in a globalized world, but regime change, so that other hands control the levers. The case is made with caution  the authors of the 1997 proposal to set up an Asian Monetary Fund as a regional alternative to the International Monetary Fund being deliberately opaque. Sakakibara (the real originator) passed the credit to his finance ministry colleagues. Japans financial press claimed that the idea had been advocated by Thailand and other countries while an official Tokyo report claimed that the scheme had already been discussed among Asean countries in the spring of 1997. As another Japanese, Kenji Takita, an academic, reminded the conference, the process of East Asian regionalism began to take shape in fear and trembling. No one wanted a head-on clash with the US or the IMF, which reacted sharply to this show of independence.        
	The AMF was torpedoed, in Takitas words. The Western powers (aided by China) had earlier quashed another assertion of independence  Mahathir Mohamads East Asia Economic Caucus, the so-called Caucus without Caucasians because of Mahathirs determination to exclude Americans, Australians and New Zealanders. (Mahathirs enemies enjoyed attributing his stridency to the Indian ethnicity that was otherwise a dark secret.) He got short shrift from the US, which gained more from burgeoning Pacific trade than from traditional commerce across the Atlantic. China, also a gainer, had no qualms then about opposing Mahathirs initiative which would draw a line in the Pacific Ocean, as the US secretary of state put it. The 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which rebuffed India, was part of the American strategy of defusing Asian economic autonomy through a Pacific free trade agreement.        
	China has shifted position since then. As Zhang Liqing (dean of the school of finance in Beijing being one of several hats he wears) told the ROF, China has suffered a lot from the continuous depreciation of the US dollar. Zhang also found it absurd that a developing country with a per capita income of $3,500 (Singapores is $39,500; Indias $1,017) should be saddled with huge dollar reserves. Complaints are not only on one side. The US feels equally aggrieved about the Chinese renminbi being undervalued at the expense of American importers.        
	Another set of battle-lines is therefore being drawn. A decade after the devastating financial crisis that swept through this part of Asia, the Asean Plus Three (South Korea, Japan and, of course, China) grouping became the new manifestation of East Asian regionalism. Its new landmark initiative for self-defence, the ambitious Chiang Mai Initiative, to which several conference speakers referred, has been on the anvil for nine years and is expected to be operational in March. The plan for a multilateral currency-swap scheme by pooling funds from the regions vast foreign-exchange reserves to weather upheavals in the future is seen as a device to reactivate the stillborn AMF and EAEC.              
	This has already set alarm bells ringing in the US, which firmly believes it has ensured peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region where it has huge economic as well as security interests and nearly 100,000 troops. Thursdays speakers were reminded that Barack Obamas assistant secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, announced in Beijing only two months ago that the guiding mechanism in Asia is so far ambiguous, but any mechanism of significance concerning security, economy and trade cannot do without the American role. Meaning was also read into Hillary Clintons observation (which Takita cited) that the (Obama) administration will strive for a multi-party, not multi-polar world.        
	Financial regime change is clearly not to Washingtons liking. Fearing that the Americans will oppose any new form of Asianism that excludes them, speakers suggested in private conversation that they would not put it past the US to try to scuttle this scheme too by pressuring Japan and South Korea, playing on their traditional suspicion of China, and further inciting Sino-Japanese rivalry over the leadership role in regional economic cooperation.              
	Sakakibara told a questioner who asked about Indias role in all this that he strongly supported intensified interaction between Japan and India, that he had started an India Economic Institute at Waseda University and felt that Asean Plus Three should be enlarged to Asean Plus Four. But he added firmly to laughter that including India could not mean Pakistan and Bangladesh too. Perhaps its not so much a question now of whether India will abandon the region (and the baggage that goes with it) as whether the region will allow India to abandon it. But the glaring absence of official Indian participation in the ISEAS conference did nothing to assuage the feeling that our diplomats still have little interest in fleshing out the Look East policy.

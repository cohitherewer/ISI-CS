	The Fabric of our lives: the story of FabIndia By Radhika Singh, Viking, Rs 499                
	Radhika Singh loves Fabindia. She wants to tell people about it. This seems to be the genesis of her new book. She even provides an originary myth to that effect: a chance meeting with William Bissell, who now runs Fabindia. Mention of the companys 50th anniversary induces a stream-of-consciousness volubility that finally results in this book. The Fabric of Our Lives is not so much a history of the company as a Fabindia product.        
	It might have been a fascinating story  tracing the growth of a company started with notions of social entrepreneurship, that brought Indian handlooms into the mainstream market and helped revive rural industries. Fabindia was born little more than a decade after Independence, weathered the political and economic turmoil of the 1960s and 70s, survived the licence raj and evolved with the economic liberalization of the 90s. The story of Fabindia is threaded with the personal history of its founder, John Bissell, as well as the history of the Indian market and the Indian consumer. Singh has excellent raw material to weave with, to borrow from the fussy fabric metaphors that run through the text.        
	A rich and varied history is made to fit the pages of a family album. John Bissell enters the story dressed as Santa Claus, distributing sweets at the school his wife ran. Singh had been a student there. This saccharine anecdote is followed by well-bred cooing, and the reader is subjected to Singhs personal admiration of John Bissell, his family and some of the people who have helped make Fabindia a success. At times, the book threatens to disintegrate into an acknowledgments list. Singh also draws from the correspondence between John Bissell and his family. The entrepreneurs love for Indias fabrics, his vision of a company that would market these products and mobilize rural skills and resources are inspiring. But Singh, in her uncritical adoration, quotes long and unremarkable passages from these letters, which does not always make for a gripping read.        
	In sporadic attempts to place these anecdotes in context, the history of post-Independence India is simplified to a fable. College girls don kurtas and jeans to establish their identity as the flower-power generation of the 1970s and, after the 12th Independence day, national optimism was invigorating the team that worked at the Cottage Industries emporium in Delhi. Indian independence seems to have been the result of the Free India movement. The Emergency is evidently explained for the benefit of the uninitiated. However, Singh provides exhaustive information on Indias export policies and regulations, as Fabindia started out primarily as an export firm. For decades, a company shipping goods out of India had to negotiate tortuous bureaucratic processes and a thicket of licences. Changes in the Indian economy largely dictated Fabindias transition from export to retail.        
	One is periodically reminded that Fabindia combines profit with social service, working directly with weavers and suppliers. The reader is treated to images of Santa Claus distributing bounty among workers. But apart from a list of names and places, little time is spent on how this remarkable association was forged. Instead, Singh describes in gruelling detail the internal structure of the company, its mode of operation and the involvement of various senior members. The book often reads like an inventory of Fabindia products over the years. Indeed, the list seems to be rounded off by The Fabric of Our Lives. This special product, launched in Fabindias 50th year, is a personal scrapbook combined with some garbled management history. One wishes they had stuck to kurtas.

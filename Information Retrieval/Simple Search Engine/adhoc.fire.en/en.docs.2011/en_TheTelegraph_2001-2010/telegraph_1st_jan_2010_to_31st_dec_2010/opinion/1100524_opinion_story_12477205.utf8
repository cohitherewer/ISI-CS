The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Going Downhill
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GOING DOWNHILL                                                    
	It was a terrifying image of the murder of political dissent and the collapse of the law. As he lay in a pool of blood in a Darjeeling street, waiting to die from his assassins blows, Madan Tamang captured all that has gone horribly wrong for a political culture. The fact that the armed policemen around him were mere spectators not only heightens the horror but also shows how dangerous the administrative vacuum in the hills has become. The way the West Bengal government has abdicated its responsibility in Darjeeling is simply unprecedented. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees anxiety to buy peace with the dominant political force in the hills has seen the gradual rolling back of the State there. This strange policy marked his governments total surrender earlier to Subash Ghisinghs Gorkha National Liberation Front and now to Bimal Gurungs Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. This has left not just other political groups but also the common people of Darjeeling entirely at the mercy of the agitators. If Tamang, who was president of the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League, met such a brutal end, it was because he showed the rare courage of carrying his dissent to the street. It should be easy to imagine how the ordinary people of Darjeeling cope with this climate of terror.         
	However, the tragedy must not be allowed to stall the talks involving the GJM, the state government and the Centre over the proposed interim status for Darjeeling. If anything, Tamangs murder shows how important it is to end the deadlock in Darjeeling and restore democratic politics there. The resolution of some of the issues, especially the one involving the territorial jurisdiction of the proposed set-up, may take time. But the situation may get worse if the talks are allowed to collapse. The talks, however, cannot be an excuse for the government to leave Darjeeling to people who want to be a law unto themselves. Enormous damage has already been done to the rule of law in Darjeeling. Mr Bhattacharjee would do well to use Tamangs death to re-establish the States authority there. Arresting the killers could be an important first step to reassure the people that the government is able and willing to fulfil its constitutional obligations. Given its location close to a sensitive border area, what happens in Darjeeling can have serious security implications for India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	The magic remains                  
	Sir  Although Hemanta Mukherjees 21st death anniversary went by almost unnoticed, his songs continue to be popular. Not many had welcomed Mukherjees decision to make a career in film-music, but the man himself had no regrets. Today, one can argue for hours as to which was his best song, whether it was Ranar or any soulful rendition of Tagore songs. The songs he composed for films like Nagin, Bees Saal Baad, Shapmochan, Harano Sur and so on showed how versatile he was. The void created by Mukherjees death is yet to be filled.          
	Yours faithfully, 
  Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad           
	Different views
          
	Sir  This is in response to the news report, Teachers block bid for autonomy (Sept 1), by Mita Mukherjee. The members of the Teachers Council, Basanti Devi College, would like to draw attention to certain erroneous statements published in the report.           
	The Teachers Council is a statutory body of the college, and as such completely apolitical. There being no other teachers union in the college, the statement in the report about there being a CPM controlled teachers union is totally false and has been published without verifying facts. The Teachers Council, therefore, strongly objects to this blatant attempt to malign it and label it as a political body.          
	Moreover, Tarun Patra is not the general secretary of the Teachers Council. He is the general secretary of the West Bengal College and University Teachers Association. It is surprising that the reporter spoke to and quoted only a senior official, the principal of the college, Maitreyee Bardhan Ray, and a member regarding the position that they believe has been taken by the teachers of the college regarding autonomy. The reporter did not speak to any teacher and has wrongly inferred that the Teachers Council has been trying to bully Basanti Devi College into withdrawing its application for autonomy.The comment made by the principal that We have been trying for autonomy since 2007 needs clarification. Significantly, the principal denies having spoken to any reporter from The Telegraph. Finally, we would like to remind the mysterious senior official and the member that the B++ Grade accorded to the college by the NAAC has been achieved largely due to the dedication of the teachers in maintaining high academic standards in spite of infrastructural constraints. So the statement that the teachers lack concern for the college is erroneous and defamatory. The Teachers Council, Basanti Devi College, strongly condemns these statements published in the said report.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Srabani Ghosh, secretary, and all members of the Teachers Council, Basanti Devi College, Calcutta

                
	Mita Mukherjee replies: I stand by my report. The article has been written after verifying all the information from competent authorities. It is strange that the Teachers Council should claim that the principal has denied having spoken to me. The principal has not sent any rejoinder to us saying that she has not spoken to The Telegraph or that she has been misquoted. In fact, before writing the article, I had contacted the principal over telephone, and we had a long discussion on the issue of the colleges autonomy. She had confirmed the resistance of teachers, and she had also admitted that the Teachers Council had adopted a resolution not to accept autonomy. However, Tarun Patra has been erroneously described as the general secretary of the Teachers Council. He is the general secretary of the West Bengal College and University Teachers Association. The error is regretted.

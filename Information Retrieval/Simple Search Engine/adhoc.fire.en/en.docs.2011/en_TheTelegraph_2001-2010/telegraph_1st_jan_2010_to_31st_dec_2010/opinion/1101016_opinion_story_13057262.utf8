	Too busy                  
	Sir  The Eastern Metropolitan Bypass used to be free of traffic jams in the past. But with the arterial roads becoming congested, it now throngs with traffic, making it difficult for people to reach the airport on time. The most troublesome spot is around Salt Lake stadium. When a football match is held, the surging crowd blocks the road, forcing travellers to miss flights. A shorter link connecting the airport with the city, somewhere near Ruby Hospital or West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, can alleviate the sufferings of air travellers.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Ram, Pune

      
	Underground trouble          
	Sir  Boarding the Metro Railway during peak hours has become difficult for commuters (From AC to age of caves, Oct 13). The trains are never on time: sometimes, they are so late that getting inside the overcrowded compartment becomes a nightmarish experience for passengers. The doors keep opening and closing at the stations, delaying the trains further.           
	The railways minister is busy inaugurating new stations without paying any attention to the fact that the Metro service is not equipped to handle its present passenger load. If this situation persists, availing the Metro will become extremely difficult in the days to come.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Manu Khandelwal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Metro Railway was once considered the pride of Calcutta. However, it is steadily and swiftly turning into a bane for the city. From delays to malfunctioning signals, out of order smart gates to overcrowding, nothing seems to be going right for Calcuttas lifeline. Instead of increasing the number of rakes and improving their standards, Metro authorities are busy extending the network. They do not seem to understand the simple fact that such a step would worsen the delays and further increase the passenger volume. The mob outrage on October 12 will go down as the worst incident in the Metro Railwayss history. The vandalism cannot be condoned, but it perhaps reflected the anger that has been simmering in the mind of every commuter.           
	Metro officials should look into the problems and rectify them with immediate effect.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Raunak Kumar, Dum Dum 

                
	Sir  It is common knowledge that an airconditioned coach draws more power than an ordinary coach does. Hence, it was imperative that the Metro authorities upgraded the electrical system before introducing AC coaches. To say now that it will not be possible to run more than two AC coaches with the existing electrical distribution system is just not acceptable. Were the Metro a private organization, heads would have surely rolled. Who is responsible for the mess?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
D.K. Sanyal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  When Mamata Banerjee became the Union railways minister, Calcuttans expected the Metro services to improve significantly. But the services were extended without installing the necessary infrastructure to meet with the increased demand. To cope with the surge in passengers, the frequency of trains needs to be increased. New rakes should be introduced to avoid technical snags. Many more ticket counters need to be opened and the price of tickets raised.Banerjee is busy flagging off new trains. She should pay a surprise visit to any of the Metro stations to apprise herself of pitiable condition of the Metro Railways.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

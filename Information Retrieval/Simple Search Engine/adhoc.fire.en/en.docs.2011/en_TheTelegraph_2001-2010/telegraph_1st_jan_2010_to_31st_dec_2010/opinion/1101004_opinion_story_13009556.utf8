	The headlines in the Western media all said more or less the same thing when the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, pulled the plug on the latest round of the Middle East peace process. Netanyahu urges [Palestinian leader Mahmoud] Abbas to continue peace talks as building freeze expires, they said, or Netanyahu appeals for calm as freeze on settlements runs out. Et cetera. But it was Netanyahu who agreed to the building freeze 10 months ago, because the Palestinians were refusing to negotiate over the future of their land while Israelis continue to colonize it  or maybe because the American government, which agrees with the Palestinians about this, was twisting his arm very hard.        
	Netanyahu was well aware that Abbas could not continue to negotiate if work on expanding the Israeli settlements resumed. President Barack Obama had begged Netanyahu not to wreck the talks by cancelling the freeze. Yet, Netanyahu has chosen not to extend it. What does that tell us about his interest in a peace settlement?        
	Apologists for Israeli policy point out that the freeze always had that 10-month, self-cancelling proviso built into it, and that Netanyahus coalition government would almost certainly collapse if he extended it now. They are probably right, as the coalition includes extreme right-wing and settler-dominated parties that are dedicated to perpetual Israeli control over much or all of the occupied Palestinian territories. But it was Netanyahu who set that deadline in the first place, allegedly to placate the more extreme elements in his coalition. Presumably, it is they who are forcing his hand now.        
	No, thats not quite right either. If Netanyahus coalition broke up, he could fairly easily create another in which parties that genuinely support the peace talks took the place of the extremist parties that stormed out. So the evidence suggests that Netanyahu is not interested in a peace settlement. Netanyahu would be very interested in a peace deal in which the Palestinians agreed to his terms. He has never specified exactly what they are, but judging by what he has said in the past and by the company he keeps, they would amount to almost unconditional surrender.                
	Unchanged agenda        
	Netanyahu wants permanent Israeli control of the land on which most of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank stand, and Palestinian assent to the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem. There would be no return of Palestinian refugees to their former homes in what is now Israel. And the Palestinians would have to create a government tough enough to enforce those terms on an outraged population, but not strong enough to threaten Israel. Netanyahu knows that any Palestinian leader who agreed to such draconian peace terms could not survive: so he is not very interested in the peace talks. He must look keen for peace, however, since that is what his American senior partners expect.        
	The first time Netanyahu led the Israeli government, in 1996-99, he faced a similar problem. The Oslo peace accords had been signed recently, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who made that deal, had been martyred by an extreme right-wing Jewish assassin. There was a strong backlash against the far-Right in Israel, and a serious danger that a land-for-peace deal was in the offing. Netanyahu might not even have won the 1996 election if Palestinian extremists, hoping that he would destroy the Oslo deal, had not given him a boost by launching a terror campaign. And it worked: having won the election, he successfully stalled for three years on fulfilling the Oslo terms. By 1999, despair had set in among Palestinian moderates, and the peace process was effectively dead. Netanyahu is in power again, and there is no reason to suppose that his agenda has changed since then.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | no easy cure
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO EASY CURE                                                    
	In India, the ill often find it more convenient to opt for self-administered cures  in the form of medicine bought over the counter without prescription  than to visit a doctor for an informed opinion. For the vast majority that lives below poverty line, the latter is not a feasible option at all, given the expenses involved. Free treatment provided by State-funded clinics is not always accessible for various reasons  paucity of trained physicians, depleted stocks of medicines, lack of equipment and so on. However, the desire to play doctor is noted as widely among those who are relatively better off and can afford to pay a visit to a physician to get a common cold or fever treated. The easy availability of antibiotics in pharmacies all over India is chiefly responsible for such an irresponsible attitude. Prescribing strong antibiotics is a much-favoured practice among doctors, although there is increased awareness about the pitfalls of popping pills hastily. So the central drug controls decision to ban the sale of antibiotics without prescriptions deserves to be welcomed for several reasons.        
	But like all noble intentions, this one too is too good to be true. In India, the nexus between physicians and the medicine industry has become too dangerously murky to be quickly sorted out by well-meaning policies. It is common for doctors to prescribe a certain brand of drug in exchange of incentives offered by its manufacturers. By making it mandatory for drugstores to keep a photocopy of prescriptions, the drug control authorities have underscored the question of accountability of doctors. But can such a project ever be foolproof, or even be practically feasible, especially for owners of small drugstores located in obscure places that are frequented by many people every day? And in a country where justice is delivered at snails pace, how many unscrupulous doctors would be brought to book? Increased awareness still remains the more sensible option.

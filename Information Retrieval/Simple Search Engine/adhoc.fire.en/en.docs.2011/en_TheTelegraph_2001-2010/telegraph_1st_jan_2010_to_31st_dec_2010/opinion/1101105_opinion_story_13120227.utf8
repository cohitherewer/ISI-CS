                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Beyond capacity                  
	Sir  In India, a situation where people would not overload a trawler, endangering their lives, but would rather wait for the next ferry is possible only in the imagination, as the editorial, River deaths (Nov 1), says. India is a vast country dotted with rivers and rivulets that are crossed by millions of people every day. Most of these people, who live below the poverty line, are simply left to fend for themselves in case of eventualities. India boasts of being a socialist republic. It pays compensation to victims of tragedies. So what prevents it from adopting a few preventive measures that may minimize the chances of similar disasters?          
	Rules can easily be implemented by the State to prevent owners of trawlers from overcrowding their vessels. There should be life jackets on board, and the vessels should always be kept in good condition. The amount spent this way may or may not be more than the compensations paid to accident victims, but such measures would surely go a long way in making a difference between life and death.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that so many men, women and children had to lose their lives in the trawler capsize. Overcrowding in boats, eagerness of people to get back home early, operators flouting safety norms, and lack of knowledge of disaster management are some of the reasons behind boat accidents. It was only last year that many were drowned in Keralas Thekaddy Lake after the boat in which they were travelling sank. That boat had been loaded beyond capacity. One must wear a life jacket if one is in a boat, but people seem to forget such basic safety norms easily. It is also the duty of the vessel owners to keep safety gears on board.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Free for all          
	Sir  In the last three decades, during which the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has been in power in West Bengal, the state government has failed to work out a suitable rehabilitation package for hawkers. All of a sudden now, when the elections are round the corner, the administration has woken up to the problem (Seal on hawker right to pedestrian path, Oct 28). This shows that the present effort is just a strategy to appease voters. The Opposition, headed by the Trinamul Congress, has also made a separate compensation package for hawkers. The irony is that in all this, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation  which is the body that is supposed to implement the plans, whether of the CPI(M) or of the TMC  has neither been consulted nor informed. However, some areas in north, south and central Calcutta have been set aside for the construction of markets for the hawkers. The state governments proposal of giving one-third of pavements to hawkers does not seem to be a feasible solution to the present problem. It is bound to result in perpetual clashes between hawkers and pedestrians. It will also give the city an even uglier look.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjit Sinha, New Delhi

                
	Sir  The decision of the state government to give some kind of legal status to hawkers is disastrous. Calcutta seems to be a city that is free for all. Anyone can put up a stall on the pavement, provided he has the support of local political leaders and policemen. The idea of giving one-third of pavements to hawkers is absurd. How is such a specific area to be marked out? Will officials go around measuring footpaths with tapes?          
	Look at College Street, B.B. Ganguly Street or M.G. Road. Almost the entire pavement is occupied in these places, and the encroaching food-sellers have even constructed pucca chulhas. It is time the citizens of Calcutta demanded their right to walk freely on pavements.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Swadesh Majumdar, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Allowing hawkers to ply their wares on pavements will further add to the pedestrians nightmare. Footpaths will become narrower, and lack of space will lead to accidents. Pavements choked with hawkers would also be a horrid sight to behold. The citizens of Calcutta should immediately raise their voice against the state governments proposal.          
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NEW START                                                    
	A world without nuclear arms is too much to hope for. But the president of the United States of America, Barack Obama, is known for his audacity of hope. And with the recent ratification of the New Start nuclear treaty in the US Senate, Mr Obamas audacious wager with fate seems to have paid off surprisingly well. For not only was the long-deferred treaty passed in the Senate, as many as 13 Republican senators defected to vote in Mr Obamas favour. Given the overall scale of the victory (71-26), it is perhaps prudent to consider its political implications first. Coming on the heels of the massive drubbing that the Democrats got in the midterm elections, this triumph should revive the drooping morale of the party. Moreover, shortly before the treaty was approved in the Senate, Mr Obama managed to repeal the discriminatory Dont ask, dont tell policy, which had so long banned openly gay personnel from serving in the US army. Neither of these was a mean feat for a president whose popularity ratings have been plunging over the last few months. Mr Obamas political fortunes seem to be looking up at last, although it may be premature to read in his achievements any lasting sign of Democratic resurgence.        
	At a more practical level, the treaty seeks to reduce the strategic nuclear warheads of both the US and Russia, bringing the current ceiling of 2,200 down to 1,550. A revised system of monitoring and verification is also expected to come into effect. It would be a major breakthrough for Mr Obamas foreign policy if Russia agrees to the treaty as well, though it would do so only after studying the terms and conditions set by the Senate. A joint pledge to reduce nuclear warheads by two of the worlds superpowers should act as a deterrent for Iran, whose clandestine uranium enrichment programme remains mysteriously opaque to this day. However, it is worth pondering if the solidarity shown by the Republicans truly reflects a principled opposition to nuclear weapons or if it was merely a show of good form under circumstances where the US had nothing to lose. As a Republican senator, who defected to vote for Mr Obama, chillingly reasoned, even with the proposed cuts, both the US and Russia would have enough nuclear arsenal to blow any attacker to kingdom come.

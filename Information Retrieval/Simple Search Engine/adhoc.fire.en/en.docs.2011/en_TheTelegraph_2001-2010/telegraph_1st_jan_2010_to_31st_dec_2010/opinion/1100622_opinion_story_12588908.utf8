The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Crossing the growth bar
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CROSSING THE GROWTH BAR                          - India needs determination to go beyond the tipping point        Ashok Ganguly                                                  
	India is approaching a steady State growth trajectory of 7-7.5 per cent of the gross domestic product per annum. In a good year it may touch eight per cent, with manufacturing, services, agriculture and exports all performing well. Given the present state of Indian politics and administration both at the Centre and in the states, crossing the eight per cent barrier is a challenge. Credit must be given to the state sector with regard to the introduction of and some measure of success in various aam admi schemes, such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the Rajiv Gandhi Awas Yojana and so on, while the private sector has steadily improved productivity, quality and competitiveness, at the same time successfully acquiring global companies and running growing international businesses. Discovery of offshore gas has been encouraging and there is much wider consciousness of environmental issues, climate change and the emerging opportunities in clean technologies. The problems of food security, water security, skills development and rate of employment generation remain some of the major challenges. The slow pace of infrastructure maintenance and development has turned out to be the biggest growth limiter without a clear way forward. In other words, the state sector and the private sector are both performing well in Indias growth story, but not up to the potential to jump to 9-10 per cent annual GDP growth, which is needed to match Indias rate of population growth and demographic profile.        
	The growth challenge represents a tipping point on how India can raise the ante, and then cross the double-digit growth barrier. It is not as if the State is solely responsible for driving economic growth and the private sector plays a tag-along role, or vice versa; or that only private enterprise should be entrusted with the prime responsibility for economic growth, while the State restricts itself to providing essential and basic services to civil society. That both the State and the private sectors have vital roles in Indias economic growth is now well entrenched and beyond doubt or debate. For example, the bulk of investments and capital formation continue to be that of the State, although private sector investment is growing rapidly. This trend of resource mobilization is likely to continue. The investment from the private sector, both Indian as well as foreign, will keep rising as a proportion of total capital investment. There are, however, areas of concern in terms of quality of capital investment and formation. While Indias growth is being driven by both production and consumption, the overall quality of investments remains suboptimal for a rapidly developing country like India. Investments in research and development, leading-edge and capital-intensive technologies and breakthrough innovations are starkly inadequate in the public as well as the private sectors. Foreign investments, barring a few exceptions, are growing primarily in manufacturing goods and providing services catering to the durable and fast-moving consumer sector rather than adding to Indias gross technology mass.        
	While there is rapid growth of visible wealth and conspicuous consumption among those at the tip of Indias population pyramid, there is now also greater flow of economic benefits to the lower tiers of the pyramid. Some of this benefit of distribution is fuelling domestic consumption and helping to reduce the historic disparities of stark poverty and destitution. These developments, however, should not overshadow the growing concern regarding the fragility of Indias technology and manufacturing which, if not attended to purposefully, will create an imbalance between high economic growth and a low technology base.        
	This imbalance is not because Indians are incapable of managing high-technology investments or that India is unattractive for high-technology investments and R amp;D by foreign investors. There are several reasons why Indias technology base is not entering higher sophisticated orbits. Even in the liberalized regulatory environment, both Indian and foreign investors still find it difficult to commit large investments in long gestation projects. Second, high-technology projects, which are dependent on natural raw materials, not only face uncertain and under-defined environmental issues, but also face even more formidable barriers regarding issues such as land acquisition, rehabilitation and compensation for those who are potentially going to be displaced, as well as other ground-level social problems. The ability of the Central government and even more of the state governments to anticipate successfully and satisfactorily deal with such issues remains problematic. Finally, as far as R amp;D and innovation are concerned, in spite of years of fiscal and several other concessions provided by the government, Indian industry stands out for its lack of R amp;D and achievements in world-class discoveries and breakthrough innovations. The history of Indian industries behaviour from the earlier era of restrictions and controls seems to have spilled into the age in which growth and competition are being encouraged, and that is the principal reason for Indias low technology economic base.        
	The 9-10 per cent growth, which is needed to meet Indias commitments to social and economic inclusiveness, will be severely tested unless Indias technology base is rapidly upgraded.        
	Food security, water security, energy self-sufficiency, climate change and clean energy challenges provide the base for the Indian State and the private sectors to start aggressively investing in R amp;D and leading-edge technologies in the appropriate areas. If we are to prevent wealth generated in India from being exclusively used for visible consumption and heating up the equity markets, creating bubbles in sectors such as the real estate sector, the auto sector, the stock market, and so on, we must explore and define a new paradigm in public-private partnership to raise the quality and competitiveness of Indias R amp;D and technology base. As illustrated earlier, the areas include acquiring, developing and applying genetic engineering and low-chemical, low-water farming technology to raise production and productivity of various crops, pulses, vegetables, fruits and so on. Similarly, investments in storage and cold chains in order to maximize returns to producers while reducing prices for the consumers will help create a network of production, storage, delivery grids across the country while upgrading Indias agricultural technology and productivity base.        
	Conservation and management of water and delivery of affordable safe drinking water requires public-private partnership and investment for modernization and upgradation of technology with huge benefits, such as availability of potable water and thus improvement in human health, while reducing child mortality caused by water-borne diseases. Supplementing thermal and hydro power with nuclear power, while investing in R amp;D for clean energy technology, is one of the biggest and potentially the most rewarding high-technology challenges and a huge opportunity for India.        
	The challenges of developing clean technologies and tackling the problems of climate change have been described as the stuff of a second industrial revolution. Although the fruits of the first industrial revolution took a long time to arrive in India, the country is at the starting block alongside the rest of the world, with an opportunity to be amongst the leading discoverers and developers of the outputs from this second industrial revolution. Indian technologists, scientists and engineers have amply demonstrated their prowess around the world and in India, for example, in the information technology sector, starting from when Indians were hailed for their leading role in providing solutions for the so-called Millennium Bug. Today, Indian IT companies are recognized internationally for their key role as technology solution providers and for their leading-edge IT innovations. Thus, the challenge and opportunities of the second industrial revolution are well within the grasp of Indian entrepreneurs, business leaders, scientists and engineers. There are lessons to be learnt from Indias IT success. It almost happened outside the countrys mainstream radar screen while triggering an explosive growth in Indias largest service sector. The development of new, clean and environmentally friendly technologies must, by contrast, be made more purposeful and visible by a combination of ambitious investment targets and national mega goals. The massive investments in new IITs, the modernization of existing ones and the creation of new institutes of advanced scientific research, and their partnership with Indias private and public sectors, provide a sound basis for India to embark upon a high-technology journey.              
	Trying to enter a high-technology orbit is both daunting and hugely challenging and can only be successfully undertaken by a combined formal commitment by both the government and the private sector in India. Just because such an experiment of public-private partnership has not been attempted before need not be the reason not to embark upon this new and exciting adventure. For example, the governments solar energy mission provides an ideal base for it to invite private sector participants as well as partners from research and academic institutions to signal a serious national interest. Similar partnerships can be forged, for example, for the drinking water mission. It is now time to start building the larger architecture of opportunities and challenges in public-private partnership to define Indias technology ambitions required to raise the rate of economic growth.        
	Therefore, to break through the 9-10 per cent growth barrier, India must explore ways to pool public and private talent and resources for projects and schemes of national priority. The fruits of such novel national initiatives will also provide India with 21st-century technology security while boosting its economic growth and, in the process, raise the level of technological sophistication and the ability to transact international high and new technology business on equal terms.        
	Given the quality of our entrepreneurs, business leaders, scientists, engineers and the deep roots of Indias democracy and strength of political leadership, the time has come for India to start changing the rules of engagement in order to achieve a higher and more sustainable as well as equitable economic society, by crossing the tipping point with a sense of purpose and determination.

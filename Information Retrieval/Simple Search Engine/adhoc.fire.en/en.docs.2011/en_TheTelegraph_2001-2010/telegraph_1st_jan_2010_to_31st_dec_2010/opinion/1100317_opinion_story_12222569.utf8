The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time for realism
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME FOR REALISM                                                    
	The success of a new deal for Darjeeling can show if politics is really the art of the possible. True, the Centres and the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas plans for a settlement of the long-standing issue of the status of the hills differ on many counts. It is easy to assume that the West Bengal government too will differ on several points in both the plans. But reducing the areas of disagreement and finding common ground is precisely the challenge for the negotiators. What ultimately matters is the political will to not let the problems derail the search for solutions. The most encouraging signal from the two plans is that the GJM seems to have relented on its demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland. Bimal Gurung, the GJM leader, knows that a division of West Bengal would be unacceptable to not only the government and most political parties in the state but also to the Centre, which faces such demands in Telangana and elsewhere in the country. New Delhi has to tread cautiously even on issues such as granting legislative, judicial and law-enforcing powers to the proposed body in Darjeeling. The negotiators have to strike a balance between fulfilling the political aspirations of the people of Darjeeling and the anti-partition sentiments of those in the rest of West Bengal. It is not an easy task but statehood stirs tough challenges for all negotiators.        
	For the long-suffering people of Darjeeling though, the fine print about the territorial jurisdiction or the powers of the proposed administrative body may be rather irrelevant. Whether the body exercises power over 54 subjects or is under the direct control of the state governor may have nothing to do with the common peoples concerns. The Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council that was born of the tripartite agreement among the Centre, the West Bengal government and Subash Ghisingh of the Gorkha National Liberation Front in 1988 had enough powers to make a difference to the lives of the people. If it failed to do so, it was primarily because of Mr Ghisinghs autocratic ways and the state governments abject surrender to him. The people of Darjeeling have suffered long spells of violence and political instability during the last two decades. It is time their own leaders and the governments in New Delhi and Calcutta gave them an honourable deal. Realism, not rhetoric, is the need of the hour.

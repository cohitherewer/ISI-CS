                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        INSECURE EGO                                                    
	The size of a ministers ego is inversely proportional to the quality of his performance in office. This was proved right, yet again, by the unpleasant scene created by West Bengals health minister, Surjya Kanta Mishra, when he was stopped for frisking while entering a hotel to attend a conference. Mr Mishra took great offence at this, called his Central counterpart (who was equally furious), and in a short while, the hotel authorities, organizers of the conference, police superintendents and senior bureaucrats were all involved, thundering down the security staff and trying to placate the ministers. There was soon an orgy of abject apologizing, led by hotel officials and security personnel. Only then did Mr Mishra agree to attend the conference and, in his magnanimity, asked the hotel not to detain the hapless guards. Top-ranking bureaucrats, police officials and hotel administrators were unanimous in condemning this disrespect shown to a minister.        
	It did not occur to any of these people that the guards were simply doing their duty  and doing it with an integrity and a dependability that were exemplary, particularly for the important person who chose to take mighty offence at what they did. Ordinary (and not so ordinary) people entering five-star hotels and other public places submit to routine security checks all the time without any signs of serious damage to their self-importance. But Mr Mishra is obviously made of sterner, or more fragile, stuff. For him, this was a breach not just of protocol but also of courtesy. What about another definition of courtesy, by which the minister, perhaps with a little smile, allows himself to be frisked by an unsuspecting guard and then pats the guard on his back for doing his duty well? Perhaps Bengals hospitals would have been less dangerous for the poor and the ill if its health minister understood such a notion of courtesy.

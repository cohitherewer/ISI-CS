The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Ice creams are made in heaven
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ICE CREAMS ARE MADE IN HEAVEN                                  THIS ABOVE ALL: Khushwant Singh                          That taste                                        
	Now that I have drastically cut down the amount I eat, I think of tasty food all the time. My pet obsession is to select one item on which I could live happily for the rest of my life. First I thought of rice. Since you have to have something to go with it, I crossed it out. I did the same with bread as you have to eat something with it. The third item I thought of was daal (lentils). There are many varieties to choose from: I like all of them but I am not sure whether I could eat daals twice every day. Next were potatoes and peas, both of which I relish. But if I lived on potatoes I would surely get fat, and peas create much gas in the stomach. So no potatoes or peas.         
	It could be some vegetable like carrots, tomatoes, beans, karela, spinach  whatever. I would be bored very soon. So also with fruit apples, pears, grapes, bananas, kiwi fruit  all good for health but not acceptable as the only thing to eat. Ultimately, I looked back: the one item I never tired of was ice cream. From the time I tasted the petiwallahs product wrapped in flannel in a small wooden box (hence petiwallah) and served on a dried pattal (palash leaf), it became my favourite. Petiwalas disappeared and were replaced by kulfiwallahs. Their product was in pitchers packed with ice and the kulfi would be in metal containers. Some were well known for the excellence of their product. I went long distances to buy them. Then we started making ice cream at home in wooden buckets full of ice and milk in different flavours. It was delicious.         
	Many years ago, my father bought the Narbudda Ice Cream factory in Bhopal. I was working on my first novel and living alone in the managers house by the lake. I made it a point to visit the factory every afternoon and spend some time in the large room where a pond-sized container had fragrant substances being churned slowly. It smelt heavenly and I wanted to plunge into it. I gorged myself on ice cream because I did hate to pay for it. My choice now is Mother Dairys Kulfi. I eat one every day as dessert after dinner. I could live on it for the rest of my life.                 
	Fair name                
	Merely for filling the air of Bhopal 
  with poison
  And taking the lives of a few
  thousand men, women and children.
  The cops first arrested
  Warren Anderson,
  Which was heinously
  wrongful action
  And now we have raked up
  the case again
  And given the gentleman
  unnecessary pain.
  Forgive, O Lord, the ex-collector of Bhopal and others
  who know not
  How much prosperity Union
  Carbide has brought,
  How much misunderstanding
  the latest revelation creates
  And slurs the fair name of the
  United States.
  How unfair it is to certain Indian
  gentlemen
  Who might have expedited the
  escape of Anderson
  And possibly made a few millions
  or a billion
  And all this for the death of
  Indian men, women and children
  Surely, we must not irritate Union
  Carbide and Mr Anderson
  For suggesting a solution to
  Indias over-population.

	Ever after        
	Once upon a time, a couple celebrated their 25th marriage anniversary. They had become famous for not having a single quarrel in such a long period. Local media men gathered on the occasion to find out the secret of their well-known marriage.        
	Journalist: Its unbelievable. How did you make this possible?        
	Husband: (Recalling his old honeymoon days) We went to Shimla for honeymoon. Having selected horse-riding, we rode side by side. My horse was okay but the horse on which my wife was riding seemed to be crazy. It jumped suddenly and tossed my wife over. She got up and patted the horses back and said: This is your first time. She again climbed the horse and continued riding. After a while, it happened again. This time she kept her cool and said: This is your second time and continued. When the horse dropped her for the third time, she took out a revolver from the purse and shot the horse dead. I shouted at my wife: What did you do, you psycho? You killed the poor animal. Are you crazy? She gave a silent look and said: This is your first time!        
	Thats it. We have been happy ever after.

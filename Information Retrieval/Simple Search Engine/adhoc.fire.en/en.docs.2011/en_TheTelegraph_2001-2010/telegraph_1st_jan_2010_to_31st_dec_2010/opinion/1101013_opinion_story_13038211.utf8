	The lore and language of the British aristocracy are not, I trust, of deep concern to The Telegraph-readers. Yet this is a quaint byway of English. Lets follow it.         
	Not that its my territory. At Eton College 60 years ago, we 70 scholarship-holders were surrounded by scions of the nobility. One was a duke. But the only ones I recall were the then Viscount Weymouth, who later, as Marquess of Bath, grew into a fine 20th-century version of the eccentric English peer, peopling his ancestral mansion with a host of young women whom he knew as wifelets; and, beside him (whom I never in fact met), a good friend who later inherited a viscountcy and became a notable sociologist.        
	As those two show, the nobs (without a k; nob is ancient British slang for head, but how its plural got todays meaning is a mystery) have always been a varied lot. The oldest titles derive from Norman thugs who came with William the Conqueror in 1066. Later titles repaid some service to the king, or ennobled his illegitimate sons. Recent ones have gone to wealth, success in business, public service or, often nowadays, to some worn out MP kicked upstairs to the House of Lords to free his Commons seat for someone else.         
	Royalty apart, titles range from duke and his duchess, marquess and marchioness, earl the sole Anglo-Saxon word  and, oddly, his countess, viscount and plain baron. So far, so easy. But their nomenclature is a maze. The Marquess of Here may be also Viscount of There, but that title is given, by courtesy, to his eldest son; so the man known as Viscount There does not in fact hold that viscountcy. And when papa dies, all change.         
	There are complex rules, now dying, on how to address the various ranks: a duke is entitled to Your Grace. Under one odd convention, peers signed letters, except to friends, only with their titular name: Lord Bath would sign simply as Bath. But in the 1960s, a politician called George Brown chose to be kicked upstairs as Lord George-Brown, so that he could go on using his familiar signature. That absurdity, slowly, brought better sense.        
	The Season, as the nobs called it, ran most of the summer. At the start, aristocratic girls (gels or gerls was their way of saying it) came out  that is, were presented at Buckingham Palace  before a long round of dances; the debs delights, the well-born young men these debutantes met, risked being labelled NSIT by mama if they were not safe in taxis. The Season was punctuated with events, mostly sporting: Ascot (a week of racing at that town west of London); the Fourth of June (a very grand open day at my old school); Henley (a rowing regatta); Cowes (a week of yachting at that southern port). It ended with the Glorious Twelfth  a hacks more than nobs phrase for that date in August, when grouse-shooting begins.         
	And there was Lords  not a Test match, something far more important, the two-day game there between Eton and Harrow. Here cricket came second to Society. Yet in 1910, cricket gave the arcane vocabulary of the nobs a phrase remembered even now: Fowlers Match. Harrow scored 232, Eton a sorry 67. Following on, Eton managed 219, thanks to 64 from their captain, one Robert St Leger Fowler, and 50 from their last pair. Harrow needed just 54 to win  and scored only 45, Fowler taking eight wickets for 23. Descendants of the players will celebrate at a dinner next month.        
	At, typically, the Cavalry and Guards Club  what other regiments would a gentleman serve with? It could be said of our aristos, in their landowning days, that they lived off the country but were ready to die for it. Taxation largely ended the first, two world wars proved the second. The 1950s ended the debutante flummery. Not that the Season is dead. But nobs is not the word Id use for many of the people in todays version of it.

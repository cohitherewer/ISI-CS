	Any progressive teacher would enjoy teaching a 20-year-old with strong, but contrary, opinions on what is being taught. But things begin to look a bit different when the student happens to be the grandson of Mumbais Balasaheb Thackeray. As with many young men, Aditya Thackeray has hobbies like photography and poetry, to which he has added, with a fine sense of alliteration, another one called politics. Being who he is, his relationship with the last is likely to be far more passionate than his relationships with the first two. He was recently made the leader of the Yuva Sena  youth wing of the Shiv Sena  and an eventful history of bigotry and vandalism immediately opens up behind this particular youth. As a sort of public initiation ritual, the younger Mr Thackeray decided to feel actively offended by a novel being taught in his university as part of the BA syllabus  Rohinton Mistrys Such a Long Journey. The book is critical of his grandfathers politics, and that is not to be tolerated. The grandson has nothing against the novel in itself, but I do not want it to be part of the Mumbai University syllabus. As with fairytale princes, his wish was fulfilled instantly. The vice-chancellor of the university, in consultation with the board of studies, made sure that the book was taken off the course. The chief minister of Maharashtra read the relevant passages and publicly agreed that they were objectionable. Meanwhile, the Shiv Senas activism has moved on to other matters. Inspired by the French, it now wants the burqa banned. But the grandsons triumph keeps the Senas flags flying high in the city, and everybody, from the most glamorous to the most humble, must take note.        
	This is how things have been for Mumbai and, earlier, for Bombay  from terrorizing the non-Maharashtrians working in the city and the Valentines Day rampage every year to obstructing the release of films because of their makers political or cultural views. Yet Mumbai has learnt to carry on being liberal and indomitable in spite of its bigots and their fearsome influence on its iconic citizens. The protesters are mostly ordinary Mumbaikars, who have supported Mr Mistrys publicly voiced concern for the essential modern freedoms. One wonders, though, what the students themselves feel about the matter. In a city where politics easily becomes bigotry, would they bother to protest against being taken for passive objects without opinions of their own?

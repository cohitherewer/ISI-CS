The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Two gentlemen leaders
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TWO GENTLEMEN LEADERS                              Commentarao      S.L. Rao                                                
	There are common elements in the personalities of Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh. There are also parallels in their performances. Both are cerebral, with little public sense of humour and no apparent capacity for expressing emotion. They are innately polite and gentlemanly. They do not appear to enjoy or practice public politics. And both respond to harsh words about themselves with rational argument.        
	Obama swept into power on the wave of his lofty vision of change. A great orator and writer, with a mastery of the English language, he raised the hopes and aspirations of millions across the world. He articulated a persuasive vision of the goodness of ordinary people and their desire to work together. He had never held any executive position in government or outside it. He was catapulted to the most powerful job in the world by his charisma. There has never been any allegation against, or scandal about, him. He has a young and happy family. He claims strong religious beliefs and is a practicing Christian.        
	Obama came to power when the nation was in the throes of the worst economic crisis since World War II. In addition, it was mired in two wars, with increasing numbers of American soldiers dying. The United States of America was in huge debt, primarily to China, and had to bend its opinions to not upset its principal creditor. The festering Israel-Palestine dispute, in which the US had always taken a consistently pro- Israel stance, had corroded the feelings of Muslims and many others towards US administrations.        
	Manmohan Singh succeeded Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and was not the natural choice for prime minister. Sonia Gandhi, his party president, was his sponsor and boss. In private politics, he had been successful, having held top economic positions under different prime ministers and even parties. He had never won an election and is a member of the Rajya Sabha. He is not a charismatic leader like Obama, nor has he painted visions of a future India. His governments policies have brought change  the recognition of India as a nuclear power, policies for inclusive growth, continuing attempts to reach out to Pakistan and China, a massive infrastructure construction programme using innovative public-private partnerships for funding it, path-breaking laws ensuring the rights to information, education, health and food. While many of these policies are credited to Sonia Gandhi and her National Advisory Council, Singh can take exclusive credit for the agreement with the Bush administration to remove Indias ostracism by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. His personal integrity is also well known.        
	Under the US system, the president is all-powerful in his cabinet, but much tempered by the Senate and the Congress while passing legislations and making appointments. Singh, in his cabinet, is the first among equals but many prime ministers had large popular followings and so were very powerful. Or they combined the job of prime minster with being the head of the Congress Party. Despite not having a large popular electoral base, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao enjoyed unquestioned obedience from others in his party and ministry. With Singh, there is not such an acceptance. His authority is further diminished by his subservience to Sonia Gandhi, especially since she abdicated her chance to be prime minister for him. Further erosion of authority was caused by his leading a disparate coalition of parties (inside and outside the government) having little in common with one another. Singhs gentle personality also appears to reduce his ability to impose his views on his ministers.         
	The party reluctantly accepts Singh because their unquestioned leader, Sonia Gandhi, and her children want it to be so. This leads to powerful Congressmen expressing dissent with the government and ministries, and to ministers disagreeing in public with State policies. Obama does not have this problem. However, in recent months, as his ratings declined and the Republicans sabotaged many of his initiatives, Obama failed to secure the support of Democrat leaders. His cabinet has no choice but to follow him. In tackling the recession, Obama has not been sufficiently forceful. Unemployment remains high. He fought the health reform battle with Republicans and antagonized many voters who wanted him to pay more attention to domestic economic woes. Obama declared a date for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan without indicating how he would strengthen the war-torn nation.              
	Singh used up his political credit for the nuclear deal but the nuclear liability bill is bound to undergo changes to satisfy equipment suppliers. The bureaucracies remain ineffective  take, for instance, the fiasco over the Commonwealth Games. As a top bureaucrat for almost 30 years, Singh could have transformed the bureaucracy. He has, to an extent, made people aware of issues in energy, growth and climate change, kept alive a closeness with the US while retaining the traditional Indo-Russian relationship, and introduced social programmes to further development policies. He has been unsuccessful in improving law and order and in responding to militancy and terrorism.        
	It is difficult to evaluate the Obama presidency as yet. He has avoided a deeper recession, although unemployment remains high. He has radically reformed healthcare and unemployment insurance, engaged in greater consultation with friendly nations, initiated global actions on climate change, and set a deadline for disengagement from Afghanistan. Still, Obama might lose his partys control over legislatures. He is yet to raise savings rates, cut external debts and defuse Israels militancy towards the Arabs. He must deal with the belligerent Republicans and come up with a strategy to be elected for a second term.        
	There is still time for both leaders to change the gloomy prospects for their governments. Else we must wonder if cerebral gentlemen are suited to lead large and complex nations.

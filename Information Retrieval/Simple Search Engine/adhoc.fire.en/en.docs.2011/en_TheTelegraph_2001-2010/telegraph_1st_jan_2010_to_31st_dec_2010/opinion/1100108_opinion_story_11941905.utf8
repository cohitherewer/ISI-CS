	Dark design                  
	Sir  The witch hunt, which was triggered off by the power failure during the one-day international between India and Sri Lanka, witnessed the police chief, Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, putting the blame on the Cricket Association of Bengal (Power failure? Call the commissioner, Jan 3). Blackouts during cricket matches are not a new phenomenon, and are unlikely to have an adverse impact on Eden Gardens chances of hosting an international game in the future.          
	What happened in Eden Gardens on December 24 was an accident and no individual can be blamed for the mishap. Had the CAB been controlled by the ruling Marxists, the police chief would not have gone beyond his jurisdiction to probe the incident. Why did the police chief come into the picture, even though there was no law- and-order problem at the ground?          
	For some strange reason, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee saw it fit to put in place a number of inquiry committees to investigate the matter. All this makes one thing clear: Bhattacharjee wants to punish the CAB chief, Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is his arch-rival. It seems that the wounds inflicted by Dalmiya upon Bhattacharjee during the polls to elect the CAB president have not healed yet. Bhattacharjee wanted to use the floodlight fiasco to avenge the defeat of his nominee, Prasun Mukherjee, to Dalmiya for the post of the CAB president. Bhattacharjee knows fully well that the CAB is an autonomous body. Yet, he is making this ridiculous attempt of using the office of the police chief to establish control over the CAB. As for Chakrabarti, he seems to have become a jack of all trades, taking his cue from his predecessor. Like Mukherjee, Chakrabarti is interested in every other thing, save for the citys law- and-order situation. The prime suspect in the Habra murder case is still absconding. The police commissioner should take up the challenge of cracking the case, acting upon the chief ministers assurance to a victims family that the police would catch the culprits soon. During the last three decades, the Marxists have succeeded in politicizing every institution. The CAB is the only exception. Now it remains to be seen whether Chakrabarti takes it upon himself to become a public figure from a public servant.          
	Yours faithfully,         Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat, Burdwan            
	Sir  It is not clear why the police chief decided to interfere in the floodlight crisis at the Eden Gardens during a cricket match played recently. Without the concurrence of the CAB, which is an independent body, can the police interfere? The CAB should take a firm stand on the matter.          
	Yours faithfully,      
G. Bhattacharya, Kshudiram Nagar, Midnapore

      
	Sir  While talking about the imbroglio in Eden Gardens, the editorial, Waxing state (Jan 3), states correctly that there is an alarming tendency to expand the powers of the State by interfering in affairs that are none of its business. This, however, is a phenomenon that is perhaps peculiar to Marxist West Bengal. In Delhi, when the game between India and Sri Lanka was abandoned as a result of a poor pitch, neither the chief minister nor the police chief intervened in the matter. Will Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti please take note of this?          
	Yours faithfully,         Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta            
	Help at hand          
	Sir  It pains me to hear about a young person committing suicide and I wish there was some help for the victim (Look Ma, Im Dead!, Jan 3). Those who commit suicide usually give some prior indication. They often dream about their own deaths or funerals, and have a tendency to speak and think about other peoples deaths. All these symptoms indicate a suicidal tendency. When someone shows such symptoms, the matter should be taken seriously. Only a fraction of those who have suicidal tendencies may actually end their lives, but we cannot really know how severe such tendencies are or how close the person actually is to committing suicide. Early identification of the tendency and counselling might help save such peoples lives.          
	Suicidal tendencies may arise for many reasons. In most cases, the root of the problem may be traced to early childhood and is often related to parenting. Parents inability to bring up their children affect the latter adversely. Children need attention, but too much attention one moment and too little the next can affect a childs self-esteem. Conflict between parents also has a negative impact on a young child. Children often end up thinking that they are the cause of the conflict.          
	Programmes for healthy parenting can be a preventive measure. Life-skill education during adolescence can also help the child fight problems caused by defective parenting. Boosting a childs self-esteem can be a curative measure against suicidal tendencies as well.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Pradeep Roy, Baruipur

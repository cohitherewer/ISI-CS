On the occasions when Aunt is calling to Aunt like mastodons bellowing across primeval swamps and Uncle Jamess letter about Cousin Mabels behaviour is being shot round the family circle (Please read this carefully and send it on to Jane), the clan has a tendency to ignore me. Its one of the advantages I get from being a bachelor  and, according to my nearest and dearest, practically a half-witted bachelor at that.   P.G.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | name to honour
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NAME TO HONOUR                                                    
	In their eagerness to pay homage to high culture, politicians in West Bengal tend to forget about other variants of that word  work culture, for instance, which has practically vanished from the state for good. Bengal already has a connoisseur of the former kind of culture in its chief minister; so it would do very well to have a leader who believes in the latter. But with the chief of the main opposition party of the state also set on the pursuit of exalted names, such a possibility looks increasingly remote. In her recent railway budget, the Union railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, renewed her pledge to rename several stations on the Calcutta Metro network to honour certain iconic Indians. She would have done much better had she spared a thought for ordinary Indians instead. Putting aside the warped, and in some cases non-existent, logic behind the new names, nothing but confusion will ensue from this project. As it is, people are still grappling with the fancy names given to the stations on the extended Metro route. It would be highly inconsiderate of the railways minister to now inflict a fresh set of fancy names on the public by removing the existing ones. Indeed, Park Street may not have the same humane ring as Mother Teresa, but the older name served its purpose quite well.        
	It would be far more humanitarian of Ms Banerjee if she cared to improve the quality of service in the Calcutta Metro. Like much else in the city, the underground network has an aura of timelessness about it  a noble gloom pervades its crumbling infrastructure, as passengers fall at one anothers throats while getting on or off the trains at rush hours. There are still no toilets on the station premises, no special access for the physically challenged, and the escalators seldom function. Since the introduction of the Smart Card to reduce queues at ticket counters and fetch more revenue for the organization, a perverse pleasure has been added to the list of woes: the Smart gates, belying their names, almost routinely fail to function, offering their users a free ride. When one of her Lok Sabha colleagues objected to the renaming of Kalighat as Bhagat Singh, Ms Banerjee snapped back, Be like Bhagat Singh. He died for the country. The people of West Bengal surely do not expect her to do as much  a few well-thought policies aimed at the greater common good would do just fine.

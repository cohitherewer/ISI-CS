	According to an old saying, the past is a different country, they do things differently there. The words, the past, could easily be substituted by West Bengal and the saying would make perfect sense. Indeed the substitution would be rather apposite since the past and West Bengal are practically synonymous as West Bengal lives in the past. The context of these comments is the fact that while West Bengal  its people and its politicians  has been celebrating or mourning (depending on political persuasions) the results of the civic polls, the Karnataka government organized a Global Investors Meet. On the inaugural day of the event, the government signed memoranda of understanding envisaging investments worth Rs 3 lakh crore. This one contrast signals how things are done differently in West Bengal. Every single state in India is taking steps to attract investment and to make progress on the path of economic growth. West Bengal is different. It believes in the politics of demonstration and destruction; it believes, against all historical evidence and logic, that economic growth is possible through agriculture and not industry; it believes that the problems of the poor can be alleviated through slogans and radical rhetoric instead of development work in the fields of nutrition, health and education. West Bengal takes pride in being different.        
	Not even in those heady days, when it seemed that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was willing to abandon his ideology in the search for industrial investment, had there been a meeting of industrialists on the scale of the one held in Bangalore. Such a meeting was not even thought of. Opponents of communist rule in West Bengal find it convenient to blame the Communist Party of India (Marxist) for the condition of the state where nothing flourishes except rallies and protests. This is only partially true, since communists did create an anti-capital and anti-investment ambience; it is also true that their agitations and politics erased all traces of work culture in the state. But these achievements would not have been possible without a broad consensus of support. No political party, even those opposed to the Left, has yet put forward a concrete and feasible programme to revive work culture and the investment climate in West Bengal. The reality is that there have been movements in the state against industries, never one in favour of industries.        
	This says something about the state and about the people who inhabit it. Are the people of West Bengal against the idea of economic growth that involves hard work, discipline and investments? Do they prefer street politics over the politics of development? Do they want to remain different even if this means remaining backward? These are questions that the people of the state will have to answer for themselves and their future.

	The doctors in Batra Hospital in Delhi reportedly did something rather silly. They had apparently deleted all mention of malignancy from a patients discharge certificate at his wifes request, because he would be extremely upset if he came to know the truth. Faced with a charge of negligence after his death, and a compensation claim of Rs 45 lakh, the doctors may have rued their deed of compassion. The wife complained that there was nothing in the patients papers to show that he had malignancy and that surgery was necessary. The Supreme Court, however, not only upheld the decision of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, which had dismissed the wifes complaint and compensation claim, but also declared that the Consumer Protection Act could not be used as a halter around doctors necks. The court has defined medical negligence in detail, clarifying that a doctors choice of treatment, when there are various modes available, cannot be seen as negligence if the result is not positive, as long as his procedure is accepted as normal in the profession.        
	This case is an excellent example of the damage that has been done to the bonds of trust and compassion between doctors and patients by the indiscriminate use of the CPA. There are negligent doctors without a doubt. Hospitals too are often callous, inefficient or greedy. But the desire to punish after the death of or damage to a loved one has also made the CPA a constantly looming threat for medical professionals. Such pressure makes many of them hesitate when taking crucial instant decisions, or employing advanced methods of treatment. This cannot be good for healing. Doctors in government institutions are often hamstrung by a lack of resources and an absence of infrastructural maintenance. Medical negligence is dangerous and tragic, but to identify it accurately, the court has said, it must be shown that a doctor did or failed to do something no doctor would have done or omitted. That may make things a little difficult for the complainant, but it is important to locate the cause of the failure correctly when there is one. If doctors take extra care about transparency and communication, this lightening of the load would allow them to work with confidence. Some of the trust between doctor and patient would be restored too, for without it no treatment can be consistent or steady.

	Perfect Rigor: A Genius And The Mathematical Breakthrough Of   The Century																														 By Masha Gessen, 
  Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $26  
	This is the biography of one of the greatest living mathematicians, Grigory Perelman. The biography proceeds from a paradox: despite the fact that the subject is still alive, he has not been interviewed or spoken to. This peculiarity is not for the want of trying on the part of the biographer, Masha Gessen. It is totally to do with the personality of Perelman who, after he solved one of the toughest mathematical problems, became a recluse, refusing to meet anyone. He even refused the Fields Medal (the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for mathematics) and a prize of $1 million.
    
	In 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute in Boston had announced a prize of a million dollars to anyone who could solve the seven great unsolved problems of mathematics. One of these problems is a classic of mathematical topology and is known as the Poincar Conjecture. It is named after Henri Poincar who formulated it in 1904. The Conjecture had been worked on by many famous mathematicians and had been the subject of many false proofs. It was finally solved in 2006 by Perelman, an eccentric (even by the standards prevailing among mathematicians) Russian mathematician.  
	Gessens marvellous book on a difficult subject and a difficult person is based on very detailed research. She has spoken to almost everyone who knows or knew Perelman  his classmates, teachers, coaches, teammates and colleagues in Russia and the United States of America. She was aided in her research by her own background. She is herself a mathematical whiz raised in Russia.        
	One great advantage of this book is that it demands no knowledge of maths, but an interest in it. The book has two aspects that are revealing, and one of these was previously unknown. The latter is the personal life of Perelman and his personality. The other is the atmosphere within Russia (in the Soviet era and afterwards) that nurtured mathematics and mathematicians.        
	The world of mathematics was a well-organized and regimented one, complete with special coaching facilities and coaches. Special processes were put in place to seek out the extraordinary talents from those who were good but not gifted. The first test was the maths Olympiad. Perelman went through this regime surprising one and all with his almost superhuman computational power. He was solitary and believed in clear and rigorous thinking. He did not believe that there was anything outside his logical thinking. Logic was his Ideal.        
	This Ideal inevitably clashed with reality. Gessen is very good at drawing out this harsh conflict between a genius and the world. The perfect rigour of Perelmans mind did not fit with the imperfections of the world he encountered. His genius was untouched by the lures of position, prize and pelf. He retreated into himself.        
	Perelmans thoughts and his life in the aftermath of his incredible achievement are now inaccessible to even as indefatigable a biographer as Gessen. The loss to mathematics is incalculable. Tragedy has no mathematical measure and genius knows no scale. The man who solved Poincars Conjecture is himself now the subject of conjecture. Gessen captures the tragedy and the irony of the onus of genius.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Justice denied                  
	Sir  The report, Man lynched on shalishi orders (Nov 16), is shocking. Shalishi courts, which dispense justice in true talibani fashion, are as medieval as khap panchayats. Such institutions should be banned immediately. Strict action should also be taken against those who are responsible for murdering Sukdeb Goswami. West Bengal boasts of a rich cultural heritage. But it seems that the state is still unable to prevent barbaric acts executed by a bunch of semi-literate thugs in the name of social justice.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta
        
	Act firmly          
	Sir  The Bharatiya Janata Partys decision to stall Parliament demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe even after A. Rajas resignation from the Union cabinet was meaningless (Opposition sticks to JPC demand, Nov 17). The BJPs demand was also politically motivated to save the party from similar charges in Karnataka. The Union government is justified in stating that the Public Accounts Committee, headed by Murli Manohar Joshi of the BJP, is an appropriate forum to discuss the report of the comptroller and auditor general of India on the 2-G spectrum controversy. However, it is also correct that Rajas resignation is not enough. Unfortunately, no political party is serious about a proper investigation as every political outfit is mired in corruption. What is needed is an autonomous commission like the one in Hong Kong to weed out corruption from the Indian political system.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The former telecom minister, A. Raja, decided to resign to obey the orders of K. Karunanidhi. It may be recalled that earlier, during the United Progressive Alliances first stint in power, Manmohan Singh had wanted to rid the cabinet of Raja because of his murky dealings. When the UPA returned to power, Singh was reluctant to include Raja in the cabinet. However, on both occasions, the prime minister was made to swallow a bitter pill and Raja included in the cabinet.           
	Singhs inability to choose his own cabinet colleagues has reinforced the general perception that the prime minister is only a nominal figure who tends to buckle under pressure from allies. Singh should refurbish his image by ensuring that exemplary punishment is meted out to the guilty within a fixed time frame to restore the peoples faith in his government. The nation wants to see an able prime minister, and not another opportunist politician who is only concerned about saving his chair.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                          
	Poor taste          
	Sir  It has become the norm in commercial films to portray the police in very poor light. Such vulgar depictions leave a rotten taste in the mouth. I would like every citizen to join me in condemning this phenomenon. We should not forget the sacrifices made by policemen such as Bapi Sen as well as those who died during the terrorist attack in Mumbai. These brave men will forever live in public memory.           
	If this unfortunate trend in cinema is not arrested, we can well imagine what the consequences will be. A demoralized police force will cease to command respect and fear in the minds of the people and criminals. After all, popular cinema caters mostly to a section of people who seem to enjoy crass humour, never mind the cost.           
	Yours faithfully,

	It is not common for men in power to utter dark truths. Men in charge of money in particular tend not to look beyond their nose. But a speech in an obscure corner of Texas gave Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the United States of America Federal Reserve, a chance to look into the future, and what he saw was daunting. He told the Dallas Regional Chamber that the US population was ageing; the costs of sustaining it and keeping it in good health after retirement were mounting. As it aged, the proportion of the population in the workforce would decline; an increasing number of old people would have to be fed by a shrinking number of people at work. If the US was to avoid rising fiscal deficits, it had to choose between less generous provision for pensions and healthcare, higher taxes, or a combination of the two. He saw that reducing the fiscal deficit soon was impracticable; but a reduction in the longer run would bring down interest rates, move funds from financing the deficit to productive investment, and raise growth.        
	That is compelling logic; it does not stop at the US borders. It is to be wondered why it has not occurred to those who make economic policies in India. For they habitually run enormous fiscal deficits. Last year, the Central government by itself ran a fiscal deficit of 6.5 per cent of the gross domestic product. State governments are tardy in releasing their shameful figures; but when they do, they will be seen to have run another nine per cent deficit, taking the total fiscal deficit to almost a sixth of the GDP. Such a high deficit might have been defensible if the excess expenditure had funded productive investments in roads, bridges and power stations. But it mostly financed government consumption such as salaries, doles and pensions. If Mr Bernanke is worried, his Indian counterpart, D. Subbarao, should be worried to death. But worry is the last thing he seems to do; the smile never fades from his face.         
	The reason why the dire vision of what is coming does not faze Indians can only be that they have been indoctrinated by the rosy view of their future. A string of amateur astrologers has predicted that the 21st century will be the century of India and China. Their strong growth performance is projected into the future, and lead to their dominating the world economy. None of them, however, ever mentions that the rosy predictions are predicated on responsible steering of the economy; and that is one thing that Indias helmsmen are incapable of. For they live from election to election. The finance minister made some noises about reducing the fiscal deficit in his last budget. But that is because the next election is four years away. The closer it comes, the more myopic his vision will become.

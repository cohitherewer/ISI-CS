	It should not surprise anyone if a generation of school children in West Bengal end up feeling, horribly confused about their multiplication tables, as poor Alice did in Wonderland. The West Bengal School Service Commission has decided to recruit teachers of mathematics and the life sciences from candidates who have failed to secure even the minimum marks in the qualifying examinations. Apparently, given the number of posts lying vacant and the glaring lack of suitable candidates to fill them up, the authorities decided to lower the bar from 40 per cent to 30 per cent for these two subjects. Quick thinking, although useful in times of desperation, can at best provide a quick-fix solution. Instead of reflecting on the reasons behind such a shocking decline in standards, the authorities took refuge in a familiar strategy. Faced with the ugly truth, they swept it under the carpet and fell back on a warped logic: if the State could somehow make sure that there were enough teachers to go around, it would be seen as fulfilling its responsibility of providing free and compulsory education to its citizens. And so, filling up posts became the be-all and end-all of the SSC. The irony is deepened by the fact that a premier educational body not only bent its own rules to serve its selfish interests but also made a policy that abets discrimination. Candidates who applied from other subjects may reasonably wonder why the cut-off marks in their areas were not lowered as well. Such a dubious model of operation is surely not very educative for anyone.        
	Teaching is not a career meant for everybody. It demands a degree of excellence and commitment that not many of its practitioners have. Since the rewards of school teaching are more often intangible than economic, the academically gifted are not tempted to take it up readily. A great many become teachers because they do not have any alternative. Could it be that the dismal situation faced by the SSC is actually an outcome of this deep apathy among teachers? Most of those who performed so miserably in the examinations had also gone to school in this state. They were churned out of the same, rotting teaching machine that they will now have the privilege to operate. In turn, these teachers will leave their unenviable legacies for their pupils. A perfectly topsy-turvy future for a topsy-turvy state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Journey through the underworld
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        JOURNEY THROUGH THE UNDERWORLD                                  Travelling in Calcutta is full of surprises, as bustling compartments spur people on to reveal their true natures and empty seats yearn for patrons, all at the same time                                            
	On any given day, a ride in the Metro Railway can yield rich material for a study in human behaviour. The meek housewife who gets suddenly transformed into a virago as she tries to squeeze herself into the ladies seat, the young girl who would rather hold her boyfriends arm than the handrail for support, the child who diligently kicks the commuter sitting beside him with his shoe-clad feet as his mother looks on admiringly, or the man who stares wistfully at the bosom of the woman standing before him  all these can become characters in a novel. Methinks that the inadvertent displays of the truer side of human nature during Metro rides has got something to do with the descent into the bowels of the earth. Armed with the golden bough that is the Metro ticket  often tucked with tender care under the wristwatch strap  every commuter becomes an Aeneas making the heroic journey to the underworld, that might expose him in unexpected ways.        
	I have discovered on my Metro rides that Bengalis prefer English to Bengali when it comes to expressing extreme states of emotion. Once acrid-smelling smoke started drifting into the compartment of the train I was travelling in. The passengers panicked, and everyone, including confirmed Bengali bhadraloks and bhadramahilas, shouted fire, fire instead of aagun, aagun, which I thought would have been more natural in the circumstances. I sat still, pondering the misfortunes of a people who have such fondness for the colonizers language and yet are prevented from learning it properly in state government schools. My theory regarding the Bengalis penchant for resorting to English when overwhelmed was confirmed when I heard some nubile nymphets from Calcutta exclaim deer, deer on spotting a herd in the forests of north Bengal.         
	Not only Bengalis, but people from other states also tend to reveal interesting aspects of their character in the Metro. Often large groups of people from Bihar or Uttar Pradesh take Metro rides, probably as a part of conducted tours of the city. These groups usually consist of dozens of excited women and children led by a single man who watches over his brood and guides them in and out of the train. They come carrying the scent of distant realms, hold one anothers hands, and get mysteriously tangled up while trying to disembark.         
	A few days ago, on the day of the holy dip at Gangasagar, an excited cluster of women, possibly from UP, lorded over by a bespectacled old man who was wrapped from head to toe in various layers of woollen clothing, got into the train at Kalighat. The women promptly placed themselves on the floor. As soon as the train left the station, they brought out their combs and ribbons, and started preening themselves. The representative male smiled benignly at the vanity of the female species. Since the women were probably used to train journeys lasting for hours, they were obviously not in a hurry to get off.         
	Come Maidan, and the news that they would have to get down at the next station passed from the lord to his women like a shiver. Outraged at this abrupt termination of the ride, some of the ladies grudgingly scampered off the train right at Park Street, only to re-enter with remarkable alacrity through the other door of the compartment as the train started moving out. They received a sound berating from the man in the course of the journey from Park Street to Esplanade, where they finally got off. All the passengers heaved a collective sigh of relief as soon as they were gone. Some of them, especially the women, wore a beatific smile, which seemed to confer extra blessings on the punyarthis from another world.         
	After the Garia extension, the Metro now requires one to be proficient in survival skills to emerge unscathed from a ride. Each day there is much jostling, elbowing, name-calling, stepping on toes, and other unspeakable horrors that have to repressed regularly if one is to get on to the train again.         
	On a day just before last years Puja, when I was still unaccustomed to tackling the rush, I missed my station, thanks to a surge of commuters who butted their way in at Kalighat, pushing those trying to get off into the deepest recesses of the compartment. When I realized that the door was about to close, I protested weakly while desperately trying to make my way out. On seeing my distress, some women, in their benevolence, gave me a solid push, which would have caused me to fall on my face on the platform had the door not slammed shut in time. From that day onwards, I have become wary of the kindness of strangers, especially if they happen to be of the belligerent breed that uses the Metro.

	Can a previously unpublished writer break into the field? As with any profession, experience is valued, but that doesnt mean that publishers are closed to new ideas. While it is true that editors prefer working with known writers, most are also open to professional submissions and good ideas from any writer. So what are the rules for getting published for the first time?        
	Making money from writing requires four things: good writing skills; knowledge of the writing markets and how to approach them professionally; persistence, and the idea or its relevance to the present time. As with all forms of writing, the idea is paramount, and new authors break in with good, timely ideas. But this in itself is never enough. All four aspects have to be fleshed out by keeping in mind that there are many different routes to publication as there are writers you may talk to.        
	In India, the first requisite to getting published is good writing, which is characterized by simplicity, clarity and purity of line. Given the falling standards of language, simplicity and clarity are absolutely necessary and this often boils down to using few complex sentences.        
	Michael Wests old classic, General Service List of English Words, has been handy, but we now have modern dictionaries that provide word frequency and usage in different forms, as well as built-in thesaurus that gives alternative words for different contexts.        
	Today, the market has become the final criterion of excellence, but very few authors know of its intricacies  what sells at what price and why, the trading terms, incentives to the retail trade and other goodies that have to be offered to make booksellers stock titles  and they have to turn to literary agents to provide the professional services that would sell the book to the publisher. Marketing, today, means not merely selling the book but also its rights, and this can be handled only by professionals, many of whom have been publishers and editors before breaking out on their own. Like it or not, very few authors get accepted first time; they have to hawk around with a set of publishers before they find themselves in print. Whether they do this on their own or their agents do it on their behalf is another matter but an author has to be persistent and be prepared to accept rejection slips before getting accepted. This has happened to the best writers breaking new ground, and it will continue because publishers are averse to taking risks of any kind.         
	Relevance is a key factor in getting a publisher to accept the work. Here again, the literary agent could be very helpful because he is selling manuscripts of all kinds to different publishers who deal with diverse subjects. He knows the relevance of the work for the market which is all that matters to the publisher. Lastly, does PR help? It is certainly helpful to be on the right side of the publisher and have his goodwill with you.

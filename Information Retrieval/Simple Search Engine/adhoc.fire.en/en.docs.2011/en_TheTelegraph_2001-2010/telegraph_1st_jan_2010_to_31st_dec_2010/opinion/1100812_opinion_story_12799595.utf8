	It is unusual for the prime minister of a country to preach calm in any state with an incumbent government. But then, matters in Kashmir have never resided strictly within the bounds of the ordinary and the expected. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had to intervene in the crisis not only because the credibility of the state government in Jammu and Kashmir is in a shambles, but also because very few voices, even within the state, have carried Mr Singhs sincerity and openness. The prime ministers address to the people of the valley in Urdu should have also made plain the earnestness of his desire to reach out to those who have been most affected by the incessant violence. In his political message, Mr Singh naturally talks about addressing the alienation and emotional needs of the people.         
	The success of any communication, however, depends on how well it is received  and there are problems here. The ascendancy of the secessionists means that the prime ministers message may not reach the people undistorted. The hard-line Hurriyat leader, S.A. Shah Geelani, has already rejected Mr Singhs peace offer, and the moderate Hurriyat leadership of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq is in no position to overturn that verdict. But the recalcitrance of the Hurriyat leadership or the stubborn refusal of the valleys mainstream political parties to amplify the Centres peace message may not be the only problem. Mr Singh has talked about a political solution within Indias Constitutional framework, one that would be subject to the political and economic realities of the time. This is not an entirely unique solution. From the limited autonomy of the National Conference to the sovereign azaad riyasat of the Peoples Democratic Party, ideas for Kashmirs future have swung wildly without ever reaching any concrete form. The Centre, most certainly, cannot impose a structure without internal consultation, which today seems no easier than it was yesterday, for it also involves sustained dialogue across the border. All plans, again, have demilitarization as their starting point, and this is not necessarily the case with Mr Singhs vision. There is another caveat that his message seems to have overlooked. How will the granting of autonomy to Kashmir look from the northeast of India, a region with as tortured a history as that of the valley?

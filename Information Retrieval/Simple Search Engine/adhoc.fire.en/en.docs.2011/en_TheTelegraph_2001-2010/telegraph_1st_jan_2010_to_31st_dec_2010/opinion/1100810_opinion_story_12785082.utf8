                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Before, after                  
	Sir  The battle is on between lovers of printed books and e-readers, with major players of the market already engaged in a price war to win each party over (The battle of the books, Aug 7). Amazons Kindle can store up to 3,500 books and is lighter than the usual paperback. Since thousands of books are available in the digital format now, one can get paperbacks and hardcovers from Amazon or from the website of Barnes amp; Noble without having to buy printed books.          
	Yet, one still cannot quite imagine crawling happily into bed or sitting quietly in a corner with an e-book, sharing a digital story with a child, or giving a downloaded book as present. And how does one get signed copies of the first editions in the age of e-books? Will the author now append a digital signature, as we do with our credit cards? Can you lend your Kindle to your family and friends? It is unfortunate that we have fallen victim to the insidious seduction of the digital book. Books are objects of love  to be held and read, or to be left alone with a pagemark in the middle.          
	Reading remains one of the few activities that gives us a break from being in front of a screen, be it of a computer, television, cell phone, camera or an iPod. If even novels or textbooks are presented in the electronic format, our entire life would be spent staring at screens. Is that what we want? The tactile sensation and freedom that real books give us enhance the reading pleasure. Books (or other printed matter) cannot be changed by any means without completely destroying them, while e-books can be easily be corrupted by viruses.          
	We have an entire generation of young people who cannot think, let alone communicate, except in the language of iPods, internet or computers. Everything  language, values, social skills  has suffered as a result. Even the simple telephone conversation seems endangered as SMSes take over our lives.           
	Since many books are exquisite works of art, we have rare book collectors all over the world. Will antique digital book collectors replace them in future? Surely not.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is true, as the editorial, The battle of the books, says, that swarms of e-readers keep shoving good old bookshops out of their way. But it is also true that a large number of middle-class book readers are driven away from bookshops by the exorbitant price of books. Publishers are largely to be blamed for this. They pay astronomical sums as royalties to writers. Penguin India has paid about Rs 35 lakhs as advance to Sarita Mandanna for her debut novel, Tiger Hills. Mandanna herself was reportedly surprised by the advance she received. Such stupendous amounts paid to authors add to the cost of publishing books, and readers face the brunt of it. Unless publishers are more cost conscious, e-books will continue to swallow the market for printed books.          
	Moreover, reading is a habit that needs to be cultivated from an early age. Todays youngsters have too many options as to how to spend their leisure. If publishers do not offer books at more affordable prices, young people will be attracted to cheaper diversions, such as those offered by cable television, internet, cell phone and the like.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, The battle of the books poses the question: are we for printed books or for e-books? I would say that preferring one over the other would depend on specific conditions. In a rich country like the United States of America, people have easy access to gadgets, which are often costly. Naturally, printed books will be fast ousted by e-books there. Even in India, the present generation spends much of its time in front of computers. After all, a person only has 24 hours to do all his work, besides reading books. He would refrain from visiting bookshops that are far away from his home if he can get e-books on his laptop.          
	In Asia, we are not so rich to as to have internet access all the time. But this does not mean that we are far behind the West. Nowadays primary education includes the teaching of computer skills. So the process of the extinction of books has already started. The real problem lies elsewhere. Do we become less intelligent as the printed book is replaced by the e-book? Scholars and researchers are still divided on this issue. Only time can deliver the verdict in this case.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Deaf ears          
	Sir  Gone are the days when one could travel in public vehicles without having to listen from close quarters to one-sided conversations of one or more fellow passengers. The words emanating from a cell phone vary from swearing, cursing to mere reporting of ones working day. Because of the widespread use of cell phones, birds like sparrows and crows seem to be leaving us. Even coconut trees are believed to be turning barren. Yet it is not uncommon to find a two-wheeler driver struggling to keep his mobile set sandwiched between his left ear and shoulder while driving. That person must surely be receiving very important news, such as that the Nobel Prize is coming his way. Otherwise, he would not have risked his life on a busy and bumpy street so heedlessly. Of course, it is not wrong to use the cell phone. But use it at least with some feeling for your own safety and with some regard for the privacy of others.                    
	Yours faithfully,

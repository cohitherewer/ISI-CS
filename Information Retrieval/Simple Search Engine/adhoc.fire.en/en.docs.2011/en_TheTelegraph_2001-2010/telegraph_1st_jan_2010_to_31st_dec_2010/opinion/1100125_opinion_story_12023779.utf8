	There was a time when the commerce ministry was the most important economic ministry, surpassing even the finance ministry. It controlled imports with a heavy hand; even a sparrow could not enter the country without an import licence in its beak. Its lucrative business collapsed in 2002, when the United Progressive Alliance government abolished import licensing. But the commercial bureaucrats had not been in business for 63 years for nothing; they knew a trick or two. They went into the business of export promotion; in its name they started giving subsidies and incentives that made slaves out of inefficient businessmen who could not export without help. Subsidies and import restrictions become negotiable in international trade rounds. That does not suit the commerce ministry. So Kamal Nath, when he went into the Doha round negotiations, kept repeating that he would never sacrifice the interests of his poor farmers. That put paid to the round. The prime minister, who won his spurs with liberalization, could not afford to be branded a protectionist. So Mr Nath was relegated to building roads, and Anand Sharma was promoted in his place.        
	The global downturn brought down exports, and gave the commerce ministry a fresh incentive to try out complicated, corruption-prone incentive schemes. Thus last year, it included 39 new countries in the focus products scheme. Recently, it added 2,000 products to the list of focus products eligible for subsidy. What is not realized is that by now, a substantial proportion of exports is eligible for bureaucratic manipulation. It may seem common sense that subsidies would help exports. But the rigmarole that exporters have to go through to get those subsidies out of the commerce ministry reduces their number; only small businessmen who have the patience and the inclination to bribe the commerce ministry clerks bother to export. And they are the exporters with whom the commerce ministry plays games. It selects products made by small industry, and avoids those made by big industrialists who have the prime ministers ear and may go and complain if harassed.        
	The tragedy is that these small industry products are produced by thousands of producers. These are labour-intensive, and capable of creating considerable employment. The thwarting of their exports by the commerce ministrys red tape militates against the growth of output and employment, which should be the particular concern of the government. Around the subsidies grow up vested interests which resist their dismantling; this is how the commerce ministry has reduced the countrys freedom of manoeuvre in trade negotiations. After making unreasonable demands for four years, Mr Nath wrecked the Doha round. Mr Sharma expressed the hope that it would be resumed and concluded by the end of 2010. But his ministry will have nothing to give in the round, and unless it is prepared to yield something, it can gain nothing for the country.

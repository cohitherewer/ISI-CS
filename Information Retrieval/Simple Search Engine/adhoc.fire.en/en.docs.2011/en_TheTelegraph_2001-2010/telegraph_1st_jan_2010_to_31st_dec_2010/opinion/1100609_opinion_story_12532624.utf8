	A fair proportion of the human race, or at least of its male half, and a good many women too, will go temporarily mad from June 11, shouting, gibbering, cheering, groaning, even weeping before some television screen as the finals of footballs Kurukshetra, its World Cup, gets under way.        
	I shall be among these TV-tied nutcases, though probably not all the way through, given the England teams recent second-rate form. As in many other fields, we British have proved better at inventing sports than putting them into practice. Still at least our language has gone worldwide with our games, infiltrating its sporting vocabulary into many others: Im told the Japanese for the two own goals by which (alone) Japans footballers recently lost to England is indeed, as transliterated, oan-go. And English in turn has adapted many of its own sporting phrases to wider use.        
	Football itself has made oddly few such contributions. Own goal, yes; youve scored against yourself. Offside, humph. The word, which anyway began life in rugby, not soccer, has barely made its way off the field. But its sibling on side recently has, in a quite non-footballing sense: eg, the prime minister brought his main rival on side, that is, persuaded him to join forces.        
	Other sports have brought us umpteen metaphors. An ambitious politician, when his party leadership falls vacant or even, jumping the gun, before it actually does so  will throw his hat into the ring. Yet he may never even reach the starting line, for lack of backers who feel he is up to scratch. Even if he does, he may be floored by some rival and be left on the sidelines, feeling below par and ready to throw in the towel, accepting that he is just another also-ran. And even if, against the odds, he can sidestep that fate on his way to the winning post, he may be overtaken on the last leg.        
	Manufacturers caught on a sticky wicket by a rush of imports from some artificially low-currency country like China will complain of below-the-belt competition and urge their home government to ensure they have a level playing field. The ball will then be in the governments court. But however quick off the mark it is, it may well be stumped to find an answer, being stymied by the rules of the World Trade Organization, and have to endure seeing its own local firms knocked out. And its complaint that the Chinese are sailing close to the wind may well be hit for six, or at least kicked into touch, by the WTO; its accusation may be on target, indeed a bulls-eye, but the WTO will be anxious not to blow the whistle on foul play by so heavyweight a trading nation. The likely result will be game, set and match to Beijing.        
	I dont recommend any scrum of metaphors, sporting or other, like the ludicrous ones of those last two paragraphs. But one could add more, even if one excludes those from non-physical contests, such as trump or checkmate. American sport has given wider English touch down, time out and in the ballpark, though curve ball and out of left field (odd, off-the-point, crazy) remain, I think, confined to those who understand baseball. Black belt, in the sense of an expert, has not yet quite joined us from Japan, but it is on its way.        
	Phrases like fly a kite or surf the Web are disputable: one can kite-fly or go surfing competitively, but more likely one is doing it just for fun. So too words like springboard or slalom. And the close to the wind that Ive cited above is perhaps itself a bit close to the wind: most of the waterborne metaphors such as anchor, change tack, in the doldrums, have the wind in ones sails or catch a crab were around long before sailing or rowing became sports at all, let alone competitive ones. So too for the many motoring metaphors such as top gear or at full throttle.        
	Leave these out, though, and we still have plenty. Any reader who cares to add to my score is welcome to let me know.

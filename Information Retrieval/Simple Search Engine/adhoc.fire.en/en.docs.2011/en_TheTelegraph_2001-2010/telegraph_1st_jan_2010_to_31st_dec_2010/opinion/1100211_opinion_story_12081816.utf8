                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Wrong message                  
	Sir  A senior police officer asking his personnel to emulate the dedication, sense of purpose and quick-learning abilities of a murderous terrorist is in bad taste, as well as horrendously unprofessional (Kasab clap shunts cop, Feb 4). Rajendra Kumar, an inspector-general from Madhya Pradesh, projected Ajmal Kasab as some sort of a role model for the Indian police. One wonders what junior police personnel would make of Kumars advice. By using the name of Sachin Tendulkar as a worthy example to emulate in the same context, he has placed a terrorist and a famous sportsman on the same platform. Such irresponsible officers have no business being a part of the police force.           
	Something is seriously wrong with a mind that cannot distinguish between right and wrong. Terrorism is not a war fought between armies. It is the deliberate murder of unarmed civilians. Therefore, a police officer praising Kasab cannot be the same as British and German generals showing mutual respect during the conflict in North Africa. Kumars statement, that he would like to see Kasab hanged at the earliest, cannot absolve him of his irresponsible remark.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Extreme stand          
	Sir  Having lost the peoples mandate, the Shiv Sena is indulging in undemocratic and obnoxious acts in a desperate attempt to recover its lost glory (Rahul to Shah Rukh, Senas hands full, Feb 5). The Senas threats to the iconic actor, Shah Rukh Khan, are absolutely shameful. However, it was heartening to see Rahul Gandhi ignore similar threats issued by the Sena and complete a successful trip of Mumbai. The foul language used by Bal Thackeray against Rahul Gandhi makes one wonder whether the former has lost his sanity.          
	Freedom of expression is a basic right in a democratic country. Shah Rukh Khan is correct in saying that Pakistani cricketers should have been given a fair chance to participate in the Indian Premier League. Every genuine cricket enthusiast in India would support his point of view. It is a pity that the Centre and the state government are letting the likes of Thackeray have their way. Perhaps it is time to enforce a ban on organizations like the Shiv Sena.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The recent agitation by Shiv Sainiks in front of Shah Rukh Khans house and their act of tearing down posters of Khans forthcoming film threaten Indian citizens rights to freedom. It is time the Maharashtra government took firm steps to ensure that the rule of law prevails in Indias commercial capital. The agencies responsible for maintaining law and order should guarantee that Khans film is screened without any trouble. On the other hand, film stars should show restraint and avoid making controversial statements as their words and deeds are watched by millions of people in the country.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  Shah Rukh Khan is the owner of an IPL team. He is free to buy any player he chooses for his team. During the auction for this years tournament, just like other team-owners, Khan too had avoided bidding for Pakistani cricketers. What prevented him from selecting Pakistani players if he is so keen to see them play in the IPL? Was there any pressure on him to make Pakistani players participate in the IPL? If so, as a patriotic Indian, Khan should disclose the name of the lobby concerned.          
	After everything got over, Khan, suave marketing man that he is, started clamouring for media attention with his statement about players from Pakistan. At the end of the day, any publicity, good or bad, counts. With his film, My Name Is Khan, due for release, it was also important for Khan to capture the support of the trans-border market. One is not sure whether the actor is using his image of an IPL franchisee to advance his career in films. His team has already entered into a sponsorship agreement with Lux Cozy, an underwear brand owned by an accused in the Rizwanur case. A former police commissioner of Calcutta lost his job in that episode. Khan and his team are likely to lose their goodwill as a result of this tie-up.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

                
	Sir  The Shiv Sena has demanded an apology from Shah Rukh Khan and has even described him as a traitor for his statement in support of Pakistani cricketers. If the Sena feels so confident about its all-pervasive power and patriotism, why didnt it run to the rescue of the people of Mumbai during 26/11? Why does it, instead, only preach the politics of hatred by dividing Indians along communal lines? The Thackerays have now taken such an extreme stand that even their erstwhile allies, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, have distanced themselves from the Shiv Sena. The Senas attitude has earned it severe criticism from all over the country. Moreover, only a few days are left for Valentines Day. There is a possibility that the Sena will create a ruckus again. It is strange that the party has chosen not to highlight more important issues such as spiralling food prices or air pollution.          
	Yours faithfully,         Md. Ahtesham Ahmad, Andal, Burdwan

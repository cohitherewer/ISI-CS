	Can people be made to remember? Bienvenu Mbutu Mondondo, one of the few university graduates at the time Congo gained its independence from Belgium in 1960, feels they can. And that they should, if the past means a tortured era of colonization. He began a campaign to remind his countrymen, and the world, that Belgium is built on the suffering of the Congolese in 2007 by filing a criminal case against the publisher of Georges Remi, the creator of Tintin, and Remis estate, because of the humiliating representations of the Congolese in Tintin in the Congo. That case is moving too slowly, so Mr Mondondo has started a new civil suit.         
	It is believed that Congo, first under King Leopold II, who bled it with slave labour, then under the Belgian State, which continued the exploitation, lost 10 million people to colonial oppression. Mr Mondondo has reasons for his bitterness: it is not merely the Wests forgetfulness he is fighting  Brussels is the headquarters of the European Union  but the amnesia of his own countrymen. Then chiefly a non-literate culture, Congo has few written records. But his efforts to remind them by attacking a white supremacist tale of Tintin raises a number of questions.         
	Mr Mondondo was alerted to the offending comic through news of the steps that Britain was taking to minimize the insult offered by the book  by removing it to the adult section in bookshops, by giving it an introduction with the historical context, and so on. But the book, with all the other Tintin comics, has been around for all this time, popular enough to be in circulation across the world, among the children of both past colonizers and the once-colonized. Remis tendency to racial stereotyping is not limited to one story, although in Tintin in the Congo it has a more perceptible edge. What Mr Mondondo is underestimating is childrens ability to treat fantasy and fun as precisely that, fantasy and fun. The stark inequalities of life seldom disconcert them. Tintin in the Congo will not make Congolese children respect themselves less or Belgians think any more of themselves than they already do. Rather, children of an independent State may read the comic as that piece of history that Mr Montondo is so anxious to retrieve.        
	But children are not Mr Mondondos chief concern as he tries to reverse the forgetting. So it might be asked whether people can forget their past because it is not written down, unless they want to. What should his countrymen do with memories, 50 years into building a new nation: be revengeful? Or should they insist that Belgium stop glorifying King Leopold? Or demand an apology? Is remembering the beginning of reparation, of decency, of a sense of real equality? Maybe. But why should Tintin, even if not at his most pleasant, bear the brunt of this upheaval?

	Fools paradise                  
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Rays article, In different garb (July 24), raised many pertinent questions which judicious people ought to ask. To quote the most significant sentence: Mamata Banerjee has been a spoiler all along, never a creator except in mobilizing people and bestowing fancy names on trains and stations. In her stints as Union minister, she was in the news for all the wrong reasons, and never did anything to write home about. Her indifferent attitude at railway accident sites, her conspiracy theories about the two recent ones, her palpable annoyance at such irritants coming just before some big show she was to orchestrate and so on exposed her blatant political ambitions. Given her overall track record of rabble-rousing, bandh-calling and populism, it is difficult to imagine what kind of goods she would deliver if she and her party were to win the next elections.           
	There is no doubt that the Left Front has reduced Bengal to a pitiable state through corruption and misrule over the three decades it has been in power. The question is whether the next government, if headed by the Trinamul Congress, would be any different. As the article stated, even professional goondas [are] reportedly abandoning the Communist Party (Marxist) for the Communist Party (Mamata). As such, the TMC is as full of hooligans as the CPIM (M) is. Some of them are defectors while others have been nurtured by the TMC from the start. They are no less effective in calling bandhs and breaking the law.           
	Just as The Party had a say in everything for the last three decades, so the new Party  only green this time instead of being red  would interfere in everything after the change has taken place. But one fears that something worse is in the offing. It takes more than songs and poetry to run a functioning government. Folksy catchphrases like Ma, Mati, Manush may endear lakhs of emotionally charged followers, but do not make for good governance. Probably the only change would involve the renaming of streets after some local hero or political victim-martyr. Datta-Ray says that Banerjees recruitment of retired bureaucrats might lend gravitas to her motley crew of dissidents, malcontents, rebels, ideologues and opportunists. But one should not forget that she has come to power riding piggyback on the same motley crew. These people can hardly be expected to disappear overnight and be replaced by properly functioning bureaucrats. To fondly imagine that under a new dispensation there would be freedom from political intrusion in every aspect of governance would be to live in a fools paradise.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray says that the late J.M Biswas who defeated Atulya Ghosh in the 1967 general elections from Bankura was an unknown cyclist. But facts speak otherwise. Biswas may not have been a politician of Atulya Ghoshs stature but he was a grassroot trade-unionist. An employee of the South Eastern Railway, he was one of the founding pillars of the leftist trade union movement for railway workers. His place of work, the railway divisional town of Adra, bears many memorials in his name. Incidentally, Atulya Ghoshs defeat in the hands of Biswas was not the only reverse he suffered in his career. As a candidate of the Indian National Congress (Organization), he was defeated by another lesser-known CPI(M) candidate, Rabin Sen, in the 1971 midterm parliamentary elections from the Asansol constituency. This resulted in the forfeiture of his security deposit, and probably culminated in his retirement from active politics.           
	In this context, another aspect of leftist politics needs to be mentioned. The Communist Party of India (CPI) seemed to have developed a distaste for its giant-killer comrades. Soon after J.M. Biswass victory against the mighty Atulya Ghosh, he was expelled from the party. The same fate befell CPIs Shibdas Bhattacharjee, who had defeated Jyoti Basu in the 1972 midterm state assembly elections from the Baranagar constituency.

	Sir  The article, In different garb, seemed to have been written with the intention to flatter the present leftist government at the expense of the TMC. How can Sunanda K. Datta-Ray criticize Mamata Banerjees dress sense? The author exposes his biased mindset when he says, Mamata Banerjee has been a spoiler all along, never a creator except in mobilizing people and bestowing fancy names on trains and stations. What a way to describe a stupendous personality like Banerjee.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilip Kumar Kar, Jalpaiguri 

                
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray talks of Mamata Banerjees moral responsibility for a series of deadly railway mishaps. Any death is sad, but the victims of the railway accidents at least boarded the trains voluntarily, with the knowledge that there remains a mathematical probability of their dying while travelling in trains.           
	Datta-Ray would have us believe that the Left Fronts setbacks are mainly in urban areas. But in the last polls, there has been a massive loss of the Left Fronts support base in the rural areas as well. The author warns, West Bengal can expect many more Nandigrams with the Marxists opposing industrialization  and, indeed, every Trinamul venture  to pay Didi back in her own coin. Datta-Ray should be told that no one is against the industrialization move. People protest when an elected government, liable to them ultimately, handles issues with deliberate lack of transparency. Nandigram and Singur erupted for these reasons, and never because the people were opposed to industrialization per se.                    
	Yours faithfully,

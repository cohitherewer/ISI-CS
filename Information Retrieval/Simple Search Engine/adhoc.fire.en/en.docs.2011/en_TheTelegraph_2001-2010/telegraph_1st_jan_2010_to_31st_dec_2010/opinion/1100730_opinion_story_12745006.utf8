	Withdrawal symptoms                  
	Sir  The United States of America has been known to deploy troops in foreign countries despite international censure. It also has a habit of abruptly withdrawing troops from the occupied country, leaving the latter in the lurch. For instance, the US incursion into Cambodia in the 1970s left the country in a shambles. The killing fields of Cambodia emerged in the wake of the American invasion. About a decade later, the US supported the Taliban against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Once the Soviets withdrew, the US looked the other way as the Taliban mercilessly executed the Afghan leader, Mohammad Najibullah.          
	The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, has assured that he will multiply the strength of the Afghanistan national army and police by several hundred thousands so that they can assume command of the nations security once foreign troops withdraw (Kabul Express, July 22). Given the magnitude of the social and economic turmoil that Afghanistan is facing at the moment, this is not enough.          
	Karzai should look beyond Pakistan for allies. He would do well to cultivate diplomatic ties with countries like India, China and Russia. This could help him grapple with the difficult situation that is bound to develop in Afghanistan once the Americans leave. It is imperative that the people of Afghanistan are made to feel confident that the country is on the road to economic and social recovery.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  With the Iraq war becoming an emotive issue in America, the American president, Barack Obama, has promised to withdraw troops very soon. Plans have been made for US troops to withdraw from both Iraq and Afghanistan. However, in Afghanistans case, the decision might have been premature. President Karzai himself has estimated that the process of withdrawal will go on till 2014.          
	Even Iraq, which had a more cohesive polity to begin with, will find it hard to adapt to the situation once US occupation comes to an end. Afghanistan, on the other hand, has spent decades fending off foreign powers from its soil, including the Russians and the British. It was also riddled with civil war and insurgency until the Taliban seized power. Its national identity has been in a state of flux for years. These facts cannot be wished away.          
	The US, Pakistan, the Afghan government and the Taliban, all have conflicting aims in the country. India, however, appears to want peace and stability in Afghanistan. But it has played a marginal role in the country, so far.          
	In addition, the Taliban has become increasingly powerful in Pakistan. They would, no doubt, prefer to keep New Delhi occupied in handling cross-border terrorism rather than participating in the peace process in Afghanistan. The Pakistani government would be compelled, even if it is unwilling, to acquiesce to the Talibans demands, if only to maintain peace within its borders. India must be prepared to use diplomacy, and maybe even force, to protect its interests in the region.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Just cause          
	Sir  It was shocking to learn that census officials clubbed housewives with beggars and prostitutes under the economically non-productive category (Working it out, July 26). It is equally heartening to know that the Supreme Court has slammed the government for being insensitive and callous, and ruled that the latter is guilty of being strongly biased against women. Such judgments, particularly from the apex court, restore the common mans faith in the Indian judiciary.          
	The contribution that housewives and mothers make is not measurable. To begin with, these non-workers work around the clock, and not just during designated work hours. Unlike other working people, they never get leave or a day off. Apart from daily chores like cooking and cleaning, housewives are expected to take care of children and aged parents, supervise the household budget and fulfil several other duties. While people who go out to work do contribute in terms of money, the housewifes patience and endurance cannot be quantified. The apex courts judgment in the Renu Agarwal case is also good news. It has criticized the government for paying a paltry amount as compensation to her family after Agarwal, a housewife, died in a motor accident. The court has suggested that other laws be amended, especially those related to compensation when the victim is a woman and a housewife.                    
	Yours faithfully,

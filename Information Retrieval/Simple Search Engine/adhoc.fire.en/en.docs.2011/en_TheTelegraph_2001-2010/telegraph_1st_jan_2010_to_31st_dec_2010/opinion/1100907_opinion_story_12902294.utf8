The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Use and abuse of suffering
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        USE AND ABUSE OF SUFFERING                                  In a world made especially sensitive to varieties of victimhood, it is becoming difficult to distinguish victim from perpetrator in every case                                            
	In the last week of August, a court in Darmstadt, Germany, ordered Nadja Benaissa, a half-Moroccan, HIV-positive popstar, to 300 hours of community service. Nadja received a suspended sentence for wilfully concealing her condition from several men with whom she had had unprotected sex. At least one of the men is reported to have contracted the virus.        
	Eighteen years earlier, Cyril Collard acted in and directed Les Nuits fauves (Savage Nights). In the film, Jean, HIV-positive and bisexual, is shown hiding his condition from the men he sleeps with and initially from his girlfriend as well. The film, which was adapted from Collards semi-autobiographical novel, won four Csar awards and despite Jeans hedonism and irresponsible sexual conduct, he was hailed as someone who had refused to allow his terminal state to become some sort of an identity card.         
	It is instructive to examine the lives of Nadja and Jean  one real, the other fictional for both raise a few distinctly uncomfortable ideas concerning victimhood. It appears that categories such as victim and perpetrator are malleable, and that the process of identifying who is or is not a victim is conditioned by extraneous factors that need not be predicated upon the principles of justice.         
	There can be no doubt about the gravity of Nadjas offence. The man she infected, as well as the others who may still be at risk, are the real victims, not Nadja, who, by knowingly exposing her partners to a deadly virus, should have been identified as the perpetrator. Moreover, the idea of bringing justice or compensation to her victims becomes complicated here by the irreversible nature of their medical status. Yet, the verdict, the support expressed by her fans and the sympathetic press coverage indicate that Nadjas transformation from perpetrator to victim is now complete. As is evident in Nadjas case, victimhood may at times be constructed to evade censure. But does the courts leniency have to do anything with the fact that Nadja is a woman, a celebrity and of mixed ethnicity? Unlikely. Perhaps, it is the nature of her affliction that prompted the court to judge her less harshly.         
	This opens up another possibility: that of victimhood being inherently unequal. Suffering is universal, but some sufferers  we are conditioned to believe by the silent connivance of the State, culture, knowledge and collective memory  are more important than others. We are justifiably outraged by the Holocaust, but why do we mitigate the intensity of the suffering of those who survived the Hamburg firebombing? It would have been interesting to note how the German court would have perceived Nadjas transgression had her condition been curable.         
	This is not to suggest that it is easy or lucrative always in being a victim. Nadja, like Collard, may die if she were to develop AIDS in the future, while the victims of Bhopal in India continue to wait for adequate compensation. And despite the spawning of a myriad networks of State and private agencies that dole out compensatory care to victims, especially in the West, demands of being recognized as such can at times be propelled by the desire to attain justice. Anti-war rallies in Britain by the families of those killed in action in Iraq are an example.         
	Unlike in the past, modern societies are willing to look at the condition of victimhood with far less scepticism. This transformation is of critical importance, as victims, and the stories they tell us, provide an opportunity to revisit, reinterpret and perhaps even correct past horrors. The increasing democratization of victimhood  all of us have suffered tyranny in some form or the other, political, social, religious, cultural and personal has encouraged people to discuss their troubles publicly. It is thus all the more important to strengthen processes and institutions that perform the crucial functions of identifying victims and bringing justice to them in a manner that is morally edifying. Justice and its equal apportioning, without which a humane and unprejudiced society would be unattainable, are dependent on the capacity to correctly determine who is the real victim.

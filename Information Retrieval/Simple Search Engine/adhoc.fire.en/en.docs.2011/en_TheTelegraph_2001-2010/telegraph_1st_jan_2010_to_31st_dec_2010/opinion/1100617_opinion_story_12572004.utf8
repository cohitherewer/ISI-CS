	When politicians play their games, the people usually suffer. But what the people of Manipur have suffered for over 65 days because of a political stand-off is quite extraordinary. The long blockade of the highway that links the state to other parts of India made life miserable for the people, making essential items scarce and pushing up prices abnormally. But all that did not seem to bother either the administration or the politicians too much. Imagine this happening to a big state or city elsewhere in the country and the furore it would have sparked. That the blockade has been allowed to continue for so long shows how cavalier New Delhi can be about the people and the issues in the Northeast. True, local politicians and groups patronized by them were behind it all. But both New Delhi and Kohima should have done much more to end the impasse and save innocent people from the long ordeal. Such insensitivity on the part of the administration has been the primary reason for the growing sense of alienation among large sections of the people in the region.        
	Hopes of an end to the blockade have brightened after the prime ministers meeting with the Naga Students Federation. But Manmohan Singhs intervention also points to the failure of the Union home ministry. In its anxiety to not derail the Naga peace talks, the ministry may have preferred a soft approach on ending the blockade. But that clearly was a wrong approach as the people of Manipur not only suffered because of it but also felt abandoned by New Delhi. The issue of the integration of Manipurs Naga-majority areas into a greater Nagaland is a complicated one and would require extremely tactful handling. The lesson from the blockade, however, is that the Naga peace process must not be allowed to disrupt normal life either in Manipur or in Nagaland. Hopefully, the Naga groups will honour their commitment to the prime minister to lift the blockade. However, what the administration does now is more important. A governments anxiety to not precipitate a crisis is understandable. But that cannot be an excuse for inaction.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LOVE ALL                                                          
	Cynical diplomats sitting across a table never forge friendships through lengthy and tortuous negotiations. Friendship is as friendship does. This was demonstrated when Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi, belonging to India and Pakistan respectively, entered the final of the mens doubles in the US Open at Flushing Meadows. It would be a mistake to see this victory as merely symbolic. It is much more than that. It reveals the artificiality of the borders that separate India and Pakistan. If paladins of the British Empire led by Lord Mountbatten had not decided to divide India to escape the empire, and if Cyril Radcliffe had not drawn lines on the maps of South Asia, India, together with what became Pakistan, would be a powerful country not just politically but in sporting terms as well. This statement is not being made in terms of the What If game that many historians love to play. This is no longer a counterfactual. Put the Indian and Pakistani cricket teams together  the result would be unbeatable. And ditto for hockey. The achievement of the two tennis-players in Flushing Meadows only strengthens the point. Far away from sports, the two countries have produced in recent times some of the finest writers of fiction in English  Salman Rushdie, Vikram Seth, Daniyal Mueenuddin, Mohammad Hanif, among others.        
	Differences and boundaries created by retreating imperialists and myopic politicians dissolve when faced with genuine talent. Messrs Bopanna and Qureshi did not need long hours behind closed doors to sort out matters; long sessions of practice brought them closer and created bonds of understanding, which are so necessary to succeed in tennis doubles. No pious words and homilies on the importance of friendship were needed by them. The commitment to perform well and come out the best brought them together and inspired them. It may not be an exaggeration to suggest that friendship did not bring them together on the court; rather, tennis created a friendship.        
	A triumph in Flushing Meadows possibly contains a significant message for those who walk the corridors of power in New Delhi and Islamabad. The message is simple: do not cavil at the efforts being put in place by Manmohan Singh to remove the trust deficit between India and Pakistan. The tennis-players have shown that it is possible for an Indian and a Pakistani to inhabit a space, and win, together. Mistrust can be removed through co-operation; suspicion through partnership. Animosity can be dissolved through victories that bring pride to both nations. These are words and wishes; they need to be actualized. This alone will establish friendship between India and Pakistan, two countries mired in meaningless enmity. Two tennis-players have served an ace for Mr Singh. Are the others on both sides of the border willing to play at the net?

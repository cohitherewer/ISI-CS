	Lessons in good behaviour                  
	Sir  It is a good idea to punish political parties for violent behaviour by their supporters (Penalty kick, Feb 13). A law should be framed to make parties compensate for any damage to public property caused by their workers. The parties should be penalized both monetarily and through a ban. But it may be difficult to pass such a law in Parliament, since no party is likely to support it. So, public consensus should be the basis for enacting this law. Political parties in India need a serious lesson in etiquette.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Alarming numbers          
	Sir  Recent data have revealed what environmentalists have been fearing for years  that the number of tigers left in India is falling fast (Science establishes tiger truth, Feb 13). Although official estimates claim that 1,411 tigers are left, one doubts whether the number is as high in reality. However, it is heart-warming to find that awareness is spreading among the masses at last.          
	The main reason behind the steady decline of the tiger population is not poaching, as is being projected. Rather, it is the lack of forests in India. Jungles are being encroached upon by urban settlements. The government should focus on critical issues like tiger conservation. The people should also collectively help save one of the most graceful animals in the world. Otherwise, it would be just a matter of decades before the only tigers left in the world would be those recreated in cinema  like the dinosaurs in Steven Spielbergs Jurassic Park.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is alarming that there are only 1,411 tigers left in India. With such a small population, the animal is now vulnerable to adversities, both natural and man-made. Moreover, the Sunderbans, the last resort of the Royal Bengal tiger, are on the verge of destruction owing to climate change. Indians should make a concerted effort to save the precious animal. It would be a matter of deep shame if the national animal is allowed to become extinct through sheer negligence.          
	The success of tiger conservation depends on spreading public awareness on this issue. The media should campaign for this cause actively.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Web woes          
	Sir  Social networking sites have become very popular in recent times. Young people across the world are the primary users of these sites. A number of sites such as Orkut, Facebook and Twitter let teenagers live web lives with online friends. These sites also create a space where young people can share their thoughts freely and promote some sort of a cultural dialogue.          
	However, privacy issues are the key concern in this online world. In India, young men and women are hardly concerned about safeguarding their privacy on these sites. They put up vital data like cell-phone numbers and addresses on their profiles. Most accept friend requests at random. Such thoughtless activities can pose major security threats.          
	An apt example of the risks of social networking is the kidnapping and murder of 16-year-old Adnan Patrawala from Mumbai (New age tragedy, Aug 23, 2007). The kidnappers had managed to trap Adnan through Orkut.          
	Despite the obvious risks, it looks like social networking sites are here to stay. But one should be cautious and prudent while using them.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Public hazard                  
	Sir  In developed countries, spitting incurs a fine, which serves as a deterrent. This act is frowned upon because it transmits airborne germs that cause diseases. People need to be educated about the harmful effects of spitting and the role it plays in defacing buildings, walls and streets. A possible solution to the problem could be an effective advertising campaign that brings about a change in public behaviour. The campaign should be complemented by stringent laws and penalties. On-the-spot fines may work well when it comes to deterring offenders.          
	Yours faithfully,        Richard Saviel, Highgate, Australia
        
	No way out          
	Sir  While complimenting Krishnan Srinivasan on his well-argued article about Indo-Pak relations, I would like to add a few more points (Uneasy neighbours, May 20). There can never be any rapprochement between India and Pakistan because neither country wishes to resolve the contentious issue of Kashmir. This is evident from the fact that in spite of the peace agreements signed at Tashkent and Shimla, nothing has changed. Both countries prefer to keep the problem alive as it is quite profitable to do so. In Pakistans case, political and financial aid will continue to flow in from major world powers  especially the United States of America and China  as long as the issue remains unresolved. As for India, its politicians can continue to invoke Article 370 in Kashmir to secure their vote bank.          
	Islamabads periodic smooth-talking  Srinivasan mentions attempts at the same by Asif Ali Zardari  is matched by New Delhis rhetoric. Both sides know well that any attempt to take the talks seriously merits a political risk. Therefore, the status quo will stay, as it has ever since the Kashmir problem was created long ago.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Krishnan Srinivasans reference to the Shoaib Malik-Sania Mirza marriage and Jaswant Singhs book on Jinnah added a novel touch to his piece. Pakistan going back on what it promises to do is part and parcel of its foreign policy, especially when it comes to resuming the talks for peace with India. Manmohan Singh has kept the door shut temporarily to any meaningful dialogue with Pakistan because of the increase in terrorist activities by outfits based in that country.          
	However, Singh isnt averse to meeting his Pakistani counterpart, provided Indias neighbour stops encouraging terrorist forces that are inimical to Indias sovereignty. Despite the well-meaning initiatives by Pakistani diplomats and other visitors, peace seems miles away. There is no doubt about the fact that the citizens of Pakistan yearn for more people-to- people contact with India. Ive heard this intention being sincerely mouthed by a host of Pakistani businessmen who congregate at Central Park in Salt Lake during the Bidhannagar Mela. But such exchanges will be of no consequence unless the Pakistani establishment gives up on its double-dealing.          
	Srinivasan points out that Pakistans foreign policy is rooted in its national identity, which, in turn, is linked to its concept of confrontation with India. Pakistans insistence on asserting itself on a par with India in areas like military or nuclear strength has been a bane rather than boon of its existence. Asif Ali Zardari has been vocal about ensuring peace with India. He has gone on record saying that Kashmir ought to be put on a back-burner so as to pave the way for greater trust. But India must tread cautiously to ensure political and diplomatic pragmatism while dealing with Pakistan.          
	Yours faithfully,

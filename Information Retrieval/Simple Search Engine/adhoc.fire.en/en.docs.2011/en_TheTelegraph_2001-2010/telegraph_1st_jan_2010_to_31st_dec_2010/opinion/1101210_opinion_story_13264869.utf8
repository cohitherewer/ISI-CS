	The road goes ever on and on                
	East of the Sun: A Nearly-Stoned Walk Down the Road in a Different Land (Tranquebar, Rs 295) by Siddhartha Sarma documents the authors journey across east Assam, Nagaland and Manipur into western Myanmar. Haunted by Tolkiens poem, The Road Goes Ever On and On, Sarma sets off on the narrow road to that part of India which is, perhaps thankfully, not yet a fixture on the tourists map. (Sarma says in his note that the North-east is a place best visited as a traveller, not as a tourist.) He peppers his accounts with useful travel tips (You pack light, take whatever transport you can get, stay wherever you can under whatever reasonable conditions, eat whatever is available... and use the golden rule: when in doubt, improvise.), history of the people and the places, and funny anecdotes. Although the author seems to be trying a little too hard at times to sound clever (chiefly by repeatedly using words like cute, imho, or dadgum), in general he succeeds in making his account witty and idiosyncratic. This book might indeed inspire one to take the secret paths that run/ West of the Moon, East of the Sun.                        
	Use Your Head: The Inside Track on the Way We Think (John Murray, Rs 299) by Dr Daniel Freeman and Jason Freeman promises to uncover the secrets of the mind to make life easier for us. There are chapters on memory, decision-making, motivation, fear and anxiety, happiness and sadness, and, of course, on the brain, among others. The tools the authors employ to analyse personality types and the attendant disorders are interesting, though not uncommon. They would be familiar to all those who are acquainted with the basics of psycho-analysis. Nonetheless, this is science made easy and accessible, and, if nothing, the book is good entertainment.                        
	The Noahs Ark Quest (Sphere, Rs 295) by Boyd Morrison is yet another adventure featuring raven-haired archeologists, rough-and-tough men, the slopes of Mount Ararat, and a priceless historical treasure, in this case the mythical ark of Noah. While the plot would contain no surprise for one familiar with the Da Vinci Code genre, this is certainly a tale well told. Boyd succeeds in keeping the excitement alive by manipulating the various strands of the narrative, making this the perfect book to snuggle with on a winter afternoon.                                  
	Slayer of Kamsa: Krishna Coriolis-Book I (Harper, Rs 250) by Ashok K. Banker is the first in a series of eight books in which the author plans to narrate the life of Krishna. The psychedelic cover and the blurb at the back  which declares, Cowherd, lover, warrior, god incarnate. The youthful superhero of India is here  make it evident that this is Krishna packaged for the modern world. Banker spins his yarn long and thick, concentrating in this first book on Kamsa  his heroism, super-human strength, and his yet-to-be-born nemesis, who scripts the end of the demon-prince from inside the womb. But this is, as the last page warns, just the beginning! Hold your breath for The Dance of Govinda coming in Spring 2011.                         
	The Power of Numbers: UNderstanding the Science of Numerology amp; A Guide to Naming Your Baby 2011 (Celestial, Rs 295) by Sameer Shah should be read only by those parents whose bundles of joy will arrive sometime between January and December next year. Armed with talent numbers, which are specific to each day of the coming year, parents can now give their babies the perfect name, which will see them through all the ups and downs of life.

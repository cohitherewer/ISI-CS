The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Clash of civilians
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CLASH OF CIVILIANS                                  THE WILD SIDE      When the escalator turned into a people-churning machine                                                  
	Members of a crowd generally tend to divide themselves into teams for any given circumstance. As circumstances change, so do teammates. Detached flneurs hardly ever roam the streets of Calcutta. Even loafers and loiterers seem to have an opinion on matters. Strangers in public spaces in Calcutta bond very fast. If these bonds are forged easily, so are loyalties ever-shifting. Remaining neutral isnt an option when youre in a crowd. Whether you like it or not, one of the teams sucks you in. No public space in Calcutta forms as perfect a site for gang-forming or groupism as the Calcutta Metro Railway. It is almost as if the underground, with its closed, claustrophobic and circumscribed borders, provides an ideal site for all kinds of differences and prejudices to play out.        
	And never have passengers on the Calcutta Metro been more talkative than since the time the line was extended up to Garia last year. Among the various teams the passengers form  men versus women, those sitting versus those standing, and so on  the most palpable is the urban-suburban divide. Ruminations on whether the Metro is indeed a Lakshmikantapur local are not uncommon.        
	The one thing that some people cannot take is brashness. Once, a fellow standing near the gate (without any intention of getting down) found himself up against a woman with a shrill voice. The lady expressed, in very many words, her desire to see the space before her cleared so that she could alight at the next stoppage. None of her noisy probing about whether the man blocking the gate wanted to get off too managed to extract a response from him. The woman had, by now, gathered an army of her own. Encouraged by their leader, all those who wanted to get off started collectively badgering the man, who was now joined by a companion. As the gate opened at the next station, the the army found itself against a human barricade formed by the two men standing near the door.        
	Although, after a lot of shouting and pushing, the crowd did manage to de-train, the passage would have been a lot smoother had the men not acted in the way they did. But then, the woman too would, in the first place, have done well to not persist with her nagging. What was impudence for him was birthright for her. There are no black or white situations when it comes to human behaviour; it is not easy to pin blame on a single person when the interests of so many are in conflict.        
	In Calcutta, the single-minded pursuit of self-interest reaches its zenith when it rains. Cranky though Calcuttans are during the heat, many love the rains only from the comfort of their homes. A slight drizzle while on a bus can cause all windows to be banged shut, thereby stifling passengers within the grimy, sticky interiors of the vehicle. Rains create chaos. The Coffee House exit of the Chandni Chowk Metro station is, quite literally, just an exit  only one escalator brings passengers up from the underground. As I stepped on that escalator one afternoon, everything seemed normal. Halfway up, I became aware of voices screaming at one another. Only as I proceeded further did I realize that it had started raining outside.         
	Those who had already reached the top before me wouldnt step on to the road for the fear of getting drenched. The escalator at that moment seemed like a machine which constantly kept churning out people from the bottom and piling them atop the roughly 100 feet square landing. Few things could have been a more serious deathtrap than this. The ruckus I had heard was the result of a brawl between those who kept standing on the landing, and those still on the escalator, who would soon be reaching the top, and requiring a place to step on. The group which, while on the moving staircase, had felt a deep sense of panic and horror at the prospect of not having anywhere to land, after somehow jostling for space, refused to clear out either. The horror felt a few seconds earlier was replaced by a selfish desire to remain dry. Teams had been switched.                          INSIYA POONAWALA

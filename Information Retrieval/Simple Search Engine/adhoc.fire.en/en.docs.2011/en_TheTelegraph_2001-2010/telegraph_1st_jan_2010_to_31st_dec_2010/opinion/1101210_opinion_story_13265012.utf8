The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Second coming                  
	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas article, The lessons of Bihar (Dec 4), was qualitatively different from the write-ups by political experts that have been published in quick succession by The Telegraph after the Bihar elections. While not undermining the worth of any of these articles, I must say that Guha has made an exceptionally realistic assessment of the conditions prevailing in Bihar at the time of the recent elections. The lessons of Bihar had the ring of truth because it was based on the authors personal experiences.          
	He describes how Bihar suffered under the regime of Lalu Prasad, the self-styled king of Bihar with a supposedly unassailable hold over the dalits and other oppressed sections of the population. There is no doubting the peoples affection for Prasad in the initial stages of his rule in the state. But it did not take long for the same people to be disillusioned with the king, chiefly because of the latters persistent efforts to transform Bihar into his personal fiefdom. Corruption reached its peak with Prasads alleged involvement in the multi-crore fodder scam and other shady deals involving his trusted lieutenants. Those closest to Prasad were rewarded with plum posts in the government. As a result, the common people of Bihar rejected the chief minister they had once adored.          
	Nitish Kumar knew what needed to be done to keep the electorate in good humour. He committed himself to ensuring the uninterrupted supply of goods and services to the people. He may not have fully succeeded in all his ventures, but there was no mistaking the sincerity of his intentions. The apprehension that the alliance of his party, the Janata Dal (United), with the Bharatiya Janata Party would make Kumar unacceptable to the minority communities was proved to be wrong by the last elections. He prevented the BJP from playing the communal card. Kumar has emerged as the new saviour of Bihar. In all probability, his administration will be able to live up to the faith reposed in it by the people for the second time in succession.          
	Guha has drawn a parallel between Kumar and the ex-chief minister of Karnataka, Ramakrishna Hegde. Everybody knows what happened to Hegde at the fag-end of his political career. Hegde could have continued to rule Karnataka with transparency had he not suddenly shifted his focus of attention to the Centre. By not committing a mistake of this sort, Kumar has displayed commendable political wisdom.          
	Kumars spectacular win has belied all expectations. He does not seem to believe in personal charisma, which is short-lived and mostly mythical in nature. It is only good work that yields enduring results. Indian voters usually follow the trend when it comes to exercising their rights. In electoral parlance, this is called passive voting. But with changing times, education and knowledge also play a part now in helping people decide. Those seeking votes can no longer take their traditional loyalists for granted. That no single party rules Delhi at present testifies to this truth.          
	Immediately after taking oath for his second term in office as chief minister, Kumar made his intentions clear to the people who had voted him back to power. There was no hint of a swagger in his interview with the press. Nor did he allow himself to be so overwhelmed by euphoria as to ignore the power of his political opponents. One hopes that the heads of other Indian states would take a few lessons out of Kumars book.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Go slow          
	Sir  East Coast Railway had advertized in The Telegraph of December 5 that a new train, the Puri-Howrah-Puri Daily Duronto Express, is to be introduced from December 11. While this seems to be the year of new trains, I find the introduction of this train entirely meaningless for several reasons. Most hotels in Puri have 12 noon as the check-in and check-out time. The new train arrives in Puri at 9.40 pm. Why should a tourist spend the better part of the day travelling, arrive late in the evening in Puri, and then having nothing better to do at that late hour, simply have dinner and go to bed? He will also lose out on the hotel rent since he will be able to occupy a room only late at night while paying charges for the day starting from 12 noon. One would rather arrive in the morning or around noon, check into a hotel, and enjoy most of the day and the evening. There are several trains from Howrah that reach Puri at such convenient hours.          
	The problem is the same as regards the departure schedule of the Puri-Howrah-Puri Duronto Express. There are plenty of trains from midday till late at night to get back to Howrah from Puri. If one is to travel to Howrah by the Duronto Express (which leaves Puri at 6.45 am and arrives at Howrah at 1.45 pm), one again loses out on half a days room rent.          
	As an alternative, I suggest that the Jan Shatabdi Express, which now takes seven hours to reach Bhubaneswar, be speeded up a bit and made to terminate at Puri. Since the Jan Shatabdi and the Duronto would depart within an hour of each other, there appears no compelling reason to introduce the latter.          
	Yours faithfully,

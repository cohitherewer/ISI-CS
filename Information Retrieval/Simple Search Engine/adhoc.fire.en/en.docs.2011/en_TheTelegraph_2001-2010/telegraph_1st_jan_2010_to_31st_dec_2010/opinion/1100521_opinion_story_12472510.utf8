	LIVING JEWELS FROM THE INDIAN JUNGLE (Oxford, Rs 1,600), edited by Ashok S. Kothari and Boman F. Chhapgar, is a handsomely designed volume that throws light on the once-rich, but now ravaged, treasure trove that is Indias forests. The third offering in the series of books published by that august institution, the Bombay Natural History Society, it comprises articles, notes, paintings and drawings that have been collected from rare sources.         
	As pointed out by the editors, unlike the previous two works, this volume includes numerous plates on plant life, such as those depicting Himalayan wild flowers. Nathaniel Wallichs description of the unequalled beauty of Burmas Amherstia nobilis and J.S. Serraos account of the mass-flowering of the species known as Karvi in Maharashtra indicate the richness of the regions flora.         
	But most readers would find the illustrations and anecdotes involving wild animals truly fascinating. These excerpts, made livelier by the accompanying picture plates, are also important because they remind us of a chilling truth: many birds and animals that were once found in large numbers are now completely extinct, or are on their way to oblivion. Captain Godfrey Charles Mundy chronicles the valour of an elephant that saved a shikari from a marauding lion and how, during a journey through enchanting Deyra Doon, he breakfasted with Mr Shore and his two pet black bears! There are also thrilling references to tiger-hunts in Reginald Gilberts piece. Rudyard Kiplings delightful lampooning of the poor rhinoceros provides a comic interlude to the blood and gore of big-game hunting. Also included in the second half are snippets compiled from the Miscellaneous Notes section of the back issues of the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society that enhance our knowledge of animal behaviour.        
	Apart from containing engaging write-ups and pictures, the volume has also been designed with care. The detailed captions for the jacket, endpapers and preliminary pages along with the brief, but informative, biographical notes on some of Indias leading naturalists add to the books appeal.        
	A word on BNHS, whose completion of 125 years has occasioned the publication of this delightful volume. The pioneering work that BNHS has carried out deserves special praise. Without BNHS and its visionary members, India would have been left poorer in its understanding and knowledge of the countrys natural wonders.

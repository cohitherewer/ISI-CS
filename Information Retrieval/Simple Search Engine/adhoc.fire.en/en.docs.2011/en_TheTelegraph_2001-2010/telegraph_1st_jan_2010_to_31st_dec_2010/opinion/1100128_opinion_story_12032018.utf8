	Risky change                  
	Sir With regard to the human resource development ministrys decision to derecognize 44 universities holding the deemed university status, the editorial, Deemed unfit (Jan 21), rightly expresses concern for the students of these institutions. This ugly situation has developed because these institutions have failed to live up to their claims. Their method of functioning has pulled down the quality of higher education in India. At the same time, the decision to derecognize them needs to be coupled with efforts to protect the students future.          
	Nepotism and corruption have plagued these institutions. They used the deemed university status as a tool to facilitate the buying and selling of education for profit. The managing bodies of these institutions lacked professionalism. Courses with fanciful names were offered that failed to help the students. No attempt was made to promote excellence in research that was a chief objective behind the creation of the deemed universities.It is sad that India, which is striving to improve its standards of higher education, has had to land up in a mess like this. The HRD ministrys decision has caused a lot of uncertainty among students and their parents. To protect the students, the Supreme Court has now directed the Centre not to withdraw, for the time being, the deemed university status granted to the institutions.The education system needs to be cleansed. To prevent the abuse of power in the future, the Supreme Court should direct the government to lay down stringent guidelines to be followed by the institutions that want to achieve the deemed university status.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The governments decision to derecognize 44 deemed universities is a remarkable and revolutionary step. This will help reduce corruption in the education system. But what about the effect of this decision on students, especially those who worked hard to get into these institutions? Does the government understand what these students are going through now?          
	In spite of the Supreme Courts assurance that the measure would not be implemented now, we, the students, are in a constant state of panic. We are insecure about our future. The government has no right to play with our careers. Why did the HRD ministry not pull up the former HRD minister, Arjun Singh, for granting deemed university status to these institutions? Even the present HRD minister, Kapil Sibal, has not sat for a discussion on this issue with the media and students, who are going to be affected the most by this decision. We have become puppets in the hands of ministers. Will a new education system be introduced every time a new HRD minister assumes office?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Futile hopes          
	Sir  Barack Obamas story is fascinating thus far. He was chosen by the people of America to battle the ills of the Bush regime, but he soon found himself struggling to find his grip on the levers of power in Washington (Great expectations, Jan 24). His idealistic vision of a just world order is falling to pieces, and his failure to end the wars that he had vowed to end is dragging him down. Within the United States of America, his efforts are being stymied by an aggressive capitalism that is impervious to reforms and disconnected from the socio-economic needs of the times. Lobbies with vested interests are playing down his universal health care bill. Americas fate depends on whether Obama will pursue his liberal ideas despite the hurdles or whether he will give in to the wild ways of free enterprise.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

                
	Sir  Barack Obama had promised to bring in change, and for one long year he has had numerous opportunities to fulfil his promise (A different tea party, Jan 22). He being elected the president of America was a change in itself, given that he is the first coloured president of that country. He had become a symbol of hope for Americans as well as for Asians.           
	But Obamas performance throughout the year has disappointed those who had voted him to power. Rising unemployment and the fact that not much has changed in the last year have angered the people. Moreover, Americans have not approved of Obamas decision to employ more troops in Afghanistan. The healthcare reforms proposed by him have also not been received kindly by most.          
	In the middle of this confusion, Obama winning the Nobel Peace Prize worsened the situation since the majority of his countrymen seemed to doubt whether he was worthy of the honour. Obama was actually at war with two countries when he received the peace prize.

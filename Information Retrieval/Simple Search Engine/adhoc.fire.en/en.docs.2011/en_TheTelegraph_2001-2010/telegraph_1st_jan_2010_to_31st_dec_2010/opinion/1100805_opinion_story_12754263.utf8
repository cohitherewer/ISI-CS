	Value for work                  
	Sir  While increasing the amount of compensation for the family of a housewife killed in a road accident, the Supreme Court has observed that the contribution of a woman who looks after her family and does housework should not be deemed any less significant than that of a man who earns money by working outside (Homemaker a non-worker? Gender bias, says SC, July 24). The apex courts judgment was delivered against the verdict of a lower court that had awarded a meagre compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh to the victims family on the ground that she was a non-earning member of the family.          
	If a persons worth is to be determined solely on the basis of the amount of money he or she earns, the majority of women and children in India may find that their lives are of little worth. Numerous deaths in India because of rash driving and medical malpractice. The families of the victims are often denied justice. Even in the rare cases when justice is delivered, the amount offered as compensation is woefully inadequate.          
	The apex court has also objected to the government census listing homemakers as non-workers. The courts verdict is a step in the right direction and is likely to act as a deterrent for discrimination against women. One hopes that the judgment will induce the making of new laws to quantify the contribution of housewives to the economy.          
	Despite progress in technology and in the overall economy in recent times, India has lagged behind in preserving human rights and ensuring equality for all. A large number of people still suffer from acute poverty in this country. Corruption in every sphere of governance and public services has ensured this inequality. The worst victims of such a lopsided system are women and children who have little power to protest against the prevailing injustice. The fact that women who stay at home to nurture their families are viewed by the government to be as unproductive as beggars and prostitutes underscores the inherent flaws in Indian society.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  A housewife plays an important role in ensuring the well-being of a family. It is unfair to evaluate her work in terms of money. But to list a housewife as a non-worker is grossly unfair (Working it out, July 26). It is unwise to ignore the economic value of a homemakers labour. In the West, babysitters and crche-owners earn handsome amounts for the services they render to working mothers. Even cooks and domestic workers earn such high salaries that middle-class households are often unable to afford their services. In India, housewives save their families such expenses on housekeeping. So, their work does have monetary value. Housework, indeed, is invisible. But if the women of the family stop working, the household would grind to a halt. This issue also highlights the plight of paid domestic workers, who often face a hostile working environment and whose labour remains largely undervalued.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, Working it out, rightly states that housework is invisible, hence it is easy to ignore and exploit. A homemaker puts in a lot of effort to ensure the smooth running of a household. But her work is taken for granted and thus underestimated. Her contribution is noticed only when she stops working. But in Indian society, the housewifes compliance with family rules has become the norm and any deviation is seen as revolt. Homemakers do not even have the democratic right to go on strike. Their vulnerability stems from a bias deeply rooted in society. The editorial states that different aspirations and economic goals are inducing different lifestyles and values. This is true, but women are still the worst victims of the unequal distribution and unjust evaluation of labour.          
	Yours faithfully,        R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore , Hooghly            
	Parting shot    
	Sir  What the British prime minister, David Cameron, said about Pakistan and terrorism during his visit to India was probably just meant to please Indians (Just visiting, Aug 3). In reality, both the American and the British governments are fully aware that there is no hope of a long-term settlement between India and Pakistan regarding Kashmir. The erstwhile British foreign secretary, David Miliband, had suggested that the Kashmir issue should be resolved for the greater good of both countries. Obviously, his suggestions had fallen on deaf ears.          
	Yours faithfully,

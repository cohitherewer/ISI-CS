                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DONE IT AGAIN                                                    
	The shift is imperceptible in terms of numbers, but so important that it should be celebrated every time. Shampa Bauri, a young teenager studying in the government school for rescued child labourers in Purulia, West Bengal, has said no to marriage. In order to convince her parents, she had the support of her teachers, peers and the local labour officer. History is beginning to repeat itself in a surprisingly pleasant way. In Purulia alone, one girl after another has been refusing to get married before 18, insisting that they will complete their studies. Rebelling against their parents has taken courage and conviction. A little earlier, there was Ahalya Kumar, digging her heels in the way Shampa has done, although these girls come from the poorest of families and have to contribute to the familys sparse earnings. Their courage and confidence can be properly admired only with that background in mind.        
	Undoubtedly, the governments role in Purulia in educating the girls in the newly-established schools for child labourers has been remarkably positive. The government is also being helped in this sphere by the Unicef. This has given Purulia a head start, and girls like Rekha Kalindi and Afsana Khatun have become role models for other girls from similar backgrounds. Some of them, whether 12, or 13, or 14 years of age, have got together as child activists to encourage others like themselves to resist early marriage. But girls elsewhere are becoming vocal too. Padma Ruidas in Bankura, taken out of school to work as domestic help in a neighbours house, calmly wiped the vermilion off her forehead as soon as the police arrived at her marriage venue following her call for help. Superstition is losing its hold over the girls of a new generation, whose earliest lessons in horror, as Padma, Ahalya or Rekha have said, come from the fate of their older sisters  married, miserable and sometimes producing dead babies long before they are 18.

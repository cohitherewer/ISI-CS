	 At times, twos not company but a crowd. Especially when one person is left with very little room for manoeuvre. Ghulam Nabi Azad is being forced to share his office at 24 Akbar Road with Karan Singh, who heads the AICCs foreign affairs department. For months now, Azad has had little company or competition on his slice of the turf. But things have taken a rather ominous turn as Singhs nameplate now hangs next to his in the main building. The reason? Apparently, Singh had demanded some more room and better decor to be able to entertain the numerous dignitaries who visit the party HQ regularly. Partymen, however, insist that the move to put Singh and Azad in the same room is a blessing in disguise. Both men hail from J amp;K, and will possibly spend quality time chatting about how things are back at home. But something tells us that Azad would have been far more happier with the earlier arrangement in which he had the whole room for himself.                
	 The prime minister managed to turn quite a few heads during his successful visit to Saudi Arabia. While addressing a gathering at a university, Manmohan Singh began his address with the customary Ladies and Gentlemen. But as soon as he had uttered these words, heads began to turn as the Arab dignitaries craned their necks to spot the ladies in the crowd. Their eyes rested on only two of them, who were both from India: one was the PMs better half and the other was Latha Reddy, the secretary in the ministry of external affairs. For once, ladies had bagged the spotlight, leaving all the men behind.                            
	 Kenya has long been considered a happy hunting ground for tourists and wildlife enthusiasts. But now, the country has turned out to be an equally favourite destination for another species: newly-wed Indian politicians. First, the Union minister of state for petroleum, Jitin Prasada, headed for a Kenyan safari. It is now the turn of Deepender Singh Hooda, MP and son of the Haryana chief minister, to savour the thrilling beauty of the Masai Mara or the fantastic view atop the majestic Kilimanjaro. With the forests and their animals disappearing fast in India, people and politicians alike are having to travel far and wide to get a taste of the wild.                            
	 The last week of February has been renamed Didi-Dada week. First, the railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, presented her railway budget, which has been criticized for being Bengal-friendly. This was followed by the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, unveiling the Union budget. That too was condemned for raising the prices of petroleum products. But despite their common fate, Didi and Dada do not seem to be sharing cordial ties with one another. Just the other day, no less than the prime minister had to intervene to pacify sister Mamata who is supposedly livid at brother Pranab for the petro hike. Members of the government must be hoping that the PMs intervention would help keep this coalition family together for the time being.                            
	 The Bharatiya Janata Party may say that it is in favour of the womens reservation bill. But, at times, some of its top women leaders have found the party wanting in its support towards them. When the Speaker proposed that the new leader of the Opposition, Sushma Swaraj, be introduced with a welcome, the BJP refused the honour accorded to her, and alleged that the government was trying to divert the Oppositions attention from the prickly issue of price-rise. But the grapevine has it that some influential sections in the party are finding it difficult to take orders from a woman leader. Will the bill be enough to change the mans world that is politics?                            
	 The Indian womens team received the gold medal at the Commonwealth shooting championship with the Australian anthem playing in the background. The organizers, confident of an Aussie win, had made preparations for only the Australian anthem. Sometimes, even a win is not enough to change skewed beliefs.                
	FOOTNOTE
      
	 At a pre-budget cabinet meeting, Dayanidhi Maran flipped through a booklet and discovered the figure, 13,420, against post and telegraph services. Thinking it to be a budgetary allocation, he asked Pranab Mukherjee why 13,420 crore have been allotted to the post and telegraph department. An infuriated Mukherjee retorted that the figure denoted the number of post offices, and not money. One cannot really blame poor Maran for the error. His obsession with his rival, the present telecommunication minister, may have resulted in this lapse of concentration.

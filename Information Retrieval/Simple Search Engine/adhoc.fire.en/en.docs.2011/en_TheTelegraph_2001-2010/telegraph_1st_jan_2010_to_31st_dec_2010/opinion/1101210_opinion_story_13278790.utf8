                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOLLOW CORE                                                    
	Julian Assange, the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, the website responsible for some scandalous exposs about the diplomatic world, has finally given himself up to the police in London. Arrested on charges of alleged sexual misconduct, Mr Assange might become easy prey for the establishment, most prominently represented by the United States of America. He has put the cat among the pigeons, no less. Equally, for millions around the world, he is also a role model who has done a great service to common people by revealing the half-truths that are bandied about by the Western powers in the global media. Heads of States have been put to shame and diplomats embarrassed. But now that the information is out in cyberspace, there is really no way of containing the menace. Every trace, however minute, is theoretically indelible from the electronic domain. So, instead of agonizing over what is being leaked out, the more sensible option for the US  and for all other nations implicated  would be to devise a more foolproof system to ensure better secrecy in the future. It was no less than hubris for the US to let millions of its agents, diplomats and officials access classified information from various parts of the world and yet remain complacent about the invincibility of the network.        
	However, it would be difficult, even for hardcore liberals, to offer unqualified support to Mr Assange. At one level, his project is no doubt visionary, an achievement of sorts that has radically altered perceptions of accountability and transparency across the globe. Mr Assange deserves commendation for his courage of conviction and the tremendous risks he has taken in order to deliver what he believes to be public good. At another level, however, the ethics involved in his working methods must stand up to unsparing scrutiny. Breaking the privileged circle of elites and unmasking hypocrisy is one thing, and doing so at the risk of libel and treachery is quite another. It would perhaps be an exaggeration to claim that diplomacy after WikiLeaks would never be the same again. The rules of the game are not likely to change much, though the inner dynamics are bound to be realigned. In order to function with a certain degree of competence, government institutions have always relied on a core of secrecy. That core has been violated by WikiLeaks and filled up with a sense of profound insecurity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | too many visits
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TOO MANY VISITS                                                    
	Diplomats in well-tailored suits may not convey the impression, but diplomacy demands hard work. Behind the joint communiqus and the glittering signing ceremonies lie hours of home work, hard-nosed negotiations and pages of drafting and redrafting carried out by anonymous mandarins belonging to the foreign services of the countries concerned. Given this almost self-evident reality concerning a visit of a head of State/government, it is incredible that four heads of State/government have come to India between the second week of November and now. The presidents of the United States of America, France and Russia and the premier of China provided Indias ministry of external affairs with an embarrassment of riches over seven weeks. It could not have been easy for Manmohan Singh either, especially given the domestic scandals he had to face and the meeting of his partys plenary he had to attend. This raises questions about drawing up such a hectic and whistle-stop schedule, which could not have left the Indian foreign office and concerned ministers and bureaucrats with much time for reflection and the weighing of pros and cons.        
	This kind of schedule lends ground to the suspicion that there was very little time for proper preparation. The reference is here not to protocol and ritual, which are probably pretty well laid down and established. It refers to the time left for home work to be done by the relevant secretaries, especially the foreign secretary, on whom falls the responsibility of leading the backroom negotiations. What does India gain by so many important visits within such a short space of time? It conveys the impression that leaders of powerful States are eager to come to India to renegotiate or reiterate the terms of their relationship with India, which is perceived now as a significant global player. This gain should, however, be placed against the drawbacks of going under-prepared to the negotiating table. Indian diplomats, this time round, may have been fortunate, but that is no guarantee that their luck will always hold. In diplomacy, as in life, it always pays to be safe rather than sorry. Surely, it is not obligatory to have important visits clubbed together within a few weeks. All it requires is some sort of forward planning and to accept the offer of visits to India on Indias terms and convenience, rather than on terms set by the itinerary of foreign dignitaries.

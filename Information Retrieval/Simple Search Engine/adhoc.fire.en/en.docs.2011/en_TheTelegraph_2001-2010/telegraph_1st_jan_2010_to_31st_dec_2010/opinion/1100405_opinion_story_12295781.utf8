	Lonely in the wild                  
	Sir  It was heartening to read about the sighting of a tiger in the Buxa Tiger Reserve (Tiger! Buxa earns its stripes, March 31). But the photograph that was carried did not inspire confidence. There were hardly any stripes visible on the animal, only a lot of white with a splash of yellow on one side. Perhaps it was an albino tiger.          
	The article claimed that no big cats have been seen in the tiger reserve in the last 40 years. This is hard to believe. In 2006, I visited the village of Jayanti, which lies inside the Buxa Tiger Reserve. Although I did not spot any of the big cats, I saw a lot of leopard pugmarks, old ones as well as recent, on the sandy bed of the Jayanti river. There were also scratch marks on trees in the jungle, evidently made by tigers. One morning, in the middle of the jungle, we could hear a herd of cheetals calling out in alarm.          
	Nevertheless, shielding the tiger from poachers will not be easy. This is largely because the government, with political objectives in mind, has allowed settlements to exist within the borders of the Buxa Tiger Reserve. All Indian reserves face the same problem and seem to be doomed to the same fate as that of Sariska, which has lost its tiger population. Tribal people have been living in the jungles for centuries in the past, but never before have they had the advantage of possessing high calibre rifles and effective poisons for hunting animals. Moreover, in recent times, poaching tigers has become a lucrative trade.          
	It is sad that the majestic tiger has been brought to the brink of extinction. In my childhood, there were many forests where the awe-inspiring yet melodious call of a tiger could still be heard. Today, only silence reigns there. I fear that the tiger will not last this decade unless the government takes stringent and effective steps for its conservation, even at the risk of becoming unpopular.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  According to recent reports, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, worried by the rising number of tiger deaths, will personally speak to states on the matter. While the prime ministers concern for tigers is appreciated, it is important that he also considers the plight of thousands of people in our country. With a rapidly growing population, there is increased pressure on land, which is needed for human habitation. This has given rise to conflicts between man and animal in several areas.          
	It is imperative to explore alternative strategies for wildlife conservation. The government could concentrate on reserving certain areas as sanctuaries devoted to wildlife only. This would enable it to focus on the animals, rather than mediate between the demands of wildlife conservation and the interests of the people living in the area. It would also be easier to control poaching. For example, once the Gir forest in Gujarat was declared a national park and a lion sanctuary, the number of the Asiatic lions in the park rose considerably. In subsequent years, there has been talk of introducing Gir lions in other regions of the country.          
	Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly evident that the government tends to prioritize wildlife conservation over human welfare. When it was proposed that the NH17, which connects Mumbai and Goa, be turned into a four-lane highway, one of the objections raised was that the new road would cut through a bird sanctuary. In order to avoid this problem, the road would have to be diverted, even though this might mean demolishing houses belonging to the people who live in the towns and villages along the highway. The habitat of the birds seemed to be of more importance than the homes that were to be destroyed.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Imperial decree          
	Sir  In her article on China, Neha Sahay writes, Googles departure has stirred up a lively debate on the nature of freedom in this country (When freedom beckons, April 1) . She adds, The government has largely succeeded in making it a Chinese-self-respect versus US-imperialism question. However, Google is not the only imperialist American concern doing business in China. Strangely enough, the Chinese government has no objection to the others.          
	Most communist governments are suspicious of the free flow of information. Recently, the Chinese government banned the countrys media from reporting on 18 subjects, including corruption, the disparity of wealth, trouble in Tibet and the Xinjiang province, high medical fees, the collapse of school buildings in earthquakes in Sichuan in 2008 and delays in rebuilding them. How long can China sustain itself by suppressing peoples voices?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Virtually timed with Womens Day, Nandikars new production, Madhabi, gives Bhisham Sahnis sympathetic interpretation of Yayatis dutiful, victimized daughter a Bengali avatar. The story comes from the Mahabharatas Udyoga Parva, where Madhavis fate exemplifies Yayatis vanity and the obstinacy of Galava, who insists on presenting dakshina to his guru, Viswamitra. Irritated, Viswamitra demands 800 white horses with black ears. The stymied Galava eventually approaches an old Yayati, who pleads helplessness but, pride in his fabled generosity hurt by Galavas accusation of failure, gifts Madhavi to Galava as barter for horses with any king. Galava contracts her to three monarchs, each in turn exchanging 200 horses for a son born of her. He gets the remainder by delivering her to Viswamitra.        
	Thus, the epic shows woman as mere chattel passed from one insensitive man to another. Sahni adds more: love between Madhavi and Galava which makes him a marginally more appealing character. The unromantic source might have left a starker, grimmer impact (besides, in some versions, Galava is Viswamitras son). Sahni grants Madhavi agency by having her offer herself to Viswamitra to complete the 800 horses (originally Garuda suggested this route). But whereas in the epic, Madhavi, after fulfilling the deal, declined her own swayamvara and entered the forest, here she gets traumatized by Galavas final decision. Clearly, Sahni favours emotional effects. He ignores Madhavis ultimate selfless act: when Yayati fell from heaven, she sacrificed half her accrued dharma to restore him  returning us to Yayatis sense of self-esteem.        
	The director, Swatilekha Sengupta, has substantially edited the sprawling Hindi play, and framed it with a sung chorus commenting on the action. Her translation-cum-adaptation highlights her main concerns of the moral pretence and power-soaked status quo, reinforced by differentiating Madhavis royal partners as virile male, ambivalent bisexual and cartoon geriatric respectively. Nevertheless, the first half could gain from further tightening. In the title role, difficult because it traverses a wide expanse from girlish purity and innocence to love, duty, motherhood, humiliation, dignity and the last shock of realization, Sohini Sengupta peaks as the tension builds to the end, yet could cultivate closer detail to the range of feelings required when younger. Debshankar Halders Galava has more of the tragic hero than determined monomaniac, while Rudraprasad Sengupta imparts to Yayati the necessary grandeur and arrogance. Madhabi has excellent production values: bunched-up curtains at the back (designed by Saumik-Piyali) resembling thick foliage when light falls on them, precision coloured lighting by Susanta Mandal, and a mostly raga-based classical score to evoke the gravity of the subject, composed by the director herself.

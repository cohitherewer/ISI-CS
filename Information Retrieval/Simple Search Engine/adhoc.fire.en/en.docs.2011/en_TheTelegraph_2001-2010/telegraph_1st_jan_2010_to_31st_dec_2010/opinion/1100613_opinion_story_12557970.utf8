                          Stressful times
      
	The bells for the West Bengal assembly polls are yet to toll. But heads have started rolling already among the top echelon of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). A blame game is rife among the Prakash Karat lobby, which is holding the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, responsible for the declining fortunes of the Left in the state. On their part, Karats opponents feel that he should shoulder the lions share of the blame. Recently, the politburo announced its decision to convene an extended central committee meeting in Vijayawada in August, when some serious soul searching is expected to take place. Meanwhile, the Bengal lobby, led by Sitaram Yechury, has charged Karat of overstepping the party line, an allegation that no general secretary of the CPI(M) has faced since the party came into existence in 1964. Apparently, the brief was to work towards the defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party, but somewhere the focus shifted to the Congress. Add to this Bhattacharjees industrial policies, and what one gets is a royal mess. It remains to be seen how the most disciplined political party in the country is going to fix this internal feud.                          
	In the BJP, too, seeds of discontent are growing into full-fledged trees, spreading their branches all over the place. Nitin Gadkari, the party president, is clearly unhappy about the fact that senior leaders, Arun Jaitley and Rajnath Singh, are no longer on talking terms. Moreover, the buzz is that Najma Heptullah is disillusioned with the BJP as well. Her grouse is particularly directed at Sushma Swaraj. Heptullah, who is never tired of flaunting her august lineage, had joined the BJP a few years ago in the hope that her talents would be better recognized there than in the Congress. That, clearly, does not seem to be the case at present.                        
	 It is said that the world of politics is all about pedigree and currying personal favours. But there are exceptions as well. Take, for instance, the case of the Union coal minister, Sriprakash Jaiswal. Recently, Jaiswal took his counterpart at the urban development ministry, S. Jaipal Reddy, by quite a surprise.      
	It so happened that Jaiswal had sought an appointment with Reddy. When he called on Reddy at Delhis Nirman Bhawan, Jaiswal presented a case for a junior-level government officials inability to get accommodation in spite of his just entitlement. Reddy, of course, did the needful, but not before enquiring whether the official was somehow related to Jaiswal or perhaps linked to someone in the Congress. The coal ministers reply was short and stunning. The only link that the official had with him, Jaiswal said, was that he happened to be a voter in his parliamentary constituency. Since then, Reddy has not stopped gushing over the ministers sense of responsibility even towards an ordinary voter.                
	 The composition of the National Advisory Council held a different kind of surprise in store for many members of the Congress. There were several heavyweights from the party eyeing plum NAC slots this time. It is believed that Mani Shankar Aiyar, Jairam Ramesh and Digvijay Singh were some of the aspirants to the panel headed by Sonia Gandhi. They all wanted to share their vision and ideas with the party president. But the NAC chief went on to pick a team of apolitical entities disappointing many in the process. In Congress circles, a membership to the NAC has assumed more value than a berth in the Union council of ministers. An NAC membership is considered akin to being granted entry into no less than the sanctum sanctorum.                            
	 The monsoons are yet to arrive but there is already a great deal of expectation over Manmohan Singhs reshuffling of his council of ministers. The Union commerce and industry minister, Anand Sharma, is said to be keen on the foreign office, where he believes he will do a better job than S.M. Krishna. Krishna, in turn, would be content with being shifted to the human resource development ministry, replacing Kapil Sibal. Apparently, Sibal wont mind at all if he is asked to move into Udyog Bhawan to take up Sharmas post. As the United Progressive Alliance government begins the second year of its second term in power, it remains to be seen how the good doctor is going to preside over this game of political musical chairs.                      
	The Congress has asked its leaders not to give any public statement on Prakash Jhas Bollywood sensation, Rajneeti. Further comments would only aggravate the controversy and spark tension throughout the country. By this time, Jha must have got used to being ignored by the Congress. After losing the Lok Sabha elections on a ticket from Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party, Jha had expressed interest in joining the Congress. But the party refused to entertain him in any way. Another snub came from the Union minister for petroleum and natural gas, Murli Deora. Recently, Jha offered Deora a piece of land he had acquired in Betia on a lease to build a warehouse for the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited. And once again, he had to take a frosty no for an answer.

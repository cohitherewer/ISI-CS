	Painful progress                  
	Sir  In Refugees and the republic (Nov 9), Ramachandra Guha says that as many as 20 million people have been displaced from their lands to make way for roads, factories and hydroelectric projects. However, these people were duly compensated. The compensation may have been inadequate, but it is a fact that factories and projects are important for the development of a country like India. Vast numbers of workers get employment in factories, and hydroelectric projects supply electricity to villages. Proper roads have made travel and transportation of goods easier for all. Hence, contrary to what Guha says, it is not merely the urban middle and upper classes that have been benefited by development projects.          
	All projects result in some hardship. But the countrys progress cannot be stalled because of this. In China, the Three Gorges Dam displaced a large number of people and inundated innumerable towns and villages. Preparations for the Beijing Olympics also dislodged thousands of people. Today the world applauds China for the dam and the Olympics. It is pity that in a democracy like ours, development does not get approval although it benefits so many.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  India has always gracefully borne the challenges posed by the refugee situation. The steady influx of refugees since Independence has intensified the countrys economic and population problems. India risked its diplomatic relations with China by offering asylum to the Dalai Lama and his followers. If India were indeed a poor, divided and still imperfectly united country, it could not have been so hospitable to so many. Various development projects have caused the displacement of millions of people. But illegitimate acquisitions of land are being scrutinized now. The government is taking measures to rehabilitate the afflicted people.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas article highlighted the negligence suffered by Indias numerous internal refugees. There are also those rendered homeless by floods and earthquakes. Many workers have lost their jobs after mills were shut down.The lack of proper rehabilitation or alternative jobs has led to starvation and suicide. It is deprivation of this kind that has driven a generation of refugee children to criminal activities.          
	Yours faithfully,        Jayanti Ghosh Dastidar, Calcutta            
	Bitter truth          
	Sir  Perhaps the former South African cricket coach, Mickey Arthur, is justified in criticizing the Indian cricketers for their lack of dignity and commitment to the game (India were spineless due to IPL, says Arthur, Nov 10). While such comments may not be welcome from a foreigner, they do merit some thought instead of just adverse reaction.          
	Indian cricketers are paid handsomely and always given extensive media coverage. This happens at the cost of all other sports, even those played at the Olympics, of which cricket is not one. The Indian Premier League has made cricketers even more rich. But they have the hopes of the entire country riding on their performances. In such a situation, a certain degree of decorum and superior performances are not too much to ask of them. It is no crime to earn money through the IPL or through product endorsements. But neglecting the job at hand for other pursuits cannot be accepted. One cannot deny the fact that sports are as much about building ones character as they are about physical prowess. Hence, we should pay heed to Arthurs words, instead of being upset at them.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Deboprokash Bhattacharjee, Durgapur

                
	Make a racket          
	Sir  Politicians have yet again displayed their penchant for supporting the wrong causes (United in noise, Oct 27). Members of the Trinamul Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) demanded that bursting noisy firecrackers be allowed. Perhaps they hope to win the support of the people who make and use such firecrackers. Politicians often care only for their own interests. The former chief election commissioner, James Michael Lyngdoh, had suggested that politicians with pending criminal cases should not be allowed to contest elections. Members of parliament from different parties had unitedly opposed his suggestion.          
	Despite laws, people burst loud firecrackers throughout the festive season.The government should stop this practice.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sanjit Ghatak, Calcutta

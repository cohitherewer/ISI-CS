	 What is the best way to break the political ice? A combination of hilsa, saris and sandesh perhaps. The week saw leaders of India and Bangladesh raise a toast to their new-found friendship with the help of these three things . The prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, had come calling with bags full of the famed fish that made their way to Pranab Mukherjee and Mamata Banerjee. In return, she received a number of gifts as well: Pranabdas wife gave her a silk sari while Didi sweetened the exchange further with some notun gurer sandesh and Dhanekhali sari. When it came to the Congress president, she proved to be a picture of grace. Spotting the visitors relatives seated in the back rows at an award ceremony, Sonia Gandhi made a number of Central ministers vacate their front-row seats so that Wajeds family members could be accommodated in their place. She moved a row behind herself. Touched by the treatment meted out to her, Wajed confided that Indira Gandhi was like a mother to her. Given the old ties, there is certainly nothing fishy about this tale of friendship.                
	 Meanwhile, even as Wajed basked in the warmth, poor Amar Singh was left out in the cold by his friends. It seems that the beleaguered Samajwadi leader now has few takers across the political spectrum, despite his earlier claims that he could walk into any alliance. Singh has been greeted with No-vacancy signs on every door that he has knocked: the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Nationalist Congress Party, the Trinamul Congress and so on. But, according to some experts, there is a door that still remains open for Singh, that of Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular). The former prime ministers party does not have much of a presence outside his home state, but he can have some use for the voluble to keep the party banner fluttering in Karnataka. Another friend, apart from the humble farmer, who might come to Singhs rescue is Big B himself. Eyebrows were certainly raised after Amitabh Bachchan cosied up to Narendra Modi, but Singh has no fear of Bachchan switching ranks. After all, Bachchan is unlikely to forget the sacrifices made by Amar for the sake of his elder brother.                            
	 The new BJP president surely means business. Everyone knows of how Nitin Gadkari wants partymen to stay in humble tents and eat simple food during the national convention to wean them off the five star party culture. Now, there is also some talk of Gadkari improving the party atmosphere to rid it of the feuds and factionalism that are all too common. Meanwhile, there are also rumours that Gadkari has set up his own vigilance team to provide information about the people seeking an appointment with him. A lucky few will get to meet him, after a careful scrutiny of their credentials. All this has allegedly made some old-timers pine for those days when both comfort and the party president were within easy reach.                            
	 After tweeting into trouble, Shashi Tharoor managed to raise a laugh, finally! Recently, Tharoor visited the National Museum on Lal Bahadur Shastris birthday to attend a lecture. In front of the packed audience, the former prime ministers son, Anil Shastri, introduced Tharoor and then went on to talk about the latters books, the columns he has written, his UN job and the many posts he has held as a board member. On hearing this grand introduction, Tharoor replied modestly that all this had taken place in the past and that there was no need for Shastri junior to go into the details. To this, Shastri replied that he was merely reading out from the material that had been handed over to him by Tharoors office.Tharoor rose to speak amidst the peals of laughter, and promised that he will ask his office to update the information about him.                            
	 Here is something more on Gadkari. Apparently, the BJP president is keen to avail his party of Pratibha Advanis services, and has even placed a formal request in this regard. The Advanis have been non-committal about the invitation. Gadkari must be hoping that Pratibha accepts the offer so that he can use her multi-tasking abilities  film production, media relations and culinary skills  to rejuvenate the ailing party. But will Gadkari be able to melt the heart of the Iron Man with this gesture?

	 At a time when Bihar is reeling under an intense cold spell, the chief minister, Nitish Kumar, is doing what he can to warm the hearts of the disempowered. On the deserted streets of Patna, it is not uncommon to see poor people huddled around bonfires arranged by the district administration under the CMs instructions. Recently, some slum dwellers who had gathered around a small bonfire in a locality late at night had a surprise visitor: it was the CM himself who had decided to visit them at that unearthly hour to enquire about their welfare, listen to their grievances as well as to check whether the district administration had made proper arrangements to help them fight the cold. But what is the reason behind Kumars nocturnal tours? Cynics say that with elections on the horizon, it is now time to go back to the people.

  - A tale of two women and a reluctant bookseller					 
										      FORBIDDEN FRUIT                                                
	At the Baruipur railway station one afternoon, a friend and I stood looking up at the showcase that was a part of a choti boi-sellers cart. What lay in that glass casing was a slim volume called Nishiddho Galpo, which the bookseller thought was fit for display only from that high pedestal. We soon realized we had company. About half a dozen men belonging to varying age groups were also gaping at the book cover, on which was an illustration of a bare-bodied young man behind whom stood (we all hoped) a bare-bodied young woman.        
	These men seemed oblivious of the others till they spotted us. Up till then, there was nothing in the way they longingly looked at the shelf that needed to be spoken about, discussed or justified. No one, not even the shopkeeper around whose stall they were crowding, seemed to mind them staring at the book. It was a guilty secret they all shared, and seemed to have come to an understanding whereby such yearning was a part of life, a necessary evil. They perhaps had a mutual sense of sympathy, as an acknowledgment of their common weakness. This arrangement suddenly seemed disturbed by the presence of two women sharing the same space and performing the same action. So the men started to disperse, hanging around only far enough to hear the conversation we had with the bookseller.        
	We asked to see the Nishiddho Galpo, to which the fumbling shopkeeper said it was packed, and would be brought down from the shelf only if we intended to buy it. When we said we did, he considered a little before quoting a figure of hundred rupees for a volume that otherwise costs between five and fifteen rupees. The bookseller was visibly flummoxed when we agreed to pay that amount. As he was desperately fishing for another excuse to ward us off, one of our fellow-gawkers came close enough to contribute: It is not for sale. As we turned back, disheartened, we thought we saw the seller give his rescuer a grateful look.        
	The genre of nishiddho galpos cannot really be called banned literature. Writing that is found offensive and subsequently removed from the public domain generally tries to be a part of the mainstream, but fails. Nishiddho galpo stakes no such claim in the mainstream. The very fact that this body of writing describes itself as nishiddho or prohibited might be indicative of the self-reflexive, even guilt-ridden, nature of the writing. The tag acts as a disclaimer, critiquing these stories before others begin to do so, thereby protecting the whole genre from attacks from the censors. This may seem like an ingenious plan. But the purpose of the label is purely utilitarian  to communicate to the readers what the content of these stories is.        
	All those responsible for the existence of such work  writers, publishers, distributors and readers  know full well that what they are writing, reading or selling is offensive by any yardstick of modesty; they admit that these stories are unfit for society at large. Those who do end up patronizing nishiddho galpos are either believers of freedom of expression who do not find this kind of writing unacceptable, or those who are drawn to them, may be slyly, precisely because they are unacceptable.

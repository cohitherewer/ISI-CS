	Sarod player Amaan Ali Khan, the elder son of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, played an engrossing alap and spellbinding gats in raga Yaman Kalyan at a recital titled A classical welcome to New Year 2010 at the Science City auditorium on December 31, 2009. The programme was jointly presented by Liver Foundation, West Bengal, and Saradha Group and also included a recital by vocalist Rashid Khan that I could not hear.        
	As in the past, the speciality of Amaans Yaman Kalyan was that it made sufficient use of the shuddh madhyam in the dhrupad style and used it with the phrase Re Ga Ma Ga instead of the usual khayal style Pa ma Ga Ma Ga Re that it seemed to avoid on purpose.        
	The skilfully and artistically crafted alap that utilized the grandeur of bass strings to build striking effects reached the high tonic around its 18th minute. There had been some lisping descents from the middle-octave pancham (5th) too in the manner associated with Ustad Faiyaz Khan (or with the shehnai maestro, Ustad Bismillah Khan, possibly the first instrumentalist to copy the device). The arrival at the high tonic was preceded by movements that built up aesthetic torque by utilizing the entire gamut of the raga all over the finger board and was succeeded by the classic Yaman Kalyan phrase Pa `Sa `Ni Re `Sa.        
	Instead of starting a formatted jod after this, Amaan cut loose with a sudden burst of taankari that traversed two octaves. There were ekhara taans, gamak taans and some larlapet before he went into drut jod, which chiefly comprised variegated jhala forays: fast four-stroke straight jhala, gamak jhala, thhok jhala and larant.        
	The jhaptal gatkari was centred on a composition that continued the dhrupad style madhyam use and featured excellent rhythm and taan development. An impressive bol-gamak taan development actually drew applause from the audience, something rather rare in Calcutta today where the audience reserves its applause for the moment at which a tabla player arrives on the sam at the end of a long tihai. Subhankar Banerjee, the tabla player here, concentrated on solid, contextual tabla playing.        
	The teental section opened with an old-style madhyadrut composition, possibly originating from Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan, and went on to an ati drut composition of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. Excellent musicianship was very much in evidence throughout this section as well.        
	The aochar and dhamar gatkari in Malkauns featured engrossing layakari, rhythmic patterns and breathtaking taankari. The brief ati drut teental gatkari too was very good. The recital ended with an aochar and two gats in Charukeshi. These, too, were very enjoyable, with both Amaan and Subhankar playing very well.

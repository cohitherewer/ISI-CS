	Q: I recently retired as a teacher in a government-aided school after 17 years of service. I have received provident fund and monthly pension. But I have not been paid any gratuity (which works out to Rs 1,29,000). The school authorities are offering me a token sum of Rs 50,000 in lieu of the gratuity due to me. What legal recourse do I have?        
	Shipra Mitra, Calcutta        
	A: It is highly illegal on the part of your employer to evade the payment of gratuity. You should send a written application to your employer in accordance with the procedure laid down in The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, claiming gratuity. As soon as gratuity becomes payable the employer shall determine the amount of gratuity and pay the amount within the prescribed time. In case of any dispute regarding the gratuity amount, you may complain to the industrial tribunal with the appropriate jurisdiction.        
	Q: After our mothers demise, my brother and married sister gifted their portions of our mothers flat to me. My share and the gifted portions were mutated in my name but under separate holding numbers. Now that I am the absolute owner of the three portions in one physically undivided flat, is it legally binding to amalgamate all the three portions under a single holding number in my name? If yes, what is the procedure to be followed?        
	Uma Girdhar, via email        
	A: It certainly is desirable that all the three portions are amalgamated under a single holding number in your name for the purpose of uniform tax assessment. You should give an application to the concerned municipal commissioner, apprising him of the facts and requesting him to do the needful.        
	Q: My father had bought a flat jointly with me in 2002. Even though we paid the registration fees, the developer did not give us any receipt for it. Subsequently, the developer fell out with the landlady and she is not ready to get the flat registered in our name. I wish to sell the flat now. Can I do so without it being registered? If not, how can I get it registered without involving the landlady?         
	Lakshmi Ganesan, Calcutta        
	A: No, you cannot sell the flat since it is yet to be transferred in your favour. You can get the flat registered without involving the landlady provided the developer has a registered general power of attorney in his favour made by the landlady with regard to the sale of the flat.

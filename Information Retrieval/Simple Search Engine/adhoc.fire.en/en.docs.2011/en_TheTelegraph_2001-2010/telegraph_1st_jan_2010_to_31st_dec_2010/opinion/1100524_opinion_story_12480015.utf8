	The air borne messenger of death has marred the festivities to mark the first anniversary of the United Progressive Alliance governments second term in office. Prima facie, it would appear that a serious error by the pilot caused the Boeing 737-800 to crash in Mangalores Bajpe airport on Saturday morning. The conditions were perfect for landing and before a full inquiry it is difficult to pinpoint any other set of causes for the disaster. It is always difficult, if not hazardous, to locate an individuals error of judgment in a structure or a system since an error of judgment could be nothing more than just that. However, certain questions need to be asked, especially in a field like air travel that permits only a very narrow margin of error on the part of the pilot. What was it that made the pilot overshoot the landing point in otherwise perfect conditions, especially as the concerned pilot had logged more than 10,000 hours of flying and had landed in Bajpe on previous occasions? Did the co-pilot not notice the mistake that was being perpetrated? Or were there other factors involved which are beyond the knowledge of ill-informed amateur observers and reporters? One point that has reared its ugly head is the nationality of the pilot who was a British national of Serbian origin. This has come up because many of the foreign pilots flying in Indian skies find it difficult to comprehend the instructions given to them by air traffic control. Moreover, the appointment of these pilots is mired in resentment because they receive higher salaries than their Indian counterparts. The civil aviation ministry should look into the linguistic competence of the foreign pilots and ascertain if this was indeed a factor in the Mangalore crash or if the point is being raised out of petty vested interests.        
	A disaster, like a crisis, is also an opportunity to clean up and change. That Air India is in a parlous condition is obvious. Its planes might fly, but as a business venture, it is grounded. It is riddled with corruption and incompetence. And no one, not even the ministry, seems to be interested in reforming it. The bigger question about whether the State should run an airline has fallen off the liberalization agenda. Corruption and incompetence not only erode the business, they also erode the service, and hence enhance the risk factor. Lives cannot be lost because of continued official neglect. A resignation letter, such as the one Praful Patel offered to the prime minister, is not enough.

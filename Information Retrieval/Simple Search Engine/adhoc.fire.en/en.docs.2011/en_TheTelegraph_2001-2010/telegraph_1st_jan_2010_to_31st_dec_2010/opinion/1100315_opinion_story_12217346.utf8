	I want to tell you today about a well-researched report on the migration question that has just been produced. While delineating the future contours of a policy-making base on migration through engagements within the academia, a plan had been mooted by the ministry of overseas Indian affairs for starting the publication of an annual migration report. This was to be on the basis of ongoing research along the lines preferred by the annual world development or human development reports. It was suggested that each such annual volume may focus on a particular theme. It is in keeping with this idea that the first in the series, India Migration Report 2009, has been produced under the general editorship of Binod Khadria, professor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University. The first years theme is understandably comprehensive: Past, Present and the Future Outlook on Indian migration.         
	Perhaps as far back in history as the times of the ascendancy of Greek, Roman and Egyptian civilizations in Mediterranean Europe  or even earlier times  Indians went on foreign voyages or travelled along the famous land routes joining India and Central Asia. On these journeys, the principal European markets had once depended and thrived. We went to them and they came to us. Almost unknowingly, cultural interfaces between the East and the West grew or were explored. We jointly created cultures that would thrive through the ages. The Gandhara and other civilizations in Asia came into existence and created art and cultures that lasted for centuries despite occasional ravages by fanatical marauders. That inheritance was treasured even when the original actors had long since left the scene. In some parts of the world, the task of intermingling of civilizations was left mainly to the seasonal curiosity of the casual tourist. But there always were more important interactions, with the conquistadors, between traders and with scholars who had gone abroad and occasionally had stayed back.              
	I have begun by saying all this because I had been recently listening to the Greek minister for  I think  tourism, addressing an external affairs ministry seminar on the subject of the growing importance of tourism between countries. I happened to be chairing that session.        
	The minister from Greece did not seem to care much about the Gandhara sculpture and architecture, not to speak of Greeces own share in that famous joint venture. Imagine my discomfort when the minister told me he was most gratified to meet one in far-off India who thought so highly of ancient Greeces cultural links. He perhaps expected governments to stick to current realities and encourage academics to do the same.        
	It was the Ptolemaic dynasty, historians tell us, that had initiated Graeco-Roman maritime trade contact with India, using the Red Sea ports. The historian, Strabo, interestingly, once noted a vast increase in trade following the Roman annexation of Egypt. His account indicates that the hazards of the Indian monsoon were well known in Athens, Rome and Alexandria. These place-names are still familiar to the modern world. Unfortunately, those of the three or four Indian ports also mentioned by the old Roman and Greek historians are not discernible, at least to me. I very much wonder if even our historians would be able to identify these places with certainty because even the port sites might not have remained. But this does not mean trade between India and the hub of the European civilization was not as important and as flourishing then as it is today.        
	The sea-trade routes of old had to be cleverly devised to make them cost-effective and also protected from both the pirates of the sea and the havocs of nature in the season the monsoon winds and rains came. Similarly, the famous trade routes by land  the spice route and the silk route  had to be as carefully maintained and properly guarded against marauders on roads spreading from what is modern Afghanistan through Central Asia. The sea and land trade routes were used then, as in modern times, for transporting physical capital and merchandise. But they must have been carrying human capital too. Indian enclaves were present in Alexandria. Christian and Jewish settlers from Rome lived in India in settlements during and even after the fall of the Roman Empire.        
	I had once seen an Egyptian mummy lying in its coffin. Parts of the body seemed covered in a delicate fabric that I was told came from India. That mummy probably was a few thousand years old. The covering fabric looked suspiciously like fine cotton that could well have come all the way from East India where the famous muslin would one day become world-renowned. I would not be surprised if some Indian merchants or even technicians were around when the mummys dressing was being put on. The use of Indian products might well have needed accompanying experts. Perhaps some of the Indian settlers living in Alexandria and elsewhere in the Old World were only welcome high-quality manpower. They would have been among the original non-resident Indians who had endowed themselves with India-made human capital but were stationed abroad for servicing their countrys wares when needed.        
	The path into the future for researchers has many steps to tread. Migration of people from India, particularly over the last two centuries, led them to many parts of the world, which now constitute a sizable minority community in many countries. The presence of Indian migrants in more than a hundred countries and their contributions in social, cultural, economic and political spheres have made them important not only in their adopted countries but for India as well. It is only towards the closing two decades of the 20th century that migration has started catching greater attention from policymakers, the academia and civil society. There are a small number of academics involved in pursuing research at different universities and institutions in the country and a few civil society organizations voicing their concern about international migration. Nonetheless, these are still scattered and need further consolidation.              
	The Khadria group report has been produced by a team of experts. It is based on research taking stock of the trajectories of Indian migration we have seen in the recent past and speculating on what seems to lie ahead. The report covers several issues relating to international migration, primarily from but also to India. It covers concerns that have been on our minds for years, for example, remittances, gender, migration of health professionals and so on. At the same time, there are issues which are of more recent vintage, like terrorism, security and climate change. The report also discusses various policy perspectives across countries.        
	The final chapter of the report is on the outlook for migration. Research here is difficult because information on many important aspects of migration is not easily available. It is also difficult because one has to link up data collected on apparently unrelated aspects, such as stocks and flows of people moving from India to other countries and into India, remittances and their utilization, temporary and permanent migration, issues related to integration, gender, illegal migration, terrorism, security, climate change and so on. This list can be extended ad infinitum and one can be sure there will be other issues that will make the question of human migration even trickier. It was good to find that the researchers  if not governments  were fully aware of that, being unencumbered with the compulsions of current policy.

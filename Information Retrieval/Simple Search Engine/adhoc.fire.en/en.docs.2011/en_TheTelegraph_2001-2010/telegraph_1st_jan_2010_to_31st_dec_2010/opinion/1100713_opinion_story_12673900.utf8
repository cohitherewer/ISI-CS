The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When Violence Is Legal
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHEN VIOLENCE IS LEGAL                                  MalVika Singh                               
	One had to pinch oneself when one read that the cabinet had decided to set up a committee  a group of ministers  to examine how to frame a set of laws that would determine the jurisdiction of khap panchayats. This is nothing short of a national shame. If this country is going to fall prey to the regressive and repressive diktats of such caste and ethnic groupings, India is headed towards militant, lawless anarchy. Khap panchayats, which have run amok and not been restrained by the existing laws of the land pertaining to both liberty and murder, are strong symbols of a failing state. Honour killings are no different from the violence perpetrated by other ethnic and religious groups elsewhere in the world that liberals have damned. And liberals are a worldwide majority.        
	This frightening development that is condoned because of votebank politics is leading this emerging economic power towards the dark labyrinth of the politics of blackmail based on insular demands. We all know that committeebaazi in India is just an expression of incompetence and the inability to call a spade a spade. It is this excuse that has been cited to stall all radical change, and a mythical consensus has been the reason given for not taking risks to alter a course that is wrong. We, the public, can see through this charade. The tragedy is that a pluralist, modern nation, with a billion-plus inhabitants, striving to take its place on the world stage, is being reduced to a failed state because of a collective leadership that is unwilling to establish and enforce a new trajectory. This malleable leadership succumbs to every kind of pressure and takes no clear positions because it is comfortable with being in power.                 
	Poor state        
	The government is soft on illegalities such as the khap panchayats, on scams in large institutions that have powerful, political owners, on the misuse of the mandated powers of the administrative class that were put in place to ensure civil societys demands. The government is greatly excited about poisoning the agricultural sector without a clear strategy, claiming that GM crops will feed hungry Indians faster and in a better manner. It was hoping to sign a nuclear liability agreement without a national discourse! Every environmental norm is being violated by government departments for big businesses to exploit what is not permitted by law, all in the name of escalating the growth rate.         
	Maybe, we need the state department of the United States of America to tell us that we must reinvent our cultural and academic institutions with immediate effect to protect ourselves from impending sanctions. In this country, there is always an excuse for not doing what needs urgent attention and rectification. Our bureaucrats are masters at finding ways to maintain a destructive status quo. Our political masters have personal priorities. As for matters related to the mind and soul, they are not prioritized because they can neither be lucrative nor help in enhancing the mythical rate of growth. We have reduced ourselves to a nation of hapless people with our pride in the country and ourselves drowning in a sea of sewage.        
	I have written endlessly about the degraded state of our museums and archives, but no one cares. The government is more concerned about regulating the media than about restoring national institutions that generate pride and creativity. The rulers of a newly liberated India had a dream. They established institutions like the Indian Institute of Advanced Study in Shimla at the erstwhile Viceregal Lodge. The building should have been conserved; the institute should have drawn the best and the brightest from across the world. But it seems that the government just does not comprehend its inherent value.

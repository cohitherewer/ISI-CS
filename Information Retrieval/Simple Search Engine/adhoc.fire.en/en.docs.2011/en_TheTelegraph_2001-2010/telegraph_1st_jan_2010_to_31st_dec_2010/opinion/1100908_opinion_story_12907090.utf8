                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SING THE TUNE                                                    
	Reality and perception are two terms linked in a complex and often ambiguous relationship. In an ideal world, perception should always mirror reality. Unfortunately, in actuality, perception can be far away from reality or can even be a distortion of it. Most prejudiced critics of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, believe that he is not on top of things as Indias head of government. They point to the general perception of him as weak and dithering, not firm and articulate enough. The reality, however, is completely different. Mr Singh, both as finance minister and as prime minister, has taken some of the most significant and courageous decisions in the history of independent India. At the level of policy, he masterminded the liberalization of the Indian economy; he steered the Indo-US nuclear deal and thus put Indias relationship with the worlds most powerful nation on a different register. At the level of tactics, he chose to break with the left parties. All these are important pieces of evidence to show that Mr Singhs performance is far removed from the common perception of him. In fact, the perception is a distortion of the reality. One factor in the distortion is the insufficient attention drawn by the prime ministers office to his achievements. To be fair, this is related to Mr Singhs personality. He prefers to work than to seek publicity. But he must accept that he is in the political arena and, in politics, perception is a critical factor. This is the reality of a political career from which he cannot afford to shy away. It is thus to be welcomed that Mr Singh met members of the media on Monday to answer their queries and to clarify their doubts. The common perceptions about him were forced to retreat when faced with the clarity and firmness of Mr Singhs mind.        
	This meeting could begin the process of enhancing the prime ministers image as a leader and thus changing the perceptions about him. But to speed up the process, the prime minister must be seen to act swiftly and decisively on crucial matters. The corruption and inefficiency that shroud the Commonwealth Games demand that those accountable be made responsible. Similarly, many issues in education and environment need Mr Singhs steering hand. The more proactive Mr Singh is seen to be, the quicker will be the convergence between the reality of his premiership and perceptions of it.

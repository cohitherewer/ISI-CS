The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Cover her face 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        COVER HER FACE                                   GWYNNE DYER                              
	Monkey see, monkey do. Soon after Frances National Assembly passed a law making it illegal to wear a full-face veil in public, Philip Hollobone, a British MP, announced a private members bill that would make it illegal for people to cover their faces in public in Britain. Neither bill mentioned Muslims by name.        
	Hollobone has previously called the Islamic veil offensive and against the British way of life, so we may safely assume that his bill is not aimed at people wearing motorcycle helmets. We can also assume that it will never become law, for British immigration minister, Damian Green, immediately replied that telling people what they can and cant wear, if theyre just walking down the street, is a rather un-British thing to do.        
	The last thing anybody needs is for another major European state to copy the French initiative. But it cannot be denied that many Europeans feel profoundly uneasy when they see these shrouded, masked women moving silently in their midst.        
	The veil is not Islamic at all. It pre-dates all the Abrahamic religions. They all come from the Middle East, and thats why they all  Jews, Christians and Muslims  used to be obsessed with female modesty. The principle of modesty was a way of controlling the behaviour of women who had the power to upset the social order, so how poor women behaved didnt matter. The early Mesopotamian laws ordaining the veiling of women applied only to the wives of powerful men. Several thousand years later, Greek, Roman and Byzantine upper-class women still went veiled, while their poorer sisters moved freely with their faces uncovered. We cannot know what proportion of women in pre-Islamic Arabia went veiled, but until quite recently poorer and rural Arabian women covered their hair but otherwise went unveiled. It seems safe to assume that the situation was not much different in the Prophets time.                
	Historic battle        
	I do not presume to interpret the Quran, but its injunctions on veiling were simply an endorsement of existing social customs. I would also observe that most Muslim communities through history have interpreted these customs as requiring the concealment of a womans hair but not her face. So why have women from non-rich Muslim families in European cities now taken to wearing full-face veils or burqas?         
	One reason is fear; the majority societys values are so seductive that good Muslims must be isolated from it. This also explains why you see girls as young as two or three wearing hijabs in Paris and London: their parents believe that the habit must start early if it is to withstand the majority societys influence. A second reason is defiance: think of it as a non-gay version of were out and were proud. Get used to it. Both anecdotal evidence and personal observation suggest to me that a large proportion of the fully veiled women in Britain are recent converts to Islam who grew up in the dominant post-Christian culture. Converts often get carried away.        
	So which part of this is a threat to public order? Why did a law banning the full veil pass through the French parliament without opposition, whereas a similar bill will never reach the floor of the House of Commons? Not because the French are more anti-Muslim than the British, but because they are the heirs of one of the great battles between religion and the secular state. Britain hasnt seen such a battle since the 17th century, and the official religion just gradually retreated to the sidelines of modern life. The fight was long, bitter and more recent in France, so the French state takes public displays of religious allegiance far more seriously. But it is still behaving stupidly. And what about Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland, where similar bans have been discussed? They should be ashamed of themselves.

	Awful end                  
	Sir  The dismal performance of the Indian cricket team in the Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies can be attributed to the fact that some of the teams leading players were worn out, thanks to the curse of the IPL (Cup of hangover brims over, May 13). The Indian Premier League is a commercial event in which glitz and glamour are more important than results. A world cup, on the other hand, is solely about results. Forced to play the world cup a few days after the conclusion of the IPL ,the Indians found competitive cricket beyond their calling. India also seems to have lost the edge in their pace attack. Resorting to open the bowling with a spinner was out of compulsion rather than strategy. First, the Aussies decimated India. Next came the Windies with their rising deliveries, something Indian batsmen failed to negotiate properly. Cricket has always been about pace, and no team can hope to do well by trying to evade it.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  India got knocked out of the T20 World Cup after two successive losses against Australia and the West Indies in the Super Eight stage. The stories of both the matches were similar. Indias famed batsmen failed to do well against the short-pitched deliveries on the bouncy track in Barbados. Indian batsmen ran short of ideas, and did not possess the technique to handle bouncers. Only Rohit Sharma did well against the Australians. Against the West Indies, not a single Indian batsman managed to cross the 40-run mark. The fielding was equally dismal. Several batsmen like Gautam Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan, Yuvraj Singh and Ravindra Jadeja failed to make a mark. It is high time that the selectors dropped Singh, Pathan and Jadeja. Those who compare Singh with Sir Garfield Sobers and Gambhir and Suresh Raina with Sourav Ganguly and David Gower, respectively, must be joking. The captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, is not a cricketing guru, but an advertisement one. Too much cricket and fun and frolic have destroyed the Indian team. The Australians came to the world cup having rested their minds and bodies. The Indians, however, looked exhausted both mentally and physically. Virender Sehwags absence dealt a body blow to the side. As a cricket-lover, I shudder to think what will happen to Indian cricket after the retirement of Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Sachin Tendulkar.           
	Yours faithfully,         Tapan Das Gupta, Burdwan             
	Sir  Indias early exit from the T20 world cup has been discussed at length. The teams over-dependence on Yuvraj Singh is the main reason behind the failure. In the match against Sri Lanka, Singh failed to accelerate the run-rate, and that cost India a place in the semi-final. There is some talk that M.S. Dhoni should have opted to bat first after he won the toss in the two previous games. But one saw what happened to Sri Lanka when they decided to bat first in their semi-final against England.           
	After the defeat, there have been suggestions to remove Dhoni as the captain. But stripping Dhoni of captaincy will undo the good work that he has done for the team. The only mistake he made was when he admitted the teams mistakes in public. Dhoni has been a good and polite speaker all this while. His outburst can be put down as an angry response to the teams shocking performance. Dhoni has won many laurels for India, and will continue to do so unless the cricket board removes him from his post. The veterans who are criticizing Dhoni are actually harming the prospects of Indian cricket. India used to get thrashed during their time. They seem to be upset because Indians have started to win most of the matches they now play.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Indians should be grateful for their teams crushing defeat in the T20 world cup. Had the team done well, state governments would have showered their respective cricketers with money and gifts, resulting in a huge loss to the public exchequer. Affluence makes human beings, including cricketers, insensitive to their duties and responsibilities. The Indian coach, Gary Kirsten, was right when he reasoned that problems related to attitude and fitness were the major factors that contributed to the debacle. The Board of Control for Cricket in India is also in the habit of doling out cash-awards to its cricketers after every win. It should now put in place a policy of imposing heavy fines on irresponsible cricketers.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The staging of the IPL just before the T20 championship cost India dearly. The Indian team failed to register a single victory in the Super Eight stage. Neither did the team play a single practice match before the competition. M.S. Dhoni refused to blame the IPL for the teams dismal performance, but conceded that post-match parties and hectic travel during the glitzy league did take a toll on the players fitness. The IPL is doing nothing except making rich cricketers even richer. The BCCI must take responsibility for the teams poor performance and disband the selection committee for picking cricketers who were chosen not on the basis of their current form but on past performance. Will the BCCI stop encouraging the IPL? If Indian players are only interested in money, then one can never build a good national team.           
	Yours faithfully,

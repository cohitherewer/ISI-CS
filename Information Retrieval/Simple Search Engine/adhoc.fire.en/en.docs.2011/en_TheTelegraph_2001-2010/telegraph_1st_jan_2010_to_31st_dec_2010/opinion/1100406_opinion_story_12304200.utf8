	Running an administration is not about pleasing allies or upsetting foes. It is about doing what is right and necessary. But that is often expecting too much of Indian politicians. The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, has repeatedly proved that he has a different approach to his job. He showed it again during his visit to West Bengal. In all he said and did during the visit, he made one thing clear  his priorities were administrative and not political. It is no surprise, therefore, that his approach upset both Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee. He did not mince words while criticizing the failures of the state administration in fighting the Maoists and in ending political clashes. Ms Banerjee was upset that Mr Chidambaram was not harsh enough on the chief minister. He also left leaders of his own party, the Congress, unhappy for not visiting some places in Burdwan district where Marxist cadre are said to be harassing activists of the opposition parties. Even on the Maoists, Mr Chidambaram spelt out his strategy in unambiguous terms. The fight would be hard and long, but the Centre would not flinch from doing what is necessary. Given the confusions among the political class and the administrative inefficiency that shackles the anti-Maoist campaign, this clarity and firmness should be reassuring.        
	Mr Chidambarams visit sends out several messages to both the ruling and opposition parties in the state. The most important message, of course, is that the administration cannot be allowed to play second fiddle to the politics of the day. While he did not spare the chief minister for his failings, he made it clear to Ms Banerjee that the Centre cannot interfere with the states constitutional right over law and order. In fact, his reiteration of New Delhis commitment to fight the Maoists shows his anxiety to help the state in this. The other message is that political rivalries cannot be the reason for a confrontation or non-cooperation between the Centre and a state government. Similarly, the compulsion of pleasing a political ally, as Ms Banerjee is to the Congress, cannot be the basis for administrative decisions. It may be in Ms Banerjees partisan interest to try and see that Union ministers do not attend even development-related programmes in West Bengal. But that is not in the states interest. More important, it is against the spirit of the Constitution.

	The concert presented by the Kolkata Konsort at St Johns Church on February 6 was organized in aid of Udayan  the home for children whose parents have been afflicted with leprosy. Many of these children were present in the audience on the day of the concert.        
	The evening began with two songs that were sung by James Stevens: Oscar Rasbachs familiar Trees and The Bells of San Marie by John Ireland. Over the years, the rich timbre of this rare baritone has lost none of its depth and power. With perfect intonation and effortless phrasing, the performance set the tone for the delightful programme. Stevens was accompanied by Sudeep Pande.        
	The young Alistair Braganza played Beethovens Sonata in E Major Allegro, Allegretto,Rondo  followed by the Ostinato by Bartk. This was a commendable performance of two difficult works, despite the fractious and ancient upright that put up a formidable resistance throughout the entire evening.        
	Sudeep Pande, whom it is our privilege to hear when he comes down from the hills in Darjeeling, sang the Aria, If With all Your Hearts, from Elijah by Mendelssohn, Ill Walk with God by Brodsky from The Student Prince, Serenata by Toselli and Over the Rainbow from the film, The Wizard of Oz. The purity of Pandes tenor voice, its wide range, control of dynamics and excellent projection were, as always, a pleasure to listen to.        
	Hindol Shah brought the first part of the evening to a close with the violin solo, Tambourin, by Gossec. Moving seamlessly into the second part of the programme, without the interruption of an interval, was James Stevens who sang four well known American spirituals. They included Go Down Moses, Joshua, Nobody Knows The Trouble Ive Seen and, finally, the haunting but melodic Lord of the Dance by Sydney Carter. In this, he was joined by the young children of Udayan. There was something wonderfully exhilarating about this particular rendition, an element of joyful spontaneity accompanied by the magic of a gifted voice.        
	Shah, once again, gave us a violin interlude: this time, it was Andaluza by Granados. After that, Pande brought this very special evening to a close with three contrasting offerings  Puccinis O Mio Babbino Caro in a surprisingly clear contra tenor; The Holy City was sung as it should be, with a highly spirited accompaniment by Conrad Matthews; and Malottes beautiful and solemn The Lords Prayer.        
	Hopefully, the audience appreciated the performances and supported the cause for which the concert took place. One wishes for many more such concerts that will surely enhance the spirit of this city.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Two stories about two evils
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TWO STORIES ABOUT TWO EVILS                              Ananda Lal      Theatre                                                
	Pakistan featured significantly at Nandikars National Theatre Festival, as one Urdu play from India about Partition and another from Karachi protested against inter-faith hatred and war, respectively. Nandikar had dedicated this festival to the memory of Habib Tanvir, whose Naya Theatre (Bhopal) staged three productions, but only one was new: Asghar Wajahats Jis Lahore Nahi Dekhya Wo Janmaya Hi Nahi, which Tanvir had originally directed for Shri Ram Centres Repertory in 1990.         
	This poignant, straightforward treatment of the exchange of houses in Punjab had moved audiences at that time, and Naya Theatres revival continues to do that. An Indian Muslim family arrives in Lahore to find a huge haveli allotted to them, but it contains a problem  an old Hindu lady still lives there, left behind by her son who has migrated to Delhi. At first, the new inhabitants resent her and try to convince her to go (picture), but she endears herself and eventually becomes one of them, so much so that when she dies, they and the other Muslims of the locality arrange to cremate her, resulting in a riot instigated by those opposed to it.Tanvir planned this as a regular urban drama, consequently not employing his experienced Chhattisgarhi support system. Instead, his Bhopal actors step into those shoes admirably, led by Flora Bose as the loveable Punjabi-speaking mother who wins everyone over in the scene where she lights lamps to celebrate Diwali and goes out to distribute sweets made by her to all in the neighbourhood. As the prime antagonist, a fundamentalist, Ramchandra Singh scares us with his malevolence.         
	Disappointingly, Tehrik-e-Niswan failed to impress with Zikr-e-Nashunida, a collaboration scripted and directed by Prasanna Ramaswamy of Chennai, and translated from English by Anwer Jafri of the Karachi group. Ramaswamy had the bright idea of setting her anti-war scenario, ironically, within a seminar on peace, to show how most conferences achieve nothing concrete, but she couldnt develop it dramatically or theatrically. The participants connect Euripides classic tragedy, The Trojan Women, which they have seen during the seminar, to the plight of women in wars. It just does not work. Ramaswamy turns Euripides fiercest attack on war into an insipid litany of weeping and wailing that sounds like a bunch of starved banshees. Only the episode about the My Lai massacre in Vietnam hits us, while the conflict in Sri Lanka is forgotten. The choreography, too, looks terribly amateurish to have come from an expert dancer like Sheema Kermani.

Jayal                                                      
	It is with trepidation that one opens the morning newspapers these days or tunes into the electronic media, for fear of being exposed to further news of damage to the revered institution of our armed forces. An institution that upheld the honour and integrity of the country, not only through wars and combating insurgencies in different parts of the country, but also in providing relief during natural calamities and international peace-keeping operations with the United Nations.         
	On the morning of Diwali, even as this newspaper published extracts of the sombre interview of the chief of army staff expressing anguish at the damage to the institution of the army resulting from the Adarsh Housing Society episode, another newspaper broke the news of a scandal involving the air force and naval housing board with an erstwhile naval chief being named. The nation must wonder how many more skeletons lie buried. If they can let down the men and women they command then letting the country down is but a small incremental step.         
	The bigger danger is to those of our serving men and women on whose shoulders rests the responsibility of keeping our future secure. How are they to differentiate between commanders to be respected and those to be shunned? And when the moment of reckoning comes, could this fleeting doubt make a difference between obeying a lawful command blindly or pausing to reflect? These are harsh questions, but in the context of the unimpeachable integrity expected of our armed forces, they need to be posed.        
	While it is not the writers case to pass judgment on those that are being named in various exposs, it is to the wider damage to the very fabric of our armed forces and their morale that our attention must be drawn. After all, the vital ingredient of a potent fighting force is morale, which is not born out of any magic potion that commanders can administer but out of the unshakeable trust and resulting bond between the leaders and the led. Morale is high when commanders enjoy the blind confidence of the men they command. Good commanders can feel the morale of their troops in their bones  as morale is not displayed on uniform sleeves.        
	If today there is a perception among many commentators and including this writer about the profound impact of all this adverse publicity on the morale of the armed forces, it is amply justified. The reality is that whilst most of us have the luxury of watching this drama unfold from our drawing rooms and to indulge in sterile debate, to those of our forces that are manning our borders, skies and oceans it is a question of whether the larger commitment to the cause for which they are risking their life and limb daily is real or hollow.        
	There are three distinct facets of life in our armed forces. The first relates to our field formations, on which rests the war-fighting capability of the nation. It is here that the officers work and train to become true leaders through baptism by fire and it is here that, in peace and war, our young soldiers and officers are giving their youth so that the nation may get on with its life. In the bargain, unsung martyrs are born daily. For them there is no breaking news and no obituary. They and their families are left to mourn in silent dignity and to face an uncertain future. Significantly, this is also where the armed forces remain cocooned from the civil side of national governance and hence uncorrupted by its rapid degeneration. Having had the privilege to command such a body of men and women, this writer can predict confidently that they will remain so, no matter where our decaying governance or politics takes us. To that extent the nation can heave a sigh of relief.        
	There is, though, another variant of this facet when the armed forces are called upon to aid civil authority, as has happened for over six decades in the various states of the Northeast and for over a decade in Jammu and Kashmir. Here, not only are these field formations exposed to the politics of the states and the civil administration, but they are sometimes even made targets of the very governments whose chestnuts they have been called upon to pull out of the fire. In such situations, the armed forces find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Of late, state governments in both Manipur and Jammu and Kashmir have targeted the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, painting it to be something that the armed forces use to abuse human rights. The lawmakers who have enacted the law, and the government that implements the law, have failed to dispel this motivated notion, remaining ambivalent. It has been left to the service chiefs to defend what legitimately should have been the task of the government. It is the right of civil governments in a democracy to exercise full authority over the armed forces, but this carries with it an obligation to keep them insulated from politics. Failing to do so and sitting on the fence on critical issues bode ill for both our democracy and the institution of the armed forces.        
	This brings us to the third facet, which is the management of the armed forces at the command and service headquarters level and their interface with the various ministries and departments of the government, the bureaucracy and the political leadership. It is here that the foundation of years of leadership and training in the field is either built on or shattered. When exposed to the unfettered power of a bureaucracy without accountability, the lack of understanding and the indifference of the political leadership to all things military and to the sheer power of patronage within the system, many a potential senior service leader falls prey. The short-term benefits to their careers, postings, promotions and, in some cases, even financial or post-retirement opportunities are far too tempting to let go of. Thus an unholy nexus is created at variance with the fabric of the institution of the armed forces. The Adarsh episode is a clear example of this.         
	This is by no means a new phenomenon. For decades now, promotions to higher ranks and to commanders and chiefs have been subject to both political and bureaucratic patronage, as is well known in the corridors of the service headquarters. Rules have been manipulated and various tricks used to benefit the privileged and pull down the deserving. In some cases, chiefs who were themselves beneficiaries of this munificence are co-opted to perpetuate this injustice. That the service takes it in its stride and continues to perform merely substantiates what has earlier been said about our field formations. But this dichotomy cannot last forever, especially in the present information age. The cracks are now beginning to show and, as the recent series of scandals indicate, they are by no means hairline, they are crevasses.         
	In the past, every instance of wrongdoing at the highest levels of the armed forces has drawn instant notice, debate and retribution in keeping with the special acts that apply to the respective armed forces. While this is necessary and keeps the institution of the armed forces on its toes and holds it accountable, the other systemic institutional weaknesses and lapses are simply glossed over. So, after Tehelka, the only people punished were those in uniform, with all others remaining untouched. Today, all eyes are on the army and its chief. Where, one wonders, is the ministry of defence, which is directly responsible for the director-general of defence estates, whose officers are also within the Adarsh net and perhaps the brain behind it? It is these double standards that are not lost on those serving in uniform.         
	The truth, however, is that the way our higher defence organization is structured, in every important area, from procurement to promotions and postings of senior officers, the authority rests with the ministry of defence and not with the service headquarters. There is thus a strong motivation to maintain status quo, and that is why the integration of service headquarters with the ministry of defence, a long overdue reform and one recommended by the Kargil review committee continues to be resisted. After all, exercising unfettered authority over the armed forces with no corresponding accountability is too attractive an incentive to surrender.              
	Now that there is suspicion that many of our very senior armed forces officers have conducted themselves in a manner not befitting the positions that they hold, the nation must ask how such people were able to reach the pinnacle of their careers, where the promotional pyramid is not only steep but competition extremely tough? Indeed, how many more are there whose misdeeds lie unexposed? What role did institutions other than the armed forces  namely, the ministry of defence, the intelligence bureau and the cabinet committee on appointments  play in failing to be diligent, and were these merely errors of omission or of commission as well? What are the organizational weaknesses that have allowed such fatal lapses in the security of the nation to take place and, importantly, what must be the institutional lessons learnt?         
	If allegations of severe wrongdoing for personal gain can be laid at the doors of chiefs and commanders who were serving, then no time can be lost in cleaning the Augean stables. The nation is at the end of its tether and people are owed an assurance. At the level of individual service, this can be done best by each service conducting a self-cleansing exercise, including those high-ranking veterans whose integrity has been the subject of whispering campaigns. At the national level, this writer can only repeat what was recommended in these columns earlier (Through thick and thin, The Telegraph, June 3, 2009): setting up a blue ribbon commission not just to find answers to the vexed questions asked above, but to that of where the nation wants to peg the institution of its armed forces.       The author is a retired air marshal of the Indian Air Force

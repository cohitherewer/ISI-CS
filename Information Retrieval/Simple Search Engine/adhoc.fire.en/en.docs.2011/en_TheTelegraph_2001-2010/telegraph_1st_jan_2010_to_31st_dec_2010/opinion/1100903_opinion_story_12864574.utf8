	Green signal                  
	Sir  The Union minister for environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh, has won the support and approval of all nature lovers. The environment ministry recently denied forest clearance to the Vedanta Groups mining project, which proposed to convert a large area of forest land in the Niyamgiri hills into a bauxite mine to feed its refineries (Jairam smiles and stings Vedanta, Aug 25). Apart from environmental concerns, Ramesh seems to have acted in the interests of the Dongria Kondh tribe, who are the traditional inhabitants of this region.           
	Not long ago, the ministry denied clearance to the Athirapally power project in Kerala. It also resisted the construction of a new airport in Navi Mumbai since it would involve diverting two rivers and having a hill blasted. Ramesh has proved that he will not let multinationals and big corporate concerns exploit natural resources in the name of development. The prime minister should support him in this endeavour.          
	Yours faithfully,         Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad               
	Sir  It is heartening to see that the Central government is taking steps to curb environmental degradation. Vedantas attempt to mine forest lands for bauxite in Orissa has been nipped in the bud. Jairam Ramesh and his ministry should follow the same policy with other industries as well. The neglect of environmental norms has led to the green cover in the country shrinking drastically.           
	There are other forms of environmental exploitation as well. In West Bengal, for instance, water bodies have been filled up to make room for industrial hubs and residential complexes. In the long term, this may prove to be disastrous for the marine ecology in the region. One hopes that the Centres decision to ban mining in the Niyamgiri hills is part of a genuine effort to save the environment and not just a political gimmick.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Alarm bells          
	Sir  In a recent incident, six spotted deer died of suffocation while being transported to the Sunderbans from Parmadan Deer Park (Food for tigers, deer fall prey to negligence, Aug 20). The dead animals were part of a group of 25. In response to this, the principal chief conservator said that a 20 per cent casualty rate was not alarming. The forest secretary also held that the incident was not very serious. No doubt, the welfare of such animals is irrelevant, considering the fact that they were being sent as food for tigers or would have fallen prey to poachers. However, the translocation should not have been carried out in such an inept manner.          
	According to forest officials, There is a dearth of food for the big cats because of rampant poaching. But the forest department seems powerless to address the situation. The natural food of tigers comprises three of the most prolific breeders. But even their numbers are dwindling. Presumably, since poaching cannot be controlled, an infinite number of deer is to be supplied to satisfy the appetites of poachers as well as tigers. Instead of translocating animals, the forest department should tackle the actual problem  poaching.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	For a price          
	Sir  As the editorial, A paying profession (Aug 22), observes, members of parliament make a fortune. After the three-fold increase in their salaries, they will make even more money. They will earn about Rs 60 lakh a year, including perks, and the whole amount will be tax-free. The figure does not even take into account other, less official, sources of income.           
	For most, politics serves as a platform for self-aggrandizement. The welfare of the people is not a major concern. The editorial rightly observes that the educated unemployed of India now have a viable career option. One wishes that more youth would join politics to work for the nations growth rather than to make money. Moreover, politicians should be made accountable and people should be given the right to recall the corrupt and the inefficient.           
	Yours faithfully,       
N.R. Ramachandran, Ooty

                
	Sir  The MPs demands for a salary hike have attained ridiculous proportions. Not content with a three-fold increase, they have been agitating for their current salary to be increased five-fold (Some members not happy, want more, Aug 21). This is tantamount to looting the nation, which is already groaning under heavy expenditure. The amounts spent on the Commonwealth Games, the crores lost in successive railway accidents, the sums needed to tackle the Leh disaster and the Maoist problem have brought about a severe strain on the exchequer. Unlike those who live in poverty, financial security is not a pressing problem for most MPs. They are also entitled to perks and privileges that the common man can only dream of. When it is a matter of their own interests, the MPs are quick to table a bill in Parliament and get it passed. Other, more urgent matters, however, take much longer. A reasonable salary hike might be needed, given the spiralling prices. But such a dramatic hike is beyond comprehension.           
	Yours faithfully,

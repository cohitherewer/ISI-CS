                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SHUT OUT FROM THE NATION                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                                    
	It is Republic Day and one retreats to 1950 when India became a republic and was moulded and fine-tuned by men and women who had a dream; a dream to create, nurture and bring to maturity a fledgling nation state that had been exploited by invading armies and colonial masters for centuries. Bharat was an ancient civilization and India was the contemporary extension of that plural and complex human and cultural mosaic. In 2010, one wonders why the dream lies mutilated, and the larger composite culture brutalized. Why did Indians themselves destroy their freedom and liberation? Why did we fail as a people yearning for dignity and civil society? 
    
	Our leaders have become insular and callous, our decision-making, thoughtless. Slogans of aam aadmi and garibi hatao, both potent and populist by nature, have been misused by politicians, and Indians feel let down and humiliated by the fact that an attempt to keep the many promises was not made. As the decades rolled on, elected leaders operated the system like small-time feudal potentates had done in the past, but this time without a territory and with no concern for their land and people.   
	They were stakeholders without a stake in what they ruled. They settled into the comfort of being surrounded by administrators, who led them to believe that a good idea could not be implemented because of some silly rule. At Independence, the bureaucracy retained regulations that undermined the native and the Indian civil service did not change that attitude.                 
	Change places        
	This week, when Delhi was fogbound, international and national flights could neither land nor take-off till the sun appeared in the morning. The backlog mounted and the delays were long and tedious. Earlier, on December 21, the skies cleared at 10 a.m. and at 10.30 a.m.  just after some flights were cleared for take-off  the government, in its supreme wisdom, shut the airport arbitrarily because it needed to rehearse the ceremonial air show for the parade on Republic Day.         
	A rehearsal at the cost of tax-paying voters who were held captive at the airport without an honest explanation, all for some unnecessary and hugely expensive ceremonial display that makes a mockery of the reality on the ground. The army, the ministry of defence and the civil aviation authority are responsible for this kind of dictatorial, unthinking decision that smacks of disrespect for the citizen who lives at their mercy.         
	Other countries have ceremonial occasions, but they do not administer them in a careless manner. In India, the babu needs to be radically retrained. The complete disconnect among the political and administrative class with India and its people is beginning to pall. The exploitation of goodwill and patience is unacceptable, and is becoming untenable.The truth is dismal and the cracks in the system are dangerous. But what is truly scary is the inability of the top leaders to see what is happening in their name around them. If the prime minister and his colleagues were to spend one week as normal, law-abiding citizens, they would be appalled at the manner in which governance has been ruined. It would be sheer joy to interview them thereafter on national television.         
	Their flashy motorcades removing ordinary people from view, the clearing of roads for their vehicles to pass by pushing pedestrians towards open gutters and uncovered manholes, the corrupt representatives of law-and- order; each of these reflects the worst feudal norms. Indians long for the day when leaders in Delhi will conduct themselves with dignity and integrity, essential hallmarks of good, tall leaders, and set the standards that are sorely missing in the public domain today.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FOR THE NATIONS SAKE                                                          
	The arrangements for the Commonwealth Games are in a mess. There is no polite way of saying this. But those responsible for making the arrangements have not been pulled up and held responsible for dereliction of duty, which has culminated in a national disgrace. In a cabinet meeting on Friday, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, ticked off the sports minister, M.S. Gill, by reminding him that the time for making presentations was long past. What was required was hard work. But is this enough? Mr Gill is a member of Mr Singhs government and one of the persons responsible for ensuring that the infrastructure and the arrangements for the Commonwealth Games are in place. He has failed to do this. He should be asked to go for his incompetence and the embarrassment that this has caused. Mr Gill may not be directly responsible for the various acts of omission and commission but as the minister he carries the can and he should be made an example of. A reprimand in camera carries little weight as a public gesture.        
	The all-too-familiar excuse that action cannot be taken against an erring minister because he belongs to a coalition partner does not work in the case of Mr Gill. The prime minister has expressed his concern, anguish and anger in private to Mr Gill. It is incomprehensible why he cannot articulate similar sentiments in public against a colleague who has failed in his duty. India expects its prime minister to speak for the nation. It does not expect the prime minister to shield a colleague who is in the wrong. It is clear that the prime minister and his team are now into damage control and are monitoring the preparations for the Games. This should have been complemented by a stronger position against the minister concerned and the responsible officials. The prime minister had little to lose. He would have won the nations applause if he had been seen to hold a minister responsible for his failures, especially failures that have seriously tarnished the image of India.        
	Mr Singh is known to be a mild man who is not given to outbursts of temper and emotion. This is undoubtedly one of his strengths. But these very qualities often make him appear to be too meek, even weak. Yet, when he deems it fit, he can be assertive and even acerbic. Witness his dismissal of the Left over the Indo-US nuclear deal. The arrangements for the Commonwealth Games and the national embarrassment that has ensued presented an occasion that demanded similar firmness from the prime minister. What is at stake here is the image and the prestige of the entire country. The prime minister can boost his own image and that of the nation he leads by being more assertive and articulate about issues that excite the nations attention. It is still not too late for the prime minister to convey that he is in charge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Hard landing
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HARD LANDING                                                    
	No entrepreneur would like to invest and be damned. It must have taken Infosys a lot of courage to decide to set up its global software development centre in the New Town area on the eastern fringe of Calcutta. For several years, the West Bengal government has been pleading with the firm to invest in the state. But the area where a plot of land has finally been allotted to Infosys is, literally, a nowhere land. It has no roads, no power, no water supply or anything else that could pass for even the semblance of an infrastructure. On the contrary, the political tussle over land acquisition in the area makes it a particularly difficult destination for investors. Other firms like Wipro that had braved the odds and decided to venture into the area face the same bleak landscape. The state government gloats over every new announcement of an investment in the area as a major triumph of its investor-friendly policies. But the complete lack of infrastructure makes such claims laughable and exposes the governments pathetic inability to honour its own commitments. The government does not seem to have learnt any lessons from the mistakes it had made at the industrial sector in Salt Lake, where the potholed roads go under water during the rains and the vehicular traffic remains messy throughout the year.        
	At the heart of the mess in Salt Lake and in the Rajarhat-New Town area is West Bengals leftist rulers confused approach to both urban planning and governance. Politics, rather than the economics of development, was at the centre of their development strategies for a long time. They had been busy for far too long with polemical issues to take care of basic amenities like roads, power and water supply. The political slant has made the administration too incapable of putting a delivery mechanism in place. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seems to be genuinely interested in opening the doors to new industries and investments. But his enthusiasm has not done much to change the mindset and work ethics of the administration. And, thanks to West Bengals obstructionist political culture, the Oppositions new belligerence has only added to the governments incompetence. The situation calls for more and more areas of infrastructure development to be privatized. A government that does not work can be the investors worst worry.

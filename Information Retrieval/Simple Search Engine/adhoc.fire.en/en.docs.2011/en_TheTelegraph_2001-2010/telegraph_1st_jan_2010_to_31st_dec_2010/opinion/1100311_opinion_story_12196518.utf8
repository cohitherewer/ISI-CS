                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BANKS CAPITAL                                                     
	Economic boycotts, blockades and divestment campaigns have been used as powerful weapons in the realm of international policy. Expect boycotts and blockades to be used by the Opposition in Parliament against the governments divestment, or rather, its proposal to reduce its stake in the State Bank of India through the State Bank of India (Amendment Bill) 2010, which was reintroduced on Monday. The United Progressive Alliance government originally introduced the bill in 2006, and this version is broadly along the same lines. The amendment seeks to reduce the governments shareholding in the SBI down to 51 per cent. Unlike with other public sector undertakings, the government does not intend to raise any proceeds for managing its fiscal deficit from this reduction in its stake in the SBI  the government currently holds 59.4 per cent  but is doing this to allow the SBI to raise capital from the markets, of anywhere between Rs 11,000 crore and Rs 15,000 crore. The SBI reportedly plans to raise Rs 40,000 crore over the next three years; the chairman, O.P. Bhatt, has talked of raising about Rs 20,000 crore through a rights issue in the next 18 months.         
	From a capital adequacy perspective, the SBI does not need the additional capital; but it does need the money for growth and expansion of its balance sheet. The dilution would also help the bank become more independent in appointing senior management personnel, and even give investors a bigger say in the management; anyone with Rs 5,000 worth of shares in the SBI can contest a directorship. But in the next decade, the SBI will continue to have a large government stake; the Reserve Bank of India uses the SBI to manage its foreign exchange reserves, and to manage its oil imports.         
	There is another possibility: for the government, reducing its stake in the SBI down to 51 per cent could be a trial balloon to test how greater reductions in its ownership of banks are likely to be received. Most opposition parties have steadfastly blocked this idea as exemplifying deeper financial sector reform; proponents of reform, on the other hand, want the government to reduce its stake to 40 per cent. And even in other public sector bank divestments, the government is unlikely to realize any money for its fiscal purposes. Already, the government has very little capital space in most public sector banks anyway; and the pursuit of fiscal consolidation will constrain the governments ability to provide more capital to the banks to continue growing. The opposition parties have too many blockades to manage; adding one more could prove counterproductive to their interests.

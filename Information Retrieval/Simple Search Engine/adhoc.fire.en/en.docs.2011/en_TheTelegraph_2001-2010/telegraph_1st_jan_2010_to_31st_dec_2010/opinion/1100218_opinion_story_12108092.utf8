The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | More than decoration
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MORE THAN DECORATION                                  YOUNG INDIA      The women of Dubrajpur are unusual in the way they combine tradition with individual talent                                                  
	There is something in the air of Dubrajpur that seems to make artists of its young women. Perhaps the strange landscape, where the twisted, ancient rocks of the Mama-Bhagne hillocks stand silently beside garbage-strewn roads, inspires them to create beauty out of the mundane. Or perhaps it is just the girls desire to have a life different from their predecessors that makes them spend the greater part of their energy on something more than housekeeping.        
	When the grandmother of young Sneha Ganeriwala  the daughter of Arun Ganeriwala, one of the leading Marwari businessmen of Dubrajpur  came to Dubrajpur from Kanpur after her marriage, there was no electricity in the locality. So she spent her married life in the light of lanterns and listened to jackals calls for entertainment. If Snehas studio today is lit by the glow of strategically placed electric bulbs, it is because much has changed in the intervening years, from the physical conditions of life to the mindset of those around her. Snehas mother, Usha Ganeriwala, got married the day her higher secondary results were announced. Marriage, and the resultant shift from her parental home in Burnpur to Dubrajpur, meant the end of studies for her. Unlike her mother, Sneha had the chance to opt for higher studies. She has done her post-graduation in English from Burdwan University, and reads Alberts History of English Literature for pleasure. She is also a budding artist who wants to make painting her profession.        
	It was not easy for Sneha to have her own way. She started painting while she was in Class V. The tutor who visited the household to give lessons in painting was originally meant for her brother. Sneha would look on wistfully during the sessions, and seeing her eagerness, the teacher invited her in. Her parents were not very enthusiastic initially, and feared that their daughters passion would pauperize them. She was asked to engage herself with something less dangerous, such as ceramics and pottery, as her elder sister, Sweety, who is now married in Berhampore, had done. (Sweety completed her MA in English after marriage.) To appease her alarmed parents, Sneha initially did copies of colourful Pre-Raphaelite paintings that could be safely hung on drawing-room walls without making anyone queasy. Then she had to make her parents understand that art is more than decoration. The success of Snehas persuasion is evident from the fact that she now has a studio of her own filled with canvases depicting tribal dancers, the local cobbler or a doe-eyed girl looking out of the window, beside the odd Kanha intent on his stolen butter.        
	The opportunities for exhibiting art are obviously limited in Dubrajpur. The painting process itself is affected by the difficulty of getting access to professional models. Sneha would have liked to live and work in Calcutta, but at the same time believes that Dubrajpur is preferable to any other place. She shares this rootedness with the Marwari men of Dubrajpur who keep coming back to this town to take up the family business no matter how many educational degrees they acquire. Such devotion to a small town like Dubrajpur might appear unusual but it is based on a realistic acknowledgment of the fact that it is the family business which allows the children to go in for expensive courses such as MBA or to indulge in costly hobbies such as painting.        
	If Sneha has stayed on in Dubrajpur, a few other girls have migrated to other places for higher studies. Nupur Chaudhuri, for instance, whose father is a businessman like Ganeriwala, is doing her MBA from a private institute in Calcutta. Her younger sister, Nisha, is into handloom weaving and textile designing, and plans to set up a boutique after she gets her degree from Visva-Bharati University. If the Marwari girls of Dubrajpur are doing well, the Bengali girls have also not been left behind. The only daughter of Moloy Mukherjee, who is a well-known advocate practising in Dubrajpur, is studying LLB. For the women, of course, the decision to leave or to stay on in Dubrajpur is determined by marriage. Sneha hopes that her future husband would be cooperative and allow her to continue painting. So fate, in the guise of the husband, will decide whether her studio would remain in Dubrajpur or be eventually shifted to a bigger city.        
	The Marwaris of Dubrajpur perceive themselves as a progressive group of people  progressiveness being demonstrated more in the way they treat their daughters than their sons. To prove that they have become more cultured with changing times, nowadays they allow their daughters to study, to work if they want, and even to marry according to their choice, although the last still exists as a possibility. These, they think, would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Even Snehas elder sister could not have dreamt of visiting remote corners of Birbhum to paint on field, and that too sometimes on a motorbike, as Sneha does.         
	The women are aware of their privileged position in a community generally known for its conservatism. So they lay stress on the importance of traditional values, such as the necessity of respecting their elders, of abiding by their husbands wishes, and of being the angel of the hearth in their marital homes, even while they pursue higher studies or professions of their choice. Is Young India aware that a few of its members, who live in an obscure town called Dubrajpur, have managed to strike that enviable balance between tradition and individual talent that is its professed ideal?                    ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

	Faith rules                  
	Sir  As Prabhat Patnaik points out, the Allahabad High Courts verdict on the land dispute in Ayodhya bestows legality on the claims of faith and beliefs (The Ayodhya judgment, Oct 12). But perhaps that is only to be expected in such a case like this.           
	A study of the judgment reveals that the deity, Ram, has been regarded not as a mythical figure but as a juristic person. The deity was made a party to a title suit. Under certain legal provisions, Ram was then treated as a minor, and represented by a next friend. Does this not belittle the revered god? Moreover, the court seems to have decided that the disputed site was the exact place of Rams birth.           
	Such a flawed judgment can only reduce peoples faith in the judiciary. It may also create a climate of hostility between religious communities. However, all responses to the verdict have been mature and restrained. The priorities of the common man evidently lie elsewhere now.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Fundamentalism, whether religious or political, can only be condemned. The demolition of the Babri Masjid was a heinous crime, an attempt to undo history by those who do not understand it. Prabhat Patnaiks arguments against the Ayodhya verdict, however, are flawed.          
	To begin with, Patnaik has tried to establish that facts are superior to faith. He seems to equate the latter with religion. But faith can also signify secular beliefs. Secularism and democracy thrive in India because the people have faith in such concepts. Indeed, this kind of faith may be the biggest driving force of our society.           
	Patnaik has also tried to delineate the role of the judiciary, asserting that it must adjudicate on the basis of facts and law alone. He does not seem to consider the reality that the judiciary, which plays an important role in society, must strike a fine balance between facts and sentiments and beliefs. The judges of the Allahabad High Court have done this admirably. They have made a genuine attempt to avoid a fractious judgment, biased in favour of any one community.          
	It is unfortunate that politicians have carved up India into minorities and a majority. However, most people have received the verdict with impressive restraint. This has thwarted any attempt by leaders to gain political mileage out of the situation. Most political parties have preferred to maintain a stoic silence. Only the beleaguered Left Front seems to think that the verdict does injustice to minorities.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Prabhat Patnaik criticizes the Ayodhya judgment, pointing out that the belief about the Babri Masjid site being Rams birthplace cannot be accepted as fact. There has to be independent and credible evidence on the basis of which alone a fact can be established, he says. It may be noted that there is nothing to prove Jesus Christs date of birth. Different scholars have different estimations. Nevertheless, faith dictates that a certain date be celebrated as the day of Christs birth. Faith cannot be ignored altogether. Very often, it seems truer than facts in the eyes of believers.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Prabhat Patnaik must be aware that any legal decision is based on several considerations, including customs, beliefs and the implications of the judgment for society as a whole. The judges who gave the verdict on Ayodhya had to take all these into account. Their judgment was delivered in the context of a particular society, where a matter of faith could not have been ignored. If the judgment is faulty, one can take recourse to a higher court.          
	The court had accepted the deity, Ram, as a party to the case long before the Babri Masjid demolition. This decision must have been prompted by various relevant concerns. Moreover, the judges took into account the facts put before them by the Archaeological Survey of India, which is considered to be independent and impartial. Their verdict, therefore, cannot be condemned as a retreat to pre-modernity.           
	Apprehensions of damage to the constitutional fabric and irreparable harm seem to be baseless. After all, the Constitution itself has been amended on several occasions in the interest of social harmony.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Parmanand Pathak, Patna

                
	Sir  Prabhat Patnaik criticizes the Ayodhya verdict for failing to distinguish between facts and faith. This failure signals a dangerous return to pre-modernity, he thinks. However, the Allahabad High Courts verdict was not based on faith alone. The judgment took into account a report submitted by the ASI. According to this report, excavations carried out in the disputed site have revealed the remains of a Hindu temple beneath the Babri structure. This must give Hindu parties to the dispute certain claims on the land, even if it cannot be established that a temple was demolished to build the mosque. The belief that the site was the birthplace of Ram does not make a material difference to this claim.           
	Criticizing the verdict may well endanger communal harmony. One must appeal to both communities involved to accept the verdict without considering it either as defeat or victory. National harmony and peace should be prioritized at all costs.           
	Yours faithfully,

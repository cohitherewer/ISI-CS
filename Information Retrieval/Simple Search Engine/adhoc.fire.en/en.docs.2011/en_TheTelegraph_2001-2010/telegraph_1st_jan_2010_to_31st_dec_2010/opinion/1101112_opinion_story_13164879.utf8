The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Generals vote
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GENERALS VOTE                                                    
	Only two major countries, China and Russia, hailed the elections in Myanmar as a big step forward. But then, one does not expect communist China or Vladimir Putins Russia to worry too much about democracy or free elections. The rest of the world saw them for what they were  the generals elections, which were, as Barack Obama put it during his visit to India, anything but free and fair. Everything that preceded the polls in Myanmar  the first in 20 years  had, however, indicated that they would be farcical. The way the military junta got a constitutional referendum passed in 2008 and all that it did in order to de-register Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy robbed the polls of any meaning. The only thing the polls were intended to do was legitimize the generals long reign and tighten their iron grip over every aspect of Myanmarese life. With the NLD boycotting the polls and the new constitutional provisions giving the army the power to sack a civilian government, there was little that the elections could do to change things in the country. Yet, what the world sees as a farce must have come as another tragedy for the people of Myanmar. Their desperate hope of a free life has been dashed yet again.        
	Two questions now loom large before both Myanmar and the free world. The long spell of Ms Suu Kyis house arrest is scheduled to be finally over this weekend. What course will she take if the junta releases her? Now that her party is de-recognized, she has to try other forms of popular mobilization. But the generals know of the power of her appeal to the countrys freedom-loving people and civil-society groups. What she does after her release and what the junta does to her could set off a new course for Myanmars struggle for freedom from an oppressive regime. The other question relates to what the world can do about Myanmar and is linked to the first one. Early last year, the Obama administration dramatically revised its policy by deciding to engage Myanmar, even while retaining the economic sanctions. The electoral farce may make it difficult for Mr Obama not to take a tougher policy on Myanmar. What the United States of America does can have an impact on how countries in the region react. For India, the events in Myanmar have troubling connotations, especially because it has become, for all practical purposes, a Chinese satellite.

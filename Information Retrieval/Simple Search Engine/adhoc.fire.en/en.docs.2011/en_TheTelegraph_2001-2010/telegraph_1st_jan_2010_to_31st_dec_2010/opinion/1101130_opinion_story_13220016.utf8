The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To stem the rot of corruption
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TO STEM THE ROT OF CORRUPTION                              Commentarao      S.L. Rao                          Changed, but not enough				                                             
	Faster and more inclusive growth has been blocked by the weakness of our governance  its institutions, systems and rules. This is reflected in the inefficiency in delivering services, corruption at all levels, the lack of accountability and severe punishment, the lack of specialization, and the hubris reflected in a blatant disregard of public opinion and media exposure.        
	Global Financial Integrity finds that since 1948, private companies and individuals illegally siphoned out of India $213 billion to evade taxes, which must have grown to at least $462 billion by 2008. These funds were gained from drug and human trafficking, corruption, fraud and currency counterfeiting. Both the earnings and the illegal remittances abroad were possible because the rule of law in India is slow and weak; further, every Central government has encouraged rules that allow black money to go abroad and return to make profit. Courts and regulatory institutions have minor penal powers in cases of corruption, and even those are rarely exercised. Neither corporate nor public governance is transparent. The media have not escaped corruption, as can be seen in paid news.        
	A vital source of corruption is the bureaucracy with its complicated procedures. The Economist in 2006 described the journey of a truck between Calcutta and Mumbai that took eight days, at an average speed of 11 kilometres per hour and 32 hours waiting at toll booths and check points. Doubtless, at each stage, money would change hands. Annual surveys of the ease of doing business rank India at 133 amongst 183 countries. It was also ranked 70 in the corruption index of 2006 and the worst performer out of 30 countries in the bribe payer index.         
	Before the economic liberalization that Rajiv Gandhi started in 1986 and which gained momentum under P.V. Narasimha Rao and his successors from 1991, Indian administrative red tape was notorious. It was created by a bureaucracy fixated on being non-accountable. The policy framework of controls imposed many restrictions  on imports, exports, on starting new businesses, technology imports and every industrial decision. Every decision was subject to government approval. The approval process during licence-permit raj provided many opportunities for bribery and corruption. The extortionate tax rates provided ample temptation to evade taxes. The red tape continues.         
	Poor foreign exchange allowances for foreign travel made many buy foreign currency on the hawala. Larger sums were kept illegally in accounts abroad or deposited overseas with friends and relatives or in Swiss and other safe haven banks. Under-invoicing of exports, over-invoicing of imports were common even among companies that normally frowned on illegalities. Rupee and foreign currency holdings in India, illegal accounts abroad, cheating on invoices and expense statements were normal. Little was done to enforce the law.         
	After 1986 and especially 1991, with de-licensing, lower tax rates, easier access to foreign exchange, and the use of information technology making minor violations difficult, corruption and black money as well as illegal rupee funds and foreign exchange held in India or abroad were expected to lessen. But they have actually increased, because the pickings in a growing economy with increasing government expenditures are much richer. Allowing anonymous investments in the stock market through participatory notes and exempting foreign institutional investments from short-term capital gains tax are policies that enable money to leave India by hawala, be invested, make a profit and return as clean money.         
	The government is the owner of many resources that are growing scarce. Land, mineral resources, and in the new age of technology, air waves and spectrum. The government also has the power to acquire land at lower than market prices and hand it over to private developers or industries. Price determination of resources like oil and gas, allocation of resources by exploitation of valuable minerals in forest and tribal lands, or allocation of spectrum offer new scope for corruption. Central and state governments decide on large purchases, such as defence equipment, railway engines and aeroplanes. The government spends its resources on physical and social infrastructure and social welfare schemes. These expenditures are new sources for politicians and bureaucrats to divert funds for personal use.        
	Along with this is the rise of criminals in politics. In 2009, 128 of the 543 members of parliament faced criminal charges, including 84 cases of murder, 17 cases of robbery, and 28 cases of theft and extortion. About a fifth of the representatives of the two major parties have been under investigation for criminal activity. The shamelessness of much of the theft of government funds by politicians and bureaucrats has grown.         
	Corruption takes place despite the many investigative agencies  the police, the Central vigilance commission, the comptroller and auditor general, the Central Bureau of Investigation, the enforcement directorate, lok ayuktas, apart from the judiciary and the media. Reasons lie in the lack of talent for investigation, poor follow-up, a cumbersome process of framing charges, getting government permission to prosecute bureaucrats and ministers, the slow judicial and appellate processes and the absence of severe punishment for the guilty.         
	All penalties for economic offences must be made much tougher and more rigid. Proven miscreants must face long jail sentences as deterrents. An independent tribunal must examine evidence and sanction within a time-frame the prosecution of bureaucrats and ministers. All bureaucrats must have a guaranteed minimum tenure in any office and an independent authority (not ministers or bureaucrats) must examine and sanction transfers. Ministerial discretion in decisions with possibility of profit must be taken by independent regulatory commissions  on licences, tariffs and so on  transparently and with reasons given.               
	Appointments to positions of executive directors in State-owned enterprises must be made through the public enterprises selection board, but its composition must be of eminent public personalities, and their choices must be respected. The membership of all independent regulatory and other bodies, as well as the selecting authorities, must also be transparent and not confined to retiring bureaucrats. Rules must be changed so that any government decision is attributable to one person, though advice and opinion might come from many. An independent authority must weigh the charges against officers and, if satisfied that there is prima facie evidence, recommend their suspension till a judicial trial. Participatory notes and exemptions from capital gains tax for investments from Mauritius must be phased out. The Election Commission must disqualify legislators if they lost appeals in high courts. No allowances must be paid to legislators when legislatures are prevented from functioning. The judiciary must come under a national judicial commission for their selection and accountability. Media content, especially television, must be overseen by a content authority as in the United Kingdom.

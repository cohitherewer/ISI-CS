	All the foreigners and about half the Ivorians agree that Alassane Ouattara won last months presidential election in Ivory Coast  but not the southerners, who say that it was their man, Laurent Gbagbo who did. So the election commission declared Ouattara the winner, and the constitutional council declared Gbagbo the winner.        
	Its been eight years now since Ivory Coast, once the richest country in West Africa, was divided. This election was supposed to end the division, but it has just perpetuated it. Maybe its time to accept that Ivory Coast is two countries, not one. Once the notion of dividing an African country in two was unthinkable. The basic rule of the old Organisation of African Unity was that former colonial borders must remain inviolable, since if they could be changed, there might be a generation of civil wars.        
	But there was a generation of civil wars anyway  in Nigeria, Angola, Ethiopia, to mention a few. There are far more ethnic groups in Africa than there are countries: some vie for dominance within the existing borders, while others simply want to secede and form their own countries.        
	There is also a religious split between mainly Muslim and predominantly Christian regions that extends right across the continent, but the dividing line runs through a number of countries, not between them. From Ivory Coast in West Africa to Sudan on the Red Sea, the north of every country is Muslim, and the south is Christian.        
	The ban on division was breaking down even before the OAU was replaced by the African Union in 2002. Eritreas secession from Ethiopia in 1993 was accepted by the OAU, although the subsequent secession of Somaliland and Puntland from Somalia has not received official blessing. And next month, southern Sudan will almost certainly secede from the rest of the country in a referendum overseen by the African Union.                
	Crippling problem        
	This is becoming almost commonplace  and maybe Ivory Coast is a suitable case for treatment. It enjoyed three decades of peace and prosperity under the rule of its first post-independence president, Felix Houphout-Boigny, but since his death in 1993, there has been almost continuous political upheaval. Finally, in 2002, rebel New Forces in the army seized control of the Muslim north and split the country.        
	It has remained split ever since, and there are some 8,000 United Nations peacekeepers in the country. But neither negotiations nor outside pressures have ended the division  and neither have elections.        
	Gbagbo is a Christian southerner, and he lost because there are a few hundred thousand more people in the Muslim north of the country. But he did control the constitutional court, which promptly declared that hundreds of thousands of northern votes were invalid, either because the voters in question were actually foreigners, or because they simply didnt exist. The African Union is trying very hard these days to ensure that electoral results are respected in Africa, so it has suspended Ivory Coasts membership until Ouattara is actually in power. Since Gbagbo still has the support of the army and controls the State television channel, it will be very hard to get him out.        
	Ivorian elections have long been troubled by the accusation that many voters in the north are not citizens. It does not matter who is right: southerners will always think they have been cheated if their candidate loses, while northerners will always insist that the vote was legitimate.        
	The problem has crippled Ivory Coast for almost 20 years, and it will not go away. Mercifully, the killing so far has only been in thousands, not in tens or hundreds of thousands. But if Ivorians cant resolve the current dispute quickly, it may be time to consider a divorce.

	A successful job application does not necessarily mean appointment. There is nothing unfair in this, as the Supreme Court explained while upholding an appeal made by the government of Orissa against a high court directive regarding the recruitment of junior clerks. The test conducted to fill a specific number of vacancies  a number that was increased between the initial advertisement and the conclusion of the selection process  resulted in a merit list. The state government then appointed candidates from the top of the merit list. Once the vacancies had been filled, some of those on the list who had not been accommodated complained to the state administrative tribunal, and then went to court on the basis of the tribunals favourable response. The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that being on the merit list, or on a panel that is made after tests and interviews, does not give anyone an absolute right to be appointed. That prerogative is the employers, whether a government or other. No court or tribunal can compel an employer to fill up vacancies, even if, for example, a lack of funds prevents selection or appointment.        
	There is nothing new in the general principle behind the courts statement. The system is old enough. But in a country where the numbers of the educated unemployed are overwhelmingly large, and where everyone is always on the lookout for discrimination, an issue such as this one is highly sensitive. For example, there may have been nothing wrong with the Orissa governments recruitment procedure, but the fact that the number of vacancies was increased from 15 to 33 during the selection procedure seemed to make it suspect. The number on the merit list or the panel always has to be greater than the number of vacancies, because the employer cannot risk another selection process if some of those selected do not join. The point, of course, is merit  if the best candidate does not join, the employer goes to the next best, and so on down the line. Perhaps a little more emphasis on this aspect of the selection procedure would have made things clearer, and more reassuring. The appointments, once the selection procedure has gone through the public route of advertisements, tests, and so on, cannot be arbitrary; to make that employers prerogative would undermine the rationale of the process and destroy fairness.

	No matter how politicians try to manipulate them, the people know a good government when they see one. Nitish Kumar may not have solved many of the problems that made Bihar one of the most backward states in India. But he initiated a change that none of his predecessors had even attempted with any degree of seriousness. The verdict in Bihar shows that the people not only approved of the beginnings he made during his first term in office but also overwhelmingly reposed their faith in his capacity to carry on the good work. His governments work on restoring law and order, spreading school education, empowering women and building roads made a big difference to the lives of the people. There are areas like power and irrigation that remain major problems for the states substantive economic makeover. But these are only blips in a big picture that shows Mr Kumar trying to change the rules of the game in Bihar. The results of the assembly polls reflect two big changes. It may be too early to see the Bihar verdict as the end of caste-based politics. But the results strongly suggest that caste alone may not define Bihars politics hereafter. The second message is more important  that Biharis care for good governance as much as people anywhere else. Leaders like Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan seem to be unaware of the changing aspirations of the people.        
	It is obvious that the alliance between Mr Kumars party, the Janata Dal (United), and the Bharatiya Janata Party had an electoral advantage over the divided opposition camp. But the vote in Bihar has interesting lessons for the BJP as well as for the Congress, the two principal national parties. The BJPs success seems to have had very little to do with its so-called Hindutva ideology. The party clearly rode on the back of Mr Kumars successes and popularity. He has made it clear to the BJP that he wants none of its communal cards. The way he shut Narendra Modi out of the poll campaign in Bihar showed how keen he was to keep the BJPs bigotry at bay. It is Mr Kumars inclusive politics, and not the BJPs sectarianism, that won the day in Bihar.         
	For the Congress, though, the message from Bihar is not so much about its ideology as about the running of the party. Since the days of Indira Gandhi, the Congress has been a party created, nurtured and run by the high command. The result is a gradual erosion of leadership at the state level. It is primarily the Central leaderships fault that the state leaders are not allowed to grow on their own even after they have been elected by the people. The complete rout of the Congress in Bihar should make the partys leaders rethink the way it is built and run in the states.

	Pure harmony        
	Tagore knew his Indian classical music well. Being an untiring shopper of resources to enrich his music, he drew effortlessly upon his training in the Bishnupur gharana of classical music while creating melodies. This is common knowledge. And so, an event highlighting the classical influences on Tagores music is not in itself an extraordinary one. But what made Parampara Bishnupurs presentation, Gurupranam, at G.D. Birla Sabhagar, stand out by a mile was the exploration of the unusual nuances of the gharana that Tagore seemed to be especially fond of.        
	Bengals own Bishnupur gharana is significantly different from the other traditions of north Indian classical music. Its distinctive use of komal and shuddh swars in unusual combinations, and its predilection for the dhrupad style with its introspective energy shaped Tagores music in a profound way. Santanu Bandyopadhyay, one of the most remarkable exponents of the gharana today, took the audience through the not-so-beaten tracks of the Bishnupur style, underscoring the distinctiveness of its sound patterns and peppering his presentation with interesting anecdotes. It was left to Manoj Murali Nairs full-throated, soulful rendition of the corresponding Tagore numbers to bring out the richness of the compositions, which shunned the rigidity of rules for a seamless blend of poetry, emotion, music and aesthetics. A vote of thanks to the organizers for an enlightening evening of pure harmony.         
	Kathakali Jana                
	Impeccable show        
	Mans journey from the darkness of ignorance, and desperation of life to the light of knowledge and understanding is difficult. It is only fragile hope and faith that take him along to enlightenment and newness of life represented by the child, full of innocence and simplicity. The Ananda Shankar Centre for Performing Arts presented Rabindranath Tagores The Child, the only poem written originally in English, as a dance production in Rabindra Sadan on April 23. Conceived and choreographed by Tanushree Shankar, it was mans journey depicted through dance and music. Its visual impact merged with the auditory experience in an impeccable manner.         
	The poem was interpreted by Shankar as a representation of the spiritual journey of man through time. The dancers enthralled the audience with their well-synchronized and graceful movements. They mingled a sense of passion for the art form with their professionalism. The recitation by Victor Banerjee lent a special touch to the production. Debajyoti Mishra, who composed the music, made an invaluable contribution that touched ones heart. Schuberts Ave Maria was transcreated in Bengali by Kamaleswar Mukherjee. Srikanta Acharya, Lopamudra Mitra and an efficient team of vocalists were praiseworthy in their performance.        
	Sharmila Basu Thakur

	Nobody seems to know what exactly a general strike achieves. Everyone agrees, though, that such a strike or bandh means a colossal economic loss and massive disruptions in normal public life. But all that does not seem to bother the leftist parties in India, the original sinners, and other champions of the culture of strikes. The nationwide strike that the Left and other opposition groups, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, have called next Monday can only mean another wasted day wherever it succeeds. And the success of a bandh is no measure of the organizers popularity or the peoples response to the issues on which it is called. If anything, such political actions run contrary to the democratic process because the political parties simply force their agenda with no regard for the popular will. It is the business of opposition parties to protest against a governments policies or decisions that they find unfair. But parliamentary democracy offers several options and platforms for such opposition. Several court rulings have pointed out the illegal nature of bandhs, especially when public institutions and the government machinery are used, as in West Bengal, to force a strike.        
	The planned bandh over the Centres decision to deregulate fuel prices also brings into focus the conflict between old politics and the new economy. Only diehard practitioners of old politics refuse to see the larger economic sense that deregulation makes. No government in todays world can afford to stick to the discredited ideas of a regulated economy. And given the pressure on every government to reduce fiscal deficits, it is suicidal for an economy to keep on subsidizing prices. A subsidy-laden economy not only distorts the reality in the energy sector, it also stunts the growth of the free market as a whole. But those who are driven by short-term political agendas only try to delay the inevitable. With the Left in India, however, the failure to see the economic reason is compounded by a strange obsession with an outdated ideology. The Lefts problem with the free market makes its politics anachronistic. Its own governments, in West Bengal and Kerala, have sought to take advantage of the free market. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee knows the battle against the free market is a losing one. Strikes against deregulation of prices or economic reforms in general increasingly look like desperate acts of losers.

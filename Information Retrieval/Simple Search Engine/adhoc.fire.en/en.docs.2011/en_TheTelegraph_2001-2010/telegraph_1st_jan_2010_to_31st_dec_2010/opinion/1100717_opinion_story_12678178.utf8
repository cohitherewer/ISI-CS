The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A problem of plenty
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A PROBLEM OF PLENTY                                  VISUAL ARTS: Rita Datta                                                  
	Its like a multi-cuisine menu of multiple main courses. Or a blockbuster where even the extras are stars. Because the list of around 33 artists at Weavers Studio must-see show, on till August 14, reads quite like a Whos Who of modern Indian art, starting with Jamini Roy and spanning almost three generations. Besides, most are represented by more than one work each, but not always hung together. The overwhelmed viewer is at a loss as to where to start, where to linger, what to skim over and what to skip. And if you think that sounds like a problem of plenty, you are right.        
	Ideally, the show comprising 93 or so works should have been spread, period-wise, over several editions. That way, eyefuls of art wouldnt be exiled to rather cramped corners. Nor would the masters intrude upon one anothers territories of radiance. Each exhibit could then be honoured with the space it deserves.        
	For yes, most exhibits of this show ought to be savoured with care. Take Jamini Roy, for example, known to go by the patua tradition of replication of images instead of the Western norm of exclusiveness. No matter how much of his art you see, familiarity doesnt fatigue the eye. Two undated works on view bear his mature style but the staccato daubs of paint could indicate an earlier phase.        
	Also featured are some riveting drawings marked by Benode Behari Mukherjees fluent forms; the sculpturesque angles of Somnath Hore; the rugged heft of a 1965 Bikash Bhattacharjee; and the delicate lines of Laxma Gouds ink nudes. The Akbar Padamsee heads, in charcoal and thin watercolour stains, hold you with their mournful, intense eyes. There are also four ink and acrylic heads by Jogen Chowdhury.        
	Of the paintings to note, theres a tiny, brooding Ramkinkar Baij watercolour; a Ram Kumar landscape of lucid economy; the pulsating, sometimes menacingly chaotic, abstractions of Kolte; and a fetching Anjolie Ela Menon crow, besides a lively Husain and the works of Badri Narayan, K.G. Subramanian, Vaikuntam, and others.        
	Some sculptures have been included too: the subtle rhythm of a small, svelte Sankho Chaudhuri; the nimble contortions of K.S. Radhakrishnans two bronze figures; a signature Dhruva Mistry and works by Chintamoni Kar and Sarbari Roy Chowdhury. Finally, the mercurial Vivan Sundaram surprises with two photographs, one of which, hinting at a primordial churning, packs much power (picture).        
	The show was occasioned by the launch of a collectible volume put together by Ina Puri, featuring 52 artists  including those to be seen here  captured at work by the camera of Nemai Ghosh, famed for his invaluable lensography on Satyajit Ray. Viewers fascinated by the products of artists creativity can now enter their ateliers to glimpse the process.

	Installation art can be tricky business. The first part  that is the installation  may not be too difficult (in fact, Marcel Duchamps urinal showed how easy it could all be). It is a different matter, of course, if the installer happens to have a colossal imagination (like Louise Bourgeois, Anish Kapoor or Richard Serra). But setting aside the logistics, it is the second bit that is always the more troubling  when does the installed object become art?        
	Postmodern academia may have conveniently dispensed with these questions, but critics still continue to be intrigued by such concerns. Even Duchamp, the pioneer of the Readymade, hesitated to articulate a general theory of his work, having anticipated the danger of everyone pretending to be an artist. On the contrary, Duchamp had left a quick word of caution for his imitators: Repeat the same thing long enough, he said in an interview with James John Sweeney, and it becomes taste.        
	Sanchayan Ghosh, who recently put up an elaborate show at Experimenter (Sisyphus Effect, Feb 5-27), took a dig at Duchamp (among other iconic figures like John Cage and Joseph Beuys), as his archly sarcastic title suggests. It would be impossible to make head or tail of Ghoshs work without reading his concept note. That the work cannot stand on its own without copious explication is telling.        
	There is not much that is conventionally appealing in Ghoshs work, which is premised on ideas that do not quite come to life. At best, the whole exercise looks like the shadow of a shadowy past, propped up with heady jargon, and tiresome in its single-minded determination to be contemporary  that is the goal it sets up for itself, and believes it to be the only one worth pursuing to become contemporary art.        
	Ghoshs starting point is not exactly novel: Any free spirit of transformation/revolution finally succumbs to its own network of self-assertion and authority. (A more direct version of this argument is offered by Duchamp in his remarks on taste.) Ghosh begins by simulating the interior of a nightclub, complete with strobe lights and deafening music  which, he explains, is a reference to the Dadaist conception of the cabaret as the ideal site of transgression. He dutifully marks out Safe Space, Risky Space and Home Space along the floor, which really mean very little, either visually or psychologically, to the viewer. It is like asking an adult to react to an imaginary ghost.        
	Every element in Ghoshs work  from the jute curtains to the projection of street scenes on the wall  looks over-interpreted. Once in a while, as the nightclub din subsides, one hears a cacophony of speeches and songs from the IPTA movement alongside excerpts from films and plays from behind these curtains. The effect, decidedly, is not one of a mystery of unveiling the unknown  as Ghosh requires his viewers to feel. Even the role of the bodybuilder, the most animated presence in the entire set-up, showing off his perfectly sculpted features on a giant video screen, has to be meticulously explained before it can begin to make sense. And as explanations go, this one could have been less convoluted: A video of a body builder displaying the made-up, practised perfection of the human body and the power it exudes, belies the behavioural insecurities of the viewer as the viewed.        
	The most preposterous aspect of Ghoshs work is the inclusion of miniature prints of Duchamps Bicycle Wheel (first made in 1913; and later recreated in 1951) and Beuyss Fat Chair (1964) alongside brief notes on John Cages 433 (1952) and the Stonewall Riots, which set off the gay rights movement in New York City in 1969. The first three of these prints appear on the walls of an inner room in the gallery, crisscrossed by a network of red lights, rather obviously symbolic of subversion. The piece could have been salvaged still  the intense luminosity of red has its own raw energy  but for the insistent embedding of certain catchwords related to cultural and art-historical movements  Flux, Revolution, Dada, or the latter rearranged to form Adda (no respite from cleverness).        
	While it is true that Dada has been done to death, it still seems presumptuous of Ghosh to suggest that the achievements of Cage, Beuys and Duchamp have undergone what he calls the Sisyphus Effect. Apart from the sheer unfairness of this estimation, it trivializes richly complicated bodies of work that aspired to the condition of a rare vitality. Even in the most cerebral or cryptic works of Beuys, for instance, there is a struggle to escape the easy allure of abstraction, a refusal to let the ineffable overwhelm the fate of his art. Beuys sought after a difficult but precise knowledge  how to make life out of the coldness of art, so that the deathlike character of thinking becomes lifelike again, as he said while elaborating the principle behind his video, How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare (1965).        
	T.J. Clark, in his study of Poussin (The Sight of Death, 2006), recalls Valrys comment that a work of art is defined by the fact that it does not exhaust itself  artness is the capacity to invite repeated response. Ghosh not only underestimates the artness of the masters of postmodernism, but also miscalculates his own response to them.        
	Contemporary art, that illusive category, created solely out of fashionable theories (as in Ghoshs case), appears somewhat over-eager. Longwinded ideas can never come anywhere close to that sublime passivity one associates with great works of art.

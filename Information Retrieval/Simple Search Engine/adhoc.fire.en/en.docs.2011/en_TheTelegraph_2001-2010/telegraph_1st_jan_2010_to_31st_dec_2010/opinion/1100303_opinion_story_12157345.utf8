	Healing touch                  
	Sir  It is surprising that it took the collective wisdom of a parliamentary panel in Britain to arrive at the obvious conclusion: homeopathy does not work (Panel: Homeopathy not medicine, Feb 23). It is common knowledge that there is no proven causal relationship between the homeopathic drug prescribed to an individual and the perceived cure of his ailment. This form of medication is considered by many to be a kind of voodooism or faith healing. Some pharmacologists feel that homeopathy, by prescribing arsenic, causes arsenic poisoning, which is a public health hazard. It would have been better if we could ban homeopathy altogether          
	But it seems that selling the sugar pills to the gullible serves a social purpose, at least in India. Homeopathic medicines, being inexpensive, can be prescribed to all people irrespective of their economic background.           
	In a poor country such as India, which offers little in the name of social security, even people with modest means at their disposal indulge in luxuries. But when it comes to paying for proper medical treatment, they complain of the high costs of medicines. Homeopathy acts as the feel-good factor for them. Having said that, we need to respect an individuals right to choose any form of therapy he likes, instead of banning homeopathy altogether.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

                
	Sir  Ever since homeopathy started gaining popularity, there has been a lot of negative propaganda against it. In spite of that, it has become a globally-accepted form of treatment. I have been practising homeopathy for more than two decades now. Many of my patients come to me because they are disappointed with modern allopathic treatment. I have looked after patients in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom, in addition to several in India. Some have been cured completely, while others are still recuperating. If this treatment was scientifically implausible, or the medicines used were just placebos, then such positive results could not have been observed. There is no reason to think that all those who claim to feel better after having homeopathic medicines are fools.          
	One can think of several examples of faulty conclusions in scientific research. Earlier it was said that the use of mustard oil leads to heart disease, and that sunflower oil is safer for consumption. But continuing research, conducted by S.C. Manchanda of the department of cardiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, has revealed the good effects of mustard oil. In the absence of any conclusive evidence against homeopathy, it is immoral to say that homeopathic products are not medicines, thereby sending the wrong message to the people.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  If homeopathic medicines do not have any ill effect, what is the harm in prescribing them? When live viruses or bacteria are injected into our body, it develops immunity against those microbes, giving the patient protection from the diseases they cause. This is the principle behind homeopathy. It is well known that a minuscule quantity of LSD, a psychotropic drug, can produce harmful reactions in the human brain. Also, pure penicillin, even when consumed in a greatly diluted form, is known to be dangerously potent. Compared to these drugs, homeopathic medicines are a lot safer.          
	Many medical practices do not have the evidence that modern scientists require. But they do cure the indisposed. Yoga, ayurveda, massage, chiropractic and acupuncture are examples of such treatment. Big hospitals and clinics are increasingly offer alternative therapies. If people feel better after availing themselves of these cures, why deny them that relief?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Correction    
	 Sir  The article, Heritage highs (Feb 27), by Nandini Guha regarding the ownership of the property of Sir Rajendranath Mookerjee located on Ho Chi Minh Sarani is factually incorrect. The article states, businessman Aditya Poddar has bought the late Sir R.N. Mookerjees palatial home. This statement is untrue. The property belongs to the direct heirs of Sir Rajendranath Mookerjee, namely Dipti Mookerjee, Rajendranath Mookerjee, Borendranath Mookerjee, Hemangini Matthai and Mriganayani Chakravarti. Aditya Poddars statement (of Wellside Hotels amp; Resorts Pvt. Ltd. located at City Centre, Sector 1, Salt Lake, Calcutta -700064 ) that he has bought the above mentioned property is misleading.  
	Yours faithfully,      
Borendranath Mookerjee, Calcutta

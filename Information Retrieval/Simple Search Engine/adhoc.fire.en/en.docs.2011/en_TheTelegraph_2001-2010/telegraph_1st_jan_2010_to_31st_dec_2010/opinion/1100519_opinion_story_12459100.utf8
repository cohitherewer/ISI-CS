	History repeats itself not exactly in the same way, but in similar ways. From the early 1990s to 1997, the demand for steel had been rising fast in India. Every second promoter was commissioning a feasibility study for making steel, buoyed by the rosy demand forecasts made by the steel ministry and the Planning Commission that failed to materialize later.        
	Many companies joined the fray, and enormous loans were sanctioned against big plans. In all, about 35,000 crores were borrowed from the Industrial Development Bank of India and the Industrial Finance Corporation of India Limited and from other financial institutions at the high rate of interest prevailing at that time.        
	With the crash of southeast Asia beginning from July 1997 in Thailand, Indian steel-makers fell into bad days since this coincided with a demand slump at home. It was followed by defaults and even closures. Only about 5,000 crores were paid back to the FIs. Both IDBI and IFCI collapsed. They were revived with huge infusions of public funds, but only as commercial banks and not as development banks nursing industries. This was an irreparable national loss, especially for the medium-scale industries.        
	Once again steel is now going through good times, thanks to the astronomical scale of stimulus that has led to a worldwide recovery from the September 2008 crisis. Demand is rising at home and abroad and so is steel price, mainly due to the increasing raw material cost and strong demand. Prices of iron ore and coking coal are rising fast, and this, in turn, are raising steel prices everywhere.         
	The present milieu of high price and strong demand is attracting investments from new and old players. The moot question is whether there will be adequate demand to match the enhanced total capacity. According to the steel ministry, 115 to 124 million tons (mt) of capacity addition is to take place in the next few years.                 
	Future tense        
	Even if half of this comes up say, in the next six years, it would require immense funding by the FIs, and the demand will have to rise by about nine mt each year, assuming capacity utilization at 90 per cent. This could be a tall order. Demand can fall well short of the Planning Commission forecast of 80 mt for 2011-12, as has happened in the past.        
	Steel consumption in India has increased steadily from 2001-02 onwards. From 29.2 mt in 2001-02, it rose to 49.7 mt in 2006-07. Thereafter, it reached 55.2 mt in 2007-08 and about 57 mt in 2009-10. This has raised the total stock of steel goods vastly, and also the ratio of the new goods to the total stock. On both counts, the productive capacity of the total steel stock has increased considerably. To keep this enormous capacity utilized profitably along with the net addition to it each year, demand has to rise sufficiently high year after year.         
	This is a difficult condition to be satisfied in the Indian context, given our dependence on the vagaries of the monsoon, and the continuous erosion in the purchasing power of the vast Indian middle and lower-middle classes. It is they who provide a large chunk of the stable steel demand. This explains our very low per capita consumption of steel at 44 kilogram.         
	The current high inflation is a major worry. The low rate of interest given by banks as compared to the inflation is generating inflationary expectations, leading to speculative hoarding of food grain and other items, causing prices to rise further. Thus, a vicious circle of speculative stockpiling followed by higher prices and higher wage demands is engulfing the economy and destabilizing the structure of industrial demand while reducing it and, thereby, the steel demand. This will continue unless bank rates are raised to curb inflation. Once again, Indian steelmakers could be in the soup and might have to be rescued with public funds.

                                  Speed matters      
	This was a chintan baithak with a difference. At Kurukshetra, where the wise men of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh met recently, a lot of time was spent reflecting on whether the cadre needed a change of wardrobe. Of the khaki shorts, shirt, cap, belt and shoes, only the cap won unanimous approval. Some suggested it was time to don full-length trousers with white tee shirts. But there were howls of protest from others who were unwilling to let go of their beloved khaki shorts. At the end of the day, a verdict was reached in favour of maintaining the status quo, minus the belt. In keeping with the organizations zeal towards its cow-protection policy, the RSS decided to let go of the leather belt. The official explanation, however, was that leather belts have gone out of fashion. A cheeky participant pointed out to the leather shoes, but they are yet to receive the boot. The majority of members felt that switching over to canvas shoes or wooden slippers would further slow down the ageing, lathi-wielding cadre.                            
	Satish Mishra is all set to drop a few places in the Bahujan Samaj Party pecking order. Mishra, apparently, now spends his days cursing himself for attending the meeting convened by the PM to mobilize support for the womens reservation bill. The meeting had been called after Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav declared that they would oppose the legislation. A desperate government turned to others for support. Mishra then staged a BSP-walkout that made it easier for the government to pass the bill in the Upper House. But word reached Mayavati about Mishras antics, and a furious Behenji is said to have decided to ensure that Mishra slides down a few notches in terms of importance. No woman, no cry, Mishraji?                        
	 What makes the AICC media chairperson, Janardhan Dwivedi, see red? First, there is Kapil Sibal. Serious differences are reported to have cropped up between Sibal and Dwivedi over the bill that would permit foreign universities to operate in India. Dwivedi, a former chairman of the standing committee on the human resource development ministry, is extremely upset with Sibal for trying to open up the countrys higher education sector. Dwivedi has strong reservations on the matter as he believes that such a move would lead to the commercialization of education and compromise the Congresss aam admi electoral plank. He has been heard muttering that the bill should have been looked at closely before it was passed. But the real cause for Dwivedis grouse, sources say, is the fact that he had made an unsuccessful bid for Sibals crown. Ever since then, Sibals initiatives have been bearing the brunt of Dwivedis barbs. The other person who, it seems, has got Dwivedis goat is none other than Arjun Singh. Dwivedi has been particularly concerned that there is now talk of a revival in Singhs flagging political fortunes. Much to Dwivedis irritation, Singh has already started making the right noises: a sub-quota for Muslim women in the womens reservation bill, implementation of the Ranganath commissions strictures and so on. Dwivedi has asked partymen not to react to Singhs statements. He has also been heard wondering whether there is any need for journalists to pay attention to veterans like Singh. Kya Digvijay kafi nahin the ki aap Arjun Singh ka interview karne pahunch gaye (Wasnt Digvijay enough that you arrived to interview Arjun Singh)? he was heard asking amused scribes recently.                            
	 In a rare move, the AICC has reportedly blocked Raj Kumar Patels entry into the party headquarters. Patel, who was fielded as the Congress nominee against Sushma Swaraj from Vidisha, had been expelled after he failed to file the nomination papers on time, handing Swaraj a walkover. Even though he lost his primary membership, Patel frequented 24 Akbar Road. After Suresh Pachauri spoke about Patels presence to BK Hariprasad, the AICC gen-sec in charge of Madhya Pradesh, Motilal Vora, the AICC treasurer, issued orders debarring Patels entry.      
	But there is no need for Patel to feel left out for long. Even Jairam Ramesh had once been discouraged to enter the HQ by PV Narasimha Rao. Sympathetic Congressmen are urging Patel to take heart from the fact that Ramesh has risen to become a Union minister from a mere technocrat. Not every gate has been closed, they insist, as far as Patels political career is concerned.                          
	The Andhra Pradesh chief minister, K Rosaiah, has finally moved into the camp office at Begumpet after much hesitation. Rosaiah had been operating from his residence at Ameerpet, which is situated in a densely-populated area. The traffic congestion was making it difficult for visitors to meet the CM. But there was no sign of Rosaiah shifting base for he did not know how long he would last on the gaddi. A superstitious man, he also believed that vaastu problems at the camp office had led to the untimely death of his predecessor. But after 200 days, amidst the chanting of Vedic hymns, Rosaiah finally set up home at the camp office after ensuring that changes had been made in keeping with vaastu requirements. His supporters must be hoping that a change in address will also help change the CMs political future.

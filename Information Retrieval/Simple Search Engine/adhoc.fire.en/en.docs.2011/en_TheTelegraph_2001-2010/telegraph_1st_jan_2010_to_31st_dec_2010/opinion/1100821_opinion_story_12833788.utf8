                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TO BE OR NOT TO BE                                                          
	In politics, as in running a railway network, the timing of a signal is critical. On Thursday, the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, missed the best opportunity to send out a signal concerning his intentions regarding the future of the new Presidency University. The common assumption is  and this is based on Mr Bhattacharjees public pronouncements on the subject  that he wants the new university to be a centre of academic excellence, which will be outside the control and influence of party and government. To this end, he has appointed a search committee to suggest the name of the first vice-chancellor. At this juncture a delegation from the Presidency College Alumni Association met the chief minister on that day and placed before him some proposals regarding the new university. One of these was that the new vice-chancellor should be an apolitical person. It was open to Mr Bhattacharjee to tell the delegation that having appointed a search committee, he could  and should  have no more say on what kind of a person should be made the first vice-chancellor. He could have reiterated that the choice was not in his hands and that he had no desire to influence the search committee. By doing this, he could have signalled that he genuinely wants the search committee, and therefore the new university, to work independently and be outside his influence, his governments interference and his partys diktats.        
	Mr Bhattacharjee not only missed a golden opportunity, he may have also, albeit inadvertently, trailed his coat. According to members of the delegation, the chief minister accepted all their proposals. By this acceptance, Mr Bhattacharjee indicated  without perhaps intending to do so  that he could influence or direct the process of selecting the first vice-chancellor. If he indeed can do this, what happens to the much-flaunted independence of the search committee? Will the search committee be reduced to a mere rubber stamp for the chief ministers wishes? And since the chief minister belongs to a regimented and monolithic party, to what extent is his view his own and not a mere echo of the partys opinion? Frightening questions about the future of the new university and the selection of its first vice-chancellor emanate from Mr Bhattacharjees failure to say that the committee is independent and so will be the new university.        
	Mr Bhattacharjee could have easily taken a leaf out of the book of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. The latter, even when he was the undisputed leader of the Congress and of the Indian national movement could, when the occasion demanded, withdraw and abdicate his responsibility. He did this sometimes to make a political point and sometimes as a genuine act of renunciation. And sometimes as both. It behoves the powerful, at the right time, to say they are powerless. A Bengali communist has a lot to learn from a genuine mass leader.

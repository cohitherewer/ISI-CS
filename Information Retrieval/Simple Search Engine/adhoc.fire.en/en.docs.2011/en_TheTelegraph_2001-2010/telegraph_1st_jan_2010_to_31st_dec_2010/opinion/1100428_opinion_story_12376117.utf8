The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Hacks and their spelling
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HACKS AND THEIR SPELLING                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	It was an odd letter, even by letters-to-the-editor standards. Interestingly, wrote one Rebecca Angelini-Hurll to the London Sunday Times, apropos of an article on dyslexia, I am a fantastic speller. Well indeed, thought I. Interestingly merely? Too modest, surely  not every fantastic speller, plainly, is equally deft in the nuances of modesty. Fascinatingly, maybe? Grippingly? World-shakingly, why not?        
	But lets not be too unkind to Ms A-H. What she said next was indeed of interest  in its way. Shed worked for six years at The Economist, it seems, and every single writer who had a modicum of talent could not spell for toffee  fortunately, they had a PA (me) who could both spell and correct grammar.         
	Well indeed, thought I again. In 35 years at The Economist, I subedited the work of umpteen highly talented journalists, in the home, foreign and business sections alike. Maybe one or two were less than brilliant spellers. But all of them? Most, even? No way. So am I to believe that in whatever section Ms A-H worked for not one could spell, let alone for toffee (a nice old expression; I dont doubt her English)? Frankly, phooey.         
	Yet the idea, a humble version of genius is to madness near allied, is not in itself absurd. One certainly can have writing talents and yet be unable to spell. Go back a few centuries, and to todays eyes that was true of every writer of English, hugely talented as some were, because spelling was not yet standardised.         
	Oops, I mean standardized, as The Telegraph insists  and is perfectly entitled to, since, as that word shows, there is no absolute, global standard of spelling even now. And back then it was chaos: even Shakespeare couldnt even spell his own name consistently (which, for the record, doesnt prove his plays were really written by Francis Bacon or ghosted for him by Hamlets father). Spelling was astonishingly unimportant.                
	Fantastic notion        
	Or is that so astonishing? Most languages must have gone through chaos like this. Yet remember the Wests formerly huge academic industry of editing ancient Greek and Latin texts. This could lead to fierce clashes: A.E. Housman, a classical scholar as well as a poet, once opined that a certain bad German editor, perusing the work of a worse follower, must have felt like Sin when she gave birth to Death. And the clashes might arise over tiny differences in ancient manuscripts. Scholars could blame some rival readings on the sheer obscurity of the text, or on the ignorance or plain error of copyists. They recognized regional differences of dialect. They knew spelling had altered over the centuries. But I dont recall any suggestion that variant readings could arise simply because, at a given place and time  say, Athens in the fifth century BC  people disagreed on how to spell.         
	Why not? Maybe because by the 19th century the idea was so alien: by then, all educated people spelt English (or German) the same way. As they do today. True, English has no strict global standard. But the permitted variations are minor and well known. Those apart, almost all serious users of English, unless they truly are dyslexic, almost always spell it the same way; that is, correctly. And in my trade theyd risk their jobs if they didnt.        
	So even if Id never set foot in The Economist, Id challenge any fantastic notion that its talented writers, little as I shared some of their views, were all dunces at spelling. Not just do I know they werent, but its impossible they could have been, at that magazine or any other. Shakespeare maybe did not worry about spelling; todays journalists have to.

	Slow pace                  
	Sir The move by the Central government to stop the pension payment of S.P.S. Rathore, the former police chief of Haryana, who has been convicted in the Ruchika Girhotra case, is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. Rathore committed a heinous crime many years ago, but the influential policeman had been able to stall the judicial process for a long time. In fact, had it not been for our highly proactive media, it is doubtful whether Rathore would have been given a prison term. Incidentally, a sessions court had dismissed Rathores petition against his conviction and also increased the tenure of his sentence (Rathore denied spot relief from jail, May 27). Rathore has already filed an appeal before the Haryana High Court against the 18-month jail sentence given by the district court. Even if the high court were to reject his plea, Rathore can still move the Supreme Court and continue to further delay the process of justice.                  
	The sordid episode involving this former director general of police clearly underscores the inherent flaws in Indias justice delivery system. The case also provides a glaring example of how money and power can influence the legal institution in the country. While it is true that the judiciary in India is overburdened with a huge backlog of litigations, there is no denying the fact that the criminal case against Rathore was deliberately stalled as a result of the pressure exerted by extraneous sources.           
	Corruption in the judiciary has come to light in recent times. Significantly, there were allegations that money and power also had a role to play in other high-profile criminal cases, such as those of Jessica Lal and Priyadarshini Mattoo. Similarly, allegations of corruption and land encroachment forced the Supreme Court collegium to withdraw the nomination of P.D. Dinakaran, the chief justice of Karnataka High Court, for elevation to the apex court. The paltry punishment meted out to the principal accused in the Bhopal gas tragedy has also exposed the intrinsic flaws in the judicial system. The Union law minister, M. Veerappa Moily, recently assured an outraged nation that a new judicial bill will soon be introduced in Parliament to root out corruption from the countrys legal system.          
	A number of reports published by independent international organizations have dubbed India as one of the most corrupt nations in the world. An honest and transparent judiciary is one of the basic necessities to build a nation. There is no doubt that criminals like Rathore take advantage of the weaknesses in the judicial system. Preventing Rathore from obtaining his pension may not put a stop to his attempts to walk free. But it will certainly make it more difficult for him to meet his legal costs. The move will also send a chilling signal to other high-ranking government officials, forcing them to desist from indulging in corrupt practices.           
	Stringent measures like the one taken against Rathore are necessary to eradicate corruption that has seeped into almost every aspect of life in India. The annulment of benefits of errant government officials may go a long way in eradicating the social evil called corruption and in building a new and prosperous India.

	Joyless ride          
	Sir  I am a regular commuter on the circular railway. I board the train at Patipukur and get down at Prinsep Ghat. A number of office-goers who work in establishments located in B.B.D. Bagh, Kidderpore Majerhat, Budge-Budge, Taratala, Mominpur and so on travel on this route. Since the circular railway caters to many people, should not the railways be looking at improving the quality of service? During the evening rush-hour, the packed train bound for Ranaghat is invariably held up between Tala and Chitpur to allow the Dum Dum-bound train to pass. This is because there is only a single line on this stretch. It is imperative that the railway authorities lay a double line in this area, especially when crores are supposedly being spent to improve rail infrastructure.          
	Again, between Burrabazar and the Eden Garden stations, the tracks run parallel to undergrowth and debris. People can also be seen defecating in the open. There is a dire need to beautify this section of the route at the earliest. Hopefully, the railway authorities will take a look at these two problems and undertake urgent measures to improve things for the hapless commuters.  
	Yours faithfully,      
Janmejoy Gupta, Calcutta

            
	Sharp rise    
	Sir  Politics in command (July 2), by Ashok Mitra was highly analytical and enjoyable. Mitra was brilliant in his interpretation of how and why inflation continues to remain unchecked in this country. It is common knowledge that the Union minister for agriculture, Sharad Pawar, has the time to attend to all his responsibilities except those that pertain to his own ministry. There is a lot on Pawars mind at present. But cricket  more specifically, the Indian Premier League  and issues related to his sugar empire are of utmost importance for this minister.           
	Furthermore, most politicians and bureaucrats are not really bothered about the soaring inflation. This is because they live in the lap of luxury, courtesy the poor taxpayers. One hopes that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, will address the issue of inflation. Else, prices of essential commodities will continue to rise unchecked, and the suffering of ordinary Indians would continue unabated.                     
	Yours faithfully,         A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

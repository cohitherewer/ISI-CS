	The pictures taken by Richard and Pablo Bartholomew  father and famous photographer-son  in the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies, of family, apartment interiors, and the Indian art world Richard had natural access to (being an art critic) have now been in circulation for two years. Recently, I saw a substantial display in an art gallery on the third storey of an old house  where the viewers, quickly unmindful of the photos, were behaving with the easeful familiarity  a state of being poised finely between absolute contentment and boredom  that characterized all the figures in the pictures.        
	Each time Ive seen these photos, Ive remembered something from my other life in childhood  not the imaginary life I was constructing for myself from the world I knew in Calcutta: my cousins world of Shuktara, Narayan Debnath, and Manna Dey; but the life that was actually my own in Bombay. This life in Bombay, which was my own but utterly distant, which was familiar but devoid of intimacy, had, however, its discontinuities; and its to these that, for me, the Bartholomews pictures speak. Occupying one of these discontinuities is a family called the Baruahs, whom I found myself thinking of in the gallery.        
	Jolly Baruah was my fathers friend, and he was a commercial artist: that is, he worked in advertising in an office on Dadabhai Naoroji Road (roughly, Bombays Chowringhee), quite a distance from the ground-floor flat he and his family lived in in Khar. To visit him at home was to visit another country: the country captured in the Bartholomews photographs. Pets  a variety of dogs, but also a cat, and, at one point, a rooster  had free range of the flat, including the bits we wouldnt ordinarily access, like the shadowy space beneath the dinner table. Besides dogs, all kinds of filmmakers roamed about the place: I remember the nice bald man simply called Sarkar, who was always on the verge of making a feature, and also recall running into Subrata Mitra, Rays cameraman for Pather Panchali. Jolly Baruah and his wifes brother, the artist and designer, Riten Majumdar, were the first two men I ever saw wearing the short kurta  the type thats now been in vogue for more than a decade because of John Bissells Fabindia. But Im speaking of the late Sixties  a time that belongs to the prehistory of the retail outlet  and was struck then by the curious shirts that couldnt be categorized or named, and seemed neither Western nor Indian, antique nor current. All around were other things that estranged me: the coir chairs in abundance; the unnaturally low centre table and divan; the strange, uncanonical visuals that hung from the wall, Jollykakus own handiwork (only later would I realize what a gifted innovator he was); the fragile lampshades; the ashtrays that looked like bits of bone or wood till you noticed the lip for placing the cigarette on. All the objects we usually call furniture or decorations were actually the assemblage of a bricoleur. Speaking of cigarettes, Jollykakus wife, Chitra, smoked endlessly. She was tall (58), and grew increasingly large as the years passed  its possible her constant smoking (and eating) concealed more than one sadness: shed lost her first son to cancer when he was 11, and also missed her vocation as a singer (despite cutting a disc soon after coming out of Santiniketan) because of some unfortunate damage to her voice. I remember her dressed in handloom saris and large-bordered Garhwals.        
	It was here, at the Baruahs, then, that I first encountered what Indians called ethnic style. Its taken me about 40 years to realize that ethnic, in India, is not really a proclamation of identity, but a register of homelessness and displacement. For instance, Chitra Baruah ne Majumdar and her brother Ritens Bengaliness was as improvised as any of the homespun or assembled things in the drawing room; theyd grown up in Patna. Jolly Baruah actually came from royal Assamese lineage. They now lived  and would till they died  in a rented flat in Khar. Charminar cigarettes (Chitra Baruahs favourite brand), Kolhapuri chappals, blue jeans (often tailored, since the authentic item wasnt available), cotton or khadi tops, sleeveless jackets with Nehru collars, cloth shoulder bags, a copy of Lorca, an interest in Bergman, a passion for the dhrupad  all or some of these elements, with a few others thrown in, added up to this ensemble of homelessness, of belonging nowhere  an odd, vibrant cosmopolitanism. I should include in the list the saris a certain kind of woman wore  predominantly the cotton tangail, with one or two striking, simple colours  as well as the large bindi (not a stick-on, but actual vermilion) on the forehead. These bold and simple patterns were then replicated on bedspreads, such as the one on which Pablo Bartholomew photographs a child lying back, as if the ambition of that generation were urgently to move from identity into abstraction  to become, in themselves, or to at least be woven into, a sort of Rothko painting. So much of that world seems organic, and yet so much of it was design, that it becomes difficult to tell where the apparently natural ends and the created begins.        
	Naturally, the Baruahs had pedigree, but we were only half aware of it at any given time, as were they, apparently: the rather bankrupt obsession today with familial connections  discovering or inventing them  was still nowhere in sight. Chitrakakis older sister was Sucheta Kriplani, Indias first female chief minister; the filmmaker Pramathesh Barua was Jollykakus maternal uncle. And so on and so forth. All this  in the vacuousness of present-day India  would be of terrible import; but at that time these facts were worn casually. They were significant, though, as part of the texture of what the sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu, called, expressively, symbolic capital: a domain of artistic and intellectual glamour and power, as distinct from real political power. The bewitching magic of symbolic capital only made itself felt in environments in which there was relatively little capital of the non-symbolic variety: such as the Baruahs rented ground-floor flat, with its beautifully put together bric-a-brac, which risked getting ruined every year when the monsoon flooded the apartment. Similarly, the faces, places, and families the Bartholomews photograph: migrs, artists, men, children, women, whose world possesses the new, idiosyncratic, evocative marks of symbolic wealth  an easel, an ethnic bedspread, a copy of Thought, the folds of a printed wrap-around cotton skirt; a rolled-up joint. This is the sweet, frayed incarnation of the new aristocracy, and it extended  like most of the photos  only to the end of the Seventies. Symbolic capital, like light, displaces meaning restlessly: an artist looks like a student and vice versa; an easel becomes a bit of furniture; the exterior of a house is like a giant canvas. The Bartholomews are partly aware of this shifting social texture: thats why they photograph themselves obsessively  not existentially, in anguish, but self-reflexively, to capture the special symbolism theyre part of, and which they cant  and dont want to  transcend or escape; to insert themselves into this largely visual symbolic panorama. The Bartholomews portraits differ, as a result, from Dayanita Singhs great pictures of the affluent of Bombay and Calcutta  photographing the rich requires a shrewd adjustment to the inequality between portraitist and sitter, so that the photographer can make herself invisible, and yet leave an unsettling trace of candour on the portrait. With the Bartholomews, especially Pablo, every picture of the time, every portrait, is also a self-portrait, every self-portrait a picture of the time.              
	What else can we recall from the peculiar itinerary of habitation and magic in those decades? There are the flecked mosaic floors, like just-begun Pollock paintings, grimy with our footsteps. Theres the constant battening of the ceiling fan, which  with the democratic white glow of the tube light, illumining everything from a coaster to a book of poems  once formed the aural and visual prism of these lives. One also notices, from the photos, how lissom Indians are  they will lie and sprawl anywhere; they read (and think) in the oddest of positions mixing languor and total immersion. Nirad Chaudhuri  in another context, that of petit bourgeois Bengali life  said that the bedroom, not the drawing room, was the main locus of sociability in these homes. Perhaps, with regard to Pablos pictures, the bed itself: where people take stock, ponder, make conversation and pacts. And what of sleep? The Bartholomews portraits of recumbent and, in Richards photos, sleeping figures are a reminder of their curious, topsy-turvy take on sociability: that one is never not part of a particular social world  itself charged with mysterious meaning, like a dream  even when one is no longer aware of it, or of oneself. How lovely to confront the richness  I use the word in a Bourdieuan sense, without Bordieus reductiveness  of the everyday in a country where we struggle to find a language with which to speak of it.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        YOUNG LOVE                                                    
	Youthful love may soften the hardest hearts, but is bad for health. Not that Indian laws encourage youthful love, what with the age bar in the Hindu Marriage Act and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act  21 for men and 18 for women. The laws may have been formulated with marriages arranged by adults in mind, for coercion rather than love is their driving assumption. They empower child marriage prohibition officers and magistrates to prevent marriages of minors (usually the girl is under age). Girls are married off early to lower dowry payments, an evil the law has not been able to eliminate yet. But early marriages also mean that the girl does not complete her schooling, remains undeveloped physically, intellectually and emotionally, and can become a teenage mother, endangering her own life and that of her offspring. Early marriages set off a chain of destructive consequences, and this is besides the far greater danger posed by the fact that the custom of early marriage makes life very easy for traffickers.         
	Yet it would seem that the laws are kind to youthful lovers. The Delhi High Court has just declared a minor marriage valid, pointing out that none of the provisions of the relevant laws can be used against the minor boy who had filed a petition in court. There was no coercion in the marriage itself, for the boy, below 21, married a girl below 18 against the wishes of her parents. The coercion worked in a different direction, forcing the youngsters to run away to get married  but obviously not registered  and then appeal to the court when the girls family filed complaints of abduction and rape against the young husband. But, unless a contracting party to the marriage complains, the marriage cannot be annulled; neither can the husband be punished for marrying a minor girl, because in order to be charged, he has to be legally an adult himself. Young love has triumphed, since the laws in their specifics appear to allow these spaces in spite of setting the age of majority. (The age of consent being lower, both teenagers had passed it.) But the courts ruling that a marriage between minors may be valid could make it easier to counter campaigns against the marriage of under-age girls and teenage pregnancy. The fight against these is a hard one, and it is a sad irony when the law defeats its own purpose.

	Vital lessons                  
	Sir  In School for change (Sept 20), S.L. Rao has discussed a topical subject. Management education has undergone radical change in recent years. The rapid mushrooming of countless management institutes in the country has resulted in the curricula being shorn of the essential contents. Most business schools in India have little to contribute to the development of management studies. These institutes do more harm than good. There is evidently an obsession with management education among students aspiring for promising careers. The problem of unemployment has intensified this craze. Business schools assure students of immediate placement on completion of their courses. But these promises often turn out to be hollow. The students, as a result, are left frustrated.          
	In the United States of America, as Rao points out, the MBAs awarded by the innumerable financial firms have added to the countrys economic misery. Management institutes in India were formed following the American model to prepare students for the Western private sector. But things have changed now. India has grown economically, and has developed a huge market of its own that needs entrepreneurial talent. Proper grooming of management students, especially in the area of sustainable growth, is important for achieving our economic goals. But the All India Council for Technical Education has failed to do its job properly. It has hardly been able to keep a tab on management institutes in the country. This has resulted in many students being misled into acquiring worthless degrees.          
	The government is contemplating certain measures to improve the situation. The steps involve asking all educational institutions, including B-schools, to follow transparent norms of governance on the lines laid down by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and a common admission test for B-schools. If these changes are implemented, they may face stiff opposition. The government must not deviate from its position because of such protests. Those taking advantage of the education system to con students should be punished.           
	Management education in India must be grounded in the realities of the market here. Other streams of study should include management courses. Our national economy, despite being on the path to growth, is facing a number of challenges. It is important that young minds be equipped to face those challenges.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Questions to answer          
	Sir  Much hue and cry has been raised over Salman Khans comments on the 26/11 massacre in Mumbai (Salman sorry for 26/11 hype barb, Sept 13). Such an undue fuss is not only uncalled for, but also deserves to be condemned. Some people seem to lose their patience and rationality at the drop of a hat and behave in the most irresponsible manner. Their ire is directed particularly at public figures who are more vulnerable to criticism. Shah Rukh Khan was targeted for his comments just before the release of his film, My Name is Khan. His sin was that he had recommended the inclusion of Pakistani players in the Indian Premier League. The Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena grabbed this opportunity to demand the boycott of his film. But Shah Rukhs admirers were undaunted by these threats and flocked to the cinema halls after the film was released.          
	Some people are agitating in the same way against Salman now. Apart from political figures, an eminent literary icon, Shobhaa De, is up in arms against him. This trend of stirring up absurd controversies is dangerous. It may throttle the freedom of speech and expression. Many may not agree with what Salman has said, but the logic behind his views cannot be dismissed altogether. Indian politicians should study the Constitution carefully before chiding Salman.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta              
	Sir  Salman Khan has said that much hype was created around 26/11 because elite people were targeted. Khans sudden sympathy for the common people reeks of double standards. This is especially so since his rash driving in a drunken state had taken the life of a pavement dweller. Khan also said that the Pakistan government was not behind the 26/11 attacks. The certainty with which he says this displays his naivet.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Manish Garg, Noida

                
	Sir  According to Salman Khan, only affluent people were targeted in the 26/11 attacks. It is true that one of the prime sites of the attack was the Taj Hotel in Mumbai. But on the same day, ordinary people were also killed at the CST and Nariman Point. The hype around the attacks did not exclude those mishaps.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

                                                    CUT TO THE CHASE                          - An election, a volcano, and a sentimental journey        Notebook - Ian Jack                          Odd man out                                              
	As you read this, voters in Britain will be going to the polls to decide the next government. For the past weeks, Ive been following the campaign in places as different as post-industrial Scotland and the blossomy lanes of Somerset. In all these places, a strange silence has persisted among the candidates. None of them has been prepared to specify or even make a guess at where the cuts will fall when Britain eventually but inevitably tackles its massive public deficit.        
	Even with tax increases (another great unmentionable) the cuts in public spending will be big  bigger, even the government has admitted, than what the great axe-woman, Mrs Thatcher, inflicted. But what will be cut? The budget for the military, for education and transport, for the arts, for social welfare? All of them? Nobody wants to say. Why not put your cock on the block and tell us, one man shouted at one public meeting, but all he got in return were the usual opacities about bureaucratic waste and efficiency savings. It wouldnt be completely accurate to say that no differences among the three main parties exist, but those differences are minute compared to the size of the British problem. To keep its creditworthiness among lenders in the international money markets, the next government will need to cut 100 billion a year from its budget. As the Bank of Englands governor has said, the next prime minister will have won a contest to be the most hated man in Britain.        
	My own bet is that David Camerons Tory party will win with a small majority  maybe a dozen seats  but Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters are hoping for a hung parliament, in which no party has an overall majority. A minority government, probably Tory, could then be formed and last until it was voted down by the Opposition. Or two parties, probably Labour and the Lib Dems, could make an alliance and rule until one fell out with the other. The Lib Dem price for joining such an alliance would be a commitment to replace the first-past-the-post voting system, horribly unfair to the smaller parties, by one form or other of proportional representation. The Lib Dems have had a good election  their personable leader, Nick Clegg, proved a star turn in the TV debates  but it would be astonishing if they won more than a sixth of the seats and a miracle if they agreed to serve in a coalition headed by Gordon Brown. If (more probably, when) Labour loses, Brown wont last as Labour leader beyond summer. He may come to see that as a blessing.              
	***************        
	For six days last month, very few aircraft flew across the skies of northern Europe. More than 100,000 flights were cancelled; airlines are thought to have lost around 1.1 billion. An Icelandic volcano with the hard-to-pronounce name of Eyjafjallajkull had erupted, sending tons of volcanic ash into the atmosphere, where northerly winds blew it south into European airspace. Airports closed, thousands of holidaymakers were stranded. The government sent the Royal Navy to evacuate British citizens whod made their way overland from further south in Europe to ports in Spain and France. This was a crisis, and in crises Britain likes to evoke whats known as the Dunkirk spirit, referring to the weeks in 1940 when flotillas of pleasure boats and merchant ships managed to rescue most of the British army from the Dunkirk beaches at the end of the armys humiliating retreat through France. Thanks to skilful propaganda and speeches by Winston Churchill, Dunkirk came to be seen as a kind of spiritual victory rather than a military defeat. It showed us as brave and resilient under the bombs and shells of the superior German forces, even though (as we now know) it was mistaken German strategy that let Britain off the hook.        
	So how brave and resilient were we this time, faced with the inconvenience of a few extra nights in a hotel rather than dive-bombers and machine guns? Its hard to tell. To judge from the television reports, not very. Families spoke bitterly about having to rent cars and drive across Europe; the Liverpool football side, forced to take the train to a game in Madrid, complained that travelling for a whole day had left them rather tired; crowds at a Spanish airport felt that Gordon Browns government had somehow let them down. Evidence of English stoicism was hard to come by, but thats not to say it didnt exist. Television and newspapers love a good moaner. Its been absolute hell, I blame the government is for some reason a more interesting  though also a far more unreasonable  sentiment than A volcano blew up, so well just need to be patient.        
	Those of us at home felt rather smug. When the winds in the right direction, which from our point of view is the wrong direction, planes heading into two of Londons airports whine far above our house. On an especially still day you can hear the wing-flaps being adjusted and the undercarriage going down  a high-up scrape and rumble, as though god was shifting a wardrobe across the floor of his celestial house. For almost a week, there were no noises from the sky. People elsewhere in the country remarked that traditional sounds were being heard properly for the first time in a generation: lawnmowers buzzing across lawns, blackbirds singing, the electric hum of distant trains. The poet laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, wrote a quick poem about it. In London all that happened was that cars, buses and pneumatic drills had no interruption from above. Everywhere, however, we were reminded that Britain is an island; cheap air travel and a railway under the Channel have made this easy to forget.        
	***************        
	Because there were no flights, I went last month to Ireland by train and ship. My destination was Galway on the Atlantic coast, where I was to speak at a literary festival. It took 16 hours rather than a flights 90 minutes, but the compensations included a magical view of Liverpool shining across the dark Mersey as we moved downriver, and I was warmed by the sentimental feeling that this was how so many great Irishmen had travelled (though it was Polish lorry drivers rather than George Bernard Shaw who leant over the rail).        
	The Galway festival was a great success. The Irish are famously and quite rightly known for their informality and hospitality, and inside the cocoon of a literary festival (sympathetic audiences, friendly questions, wine) its easy to ignore the condition of the country just outside the door. That condition isnt good. Three or four years ago, Ireland thought of itself as the Celtic Tiger, its old reputation as one of the poorest and most religious countries in Europe obliterated under a tsunami of cash. House prices in Dublin soared even beyond London levels. Irish entrepreneurs bought up English agricultural land and Mediterranean holiday villas. In rural Ireland, speculative housing estates covered the most unpromising stretches of country and BMWs and Range Rovers became the mark of quite ordinary levels of prosperity. Undermined by materialism and tarred with all kinds scandal  from non-celibate bishops to child abuse  the Catholic church shrank in reputation and influence.        
	And then Ireland went bust. Today it has the highest levels of public debt in Europe. Housing estates lie empty, unemployment is rising, workers in the public sector face harsh pay cuts. Everyone I meet confesses, We were living in a dream. Among other Euro countries, Greece is of course even worse off and Portugal and Spain no better, but in Ireland the economic crisis accompanies a real sense of social and cultural loss. When Ireland fell head over heels for money  or debt, as it turned out to be  it also dumped practical ways of thinking and living that had grown from centuries of hardship.              
	The financial crisis facing Britain isnt exactly the same. It has had centuries of prosperity compared with Irelands 10 years and its political institutions are probably stronger. But the solutions to its own debt mountain will be much the same as Irelands: higher taxes, unemployment, cuts, cuts, cuts. Everyone knows this. Tonight the votes will be counted. Soon after tomorrow the pain will begin. A quick glass of Dunkirk spirit, anyone?

	Nationalism has long replaced communism as New Chinas red badge of courage. At every hint of trouble, domestic or foreign, its rulers seek to whip up jingoistic sentiments. So the current anti-Japanese cry in China is not exactly a new thing. What is new is the intensity of Beijings reaction to the arrest of the captain of a Chinese boat, which had collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels in the East China Sea earlier this month. China first suspended all high-level diplomatic exchanges with Japan. And now it has ruled out any meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly session later this week. Worse, sections of the official Chinese media have called for retaliation, including the use of force, in order to establish Chinese claims of sovereignty on the group of islets in the East China Sea known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. This sabre-rattling is new even by the standards of China-Japan rivalry. Japan has only warned against the dangers of narrow-minded, extreme nationalism.        
	A worse danger seems to be a new aggressiveness that marks Chinese expansionist aims not only in East Asia but also in South Asia. This has gone hand in hand with Chinas rise as an economic power. Only last month, China edged past Japan as the worlds second biggest economy after the United States of America. Ironically, it is the economy that might also hold Chinese ambitions in check. China replaced the US as Japans biggest trading partner in 2009, when trade between the two neighbours stood at $253 billion. The economic impact of the boat row could, therefore, be limited. But Beijing could end up losing more than it could hope to gain by baiting Japan too much. What Beijing does on the boat issue will be watched not only by Japan but also by other countries. It can do China a lot of harm if its rise is feared, rather than admired, by the world. Power has its rewards, but it also has its risks.

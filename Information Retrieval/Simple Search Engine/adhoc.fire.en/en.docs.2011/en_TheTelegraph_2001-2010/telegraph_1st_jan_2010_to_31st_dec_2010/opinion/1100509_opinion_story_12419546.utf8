	Not for the people                  
	Sir  Calcutta was adversely affected by the nationwide bandh called by the Citu (Promised land, April 29). Instead of ensuring the well-being of the citizens, the Left Front government is busy flexing its political muscles by calling strikes and hartals. Bandhs, as a political weapon, need to be used with caution. However, most political parties resort to calling bandhs without realizing that they inconvenience common people. The people of West Bengal hate bandhs as much as the politicians like them.          
	Yours faithfully,        Subham Saha, Calcutta
                  
	Careful with rights          
	Sir  The Supreme Court verdict, which prohibits the use of lie detector tests and narco-analysis on a suspect without his consent, may have far-reaching consequences (True lies, May 7). The decision may affect investigations on people who are accused of being terrorists. The SC should have recommended alternative techniques to extract the truth from suspects. The current verdict may even lead to interrogators treating suspects in a harsh manner to earn their consent.          
	The right to silence could give those involved in terrorist activities an upper hand over the law-and-order machinery. Dangerous criminals may even misuse this right.           
	It is not right to expect that criminals will show a sense of responsibility and lawful behaviour. Perhaps it is not even right to allow criminals to protect themselves in the name of human rights. It might be a better idea to seek permission to conduct lie detector tests and narco-analysis from the court rather than from the suspects themselves.          
	Yours faithfully,        S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi                      
	Wrong reason          
	Sir  The prophet of doom (May 4), by Ashok V. Desai, throws light on an obscure part of the history of Indias struggle for independence. The piece explains why the apparently secular Muslim freedom fighter, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, was opposed to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan. Desai cites Azads contention to illustrate the reason behind the national icons reluctance: The cherished goal of a Muslim was to spread Islam; if Muslims had from the outset divided the world between Muslim and non-Muslim territories, Islam would never have spread. From this statement, it may be inferred that Azad opposed Partition not because he wanted a sense of brotherhood to develop between Hindus and Muslims, but because he feared that Partition may affect Islam adversely. It is sad to realize that Azad wanted an undivided India simply because he thought that this might facilitate one particular religion to flourish.          
	Desai writes that Azad foresaw the fate of Muslims who would be left in India after the creation of Pakistan, and predicted that they would face three choices: migration to Pakistan, becoming victims of riots, or converting to Hinduism. But all the prophecies of the so-called visionary do not seem to have come true.           
	After the initial migration to the neighbouring country during Partition, there has hardly been an exodus of Muslims from India. And cases of Muslims converting to Hinduism are very rare indeed. In fact, the Muslim community in India, despite acute poverty and a host of other problems, has grown substantially since the beginning of Indias independence.                    
	Yours faithfully,

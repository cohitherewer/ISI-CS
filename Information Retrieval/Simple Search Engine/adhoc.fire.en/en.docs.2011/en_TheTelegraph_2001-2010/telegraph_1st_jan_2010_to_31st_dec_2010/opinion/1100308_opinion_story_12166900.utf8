	Enough. No more. The armys morale is broken, said General Ilker Basbug, the chief of staff of the Turkish army; but the humiliations continue. Another 50 officers were arrested recently for suspected involvement in a 2003 plot to overthrow the government, including the current chief of the navy, a retired air force chief, and a former deputy chief of the army.        
	The plot, code-named Sledge-hammer, was revealed when the newspaper, Taraf, began publishing information gleaned from stolen army documents that came to its hands early this year. This comes on top of the Ergenekon scandal of 2008, in which hundreds, including four-star generals, were arrested for belonging to a secret organization that was also planning a coup.        
	In fact, however, the threat of a coup has been declining for years. The information is only coming out now, but the coups were planned for 2003. In at least one case, the army high command intervened directly to block it. And todays army chief of staff has accepted the arrest of dozens of generals and admirals without protest.        
	Turkey has been a democracy for half a century, but it was a rigidly secular democracy (in a 99 per cent Muslim country) that allowed no reference to religion in its politics. If a politician hinted that he had Islamic leanings, he faced prosecution in the courts. If he became prime minister, he faced a military coup; and there have been four such coups since 1960.        
	The reason lay in Turkeys history. The Ottoman Empire was an Islamic state, but in the end, the Muslims became nationalists and rebelled against Turkish rule. Turkey itself was nearly divided up into European colonies at the end of World War I.                
	Fear not        
	It narrowly escaped that fate under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The conclusion he drew from this history was this  to survive, Turkey must become a strong, modern State, which, at the time, meant it must become a fully European society. Islam was a potential weapon for those who wanted to resist that change, and so it must be rigorously excluded from politics.        
	By the start of this century, Ataturks goals had been largely achieved. Turkey was a powerful country with a higher average income than several of its Balkan neighbours, and more people than all of them put together. It was also a democracy in most respects, even a candidate to join the European Union. But the total ban on religion in politics survived, and so did the (unwritten) right of the army to enforce that ban.        
	The Justice and Development (AK) Party has its roots in political Islam, and since it won power in the 2003 election, the country has been divided into two camps. Its not just the army: despite its 99 per cent Muslim population, Turkey is a typical European country in that many of its citizens are not very religious. Some are not believers at all, though it is still unwise to say so publicly.        
	Devout Turks, on the other hand, do not see why they cannot organize politically to resist anti-religious discrimination. The AK Party swears that it has no wish to shove religion down the throats of secular Turks. But people suspect it is biding time until it has tamed the army, the historic guardian of the secular State: then it will be full steam ahead to the Islamic State.        
	That seems unlikely to the collective leadership of the armed forces. Groups of generals may plot coups, but the high command blocks them. It is to be noted that both the plots that have become public were hatched in 2003, when the AK Party had just won power, and suspicion about its motifs was at a fever pitch among secular Turks. The violence allegedly carried out by Ergenekon, like that envisaged by the Sledge-hammer plot, was meant to force the high command to accept a military takeover. But there was no coup. And there will not be one now.

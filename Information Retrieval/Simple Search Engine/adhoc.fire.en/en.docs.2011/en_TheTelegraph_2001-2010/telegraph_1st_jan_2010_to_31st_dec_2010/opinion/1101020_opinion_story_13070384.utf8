	New leader                  
	Sir  Team India scripted one of the finest wins in the history of Indian cricket when it beat Australia in the second Test in Bangalore (At 37, an unassailable leap amp; a slide, Oct 14). The Indian players played splendidly and excelled in every department of the game. After V.V.S. Laxmans heroics in Mohali, it was the turn of the batting maestro, Sachin Tendulkar, to come up with sizzling knocks in both the innings in Bangalore. The Australians under Ricky Ponting were made to eat humble pie by the mighty Indians who put up an all-round performance. With this series win, India retained its numero uno position in international Test rankings.          
	Debutant Cheteshwar Pujara and the dependable Murali Vijay came up with sterling knocks, and the spinners and pacers also proved their worth. Overall, it was an excellent team effort. Indias 2-0 victory should show Australians their place. Instead of resorting to mental games against the opposition, they would do well to raise the standards of their game if they are to regain their lost pride. The nation, which is celebrating this superb victory, wishes Dhoni and his boys many more laurels in the days ahead.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Ram, Pune

                
	Sir  Congratulations to the Indian team for creating history in Bangalore. In a thrilling finish, the Indians defeated the Aussies by 7 wickets to register their first ever clean-sweep against Australians.           
	The match at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium will always be remembered as one in which the formidable Australians were bulldozed after the miracle in Mohali. In recent times, there has been a bare-knuckled struggle between India and Australia to capture the Test crown. But Bangalore proved to be Australias Waterloo. The credit for Indias glorious victory goes to brilliant team work and the dynamic approach shown by its players. Not only did the bowlers do a commendable job, but the batsmen also came up with some scintillating performances. The architect of the win in Bangalore was Sachin Tendulkar who was adjudged Man of the Match. Incidentally, he also won the Man of the Series award. It is worth mentioning that in Bangalore, the master blaster reached 14,000 runs in his Test career. Tendulkar is a shining example for Indias budding players. One hopes that Team India will maintain its winning tempo in the near future.                     
	Yours faithfully, Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh             
	Sir  India achieved yet another memorable victory against Australia in Bangalore, thereby clinching the series in a convincing manner. The emphatic victory was possible only because of Sachin Tendulkar, who scored a classy double century in the first innings and followed it up with an unbeaten knock of 53 in the second. At 37, Tendulkar is still the best cricketer in the world. He has already bagged a number of centuries this year, and missed a few more by a whisker. He deserved to win the cricketer of the year award from the International Cricket Council.           
	It will be unfair if no mention is made of the other players who contributed to Indias success against Australia. Bowlers like Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan and batsmen like Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara excelled on the field. In fact, it was a complete team effort that helped the Indian side, with every player doing his bit for the sake of the team. The triumph against Australia shows that Indian cricket is now scaling new heights. If the Indians continue to perform consistently, they may stay where they are now for some time to come.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Adhip Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Early morning, on Navami, I saw a few shops that sell mutton getting ready for business. People had also queued up to buy meat at that early hour. It is well known that Bengalis prefer eating mutton on Navami. But I did not know that meatshops opened at that time of the day to meet the high demand. This makes it evident that Calcuttans truly love, understand and respect food.           
	Hence it is important that research and development of food techniques and experiments with new dishes are prioritized. Calcutta is possibly the only city in the world where every second person considers himself to be a foodie. The uncommon sight of mutton shops opening at the crack of dawn can perhaps only be seen in this city.                     
	Yours faithfully,

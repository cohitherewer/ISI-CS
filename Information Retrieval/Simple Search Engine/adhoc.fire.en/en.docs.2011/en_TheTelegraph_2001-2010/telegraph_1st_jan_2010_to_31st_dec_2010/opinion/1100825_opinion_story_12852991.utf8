The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Frank Kermode 1919-2010
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FRANK KERMODE 
  1919-2010                              OBITUARY                        
	In one of his most celebrated works, The Sense of an Ending (1967), Sir Frank Kermode, who died last Tuesday, wrote of a need in the moment of existence to be related to a beginning and to an end. In his own case, that need was addressed through reading, writing and talking about books in a language that found resonance not only with students and teachers of literature but also with the common reader. For Kermode, a critic was not an imperious pedant, but rather a man speaking to men, to use Wordsworths description of the poet in the Preface to the Lyrical Ballads.        
	In spite of his towering reputation as an academic, Kermode will be remembered more as one of the great literary essayists of his generation. Born at the end of World War I to working-class parents in the Isle of Man, Kermodes origins were decidedly humble, a fact that he never seemed to outgrow in all his 90 years. Modest to a fault, he went on to call his memoirs, with typical self-deprecation, Not Entitled (1995). By this time, he had, of course, attained the pinnacle of glory, received honorary doctorates from across the world and held every important professorship in the British Isles. And still he found himself in a permanent state of mild alienation.        
	Apart from choosing lifelong exile in England, Kermode also consciously opted for a relatively less taken career path. After postgraduate studies at Liverpool, he did not do a doctorate, but went on to teach in several redbrick universities until his appointment as the prestigious King Edward VII Professor of English Literature at Cambridge. In spite of his immense scholarship, his prose was never encumbered with footnotes and jargon. In a level tone, he elucidated complex ideas without flattening out the difficulty of his argument or sounding pompously self-assured. His Romantic Image (1957), written in this mode, is a classic of its kind, although Kermode preferred to call it simply an essay. The epithet, with its suggestion of tentativeness, reflects the form that best suited a magpie mind like Kermodes.              
	Fierce reading        
	From being a major, and highly controversial, proponent of French theory in Britain, Kermode became a pioneer of literary journalism. It was in the fitness of things that Kermode, with his early experience of poverty and a distinctly non-elitist education, should champion the review-essay, a genre he moulded after his own manner in the pages of the London Review of Books, the founding of which he inspired in 1979. Although he felt the need to come down from the ivory tower, Kermode never compromised his standards. But he did like to remind donnish reviewers of one of Lord Chesterfields less offensive precepts: Speak the language of the company you are in; and speak it purely, and unlarded with any other. At the same time, he held that readers of LRB or The New York Review of Books must be prepared, from time to time, for a mildly strenuous bit of reading. This model was also hugely influential in adding substance to the review pages of serious newspapers like the Guardian.        
	Kermode was a staunch vindicator of what he called fierce reading, a phrase that encapsulates his voracious appetite for books, attention to detail, and sharp critical instincts. However, his legacy cannot be confined solely to his activities as a literary critic. A firm liberal, he transformed the nature of public discourse in England by making the LRB a platform where a variety of topics  from politics to poetry  could be debated at length. Kermode never hesitated to go against the grain  he even risked a terrible spat with the legendary Oxford don, Helen Gardner, over the use of theory  and was equally forthright about admitting his mistakes. He was duly contrite for acting as a co-editor of the Encounter, which, unknown to him, was funded by the CIA.        
	With his resistance to being boxed into any school or clique, Kermode remains unique. He loved to rue the fact that there would be no Kermodians.

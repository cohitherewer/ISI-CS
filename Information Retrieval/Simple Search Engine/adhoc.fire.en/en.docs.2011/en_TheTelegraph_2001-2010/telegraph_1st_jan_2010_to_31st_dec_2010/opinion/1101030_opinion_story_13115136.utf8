The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | birth of a goddess
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BIRTH OF A GODDESS                                                          
	Modernity is always a muddle. In its most fascinating forms, it is cobbled together out of past and present, history and fantasy, religion and revolution, surreal and real. The human body and consciousness battling Time (and the times) are its only constants. So, when a new goddess called the English Devi is born in the countrys most populous, politically complex and notoriously backward state, anybody following the incredible ways of contemporary India would sit up and look with interest. The devis home is a temple being built by a local educational trust in the predominantly Dalit village of Banka in the Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh, where birthplaces of the older gods are protected by human law. The steps leading up to this goddesss shrine resemble the keyboard of a computer; the deity herself stands on the monitor and resembles the Statue of Liberty. She wears a wide-brimmed hat, presumably to protect her fair complexion from the sun of learning, and holds a giant pen in one hand and the Indian Constitution in the other. On the screen of her monitor-pedestal shines the Buddhist chakra; the inner walls of her temple are engraved with the symbols and formulae of the modern sciences and with wise English sayings.         
	Abanindranath Tagores Bharatmata of 1905  another icon that mixed up old and new, high and low, worship and politics  comes to mind immediately. Tagores mata ultimately went back to allegories of Britannia; her four hands promised learning, clothing, spirituality and nourishment to a Bengal (and then India) threatened with division. A century later, the continents have shifted, but this Dalit Statue of Liberty (through the English language) would have been inaugurated on Lord Macaulays birthday, this month, had the temple construction been completed on time. Yet, colonial history is inextricable from Dalit activism in the person of this divinity. She embodies B.R. Ambedkars own educational achievements in India, and then in such institutions as Columbia University (hence the Statue of Liberty?) and the London School of Economics, together with his pioneering role in the education of Dalits. There is also that remarkable poem in Marathi and English, Mother English, by the 19th-century reformer and educator of Dalit women, Savitribai Phule. This poet could never make up her mind about whether she liked or disliked the British, or if she disliked them more or less than upper-caste Hindus.        
	Yet, in spite of her halo of history, the English Devi of Banka village is a stridently contemporary icon. She rubs shoulders with those astronomically expensive civic idols built by her earthly sister, the no-less-iconic chief minister of the state in which both women hope to work their powers. What were Home and the World for the Tagores in the last century, are Local and Global in this one.

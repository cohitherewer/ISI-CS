	A politician may be hugely popular in his day without actually achieving or changing much. When he took over Brazils presidency eight years ago, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva rode the crest of a rare popularity wave. As he prepares to leave office after his second term, he remains, in Barack Obamas words, the most popular politician on earth. His hand-picked successor, Dilma Rousseff, has only invoked his name in order to win the next round of elections and step into her mentors shoes. It is easy to see why Lulas name still works like magic in Brazils politics. Eight years of his presidency changed much for the country to make it part of Bric, the new group of emerging economic powers made up of Brazil, Russia, India and China. Its international clout too has reached out far beyond Latin America. At a time when most countries are still struggling to recover from the three-year-old recession, Brazilians see their incomes rising and more and more jobs being created for them. When he won his first presidential election, it was primarily the fairy-tale element of the former shoeshine boys personal triumph that captured his peoples  and the worlds  attention. But his success story therefore makes his exit just as dramatic.        
	Lulas story has messages for leaders everywhere. He changed so much because he could begin by changing the outdated economic ideas of his own Socialist Party. But that was only one part of his story. The other part was about how he ensured continuity and stability. Although generally left-wing, he avoided the kind of rabble-rousing that has made Hugo Chvez of Venezuela a controversial figure in Latin American politics. More important, instead of rejecting the reformist economic policies of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Lula used them in order to control fiscal deficit and repay foreign-currency debt. His success in blending change with continuity disproves the myth that economic reforms make for bad electoral politics. His critics, though, wanted him to do more so that the States control of the economy and the ruling cliques grip on the government were loosened further. These are challenges that his successor has to seriously address. It remains to be seen whether Lula lets Ms Rousseff come out of his shadow and stand up on her own. That may be one final test of his leadership.

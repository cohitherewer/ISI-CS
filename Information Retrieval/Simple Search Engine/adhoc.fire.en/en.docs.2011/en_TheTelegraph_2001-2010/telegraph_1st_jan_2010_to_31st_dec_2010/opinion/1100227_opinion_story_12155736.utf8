The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Not radical, but sound
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT RADICAL, BUT SOUND                                                          
	The budget, according to the Union finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, is the governments vision of the future. What this budget does is that it clearly delineates the views of the government about the respective roles of the private and public sectors in achieving the governments objective of inclusive growth. It seeks to create a stable environment within which the private sector will be the leading player in accelerating the overall growth of the economy. The government will be responsible for strengthening infrastructure and enlarging the scope of social security measures. With this in mind, Mr Mukherjee has made only a relatively modest attempt to raise resources through additional taxes, the net amount to be raised being only Rs 20,000 crore. Much of this additional revenue comes from the increase in Central excise taxes, which had been successively lowered in three installments as part of the governments earlier fiscal stimulus package. Since the economy is now in a much healthier state, virtually everyone had expected the rate to go up. Perhaps what may have come as a surprise was the decision to raise taxes on petroleum products excluding liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene. The increase merely reverses the earlier reduction, which was effected when crude prices were significantly higher. There has not been much change in the structure of indirect tax rates, except that tobacco, and some luxury goods will cost more. The middle class will benefit because the income tax slabs have been widened. Another additional benefit to individuals comes from the increased deduction from taxable income, available to those who invest in approved infrastructure bonds.        
	The overwhelming bulk of increased government expenditure will be in infrastructure and the social sectors, the latter demonstrating the governments desire to promote inclusive growth. However, the increase in overall government expenditure (both plan and non-plan) is designed to be relatively modest, reflecting the finance ministers desire to restore fiscal discipline. He plans to keep the fiscal deficit to 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product during the next year, and has even laid down a roadmap according to which the deficit will be brought down to just over four per cent within three years. He plans to achieve the immediate target by raising as much as Rs 40,000 crore through disinvestment of public sector enterprises and an additional amount of Rs 36,000 crore through spectrum auctions. The actual realizations may be significantly lower if the current optimism about the prospects for the economy turns out to be misplaced.        
	This is a budget devoid of frills. But those who know Mr Mukherjee expected none. However, this budget does seek to achieve some worthwhile goals  strengthening infrastructure, promoting social welfare and restoring fiscal discipline. This budget will be judged by the extent to which the government achieves these goals.

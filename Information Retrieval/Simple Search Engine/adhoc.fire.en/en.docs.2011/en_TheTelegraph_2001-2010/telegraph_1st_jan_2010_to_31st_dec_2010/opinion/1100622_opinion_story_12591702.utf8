The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Out of tune
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OUT OF TUNE                                                                  
	There is no need to lose your nerve; they are all user-friendly. For all those who approach gadgets with fear and trembling, with the insane hope of escape gleaming in their eyes, this reassurance is, at best, dubious. User-friendly is an expression oozing glibness, it does not inspire trust. But there is no choice; all these machines, gleaming, winking, cooing and clicking, surround the cowering user, forcing their services on him. Should he even dream of using the old machines, perhaps a fridge, or a telephone, or a flickering television without a remote, anything that does not beep or flash or croon the moment he comes close, he is reduced to looking for its outworn parts among heaps of scrap and for its workmen among those beyond earthly reach.        
	The friendliness of the mobile phone is overwhelming. All you need to do is to touch it at the right place, and it cascades into nerve-racking action. But I was pleasantly convinced of its user-friendliness when a busy woman I know learnt to use it through images and symbols because she is illiterate. Then, all of a sudden, her phone began to sing at me instead of ringing when I called. It appeared that she had no idea what her phone was doing; the company was simply charging her extra for a caller tune it had decided to give her.        
	Perhaps the company expected to get brownie points for its thoughtfulness. People love singing phones. They use their favourite tunes as caller tunes; it is a marker of identity, of mood  the most fervent adherents of this new culture choose a fresh tune for each frown and smile, even of politeness  the caller listens while he waits. It leaves me bewildered. Why should I be forced to listen to a song someone else likes? And what has someone elses mood got to do with mine? I might like a song, say, Blowing in the wind, but I may not be thrilled to hear it when I am desperately trying to speak to the doctor because my mother-in-law has fallen and appears to have broken her leg. I am not soothed, I dont feel the least bit musical. Even if I ring someone with good news, I dont want to listen to their music. I dont want to hear Ki ashay bandhi khelaghar (I may adore Uttam Kumar, but theres a time and a place for everything), or Tomar dekha nai (thats why Im calling) or Yeh jo mohabbat hai (I never felt less like mohabbat in my life) or anything else. But what I want doesnt matter. Culture, as implacable as the machines it clings to, has defeated us, paralysing the unwilling user and drowning my feeble fury in its stiflingly friendly embrace.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

	Beyond control                  
	Sir  The government seems to be making sporadic and wayward attempts to control inflation, which continues to rise. Consequently, food prices have been sky-high for quite some time now. Back in 2009, high inflation was seen as a sign of economic recovery. But the trend has continued, and the government has failed to tame it. A group of ministers should be appointed to tackle the situation. The members must have a holistic view, set aside conventional economics and focus on ground realities to improve the situation.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

                
	New surprise          
	Sir  It is surprising to learn that the Trinamul Congress chief, Mamata Banerjee, has invited eminent people from all walks of life to become advisers in Calcuttas civic body (Target: 95 advisers for 95 councillors, June 7). She has appointed Sovan Chatterjee to head the Calcutta Municipal Corporation as the mayor, with 76 experts to guide him. But it is not clear how this committee of experts will reach a consensus while taking vital decisions. Among other things, the CMC will be expected to restore pedestrians right over footpaths, facilitate smooth traffic and ensure the supply of drinking water to remote corners of the city. One wonders how the advisers can help the CMC address such critical concerns.          
	Had Banerjee learnt a lesson from the Stephen Court fire or other similar disasters, she would not have been so casual in her selection of advisers. Reportedly, actors, singers and even painters have been invited to be a part of the panel. Some of the names in the list also suggest that the selection might have been made with an eye on vote banks.          
	So many experts advising the CMC may ultimately impede the smooth functioning of the civic body. For example, the members of the expert committee may contest a decision taken by the mayor, and this may result in an internal conflict. To avoid this, the advisers for the panel should have been chosen from among people who have experience in relevant matters. This would have helped the CMC function in a capable manner.          
	Banerjee had earlier appointed singers and theatre personalities to the railways heritage and cultural committee. This committee, set up by Banerjee herself, had no bearing on the well-being of railway passengers. Similarly, the CMCs expert committee may prove to be an unnecessary burden on the state.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Mukherjee, Burdwan              
	Sir  Mamata Banerjees penchant for springing surprises is known to the people of West Bengal. But even those who have enjoyed the miracles performed by her must have been bewildered by her latest act: constituting an experts panel of 76 members for the citys corporation. Banerjee has even promised to add another 19 names so that all the councillors of the civic body have an expert each to take advise from. These experts have been selected from various professions, and include actors, musicians, painters, film-makers and so on. Most of them do not have much to contribute towards providing civic amenities to Calcuttans.          
	No other civic body in the country might have thought of such an innovative step. Surely, the CMC would be regarded as a pioneer in talent mobilization in the history of Indias civic boards. The people of Calcutta must thank Banerjee for turning the medias attention on a city that is otherwise forgettable in every possible way.          
	Yours faithfully,

	It is virtually certain that the meeting of the Group of 20 will see a war of words in Seoul. The bone of contention was the announcement of the United States of America Federal Reserve on Wednesday to buy long-term government bonds worth $75 million every month for the next eight months. It is a pure and simple liquidity injection; it will replace $600 million of bonds with that much money. The purchase of bonds may reduce interest rates. But more important, it will increase total spending. If it ends up in the coffers of banks, they will be able to raise their loans by a multiple. The loans, when businesses and consumers spend them, should increase total expenditure by another multiple. If some of the money is used to buy shares, it would raise stock prices and induce companies to raise capital and spend it. It is a straightforward device to raise demand in an underperforming economy evidenced by the high unemployment and surplus capacity. Nothing could be a more obvious, a more Keynesian thing to do. But unlike Keynes, we live in an open world in which everything affects everything else. So the American reflationary measure immediately drew the ire of its allies. Wolfgang Schuble, the German finance minister, was the first to let go; his chancellor, Angela Merkel, followed him. Their charge was that the liquidity injection was a covert devaluation. The idea seemed to be as follows: lower interest rates in the US would drive funds away to other countries with higher interest rates, those who transfer funds would sell dollars and buy other currencies, and that would drive the dollar down against other currencies.        
	Developing countries had another grouse. Zhu Guangyo, the Chinese vice-minister of finance, said that the move would attract unnecessary capital to developing countries, meaning China. Henrique Meirelles, the governor of the Brazilian central bank, said that it would make it more difficult for Brazil to prevent appreciation of its currency. Chinas and Brazils problem  of unwelcome capital inflows  is Indias too. But neither the prime minister nor the finance minister reacted. The only comment came from their chief economic advisor, who called it a gamble. According to him, the world faced new economic problems; they called for new thinking about solutions.        
	This sage view seems to be the best suited for the prime minister to carry to Seoul. For one thing, capital inflows till now have been manageable, and have, in fact, filled in the deep hole in Indias balance of payments. For another, members of the G-20 are sovereign countries. Even though their domestic policies may spill over to the detriment of other countries, no one has the power to prevent that. The best the leaders can do is to sit down and find a consensus. And whether the consensus is clever or foolish will depend on the economics that goes into it.

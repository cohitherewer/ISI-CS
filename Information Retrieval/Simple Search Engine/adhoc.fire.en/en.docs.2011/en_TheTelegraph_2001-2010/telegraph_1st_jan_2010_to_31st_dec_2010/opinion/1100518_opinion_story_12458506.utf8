	The Abhisit Vejjajiva government in Thailand has finally ceded to the Red Shirt protesters the moral high ground it had been guarding so assiduously from them. Part of it had been lost last month when the army attempt to evacuate the anti-government protesters from one of the most fashionable parts of Bangkok had ended in bloodshed. The sniper attack on Khattiya Sawasdipol  a renegade army officer who had been trying to add military teeth to the protest movement  and his subsequent death gives away on a plate whatever had remained of that high ground. For one, it nails the governments lie that it is not using weapons against civilians. Sawasdipol may not have been a civilian, but it will take a lot for the government to convince those still willing to listen that he was a terrorist in the midst of protesters who deserved to be taken out. And since he is not the only one to be felled by sniper attack, the job of convincing the people may prove more difficult. The Thai administration perhaps knows as well as anybody else that it has now given enough reason to the Red Shirts to take their protest to the next logical level. Not unsurprisingly, a shutdown has been ordered to prevent reinforcements from the north and northeast of the country from reaching the protesters in Bangkok. They, meanwhile, are being starved out by the blockade around the protest site in the city. But unlike previous occasions, a clampdown or even stoicism in the face of provocation may no longer be sufficient to deny the movement its spread and momentum.        
	It is possible that the Thai prime minister himself is aware of the transformation of the movement from a predominantly loyalist protest in favour of the deposed former premier, Thaksin Shinawatra, to a popular democratic movement for political reform. His promise to hold early elections, voiced many times during the negotiations with the protesters, is a probable reflection of that. Unfortunately, the use of brute force has clouded his intentions while raising fears of the ascendance of the military. Mr Vejjajiva ought to realize that he cannot have nor expect an entirely protest-free scenario before commencing with his reform plans. Both he and his backers among the countrys elite may ultimately have to cede more ground than they can imagine if they are to remain politically relevant.

	One sincerely hopes that what one is writing today is subsequently proved wrong, thereby giving India the right signal pertaining to the purchase of high-end defence hardware from foreign countries. Owing to the inability of the indigenous defence industry to meet the demands of the Indian armed forces, approximately 70 per cent of our military hardware is imported. As Western manufacturers face the grim reality of drastic reductions in the military expenditure of richer nations, the sellers may have to give a fresh chase to potentially prosperous customers like India. In this situation, when choices are available to the buyer rather than to the seller, India should have been able to make a good bargain, making the sellers offer their products at a price lower than the usual contract price. However, that does not seem to be happening.        
	Let us study the example of American military equipment on sale, offered to, or contracted with India. In 2007, India made a deal with Lockheed Martin for the supply of 06C-130J Hercules medium multirole (transport) aircraft worth $1.02 billion under the foreign military or government sales programme. According to Military Balance 2010, these aircraft are for special forces operations configuration with AN/AAR-47 missile approach warning system and radar-warning receivers.        
	Obviously, there appears to be some special stuff embedded in the aircraft that makes the price of each flying machine $170 million. However, it appears from Janes All the Worlds Aircraft 2010-2011 that the same type of aircraft was sold to Australia in 1995 for $55 million  the baseline price of C-130J for US Air Force [was] quoted as US $67 million in early 2002, and there was a multilayer procurement of 40 C-130J-30s for the US Air Force [at a ] unit price [of] US $67.5 million.                
	Bottom line        
	Again, in 2003, the contract for one aircraft for the Air Force Reserve Command was worth $70.5 million. This disparity of more than $100 million per aircraft between Australia and the United States of America on one hand and India on the other is intriguing. Why did the price of the same type of aircraft shoot up so high when offered to India?        
	Initially, in early 2002, potential buyers were expected to be Australia, Canada and Italy, which were to begin negotiations concerning cost and work-sharing aspects of the collaborative venture. However, all three countries withdrew by mid-2005. Not unexpectedly, after the retreat of the three developed nations, the early entry of India took place, with a $2.1 billion-order for an aircraft which was still far (five years) away from the development and production line. The US was in dire need of cost or risk sharing partners, and it missed the bus. Instead, it got a $2.1 billion moneybag in New Delhi.        
	However, there is no doubt that American aircraft continue to be top-class, which, understandably, is why overseas clients want it. As Americans are conscious of the unmatched quality of their product, they tend to be difficult at times and try to arm-twist those customers who dare to have a contrary view. And here lies the danger for India as a customer of US military aircraft. India may have to contend with extreme reluctance on the part of the US to part with its latest and best technology.        
	Successive US governments have acknowledged the existence of rigid export controls but have failed to loosen the checks owing to opposition from the US Congress. Even President Barack Obama may not be able to change this practice. Hence, India will have to remember the ground realities of cost, quality and control checks of the US aviation when it tries to acquire aircraft for the Indian air force.

	Time has proved the pundits wrong again. After Greece, it is neither Spain nor Portugal that has fallen, as had been predicted, but it is Ireland, with a $20 billion debt default. Irelands present public debt burden is nearly 99 per cent of its gross domestic product. It also has to bail out its distressed banks at a cost of $54.3 billion. In 2009, it had the highest budget deficit of 14.3 per cent in the euro zone. Irelands credit rating had dropped from AAA to AA+ in March 2009, then to AA in June 2009, to become AA- this year, the lowest since 1995. The irony is that unlike Greece or Portugal, Ireland had been doing fine when it joined the euro. Since then, till mid-2008, Ireland had one of the fastest growing economies in Europe when banks, both foreign and domestic, just poured in cash in its property market. Prices zoomed, but by mid-2008, when the music had stopped, there were few takers for these properties. The market crashed, along with stocks and jobs in the construction sector.         
	Ireland has been strictly following the rules set by the European Central Bank to keep the euro stable  cutting budget deficit, slashing salaries and wages, keeping taxes competitive, living austerely and trying to boost exports. Yet, its credit rating is dropping. Interestingly enough, the International Monetary Fund used to set the same conditions, plus capital mobility, for its loans to the developing economies. The catch is that this solely market-based, export-led growth model ignores the fact that import demand, like home demand, is very much a function of income, as price is. In fact, at times, income is the dominant factor governing demand. So, when a recession or a feeble recovery engulfs nations and/or their major trading partners, their consumption and imports are cut sharply and the model fails. This is the predicament of Ireland.                 
	Depressed times        
	Ireland entered recession in mid-2008 for the first time since 1983, and was the first euro-country to do so. Thousands of jobs were lost in construction and the malaise spread to other sectors through linkage effects. Unemployment soared from six per cent in 2008 to 12 per cent in 2009, and can rise to 14 per cent this year. While consumer price inflation averaged 4.1 per cent in 2008, it has been falling since the last quarter of 2008, thanks to declining demand. In 2009, it became -4.5 per cent and is estimated to be -0.5 per cent or lower this year.         
	Ireland, thus, has been in deflation since late 2008. In such a situation, business delays investment decisions and households delay their purchases, expecting prices to drop further. So, both consumption and investment, the two components of home demand, shrink. It is in this context that the ECB-dictated austerity programme is to be judged. With both home and export demands reduced significantly, it is only government demand that can lift Ireland out of the morass. Since mid-2008, Ireland has passed three slashed budgets with sharp cuts in public sector salaries, child benefits and social welfare payments. These are estimated to have sucked about five per cent of the GDP. The ECB has set 2014 as the year by which Ireland has to reduce its budget deficit to three per cent. Consequently, it could face tax raises and further cuts on public spending to the tune of $20.6 billion over the next four years. GDP would fall, causing the tax revenue to drop, making debt-servicing far more difficult. The economy might be propelled into a full-scale depression then.        
	Till now, there have not been many strikes or riots. But the ruling party is stuck at below 25 per cent in the polls for more than a year and can lose the parliamentary strength necessary to implement the austerity measures. In that case, either the ECB alters its rigid stand regarding the budget deficit or Ireland exits the euro. The latter would be beneficial for the Irish people.

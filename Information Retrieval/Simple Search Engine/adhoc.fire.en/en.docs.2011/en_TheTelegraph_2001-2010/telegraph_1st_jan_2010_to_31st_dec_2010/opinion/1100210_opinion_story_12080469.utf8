The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | fire in the hills
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FIRE IN THE HILLS                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	It should be obvious by now that the agitation for a separate Gorkhaland has reached a stage where it can neither peter out nor be ended with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha accepting a halfway house. Politicians in Calcutta may cry themselves hoarse, refusing to allow another division of Bengal, but that will not change the reality. The hill people are determined to carve out a separate existence, and this determination has only gained strength with the creation of small states in the plains.        
	They noticed that while their demand was hanging fire, the Centre agreed to bifurcate Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, and recently consented to split Andhra Pradesh into two. For ages, people in the hills  the Nepalis, Bhutias and Lepchas  have complained of neglect, and now, with the nod to the demand for Telangana, they are not prepared to be sidelined any more.        
	In the context of Telangana, New Delhis argument, voiced by the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, is that the demand from three sub-divisions of one district cannot be equated with that from about a dozen districts. The argument is flawed. Size is not the issue here; the issue is of ethnicity, and thereby, of culture and language. That a distinct group such as the Nepalis, together with the original inhabitants, the Bhutias and Lepchas, are entitled to the right to determine their own future had been acknowledged by the undivided Communist Party of India. Later, the Marxists began to rethink the subject, but in the hills the Nepalis never forgot what the comrades had once said. The current argument that a separate hill state will not bring any solution to the peoples problems is undeniably valid. But in Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong, they are asking the other equally valid question: have their problems been addressed by keeping them within West Bengal? If not in so many words, they are telling Calcutta what Gandhi told the British: Leave us to our chaos.                
	Simmering unrest        
	The time has come for some honest introspection. What did the hills get after Independence? The only answer is, Nothing. During the earlier Congress rule, Darjeeling was the summer capital of the state, which meant ministers and bureaucrats went up there for a fortnights holiday, and not much else in real terms. Between 1972 and 1977, when Siddhartha Shankar Ray was the chief minister, he sought to assuage Nepali sentiments by mouthing a few words in their language at public rallies, and by donning a Gorkha cap, even as the government resisted demands for constitutional rights for their language. The Marxists began their rule by appointing a minister for hill development but soon discontinued with the post. True, such acts of neglect are to be seen elsewhere as well, but they can assume serious proportions in an area allowed to become sensitive over the years.        
	The Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council could have made some difference had it not been allowed to become the plaything of an individual and his cronies, with Calcutta looking the other way. So how much more chaotic can things be if a new state is born? At present, officials from New Delhi and Calcutta are holding periodic parleys with the hill leaders, and they can go on doing so: these can make no difference to a people who are visibly determined to fight it out.        
	Any protracted struggle assumes fresh dimensions, and that has happened in the present case as well. The agitation has brought within its purview the Nepalis of the Dooars, and is now seeking bonds with the tribal leaders of the area, who have their own agenda. This is bad news for Calcutta, as elsewhere in north Bengal separatist movements seem to be gaining ground. Wide areas of unrest have been created that could have been avoided by a favourable response to the demand for a separate state.

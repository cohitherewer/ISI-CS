	New role                  
	Sir  In Triangular phenomenon (April 23), Ashok Mitra calls the Naxal movement a creation of the Right or the Congress: At that juncture, the Right, that is, the Congress, instructed police and security personnel under its political control to seek the assistance of the ultra-Left, the Naxalites, in the holy battle against the Marxists. The Naxalites had broken away from the CPI(M). Mitras insightful political analysis notwithstanding, this assertion is perhaps unjust.          
	In the years following the second world war, the undivided Communist Party of India led armed rebellions in Telangana, Tripura and Kerala. This could arguably brand them as ultra-Left. However, the radical, B.T. Ranadive, was subsequently demoted. When the Sino-Indian war broke out, a number of left-wing leaders were believed to be pro-China. In 1964, 32 CPI members walked out of a national council meeting, precipitating a split in the Communist party of India. They were riled by the sympathies shown by the then CPI chairman, S.A. Dange, towards the Congress government. At the Tenali convention, which marked the inauguration of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), a large portrait of Mao Zedong presided over the proceedings. Such sentiments may well be seen as ultra-Left.          
	The CPI(M) was further polarized and in 1967, the peasant uprising in Naxalbari was led by hardliners such as Charu Majumdar and Kanu Sanyal. In 1968, the hardliners formed the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, which would later foster other militant Maoist groups. The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), which, under Kanu Sanyal, broke away from AICCCR in 1969, had a strong affinity with the government in China. Both the splits, the formation of the CPI(M) in 1964 and the breaking away of hardliners in 1968, seem to have been dictated by a closeness to the Maoist doctrine.          
	Finally, Mitra expresses concern over the disintegration of public sector units in India. Ironically, the establishment of PSUs was largely an initiative of Congress governments. A move to control the onslaught of big business houses, the PSU in India has been a partial success. It would appear that, all things considered, the Congress, or the Right, has been more socialist than the traditional Left in India.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Chandan Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra has reminded the Left to be consistent with the idea of class struggle, and warned it of the dangers of uniting with the Central government to fight the ultra-Left. The Left, in Mitras opinion, has increasingly aligned itself with the Centre instead of protesting against measures taken by the government that have become burning issues in present-day India. Presumably then, the Left joining the United Progressive Alliance government in 2004 was a historic blunder.          
	But if objective reality is taken to be altered, Mitra must delineate the new nature of class and of class struggle that the Left is to undertake. What role will capital play in this class struggle which, evidently, must be taken up by the governments of West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura? There seems to be some confusion between theory and practice, since the Left should ideally sustain a dialectical struggle against the existing structure. If the objective reality has changed, so should the form and content of this struggle.          
	The Left, apparently as a result of its inner weaknesses, created a vacuum that was filled by the ultra-Left. This raises the question as to whether a fresh synthesis between the Left and the ultra-Left is possible in the future. It is hoped that Mitra will explore in greater detail what role the Left, ultra-Left and Right will play in the new form of class struggle that the author foresees in the country in the years to come.          
	Yours faithfully,        R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly             
	War over prices          
	Sir  The Supreme Court verdict on the dispute between Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Infrastructure Limited and Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Limited is silent on the price of the gas itself (Mukesh wins gas game, May 8). The apex court limited itself to the observation that the government kept assets such as natural gas in trust for the people and that it has the right to decide the price. The two companies had been warring over the price at which RIL would supply gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin to RNRL. The latter had objected to the price fixed by the government in 2007  $4.2 per million British thermal unit.          
	The apex court could have directed the government to go in for a detailed reappraisal of the gas pricing. Having already spent so much time on the issue, a few more months and greater effort could have been worthwhile. Such an injunction would have taken care of any loopholes that can be targeted in the future for further interrogation or litigation.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

	OUR KIND OF TRAITOR By John le Carr, Penguin, Rs 299        
	In his Notes on the Novel, the Spanish philosopher, Jos Ortega y Gasset, observed that for us as readers soon adventures by themselves lose attraction and what then pleases us is not so much the fortunes of the personages as their self presence; we enjoy living immersed in their world or atmosphere. Such a perception might appear to run directly counter to our expectations of the spy thriller, a genre with a clear Aristotelian preference for action over character, suspense over stasis. Nevertheless, it expresses just what John le Carrs readers have come to feel about the espionage novel of which he is so unquestionably the late-20th -century master. At a certain point in the Smiley epos, we decided that we didnt really care what happened, so long as Smiley and Karla could face each other for ever across the bleak wastes of Cold War Europe.        
	That time is past, and all its aching joys are now no more. Le Carr, having survived the war, must now find ways to survive the peace. Like Graham Greene before him, he has been doing this with all the intransigence and anger of a writer never at ease in the new dispensation, bringing the formidable artillery of the spyhunters paranoia to bear on the crimes of global capital. His latest book, Our Kind of Traitor, spectrally unites the characters, feeling, techniques and mannerisms of his classic, high period  the world of the Smiley novels  with the contemporary, monetary logic of late capitalism. If we have the eerie sense that The Honourable Schoolboy (1977) just misses meeting The Godfather Part III (1990), this is because le Carr himself, preternaturally sensitive to atmosphere and tone, always deflects the possibility of melodrama with an adroit, even uncanny, intuition of pathos, absurdity, and suffering.        
	The novel begins with a tennis match between Peregrine Makepiece, lately an Oxford don, holidaying in Antigua with his barrister girlfriend, Gail Perkins, and a Russian mobster and money-launderer known as Dima, attended by his family and friends. The entourage includes a fanatically religious wife, a beautiful and secretly pregnant 16-year-old daughter, two high-spirited sons, two small girls grieving for the death of their parents who were Dimas close friends, and various other bodyguards and hangers-on. Dima, large, impressive, rambunctious, affectionate, overbearing, and deeply sinister, is a figure completely outside the British couples experience. As a Russian billionaire, he does not even resemble the celebrated owners of English football clubs. This incredibly played-out encounter ends in an approach by Dima to the British secret service through Peregrine (not unnaturally for a Russian even minimally informed of Cold War history, he thinks that all Oxbridge dons are spies). As it happens Peregrine is not a spy, but he feels himself honour-bound to pass on Dimas request, through a colleague who is indeed a recruiter, to an organization of which he vaguely, left-liberally, disapproves.         
	It is at this point that le Carrs novel, having thrown us off balance by the real oddness of that initial encounter between two innocent, highly-educated, idealistic representatives of a social class largely unacquainted with war, crime and danger, and a member of a Russian criminal brotherhood or vory, who has spent 15 years of his youth in the Gulag but now has the billionaires entry to all the tables in Europe, suddenly rediscovers its own past. The novels middle section offers a brilliant, but off-centred and nostalgic, recreation of the staple of le Carrs classic plot, the debriefing and briefing of the potential agent in a London safe house. Those entrusted with this task, the angry, anti-establishmentarian Hector, the unhappy Luke, the enigmatic Yvonne, are themselves anachronisms, throwbacks to a service past that we thought was gone for ever. It is here that we taste, with Peregrine and like Persephone, the bitter pomegranate seeds that will keep us prisoner, for at least our shadowy half-lives, in the underworld of spies and handlers, secrets and codes, assumed identities and language games.        
	This period of training builds up to a second, planned meeting between Peregrine, Gail and Dima, with his severely damaged family, at the French Open final in Roland Garros. Roger Federer is playing Robin Sderling  in 2008, not 2009  so Peregrine, a Federer devotee, has something to celebrate. What is played out in the background of this performance, however, is a murky international plot involving some of the most powerful, wealthy and corrupt men in the world, including British politicians and public servants. In a long interview he gave to Amy Goodman on Democracy Now! on October 11, 2010, le Carr said, You have to bear in mind that when Lehman Brothers wasnt going to function anymore and the big banks werent lending to one another, back at that terrible time, $352 billions of illegal money were then tacitly released upon the market, and that was about the only money people were lending to one another. So, money laundering is not some distant fantasy. Its actually how you handle the profits of extortion, tax evasion, criminal conspiracy and huge quantities of drug money. Not only is money laundering universal, le Carr suggests, but too much is invested in it for the efforts of small men like Peregrine and his oddball secret service colleagues who hope to name and shame their political superiors, to succeed.        
	This is not so dark a novel as its predecessor, A Most Wanted Man (2008), nor is it as deeply melancholy as the best work of le Carrs late period, The Constant Gardener (2001). Nevertheless, it manifests the same corrosive conviction of human wickedness, together with an extraordinary, nave power of inducing belief in innocence, goodness, and love. The second set of concerns has always been at the heart of le Carrs fiction, but not the first. Theorizing late style, Edward Said cited Theodor Adornos account of Beethovens late works as negative and catastrophic: devoid of sweetness, bitter and spiny. Le Carrs late style, a style that has evolved to suit his late-period art, is not wholly bitter, but it is uncompromisingly moral. Paradoxically, it was the early, straight spy fiction which offered a complex, indeterminable mixture of good and bad, without villains or heroes. His late novels choose large targets  armaments manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, terrorists, money-launderers  and they leave us in no doubt that the principals in these large operations are profoundly wicked men. Disturbingly, they also imply that we are all to some extent complicit in such evil.

	Democracy has always been the unique selling point of the Hamid Karzai government. Its proven ability to hold elections  four times in six years  may now be its only redeeming feature, given that it has failed the country and its international backers in every other way. Yet, the recent parliamentary elections in Afghanistan may not do much to improve the prospects of the country or its political head. Like the presidential elections last year, the elections to the Wolesi Jirga or parliament are mired in serious allegations of fraud. There are more than 4,000 applications before the electoral complaints commission alleging bribery, threat, bogus-voting and other kinds of fraud. Apart from delaying the results for months, the allegations harm the credibility of the Karzai government and do disservice to the aspirations of those who braved violence to cast their votes. There has been a significant fall in the number of voters in the parliamentary elections, which, unlike the presidential elections, were devoid of the momentum for change. The lack of interest among the voters is alarming, and if the Wolesi Jirga turns out to be as ineffectual as expected, there might be nothing to stop the people from turning their backs on a political system that is Afghanistans only hope against chaos.         
	Mr Karzai has to remember that it is a functioning democracy, and not just a mammoth army and police force, that is his countrys safeguard against being swamped by the Taliban or being occupied perpetually by international forces. Yet, his government, which has taken major strides in building the strength of the army and the police (who conducted the elections), has made no attempt to rid the administration of corruption or decentralize governance. As with the presidential elections, former warlords, ethnic leaders and a motley group of self-interested parties tried to grab their piece of the political cake during the parliamentary elections. Mr Karzai has had little control over the international game being played over Afghanistan. In spite of his objections, he has had to accommodate Pakistans strategic interests in the region and the changed priorities of the United States of America. Presently, the president is trying his best to reach out to Iran and to India to uphold his countrys, and his own, interests. A strong democracy at home would be better guarantee for Mr Karzai and for Afghanistans sovereignty.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HUNTING GHOSTS                                                          
	One of the worlds largest film archives was founded by a ghost hunter and psychic researcher, among others, who was as obsessed with getting to the bottom of the Great Indian Rope Trick as with preserving films for posterity. What Harry Price started in 1935 are now the archives of the British Film Institute, celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. It was in the same year, 1935, that Pramathesh Barua made, and played the lead role in, a Bengali version of Devdas. But a fire in Calcuttas New Theatre studios destroyed all the Indian prints of this film. Only one exists in the Bangladesh film archives now, though nearly half of even this print is destroyed. So, the link between hunting ghosts and keeping archives that Price and his film library embodied  luckily, it took on a life of it own that thrives to this day  is not just a piece of historical curiosity. It is part of the challenge, and pathos, of archiving films and cinematic ephemera  in fact, of archiving anything at all.        
	So the eye stops with mixed feelings at a recent insertion in the papers by the government of India. It is an appeal for all kinds of stuff for a national museum of Indian cinema to be set up by the government, addressed to film enthusiasts, studios, producers, film companies, cinema lovers and curators. They are being requested to donate  and thus cease to be the right holder[s] of  everything from films and sound tapes to books and phonographs. It all sounds rather quaint and touching, even quite exciting, until one starts thinking about the existing national museums  from the Indian Museum in Calcutta to the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi, and other sorry places like the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, the state archives, or the state-owned storage spaces where priceless Indian artworks (the Tagore paintings, for instance) languish. Why should private collectors give their beloved collections to a State that has shown little more than indifference (at best) and criminal destructiveness (at worst) when it comes to preserving the invaluable material traces of the nations past?        
	In 2003, a fire broke out at the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune that released a multitude of ghosts to be hunted in vain by the Harry Prices of this country. Among the 4,000-odd, nitrate-based, pre-1950 films destroyed in that fire were such gems as Achhut Kanya and Alam Ara, the first Indian talkie made in 1931 and rendered unwatchable now by a chain of negligence that ultimately led to the Central ministry of information and broadcasting, then headed by Sushma Swaraj. Without the archival scruples, restoring skills and munificence of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the BFI and the University of California, Santa Cruz, among others, a similar fate would have befallen many of Satyajit Rays films. Sadly, the words Indian and national, when joined to museum, are yet to strike a note of anything other than doom in the hearts of those who know and value what archives are about.

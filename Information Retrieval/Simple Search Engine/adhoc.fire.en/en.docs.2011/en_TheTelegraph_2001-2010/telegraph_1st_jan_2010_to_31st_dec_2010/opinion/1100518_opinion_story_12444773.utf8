                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STAND UP AND BE COUNTED                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The ruling United Progressive Alliance is in the midst of a Mad Hatters scorching summer tea party, an ouster party. All factions within the Congress as well as within alliance partners are playing a bizarre version of a treasure hunt as they hurtle about discrediting one another, some desperately using the occasion to clear the boulders along the path to make way for vested interest groups from the commercial sector to get back in the act of raping Indias natural resources despite the legal ban. From treasure hunt to musical chairs to passing the parcel, the intelligent, uninitiated in the sinister ways of Indian politics, are the losers in all the games. Those who have failed India for decades are winning, as they furiously use every mistake, every error of judgment, every word spoken out of turn to their advantage, ensuring thereby that each move away from the corrupt status quo of decades is killed before it can take root.        
	Big businesses, which were restrained by the ministry of environment, have been using every trick in the book to derail the carefully calibrated renewal of the rule of law in this sector. Now they are working overtime to get Jairam Ramesh removed from his position immediately, or most definitely when his Rajya Sabha nomination comes to an end. They have had a great deal to lose because of the notings against their mining operations in sacrosanct areas, hydel works in the wrong places, roads cutting through precious forests, and coal mines on the periphery of the homes of our gods. For such commercial interests, Rameshs foot-in-mouth has come like manna from the heavens. What is the larger game? Who is involved with whom? Is everyone together in the larger charade, pretending to play one against the other as they mock us all? Can we trust any leader or utterance from their lips?                
	Bold decisions        
	Shashi Tharoor has gone. Will Jairam Ramesh go as well? Why did the prime minister protect A. Raja? Why does Sharad Pawar get away with the enormous incompetence of his ministry, of its delivery systems and more? Is ineptitude and corruption, malpractice and manipulation, the privilege of the partners? Are Congressmen mere scapegoats because the coalition must live out its term? Are we going to be left with aging failures, self-serving men and women who were unable to deliver civil society despite being around in the political arena for decades? Will corruption triumph over all else? The ruling leadership seems to be tied up in knots, unable to move.        
	Cut to the British political space. A coalition of two disparate parties, two young, energetic leaders who hit the ground running. Gordon Brown and family walk out of 10 Downing Street with great dignity, and David Cameron enters. Both leave Buckingham Palace in their cars without the red light and outriders, with no stoppage of regular traffic on the streets of London. So civilized. In India there are endless excuses and oodles of greed to stay on in State-funded accommodation with all its free trappings. The ill-mannered gait, strut and behaviour of our leaders, even of those who professed before they came to power that the trappings were ugly and unnecessary, are unforgivable. The red light and screeching siren are symbolic of faulty and fractured governance and a septic body politic.        
	Our ancient leadership, stuck in predictable grooves, looking to commerce and calling it development, needs to introspect. The clean and honest among them need to voluntarily step down if they are not willing to stand up and take a call on corruption that is rampant and corrosive and is attacking the citizens with impunity. What is the point of having good people if wrong always prevails? Is this the mantra of governance in India?

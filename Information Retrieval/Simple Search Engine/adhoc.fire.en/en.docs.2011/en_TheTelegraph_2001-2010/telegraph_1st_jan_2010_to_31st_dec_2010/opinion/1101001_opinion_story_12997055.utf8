From the 1780s till 1814, he travelled extensively, conducting military surveys, and accumulating the drawings, maps and manuscripts that now make up the Mackenzie Collection. In 1815, he became the first surveyor general of India. Mackenzie had a group of Calcutta-based assistants mdash; natives as well as Europeans mdash; who collated and copied his collections. In ILLUSTRATING INDIA: THE EARLY COLONIAL INVESTIGATIONS OF COLIN MACKENZIE (1784-1821) (Oxford, Rs 2,750), Jennifer Howes resurrects this fascinating archive containing a wealth of information on pre-colonial and early colonial India.

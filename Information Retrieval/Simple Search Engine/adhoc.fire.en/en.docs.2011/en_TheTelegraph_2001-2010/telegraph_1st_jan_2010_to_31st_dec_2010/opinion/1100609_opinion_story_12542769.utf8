	The fact that Srinagar had to come to a standstill because of the security arrangements during the prime ministers visit to Jammu and Kashmir shows how far the state is from returning to even a semblance of normalcy. These conditions only underline the importance of the visit. There were two statements that the prime minister made which are significant because they are suggestive of paths that might lead to the restoration of normalcy to Indias most troubled state. The first of these statements went out as a warning to the security forces regarding violation of human rights. There have been too many reports about the way the police and the army often ignore and ride roughshod over the established codes of conduct. The prime minister made it clear that allegations of such violations would not be treated kindly. Such a step could be the first and essential step to bring back the rule of law in Jammu and Kashmir. The people of the state have suffered for too long conditions that are best described as war-like.        
	The other statement was the declaration that the government was ready to talk to all those people who are against terror and violence. This might look like a statement emphasizing the obvious, but in the context of Jammu and Kashmir it has a point perhaps worth making. The first condition for participating in a negotiation process must, by definition, be an abandoning of any kind of advocacy of violence and terror. It cannot be expected that the government of India will parley with groups that are using violence against it or are advocating the use of such methods. The government has made a similar point in its attempts to open a dialogue with the Maoists. If todays terrorists want the State to end its counter-insurgency measures, it must also create a modicum of goodwill by abjuring violence. The problem is that such reciprocal gesture is not always forthcoming. This is what the prime minister called, in another context, a trust deficit. The prime minister has suggested a way to make up that deficit.

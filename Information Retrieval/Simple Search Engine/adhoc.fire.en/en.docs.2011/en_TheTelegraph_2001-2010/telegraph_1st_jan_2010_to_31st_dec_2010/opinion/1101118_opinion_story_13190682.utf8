The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fear of history
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FEAR OF HISTORY                                                                  
	Recently, I came across a cartoon of Dennis the Menace looking at a photo album and saying, This brings back memories I never had. For me, a 1983-born, the cartoon summarizes Ayodhya. The demolition of Babri Masjid appeared before me as a half-page-wide news headline. The only thing that disconcerted me back then  in 1992  was the size of the font.        
	Since then, images, words and visuals related to the mosques destruction have created in me an inconsistent and impersonal sense of repulsion towards communal injustice. Perhaps it is convenient and politically correct to feel this repulsion. Ayodhya was someone elses memory that affected me somewhat, but never really became my own. I have often tried to understand my detachment from this issue. Is it because I am an atheist? But Ayodhya is an issue more political than religious, and in more senses than one.        
	Perhaps it was a broader fear of being, or not being, slotted into a political identity. Every generation has people who make up their minds quickly and people who wait for a pertinent reason. For my generation, the wait has stretched too long; Godot has never arrived. An inexplicable fear of not belonging anywhere politically has given way to either desperation or apathy. But history has not left us alone. Facebook communities such as We support the Ayodhya verdict as it is and want to move on (resonating with a strange exhaustion) and No more tension due to Ayodhya. We want Peace (echoing a desperate search for a fairytale-like all is well ending) hold up to us broken pieces of a mirror with which we must now solve a jigsaw puzzle.        
	It is not easy to forget, even if the memory belongs to someone else. It is not easy to look away when power structures show themselves shamelessly in a court verdict. Although peace is the buzzword that beckons urban youngsters to candlelight marches and makes them feel opinionated, the daunting task of facing political realities often shatters this idyll. The Ayodhya verdict is one such instance. The young have reacted to the verdict with strongly polarized opinions, but a struggle is apparent in the reactions notwithstanding the sides taken. This struggle is that of memory against forgetfulness  a struggle against the immensely powerful myth of an apolitical cohort of disco-hopping youngsters. The struggle has been painful, given that moving on would have been so heartbreakingly expedient.        
	Ayodhya reminds me of Toni Morrisons Beloved. The verdict stands before us just like Beloved stood before Sethe  a piece of history that we would like to forget but cannot quite manage to deny. Like Beloved, this history is dispossessed  it has claim but is not claimed. And yet, just like her, it has stretched its arms to embrace us in a possessive and consuming claim. I face it bewildered, wondering if I will ever be able to hold it as my own. As I wait for a decisive surge, the fear of context, and that of not having a context, holds me in a cold and fateful grip. There is somewhere a desperate urge to slight the issue and escape its profound weight, but frivolity is not always a medicine for fear.                    ADHEESHA SARKAR

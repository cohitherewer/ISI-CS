	Looking over the great wall                
	To the last bullet: The inspiring story of Braveheart  Ashok Kamte (Ameya, Rs 300) by Vinita Kamte with Vinita Deshmukh reveals lesser known facts about the life and death of a brave and competent police officer. Ashok Kamte, the additional commissioner of police, east region, Mumbai, fell to terrorist bullets during the November carnage. But his death, and the circumstances that led to it, remained shrouded in mystery for a while. Here, the journalist, Vinita Deshmukh, helps Kamtes wife weave together her husbands final moments near the Cama hospital. But this is not just the story of a courageous officer and his colleagues  ATS chief Hemant Karkare and inspector Vijay Salaskar  taking on a superior enemy with limited resources. Vinitas chronicle is also an honest attempt to uncover the failures in the system that cost Mumbai the lives of three of its finest policemen. The fact that Vinita had to take recourse to the Right to Information Act to gain access to the chain of sequence of that fateful night indicates that attempts had been made to cover up a monumental failure. The anecdotes from Kamtes earlier postings  in troubled areas such as Bhandara, Satara and Sangli  establish his valour and humaneness in equal measure.                  
	 On in four: One day of magic and mayhem on the golf course (EastWest, Rs 195) by P. Surendra Prasad is supposed to tell us why our near and dear ones spend so little time at home and so much at the club in pursuit of the perfect swing. Four old men, well past their prime, spend hours at Delhis Golf Club practising the perfect birdie. But their stints at the greens are punctuated by more misses than hits, forcing the septuagenarians to share tales that are unlikely to amuse the discerning reader.                        
	Memories of life in Lhasa under Chinese rule (Penguin, Rs 450) by Tubten Khtsun has been written by a man who was imprisoned while defending the Dalai Lamas summer palace against the Chinese during a tumultuous event. After his incarceration, Khtsun survived four difficult years in prisons and labour camps, before spending nearly two decades in Lhasa as a class enemy. What is fascinating about this autobiography is that despite his personal hardship, Khtsun provides a balanced and objective account of life in occupied Tibet. Included here are the snippets of his sufferings in the notorious prisons, as well as a first-hand description of the trauma that accompanied the Cultural Revolution. Information pertaining to life in occupied Tibet is hard to come by, and is often unreliable. However, Khtsuns work, ably translated by Matthew Akester, provides a peek over the great wall that surrounds Tibet.                                  
	Desilicious (Orient, Rs 295) edited by The Masala Trois Collective is a collection of erotic writings subtitled, Sexy. Subversive. South Asian. It represents an intriguing literary attempt to trace the thematic, time-tested bonds between South Asian cultures and sexualities. The editors, Deborah Barretto, Gurbir Singh Jolly and Zenia Wadhwani, bring together essays, stories and poems to emphasize that the lines separating fantasy, memory and the erotic are constantly getting blurred and re-drawn. The contributors  men and women  often employ a personal tone in their narratives, and they have also tried to debunk the clichd representations surrounding South Asian sexualities. The flavour of the collection is certainly varied: Mehnaz Sahibzadas My Spicy Wagina is suitably risqu, The Reluctant Voyeur, by Rashmi Choksey, vaguely funny while Sandip Roys The Secret Life of Good Boys is heart-rending yet sweet. This is worth a read, even if just for once.

	It is a brave leadership of a political party that can recognize and address the twin and irreconcilable problems of economic growth and increasing economic inequality. The Congress party leadership, as is evident from the opening speech of its president, Sonia Gandhi, at the All India Congress Committee session, decided to tackle the two issues headlong. One reason for this is that the Indian reality does not allow any escape from the dilemma of trying to harness the growing prosperity of a section of the population without ignoring the poverty that stalks millions of citizens. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, the author of economic liberalization that ushered in the era of phenomenal economic growth in India, has consistently spoken of inclusive growth, a process that would enable the common man to enjoy the fruits of prosperity. The same phrase was used by Ms Gandhi in her speech. She also emphasized the urgent need to protect the environment from the onslaught of indiscriminate industrialization; she expressed her concern for the welfare of the tribal and of those who eke out a living from the forests. Her speech reiterated the Congresss commitment to expand various welfare schemes to assist the poor and the underprivileged. Such schemes inflate the exchequers subsidy bill whereas one of the main thrusts of the economic reforms is to reduce subsidies.        
	It is easy to detect that there are two contradictory pulls operating here. The contradiction could be seen as one between party and government. The Congress party, given its history and given its urge to win elections, cannot afford to turn its back on the aam admi and his welfare. Thus the Congress president spoke about the partys commitment to the people. It could be said that in her speech she was going back to the basics: the fundamental concerns that have driven the Congress ever since it has been at the forefront of Indias national movement. Thus Ms Gandhi, in the context of the recent court verdict on the Ayodhya land dispute, stressed the importance of secularism and of bringing to justice those who demolished the Babri Masjid. Her speech inter alia expressed commitment to the poor, to women, to secularism and to the environment. All these, it need hardly be said, are national concerns. Ms Gandhi was thus highlighting the Congresss position as a national party  the only party that is above sectoral concerns. Ms Gandhi refurbished the identity kit of the Congress. The nation will watch how the rhetoric translates into policies and praxis.

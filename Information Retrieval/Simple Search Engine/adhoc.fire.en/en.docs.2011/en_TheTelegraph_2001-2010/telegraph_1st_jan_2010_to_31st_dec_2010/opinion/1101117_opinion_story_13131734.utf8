                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ROUND THE BUSH                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	Nepal has no king. Nepal has no prime minister, no government, no constitution. All that Nepal has is a number of political parties, none of which commands majority support and hence cannot form a government on its own. Nor can they form a viable coalition because of the basic differences they have with one another. And Nepal has a huge population, which, only the other day, had overthrown the old order, hoping that a new future will follow. That has not happened, and nobody can say with any degree of certainty that a sizeable section of the same population will not shake their heads and say, Lets go back to royalty. Our problems will not be solved but at least we will have somebody to blame for our sufferings.         
	It is a situation not ideal for Nepal but very much so for two countries  China and Pakistan. Both countries had always been anxious at Nepal being, for geographic and historic reasons, tied to India more firmly than they would have liked. Now, in this situation of flux, both have the opportunity of unitedly egging on the anti-India forces that have always been active in the former Himalayan kingdom. This will not help bring any solution in Kathmandu, but New Delhi will have to suffer the continuous discomfort of having a restless and increasingly hostile neighbour.         
	The Maoists, with the largest number of elected representatives, have never had any love lost for India, which they see as an imperialist force. The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) does not go to that extent but also feels that Nepal has always had a raw deal from India. And then there are the groups of intellectuals who are once again demanding that the boundaries with India be re-drawn.                
	Second revolution        
	The specious argument is that since the Treaty of Sugauli no longer exists  the Indo-Nepal agreement of 1950 made all past treaties with the colonialists redundant  there should be a new look at the boundaries. Such an attitude can spell danger, especially since the forces in Nepal that cannot join hands to form a government are having no problems in coming together for India-baiting. This may well be the plank on which the Maoists and the CPN(UML) choose to unite, a process that will be aided if Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, agrees to make himself scarce. The other parties, of course, will not like this, but they are in no position to provide an alternative. As for New Delhi, with its limited options, it will perhaps be happier to see a government rather than no government, which encourages irresponsibility.        
	It is difficult to imagine that any such arrangement will last for long. The Maoists have their own agenda, which they cannot be expected to shelve for too long. Actually, the trouble lies squarely with them  they cannot be fitted into a scheme that they are dead against. They themselves know their problem, but how can they change themselves and their ideology? Right now, they are also trying to find a way out of the impasse but that will have to be, as far as possible, on their own terms. The CPN(UML) may agree upto a point, but what about the central demand that Maoist cadres be inducted into the army? Prachanda is unlikely to budge from this position unless his friends in Beijing tell him to do so.        
	Unlike the political parties and their leaders, the man on the street is eager for a solution to the current troubles in Nepal, since all government functioning has come to a stop. As the political class goes round and round the bush, may he not in exasperation want to break out and give Kathmandu its second revolution to restore monarchy? That possibility cannot perhaps be entirely ruled out. Particularly since he is not without friends in high places.

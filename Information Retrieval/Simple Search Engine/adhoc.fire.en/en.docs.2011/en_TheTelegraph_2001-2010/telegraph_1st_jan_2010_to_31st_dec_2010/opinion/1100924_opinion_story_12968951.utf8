	Saraswati park By Anjali Joseph, 
  HarperCollins, Rs 399        
	Every city has many cities within it. Some are mirrors, some mirages  at once solid and liquid, at once air and stone. Invisible cities that show themselves unexpectedly when you take a turn into a dimly lit lane from the busy main road, or take a short cut through an obscure alley. Every story has several stories hidden in it  stories that dwell on the margins. Anjali Josephs Saraswati Park both conceals and reveals these stories. The subdued, slow-paced narrative creates a faade behind which lie several startling tales of folly and fascination; they speak of a different cityscape lying beneath the surface of a glamorous metropolis.        
	The protagonist, Mohan, as ordinary as a man can be, collects old books that have scribblings on their margins. He cherishes the feeling of following in the footsteps of other readers. He looks at a text not as an aloof observer but as a keen participant. The author in him wants to write his own story, but hesitates to tread unaccompanied on the alien surface of a white sheet of paper. Mohan chooses to write instead on the margins of an old Mark Twain volume, How to Tell a Story and Other Essays. He is attracted to this book first by its title, and then, more compellingly, by its two-inch-wide margins: he seems almost grateful to find such a generous expanse next to the printed words. But what he writes does not have any connection to the printed text; it is not even a subtext or an extension. It tells Mohans story, which runs alongside Twains writing as a parallel narrative. The authors portrayal of Mohan in his strangeness incarnates the postmodern acceptance of different realities existing side by side.        
	Mohans obsession with margins is a reflection of his being. He avoids stubborn, one-dimensional truths  a trait that could be simplistically interpreted as escapism. Mohan is a sensitive man with an unusual, and almost extinct, profession of letter-writing. The gradual ripening of his bond with his nephew, Ashish, encourages him to start writing a story. The relationship between the two, though warm and loving, is fraught with a strange tension; much like the way Mohans relationship with his own stories remains passionate yet somewhat awkward. He stays cocooned in a shell of his own: not even his wife, Lakshmi, can fully comprehend his ways. Saraswati Park, the neighbourhood he lives in, seems to have been born out of his own imagination instead of being a real place.        
	Mohan plays a game of hide and-seek with Bombay. He resists the influences of conventional city life, yet fervently drinks in the flavour of the city. Mohan likes to read the familiar lanes and alleys rather than watch them. He reads not only places but also people: those who come to him to get their letters written. He tries to peek into their lives and guess their stories; sometimes he creates their lives inside his head. He looks at Bombay from an unusual angle, sitting under a tarpaulin shade and a gnarled, mythic-looking banyan tree; from his visions emerge invisible cities, layers of unknown lives, oozing from the cracks and creeks of a familiar Bombay.        
	Mohan, as the authors alter ego, has an eye that is sensitive to masked realities, to trivial details that bring to life stories from the margin. He is the frame that holds a canvas upon which many tales are written and rewritten  of Ashish, Lakshmi, Narayan and many others. These tales merge, clash and quarrel, eat into one anothers bodies, and yet hold their own. They often attack the reader with a throbbing directness, and sometimes obscure themselves playfully. The use of language is intelligent and insightful, and peculiarly suited to this amazing play of light and shade.

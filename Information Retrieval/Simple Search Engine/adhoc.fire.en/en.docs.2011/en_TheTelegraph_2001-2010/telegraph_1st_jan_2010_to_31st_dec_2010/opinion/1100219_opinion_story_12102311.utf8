The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A fine tribute to a great institution
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A FINE TRIBUTE TO A GREAT INSTITUTION                                                          Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar (below) and M.S. Subbulakshmi				                           
	Four Score amp; More: The History of the Music Academy, Madras By Sriram V. and Malathi Rangaswami, Westland for the Music Academy, Price not mentioned        
	There is good reason to celebrate the existence of the Music Academy, Madras. India is strewn with institutions which have been set up with enthusiasm and fanfare, but have quietly died after the passing of the original inspiration, or with the shrinking of funds, or of public apathy in general. In this dismal context, the academy shines. After 80 years, its prestige is undiminished, and it continues to maintain a distinguished record of fostering classical music and dance. It has learnt to live with the times and open its doors to all listeners, not only to the cultivated south Madras rasika. In a city with several hundred sabhas, it is still the academy, and of all the honours that can come the way of a Carnatic musician, the title, Sangita Kalanidhi, awarded by the Music Academy each year, is still the most coveted.         
	Four Score amp; More: The History of the Music Academy, Madras by Sriram V. and Malathi Rangaswami is a fine tribute to this great institution, released this last Chennai season. Well produced, and with a large number of photographs, it documents the early history of the academy and the interesting coincidence of growing nationalism, the teaching of music in universities and the growth of Madras as a cultural centre. The authors have made good use of their access to the academys archives. The book also gains from the fact that one of the authors has recently completed a doctoral thesis on the early history of the academy.         
	Of all the large issues with which the academy has been involved over the years, none has been as passionately fought as the dispute over Tamil Isai. It seems strange now that there could indeed have been a time when the singing of Tamil songs in a concert was the cause of such ferocious opposition, and even stranger that both sides of this dispute were represented by Tamil speakers  musicians, musicologists, educationists, politicians and prominent citizens of Madras, all joined the fray. The Tamil Isai movement scored an early victory by securing the support of M.S. Subbulakshmi, represented as always by her ambitious husband, and by being able to build its own hall. The academy continued to adopt a more national posture, seeking even to invite Hindustani musicians while deploring the practice of singing Tamil songs.         
	The skirmishes and counter-attacks that lasted through the early Forties are well documented. The matter finally rested when both sides realized that there was scope for the other to exist. In years to come, Subbulakshmi came to sing Telugu songs of Tyagaraja in her concerts at the Tamil Isai festivals, but by then the dispute was so long-forgotten that no one even seemed to notice.         
	The other great combatant in the academys affairs was Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar. Though recognized by the academy early in its history in 1938 as Sangita Kalanidhi, his relationship with the institution was tense. Clearly aware of his position as the pre-eminent vocalist of his times and acutely sensitive to perceived offences, he boycotted the academy at several different times, requiring adequate propitiation before returning to its stage.        
	Readers familiar with the great performers of the past will be delighted by the photographs. There is a particularly moving photograph of Karaikudi Sambasiva Iyer resting on a mat, strumming a veena placed across his chest.         
	If Four Score amp; More has a notable weakness, it lies in the differences in the writing style in the two halves of the book. The early years, until the late 1950s, are carefully, and chronologically, documented, giving a clear sense of how the institution grew and the issues with which it was concerned. This approach is abandoned for the period starting from the 1960s and, what is worse, reliance on the academys archives given up in favour of anecdote and gossip. This is unfortunate, especially in a book that is the official illustrated history of the Music Academy. Gossip is always fun but it cannot be made into a literary style. In fairness, not only the book under review but also many recent publications, both books and journals, including the otherwise excellent Sruti, have encouraged this regrettable trend.         
	It is also odd that no price is indicated for this important publication. It would be a pity if Four Score amp; More is meant only for private distribution. The book appears to have been privately sponsored but that is no reason for limiting its circulation. There is a great deal here of interest for music lovers, and the academy should see to a way of making the book widely available.

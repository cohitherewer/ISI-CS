                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CLUMSY AND CORRUPT                                  Malvika Singh                              
	When did the frame that held India together with some semblance of dignity and integrity begin to fall apart? That question needs to be asked. Looking back at the last few decades, it becomes clear that 1975, when the Emergency was declared, was the watershed year after which wholesale corruption and illegalities would become legitimate within the administrative system. In 1977, the first coalition was formed, made of disparate ideologies that desperately wanted to be in power rather than to guarantee excellence in governance. That lot never felt the need to revert back to democratic processes based on ethical norms enshrined in our Constitution. The babus, aided and abetted by their greedy and incompetent political masters, ensured the start of the rapid decline into anarchy.        
	Successive governments have merrily manipulated civil society by perpetuating the illegalities and defying the need for immediate reform and restructure. This has insulted one-billion-plus individuals who carry one of the finest legacies on this planet. There is only one real priority today  overhaul and ruthless reform of the corroded administrative system. Imagine how any new economic initiative will fare in this protected but absolutely inefficient, unproductive system. Imagine building a nuclear energy infrastructure with a clumsy and corrupt bureaucracy that has been caught with its pants down, often with its hands in the national till, breaking its own rules, over and over again. Today, with the internet and electronic media entering an ever-growing number of households, these babus, who thought they were safe in their opaque cocoons, are becoming increasingly vulnerable. Yet they continue to be impervious to the radical change that will soon engulf them and compel a reform. The petulance we see is akin to the heightened flame of a candle before it dies.                
	Radical reshuffle        
	India will never be able to contend and compete with China and other emerging States with its bureaucracy being what it is today. India will be chewed up because of its soft and vulnerable, dishonest and conniving, incompetent and intellectually ill-equipped steel frame. The political masters will have to be far more alert, demanding and correct. Accountability is at the core of good governance. Till failures are not hauled over the coals and suspended from service, India will continue its fast slide into decline. Apart from the babu and the politician who is served by the babu, every Indian  from rural to urban to metropolitan  believes that the babu is wholly responsible for the shameful state of affairs prevailing in India and Bharat. This is the consensus across caste, creed, faith and class.        
	There was a time when a prime minister would have forced the resignation of those involved in the grand scam that has been the preparation for the Commonwealth Games. Those at the helm of the Delhi Development Authority, the ministry of urban affairs that has consistently said, all is well, the chief of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and other such incumbents need to set the standard by demitting office for shaming the country. All the members of the organizing committee of the CWG should be interrogated.        
	The time has come for a radical reshuffle  Ambika Soni should revert to being minister for culture and restore what she had begun during her tenure. Indians need to have direct access to the minister for culture. To have a secretary operating as the de facto minister is unwarranted. Such a situation leaves no room for voicing legitimate grievances. The sports ministry should be given over to a middle-aged person, since those with experience have behaved shamefully.

	Different league                  
	Sir  The controversy surrounding the Indian Premier League is far from over, and the rot seems to have gone very deep (Milch India, April 26). The concerted efforts of the press and the government to entirely blame Lalit Modi for the problems are unacceptable. People should realize that the menace plaguing the IPL would not vanish with Modis removal. Other officials at the Board of Control for Cricket in India do not appear to be innocent either. Any attempt at cleansing should take into account the follies of not just Modi, but also of others involved in the saga.          
	Modis intentions never seemed entirely clean. It has been alleged that he was instrumental in ousting Jagmohan Dalmiya from the BCCI. Sharad Pawar bestowed Modi with the post of the IPL commissioner owing to their close ties. Given the astronomical sums involved, it is not surprising that Modi is now facing allegations of playing around with money. After the first IPL, Modi was showered with praise for being an excellent administrator and for his innovative idea. But what was not noticed was that Modi had created the league to suit his own business interests. Subhash Chandras Indian Cricket League could not find a toehold because of the sustained non-cooperation of the BCCI. It is not as if Modi invented the IPL alone. Chandras efforts show that other competitions based on a similar format had been tried out as well.          
	Until now, IPL auctions involving large sums of money were being carried out publicly. It is strange that the income tax department took no notice of the goings-on until now. Did it discover the irregularities because of the fallout between Shashi Tharoor and Modi, which led to the formers resignation? There had not been any attempt to investigate the source of the IPL funds earlier. The IT department should be pulled up for its callous attitude.           
	Even the income tax exemptions to the BCCI should be withdrawn. Tax exemptions that are granted to organizations allow them to use the profits to promote sporting activities. Exemptions are meant to finance the activities of sporting organizations that are short of funds. Is the cash-rich BCCI entitled to such tax exemptions? Nowadays, when corporate bodies are pouring money into cricket, providing tax exemptions to the BCCI does not make sense.           
	The tax collected from the cricket board could be used to build infrastructure for the country. However, given the manner in which the government is handling the IPL fiasco, it seems possible that the rich and the famous would be allowed to escape unscathed. If this prosperous league is to continue, it should be managed by the State. This will stop the corruption in this cricket league.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The IPL has become a huge success and has generated unprecedented profits (Bent and beautiful India, April 16). In times of frequent power cuts, matches are being held in flood-lit stadiums. People remained glued to their television sets, such was the craze for the league. However, as is evident now, the IPL is not free of sleaze. Politicians, filmstars and corporate heads are only interested in reaping profits from the league. But one cannot rule out the possibility that people from the underworld are also involved. The State needs to ensure that the IPL is, in no way, tarnished by the presence of the underworld.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Shashi Tharoors resignation over his alleged, and unacceptable, involvement in the affairs of a new franchisee in the IPL shows how steep and sudden his fall from grace has been. From contesting for the post of secretary-general of the United Nations to resigning from a cabinet post on charges of corruption  Tharoors career proves, once again, that ones actions, ultimately, make or break an individual.           
	Tharoors denial of his complicity in the episode involving the granting of sweat equity to Sunanda Pushkar exposes his naivety. The excuses given by Tharoor are an insult to the intelligence of the people of India. Tharoors overconfidence has become a bane for his political career, and has led him to believe that he can explain, or get away with, anything. He has not realized that in the process, his credibility has been eroded.          
	The IPL too should be criticized for several reasons. The likes of Lalit Modi appear to be taking undue advantage of its success. The money involved should not have affected cricket as a sport, but that is exactly what has taken place. The IPL is now entirely a mechanism for reaping profit. A thorough purge is required to cleanse it. The names of the bigwigs involved in these dirty dealings must come out in the open.          
	Yours faithfully,

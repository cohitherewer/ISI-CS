The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A president in the box
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A PRESIDENT IN THE BOX                                  The medias behaviour during Barack Obamas visit provokes Ashok Ganguly to wonder if freedom of the press has gone overboard                                            
	I was a bit under the weather, otherwise I was quite looking forward to participating in the India-US business meeting in Mumbai and listening to President Obama, and then travelling to Delhi to join the Indo-US CEO forum for discussions in Hyderabad House. Since I was unable to do so, I watched Barack Obamas visit as it was covered on television. What amazed me was that even before Obamas visit was to begin officially on Sunday in New Delhi, a particular section of the media, the English news channels on TV, began their harangues on what Obama should, or should not, say on his first day in India. I was particularly amazed as the channels had assembled fairly respectable panels of experts to participate in the debate. They were interrupted repeatedly and forced to agree with the channels views or, if they did not, were cut off in mid-sentence. The activities at the Taj Mahal hotel, the tributes to the victims of 26/11, the schoolchildren with whom the president and the First Lady celebrated Diwali, and the Town Hall session with a group of Bombay University students at St Xaviers College were conducted with far greater decorum, presenting insightful questions and confident interactions.              
	The medias pompousness in trying to dictate what Obama should or should not say was, to say the least, bewildering. Some elements of the media still appear to push India as a Third World country with a begging bowl, whining for favours, hand-holding and loving care from what used to be the 20th centurys most powerful nation in the world. Parts of the media get away with such conduct because there is no way of expressing public disgust at such atrocious behaviour from the media. I must hasten to add that, in contrast, one of Indias most popular English news channels conducted itself with far greater dignity and sense of contemporariness than it usually does.        
	I was hesitating to write this piece, but when I continued to watch the TV on Monday when the anchor, referred to earlier, had the temerity to instruct the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, on what he should discuss with Obama and what the issues were that would be top priority for the Indian public, I felt that freedom and sanctity of the press had gone overboard in India. I am compelled to write this piece in order to trigger a public debate.        
	Incidentally, nobody raised the AfPak issue from a global point of view. It is now becoming clear that the war against the Taliban and al Qaida cannot be won. The restoration of civil society and governance in Afghanistan looks increasingly remote because of nationwide corruption.              
	I wonder why the press has not raised the issue of the alarming scenario that would prevail if America were to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and, eventually, from Pakistan. What would happen to the nuclear arms and facilities in Pakistan when they fall into the hands of al Qaida and the Taliban, and how are the neighbouring countries going to face the consequences? An emerging grand alliance, almost unprecedented in history, will be in the interests of India, China, the United States of America, Iran, Russia and the Central Asian countries, enabling them to get together and find a way of preventing the collapse of a civil society. We do not have to be sympathetic towards the Americans, but we need to be realistic about what America is facing, which is not dissimilar to what happened in Vietnam.        
	I would strongly urge the section of the haranguing media to reflect Indias rising power and influence in the world, to reflect Indias challenges and not continuously plead with the US to save it from its marauding neighbours. The American society and economy today is more fragile than ever before. Obamas visit has a long-term mutual interest for India, rather than being a point-scoring match.        
	Ultimately, it is the government of India and the government of the US that will set the agenda for discussions between the two nations, and the media must be modest enough to accept the fact that they have a limited role, or no role, to play in this. They have, of course, the freedom to challenge, disagree with and reject the outcome, but they do not have a pre-emptive role in these matters.

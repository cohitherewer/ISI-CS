The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Silence, exile and cunning
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SILENCE, EXILE AND CUNNING                                  THIS ABOVE ALL: Khushwant Singh                          Lonely path                                        
	By a strange coincidence, James Joyce in his famous novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, wrote a few lines that are echoed in Rabindranath Tagores poem, Ekla chalo  Tread the lonely path written at about the same time. Joyces lines run as follows:        
	Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I would do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do and what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use  silence, exile, and cunning.        
	Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead him back towards Leeson Park. He laughed almost slyly and pressed Stephens arm with an elders affection.        
	Cunning indeed!, he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you!        
	And you made me confess to you, Stephen said, thrilled by his touch, as I have confessed to you so many other things, have I not?        
	Yes, my child, Cranly said, still gaily.        
	You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity too.                
	First attempt                
	I was rummaging through old notebooks and scraps of paper I had preserved when I came across my first attempt to translate Urdu poetry into English. It was with the help of Manzur Qadir, my closest friend during my seven years in Lahore (1940-47). We happened to be travelling in the same Polish ocean liner, Batory, which plied from Southampton to Karachi and Bombay. Most of the passengers were either Pakistanis or Indians. Manzur and I spent our days on the deck. He took out his favourite verses from the Deewan-e-Muhammad Iqbal by Allama Iqbal and explained what they meant. I chose one to try my hand at translation and showed it to Manzur to check for accuracy.        
	To the Creator did Beauty
  one day complain
  Why made Ye of stuff that
  doth wane?
  The world is like a Hall of
  Mirrors, answered He.
  A tale told to pass the 
  long night of eternity
  Since of changeable hues
  we are made.
  It is essence of beauty that it 
  must fade
  The moon overheard, she was not far
  It spread in the skies to the 
  Morning Star
  The Star told the Dawn, the Dawn 
  to the dew extended
  The secret of heavens thus to the
  earth descended 
  Tears filled the eyes of the flower on
  hearing what he had said
  The buds little heart burst with
  grief and bled
  Grief fled the garden in loud lament
  Youth that had come to sport, in 
  sorrow went.          
	Growth rate                
	We have controlled population
  growth and checked the price rise
  Which are now touching the lower
  skies.
  Amit Shah is innocent and his very
  look shows
  That he cannot kill a couple of flies,
  The Parliament functions normally
  And away from all business shies,
  Ms Mamata Banerjee is a great 
  railway minister 
  Who from the Maidan in Calcutta
  cries
  You the people of Delhi, Mumbai
  and Chennai
  Very safe in my hands your lives lie 
  But let me first, with some help from
  Naxalites
  To the chief ministership of Bengal
  rise.
  Bhishm Pitamah of the country, 
  M. Karunanidhi
  Will see to it before he dies 
  That for seven generations in his
  family 
  Every child a ministers chair 
  occupies
  And true to the maxim that there is
  lull before the storm
  Rather dormant Behenji Mayawati
  lies.
  So I can say on oath
  That in political morality and 
  service to the people
  Our netas have touched the point of
  highest growth.

	Q: My son, a college student, was recently charged with offences under the Indian Penal Code, following a false FIR lodged by another student. Can he get a passport? Can he get a job in a government or semi-government service?        
	A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta        
	A: Your sons application for a passport could be refused on the ground that proceedings against him are pending before a criminal court in India. As far as getting a government or a semi-government job, every organisation has its own by-laws and standing orders and these will determine whether he can get a job or not.        
	Q: My late father had gifted his residential property to my older brother and me in the 1970s. I am a non-resident Indian and my brother lives in Calcutta in another house. Recently, my brother claimed the entire house and locked it up, except two rooms where our mother now lives. How do I find out the legal status of the owners of this property? The original documents seem to have gone missing. Does my mother have any rights to this property?        
	P. Gangopadhyay, Australia        
	A: You could take the assistance of an advocate and conduct a search relating to the property in the registry office with the appropriate jurisdiction to find out the details of ownership. Once you get the particulars, you can apply for the certified copy of the original deed. If the property has been gifted to you and your brother, then your mother does not have any rights to it. But your brother and you are bound by law to provide her with maintenance, which includes residence.         
	Q: I had booked two duplex flats. The promoter began construction of our units after I had paid 60 per cent of the price. I learnt of a problem with the land deed when a bank refused me a home loan on it. Could I claim a refund on the ground that construction did not begin on time? Can I ask for the original deed to get the property searched?        
	Sangeeta Bubna, Calcutta        
	A: Before going ahead with any property deal, it is always prudent to conduct a search of the property to ensure its clear title. Claiming the refund of your money would depend on the terms and conditions of the sale agreement. You should have perused the title deed and all relevant property documents before booking the flats. However, you can still do so.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DIGNITY IN DIVERSITY                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Ever since the womens reservation bill won the vote in the Rajya Sabha, the most unlikely of men within the high offices of the Congress have been vociferously arguing against the bill, referring to it as defective. One minister went to the extent of saying that rotation of reserved constituencies could finally end up bringing close to 400 women parliamentarians. How wonderful that after 60-odd years of close to 500 men dominating our democracy, the roles could be reversed for the next 60 years. The Congress seems to be finding one explanation or another for derailing this bill from being placed for vote in the Lok Sabha despite adequate numbers supporting it. This is shameful. Will Sonia Gandhi pull the whip at the last moment or will she succumb to the soft-peddling of her party colleagues?        
	Whether perfect or not, the bill needs to be pushed through and instituted as an act. In time, it can be adjusted to meet changing conditions, and correctives can be introduced through experience on the ground rather than be delayed by insecure males pontificating on its merits and demerits. As for the other two crucial legislations  Right to Education and food security  both need to be fine-tuned and workable delivery systems need to be put in place. For this to be effective, administrative restructuring has to happen according to the reforms suggested by the Moily committee. Members of civil society need to partner their government counterparts and work together for transparent delivery of goods and services.        
	Here is an opportunity after 63 years to relook at, and reinvent, processes that empower Indians across all strata, in a concerted effort to make this nation a force to contend with, so that its phenomenal human resource adds value and takes an inclusive rate of growth to new heights. These potential acts could be used to showcase a fresh mechanism that will benefit those who have been exploited and neglected by the State till now.                
	Fresh thinking        
	This challenge is at the top of Sonia Gandhis agenda for India 2010. The determination of the Congress president to put hitherto-failed policies on the front-burner, and put pressure on the United Progressive Alliance government to actively address the existing problems, is amply clear. Will the government get its act together and start cleansing the system and the delivery process, making administrators down the line accountable?        
	Sonia Gandhi has understood, better than many of her colleagues, what the priorities must be for India and Bharat to grow and share equally, to ensure dignity of life and living. She has engaged with people who are committed to finding alternative solutions to rescue the India that lives below the poverty line. Ironically, more people are being added to the umbrella of BPL as privileged India develops and consumes more and more. Our planners need to rethink the economic structures and parameters within which they expect India to change and grow.        
	Empowerment brings responsibility and with those two ingredients in place, society feels secure and comfortable. It allows people to get on with their lives. Affirmative action is a positive sentiment but, in India, opportunist politics has abused what it stands for. Factional parties, regional satraps, divisive ideologies have come together to discredit political operations. Unwarranted behaviour in legislative assemblies and Parliament, crass lobbying and posturing, have presented Indian democracy as immature and untrustworthy, an unwieldy institution that needs restructuring. We need to look at the mechanics carefully and make urgent correctives, starting with whether first-to-the-post makes electoral sense in a complex and plural country such as ours.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNWARRANTED                                                    
	A knock on the door at dawn to serve an arrest warrant is a procedure that is immediately associated with a totalitarian regime. It became a grim fact in the life of Sunirmal Chakravarthi, the principal of La Martiniere for Boys, one of the oldest and prestigious schools of Calcutta. The charges against him have been brewing for a long time and Mr Chakravarthi had shown no signs of fleeing to escape the hands of the law. On the contrary, he has been busy carrying out his duty of running a school. Therefore, the drama created by the police remains shrouded in mystery unless the manner of arresting Mr Chakravarthi is taken as evidence of naked high-handedness on the part of the police. This suspicion is fortified by the fact that the charges framed against the principal were not at all serious: they did not warrant this kind of drama and show of authority. The explanation given by a senior police officer that since the offence was cognizable, the arrest was mandatory is disingenuous. It tries to avoid the issue of the manner and the timing of the arrest. The Calcutta Police is not known for its efficiency but is notorious for its occasional outbursts of high-handedness. In this case, it has outshone itself in its overzealous show of power and thereby disgraced itself.        
	Any discussion about the arrest of the principal of La Martiniere for Boys has to face the question of corporal punishment in schools. This practice, once widespread and now in disrepute, should be the subject of a wide societal debate. Where is the line to be drawn separating punishments required to discipline an errant child from deliberate acts of cruelty and torture? It can be no ones argument that school children should not be disciplined and punished. Neither can it be argued that a child should be the victim of acts of cruelty. Good school teachers know somewhat instinctively where the line is located; they act accordingly and thus earn the respect of their students. Unfortunately, a section of public opinion, under the guise of enlightened views, has veered round completely towards political correctness. What is worse is that this political correctness engenders a kind of intolerance towards alternative views of disciplining. This is not to absolve Mr Chakravarthi of all responsibility for his actions that may have been produced from his ignorance of the law. But there is no ground for treating him like a dangerous criminal as the police did.

	Unforgettable moments                  
	Sir  On May 24, 2010, the world of theatre lost one of its most vibrant and respected personalities, Shyamanand Jalan, when he succumbed to cancer (Good director of Calcutta, June 13). A legend, a magnanimous man, and a very warm-hearted human being, Jalan single-handedly revolutionized Hindi theatre in eastern India. He was a father figure to all performing artists of Calcutta. This septuagenarian had friends of all ages, ranging from six-year-old dancers at Padatik to former colleagues aged 85 years. He was Sir, Uncle, Shyamanandji, Dadaji, and to many of us, simply SJ. The overwhelming presence, passion and enthusiasm of this thespian could give teenagers a complex.          
	I, one of the founders of the group, Theatrecian, have been associated with Jalan for nearly 12 years. My first contact with Jalan was during a one-act play competition. He was then wheelchair-bound, yet he sat through the entire performance with the zest of a 12-year-old, applauding everyone and sending congratulatory notes backstage. I still remember his words to me  Tum mein aag hai, par kuch zyaada hi chattpatt ho (You have the fire, but are a bit too restless). Every time I met him, I had to introduce myself to him since he never seemed to remember my name. He would recall the details of my family, my address, car number, the brand of cellphone I was using, and so on, but never my name. In retrospect, I think that forgetting my name was a joke he loved to play on me.          
	Recently, I heard that Jalan and his wife, Chetna, were contemplating the revival of a project that had long been very close to their hearts. When they drafted my name as a possible team member for the project, I jumped with joy. I ran all the way to the Padatik office to meet Jalan, when I heard that he has been hospitalized. I was worriedly talking to my friend, Arindam Mukherjee, who runs many of Padatiks operation, when Jalan himself called from hospital to give directions regarding the venture. We were awestruck. Here was a man battling cancer, and he still had the zeal to check on the status of the ongoing project and render advice.          
	For Jalan, theatre was not about money or fame. He aimed to take Indian culture beyond boundaries, to learn more, and to value the artist within. His magnetism was such that wherever he went, hordes of people would follow him. He himself never asked for help but was ever ready to lend a helping hand to others. Jalans quick wit and poker-faced comments would give comedians a run for their money.          
	We cherish the special moments we shared with him. We are thankful that we had the fortune of being acquainted with such an exceptional person as Shyamanand Jalan.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Enough is enough          
	Sir  The murder of Madan Tamang and the incidents following his death remind one of the fact that once upon a time there used to be a civic administrative body in the hills which has now become oblivious of its duties out of fear of reprisal by a group of aimless activists (CID zeroes in on Tamang killer, June 9). At the beginning, when groups such as the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha were just rearing their heads in the hills, the administration had paid no heed. As a result of this inaction, these disruptive forces gained in strength, and captured the district administration, making the district magistrate and superintendent of police mere titular heads, so to say. The groups launched their own police forces and started running a parallel administration.          
	Senior State officials, let alone political leaders, rarely visit Darjeeling. The state administration just plays a wait-and-see game, participating in tripartite meetings that produce no result. After each such meeting, rowdiness usually increases in the hills. The shadow administration, as usual, keeps mum.          
	Paramilitary forces have been deployed to wipe out the Maoists, who are considered enemies of the State. Why should the untameable activists of the GJM, who, in all probability, masterminded the murder of Tamang, be spared then? The state and Central governments should seriously think about how long they want to pamper these volatile activists with their ever-changing political demands.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Sumitra De, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  After Madan Tamangs murder, there can be no reason to tolerate the GJM any more. Enough is enough. When Gorkhas themselves are after Gorkha blood, then what good can they possibly do for their community?          
	A committee should be formed in the hills with representatives from all factions, including the adivasis, over whose inclusion in the proposed Gorkhaland there has been much controversy lately. Every group should get the chance to voice its demands. Tripartite meetings henceforth should not have the GJM as the sole representative of the hill people. The party should be sidelined so that its power is curbed.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Animal world          
	Sir  The article, Unhappy ark (June 8), by Uddalak Mukherjee brings to light the dismal condition of the animals in the Alipore zoo. In place of the zoo, a park where animals move about freely in their natural environment can easily be created in Calcutta. The zoo authorities can learn some lessons in this regard from the Van Vihar National Park in Bhopal, which offers a unique opportunity to observe wildlife while creating awareness about it. The cages in Alipore zoo can give way to fortified enclosures. Greenery can be increased to attract more birds. Visitors can be let inside in small batches and given guided tours at specific hours of the day.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Meenakshi Sanyal, Calcutta

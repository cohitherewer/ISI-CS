                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SEASONS SPLENDOUR AND BIZARRE CLOTHING                                  DANCE: Kathakali Jana                                                  
	The processes that have shaped a modern identity for Bengals fine arts, dance included, owe much to Rabindranath Tagore. Under his spirited guidance, Santiniketans experiments with dance throughout the 1900s embraced Kathakali and Manipuri, daring to foray beyond their rigid classical limits, and flirted with folk forms. Tagores dance dramas ceaselessly sought to develop a distinctive contemporary dance vocabulary of their own.        
	Today, sadly, much of this sterling spirit of experiment is lost in self-serving mediocrity. Many of the citys dance outfits and institutions that engage in reinterpreting Tagore for modern viewers seem to be caught in a time warp, preferring to stick to age-old, worn-out expressions that Tagore himself would have been the first to spurn as repetitive and lacklustre. This years World Dance Day (April 29) offerings by Rabindra Bharati Universitys department of modern dance in the institutions august precincts featuring several ensembles only underlined this disturbing realization.        
	There was much to be desired in the performances of Krishnendu Roy and his group, Shatabdi Ballet Troupe, of Anupama and her troupe, and of Sourav Music School. It must be remembered that a foray beyond the well-defined frontiers of a classical form of expression paradoxically presupposes the highest degree of familiarity with the form itself. The above groups were patchy in their presentation, displaying an appalling lack of choreographic integrity, and resorting to tiresome movements that have been done to death by practitioners of what has come to be labelled  and censured for its mind-numbing monotony  the Rabindrik (Tagorean) dance style.        
	Sabyasachi and his troupes balletic interpretation of Tagore songs, grossly remixed versions of which were used for the purpose, was embarrassing in its lack of understanding of Tagores poetry. Admittedly, the dancers had a certain degree of poise and negotiated precise acrobatic movements with ease, but they did nothing to elucidate the songs they danced to, such as the profoundly spiritual Dariye achho tumi amar gaaner opaare. And the relevance of the little ballet dresses (picture) and the bizarre, badly-tailored mens clothing in the context of the songs chosen was totally lost on the reviewer.        
	Fortunately, however, the evening had its moments of triumph as well. Sruti Performing Troupes excerpts from Gitanjali, for instance, made a bold statement. Natyaloks exploration of Nrityero taale taale was delightful in its balance of vigour and fluidity, technique and inspiration, saying much for its accomplished choreographer, the Kathakali exponent, Kalamandalam Piyal Bhattacharya.        
	Sapphire Creations chose an excerpt from the monsoon section of their acclaimed production, Rituranga, for the occasion. The dancers consummate use of space and the liquid grace of their movements brought alive the romance of Badol diner pratham kadam phool and the vivacity of Hriday amar nachere aajike, allowing the senses to be pervaded by the splendour of the season.

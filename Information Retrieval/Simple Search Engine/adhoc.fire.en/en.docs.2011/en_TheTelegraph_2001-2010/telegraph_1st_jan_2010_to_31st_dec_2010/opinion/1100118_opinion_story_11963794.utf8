	All his life Jyoti Basu had only two identities. One was that of a communist and the other that of a Bengali bhadralok. Basu took to communism in his youth in England. Before he decided to devote his life to the cause of communism, Basus career had followed a path familiar to many sons of the bhadralok: St Xaviers School, Presidency College and Lincolns Inn. What precisely drew him to communism was never clear, but he spoke often of the influence of Harry Pollitt and R.P. Dutt, the two leaders of the Communist Party of Great Britain. His commitment to communism grew not from any deep understanding of the theoretical issues of Marxism and communism. His response was more emotional. He wanted, as a member of Calcuttas privileged, to do something for the downtrodden. But the stamp of privilege never left Basu. It was evident in the glistening white dhoti and panjabi he always wore, in his shoes, which were invariably polished, in his swift and confident gait, in his occasional bursts of arrogance and  dare one say it?  in his fondness for good food and the sundowner.        
	It could not have been easy for Basu to keep intact both these identities, since the ideology of one and the class content of the other inevitably pulled in opposite directions. This contradiction was most strained perhaps during Basus days in the cold when, as a firebrand Opposition leader, Basu directed workers and West Bengals sprawling white-collar sector to go on strikes and go-slows. On the streets of Calcutta, buses, trams and public property went up in flames in displays of mob violence that Basu and his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), led. It seemed then that beyond the destruction lay the revolution: the fire and violence were necessary purifiers. What such acts perpetrated in West Bengal were decline and decay. They thus created the perfect ambience for the bhadralok  born under the sign of decline as a class. Basu seemed, in the second half of the 20th century, the agent of that sign. Thus the contradiction appeared to be resolved, and the resolution produced Basu, the chief minister.        
	As chief minister, Basu nurtured the Left Front and so ensured that the Left votes in West Bengal were not split. This kept the Left on a winning streak. There was also the realization that the real basis of power in West Bengal lay in the countryside. The neglect of Calcutta and the agitational politics that Basu had spearheaded resulted in the flight of capital, a complete erosion of work culture and irresponsible trade unionism. The consequences of the scarcity of investments dawned on Basu as India entered the era of economic reforms and as socialism collapsed. In 1995-6, he engineered a volte face and decided to welcome capital back to West Bengal. The result was not a resounding success. Realism, Basus principal asset, won for him the respect of politicians across the ideological spectrum. In 1996, when there was a search for a prime minister to lead a non-Congress, non-Bharatiya Janata Party coalition, Basu was the natural choice. But here the CPI(M) rendered unto Basu the most unkindest cut of all. The party refused to join the government, and that ruled out Basus getting Indias top job. Basu described his partys decision as a historic blunder: strong words from an utter loyalist. Basu never forgot the lost opportunity. Towards the end of his life, he pleaded to be let off the harness on grounds of ill health. But he soldiered on in the politburo. He lived to see the first major electoral defeat of the Left Front in West Bengal. History will not be kind to Basu and his tenure as chief minister. He will be remembered as West Bengals evergreen communist and bhadralok chief minister who did precious little to pull the state out of decline.

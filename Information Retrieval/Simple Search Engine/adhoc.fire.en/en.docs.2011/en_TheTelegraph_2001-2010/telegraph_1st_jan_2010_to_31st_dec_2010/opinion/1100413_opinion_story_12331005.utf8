	The parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka are over and have produced an utterly predictable result. With President Mahinda Rajapaksas principal political adversary, Sarath Fonseka, firmly behind bars and the opposition in complete disarray, the general elections held out no special surprise either for the voters or the watchers of the political scene in Sri Lanka. The voter apathy was evident in the low turnout  a mere 55 per cent compared to 74 per cent and above during the presidential polls. It can be construed that a sizeable percentage of the absentee voters were Sinhalese because there has been no major variation in the voting pattern of the population in the north and the east, where the voting percentage has dropped further from a dismal 20 per cent (it was slightly higher for the east in January). It is significant that together with the predominantly Tamil people of these regions, a largish percentage of the Sinhalese too now think that it is futile to exercise their franchise under the given circumstances, which are not too different from those which existed prior to the defeat of the Tamil rebels. The country continues to be under the state of emergency and there is no major improvement on the front of either civil or political rights.         
	But far from being humbled by the voter disinterest, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance is feeling emboldened by the polling exercise which has given it another decisive victory. The results, delayed by the repoll in two constituencies, may fall short of the two-thirds majority which the UPFA had been gunning for, but the victory is enough to convince the Rajapaksa administration that it has the popular mandate to tinker with the constitution in order to perpetuate its rule for a time way beyond 2017. In the next few months, there is no doubt that the government will concentrate its efforts on making this ambition possible. It will also try to concentrate on the economic alchemy that will support its political experiments for it cannot afford to have the entire nation at its back for failing on the economic front too. Together, all this may see the question of political settlement for the Tamil minorities being pushed to the sidelines. Of course, provincial elections will be held in the north. But like the elections in the east, they may not do anything to further reconciliation or democratic choice in Sri Lanka.

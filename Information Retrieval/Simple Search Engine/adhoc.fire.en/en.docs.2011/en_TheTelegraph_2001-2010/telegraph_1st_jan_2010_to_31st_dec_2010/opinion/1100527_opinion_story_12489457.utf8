	Its hard to define what a sense of place actually means, but Gertrude Stein summed up its absence nicely when she said, theres no there there. Its safe to say that theres plenty of there in Bombay; not only does the city have more than its fair share of iconic landmarks, but it also has a style, a swagger, a way of speaking that has been storied in film and fiction.        
	As someone from Delhi, Im acutely conscious of the fact that Delhis neighbourhoods, its sense of itself, its historical landmarks, dont resonate with outsiders in quite the same way. Why is this? Delhi is the older town, historically the grander metropolis, and politically the much more powerful city. William Dalrymples history of the rebellion in Delhi, Ahmed Alis Twilight in Delhi show us a city that once represented historical processes larger than itself. And you can see that in movies like Delhi-6, there are worlds to be evoked, theres a nostalgia to be harnessed in the service of fiction.        
	So why is it that its Bombay that captures the pan-Indian imagination? The only time Delhi is used as a metaphor is in the course of political sloganeering, when one politician or the other says Dilli chalo. Netaji Subhas Bose pioneered the slogan, and a bunch of less distinguished imitators like L.K. Advani have echoed it. I can, without thinking too hard, think of three big recent English language books (Sacred Games, Maximum City and Shantaram) that take Bombay as their text. And this is a fairly thin sliver of Indian literary production: if we were to get started on the popular fictions that shape India  the Hindi films that Bombay makes which, in their turn, make Bombay  the list would be endless.              
	Cities become iconic, their landmarks become resonant when they are overlaid with events, stories, memories, nostalgia. Delhi has more historically resonant places than you can shake a stick at  Lal Qila, India Gate, the Jama Masjid, Nizamuddin, Tees January Marg  and there was a time when their stories were told. But these were stories about the past. Never has the passing glory of a city been more energetically and plaintively lamented than in Delhi after the Mutiny. From Ghalib to Ahmed Ali, Delhi was storied in its decline. Then it became the capital of a new empire more than half a century after it ceased being the capital of the old one and it became two cities: a superseded Old Delhi and a British New Delhi. The first declined, the second grew, but it grew anonymously as bureaucratic towns do, driven by status and power more than commerce or creativity, taking its place with Washington DC, Canberra, Pretoria, as a capitol town.        
	Its landmarks became tourist destinations cordoned off from the present: the air inside each monument older and more brewed than the air outside. No one told new stories about them. Partition and the great wave of displaced refugees became a theme in the odd novel, but the contemporary city remained untold, smaller than the sum of its parts. Occasionally, Lodi Gardens or Rajpath would figure in a movie, but nothing like the way in which the Bombay film has rendered the landmarks of Bombay iconic. Thanks to the Bombay film, when I think of the police, I see a Bombay police uniform though Ive lived my life in Delhi.        
	Bombay was untouched by the defining event of 19th-century India: the rebellion of 1857. At a time that saw Delhi traumatized and diminished, Bombay closed in on, and then overtook, Calcutta as the second city of the Empire. Opium fortunes saw islands joined, land reclaimed from the sea, political associations formed, theatre companies founded. Bombay became the symbol of an Indian modernity because it had no pre-colonial past, no lamentation to distract it from the present; because its trade and industry was substantially owned by Indians and because Indian wealth and Indian industry gave it an undeferential sense of itself. And in Hindustani and the cinema built around it, the city found a way of narrating and amplifying itself till it became for the rest of India, synonymous with cosmopolitan modernity.        
	So what is it that makes Bombay the site on which pan-Indian dreams can be persuasively dreamt, in a way that they cant in Delhi or Kolkata? More simply, why is Bombay seen as pan-Indian where Calcutta and Madras and Delhi are seen as great metropolitan cities that belong to their hinterlands or are, at least, defined by them?        
	I think the much abused comparison with New York offers a clue. The hyper-cosmopolitanism of New York is founded on the inexplicit but very real sense that it isnt inhabited by an aboriginal people. Unlike Boston or San Diego, there isnt a possessing majority or a dominant plurality in charge. Even for a country of migrants, New York is almost bizarrely welcoming. The assumption made by its residents is that youre there to stay. There are neighbourhoods dominated by Blacks, Puerto Ricans, Jews and South Asians, but theres no prior host. Even Americans from other American cities remark on this.        
	Bombay, for reasons sometimes different from those that underwrite New Yorks cosmopolitanism, had something of that quality. Delhi has a strong Hindi-Punjabi feel to it; Kolkata is densely Bengali as Chennai is rooted in Tamil. And while theres a deeply-felt indigenist movement to claim Bombay for its Marathi-speaking hosts as opposed to its immigrant guests, I suspect the reason why the city has stoked the imaginations of film-makers and writers and people looking to make new lives for themselves is on account of this quality of not being owned.        
	I teach history so Im predisposed to look for reasons buried in the past, conjunctures that might explain Bombays special claim to cosmopolitanism. There are at least two historical reasons that kept Bombay from being assimilated into its hinterland.              
	One reason has to do with the fact that Bombay was founded by the Portuguese, and then handed over to Britain well before the Marathas were eclipsed. Its not until 1818 that the Peshwas are finally defeated and Bombay had been in existence for 200 years and more by then. The fact that the city was politically fenced off from its Marathi-speaking hinterland for the first two centuries of its existence allowed it to become home to both foreigners and Indians who didnt necessarily have roots there, linguistic or cultural. At the same time, the fragility of British control over western India allowed Indian trading elites to flourish in enterprises such as the opium trade. Thus, rich Gujaratis, both Hindu and Parsi, came to dominate the early history of Bombay.        
	Related to this isolation from its hinterland was Bombays adoption of a northern lingua franca. Before 1947, the Indian National Congress had a formula for the national language: the formula was that Hindustani written in the Persian and Nagari script would be Indias national language. In a sub-literary way, this is what Bombay did. It extemporized a pidgin (Hindustani) to get along in, and this mongrel Hindustani became a neutral ether that all Bombays citizens could breathe.        
	This relationship between the city and its pidgin and the way in which they came together to make Bombay Indias arch-metropolis, need a separate explanation and will be the subject of another column.       mukulkesavanhotmail.com

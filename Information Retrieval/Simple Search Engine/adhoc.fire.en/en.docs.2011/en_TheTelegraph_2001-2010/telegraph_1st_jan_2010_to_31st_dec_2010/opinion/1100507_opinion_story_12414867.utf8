	The hot, unrelenting summer is a good time to introspect and work on creating fresh models to ensure that old and moribund systems of operation are replaced. Distractions are few, and earnest work can happen in an honest, committed manner to reframe norms and laws that will help in the delivery of good governance in a variety of fields. Let us look at the condition of our museums and archives, both of which are repositories of our history and the layered fabric of our extraordinary culture. How can we make these institutions accessible, welcoming spaces for future generations?         
	If we look seriously at the vibrant museum culture in the United Kingdom, where, at any given time, there are vast numbers of people wandering through great halls, absorbing the history of their island kingdom that once ruled a substantial section of the planet, we can learn much. It was the British who established and set down the parameters within which our cultural institutions operate. That was when they were our colonial masters. Post Independence, we have continued with that now untenable structure without taking another look at its modalities and systems. The British, realizing that times and demands have changed radically, restructured their own institutions, which shifted from being solely government-administered to becoming a part of public-private partnerships.        
	Without civil society actively participating in the preservation, conservation and dissemination of history and culture, museums and archives take on the appearance of a morgue. The treasures in these repositories are special, some fragile and others robust. They can generate a profound sense of pride in a generation of Indians that is not embittered by alien rule or by the Partition. Their counterparts and contemporaries across the world could comprehend the deep-rooted cultural ethos of this subcontinent. Why are we throwing away our hugely important base upon which we can build human diplomacy? We can alter the course with ease if a clear political diktat is implemented constructively.                
	Simple remedies        
	The National Museum, as the first example, needs to reconstruct its legal mandate. An act needs to be devised that incorporates the civil society into the working mechanisms of museum management. In the todays jargon, this is called public-private partnership. The Victoria and Albert Museum, which was a government institution, reworked its constitution and opened its doors to private initiative. It has, over the years, become a celebrated international museum. It discarded the earlier structure, stepped out of the stifling bureaucratic framework, and opened its doors to gusts of fresh air. We, too, need to follow suit, and reframe the decayed mandate to rejuvenate our State museums.        
	The National of India appropriately sit in an imposing, historic, Lutyenesque building on the axis of Rajpath and Janpath. Enter the portico and a stench of pigeon droppings greets the visitor. Then there is reprieve when you meet the inmates, the historians and researchers working there. They are fine people, with enthusiasm and commitment as well as a love for their subject, but they are neither celebrated nor given the tools to make them truly effective. The archives do not appear to be on the radar of national priorities. This is the sad truth about our governments attitude, post Independence.        
	What the British left was meticulous in comparison to what the Government of India has enshrined in its National Archives. We need to restore its dignity. For a start, the building needs urgent restoration. It needs an infrastructure that protects the fragile evidence of days gone by. The people within its portals need to be respected for their dedication. Simple remedies will compel a change of attitude and rekindle a forgotten ethos.

	The Year of the Flood By Margaret Atwood, Bloomsbury, Rs 999        
	Margaret Atwoods latest novel is set in Year 25, the Year of the Flood. Although the era to which Year 25 belongs is left unspecified, it is undoubtedly some time in the future when the dry flood  a man-made epidemic  has swept over the entire world to leave it derelict. The plague has wiped out almost all human beings; There is still life, however. Birds chirp; sparrows, they must be. Their small voices are clear and sharp, nails on glass: theres no longer any sound of traffic to drown them out. It is thus a vision of the future very different from the one imagined by Rachel Carson in Silent Spring (1962). (Carson is one of the saints worshipped by the sect of the Gardeners in The Year of the Flood, some of the other saints being Mahatma Gandhi and Dian Fossey, the legendary researcher on gorillas.) If in Carsons future world, technological progress has effectively silenced all birdsong, in the Year of the Flood, in a perfect instance of poetic justice, science has obliterated its inventor, mankind, while sparing the birds and animals, who are slowly regaining their hold over the earth.         
	There is much poetry in The Year of the Flood. It is present in the songs sung by the Gods Gardeners at the end of each sermon, in Amandas bio art, made up of disappearing words, in Rens remembrances of the pains of love, and in Tobys stoic fight against chaos. Poetry performs a role similar to that achieved by the purring of the children of Crake in Oryx and Crake  it heals. The process is slow and painstaking, but it works as the world is purified of the dross of destructive human emotions. And like the purring by those genetically-engineered, flawless Crakers  naked, herbivorous, uncomplicated human beings  the poetry in The Year of the Flood is childish and profound at the same time. Sample these songs from the Gods Gardeners Oral Hymnbook  Oh let me not be proud, dear Lord,/ Nor rank myself above/ The other Primates, through whose genes/ We grew into your Love. Or God gave unto the Animals/ A wisdom past our power to see:/ Each knows innately how to live,/ Which we must learn laboriously. At the novels end, Atwood acknowledges the presence of Blake and Bunyan behind the Gardeners hymns.        
	The futuristic world Atwood creates out of the ruins of human civilization, populated by hybrid creatures, aggressive human beings and loony sects, and characterized by constant surveillance, is more old than new. For her narrators, Atwood chooses two women, Toby and Ren, ex-members of the Gardeners who seem to be modelled upon the Holy Fools of early Christian myth, made famous by Erasmus The Praise of Folly. Erasmus says of Christ, he seems to have taken the greatest delight in children, women, and simple fishermen; even among brute beasts, those that pleased him best were least like the crafty fox.... All these witnesses point to a single conclusion, that all men are fools, even the pious ones.... In the same way, God, the maker of the whole world, prohibited the eating of the tree of knowledge, as if knowledge was poisonous to happiness.         
	In Atwoods fictional universe, most men, satiated with knowledge and science, have given up on happiness. It is left to the foolish men such as Adam One and the rest of the Gardeners, to women like Toby, and to child-women like Ren, to rejuvenate the wasteland, using the wisdom of yore. Toby and Ren save Jimmy the Snowman, who had been teetering on the brink of death at the end of Oryx and Crake, Atwoods previous novel.        
	Oryx and Crake tells the same story as the one narrated in The Year of the Flood, but from the perspective of Jimmy, whose memory contains images of the worlds annihilation masterminded by his super-intelligent friend, Crake. For Crake, god was a brain mutation. Armed with the knowledge of genetics, Crake replaced god as he created his children, the Crakers, to supplant mankind. The beautiful Crakers are the solution to each of mans woes. They subsist on plants, are non-violent, immune to microbes and, programmed to be on heat during specific seasons and copulate, have no need to rape, plunder or murder for love. It is important that they are incapable of any kind of art, since in Crakes view, Symbolic thinking of any kind would signal downfall. The Crakers make a brief appearance at the end of the The Year of the Flood, when their soft singing hits the ears of the ragged humans as they salvage the few left of their kind.        
	Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood continue the debate over the usefulness of science and the apparent futility of art that runs through much of Atwoods speculative fiction. In a world where technology has brought immortality to men, art would obviously lose its value. The degradation of art in the future world is evident in the lowly status accorded to the Martha Graham Academy, which is a dump for students without brains. In The Year of the Flood, the institute provides a steady supply of performers, a euphemism for sex workers.         
	As the arts lose their value, language too turns corrupt, as indicated by such names as Paradice, MaddAddam and AnooYoo. Crake could create a new race but he could not be the Nomothete, the name-giver. It is left to the original Adams, though they have turned slightly mad by this time in the future, to restore meaning to the Word, perhaps through a process similar to that adopted by Rens dear friend, Amanda. Her art consists in creating gigantic four-letter words (such as love) with carcasses and then letting vultures wipe the slate clean.        
	Crake, or Glenn as he was called before he got famous, had reasoned that like the idea of the immortality of the soul, god is an effect of grammar: and grammar would be impossible without the FoxP2 gene; so God is a brain mutation, and that gene is the same one birds need for singing. So music is built in...its knitted into us. Crake made his children as unlike real human beings as possible in their docility and predictability, but could not amputate the innate human ability to sing. The Crakers ethereal songs link them to the birds, and to the poet who sings of sorrow and joy. The Year of the Flood begins with the chirping of sparrows and ends with the Crakers songs, still faint and far away, but moving closer. Surely, all is not lost in a world where music yet opens the charmed magic casement on the foam of perilous seas.

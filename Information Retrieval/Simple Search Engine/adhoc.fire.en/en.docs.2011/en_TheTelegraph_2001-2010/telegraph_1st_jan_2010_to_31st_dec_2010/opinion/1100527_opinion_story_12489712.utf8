	Is consensual group sex involving adults within closed doors a crime? Nineteen persons have just been sentenced for having indulged in group licentiousness, under a law dating back to Maos reign. The law makes it a crime for three or more persons to indulge in sex together. The accused include taxi drivers, shop assistants, security guards.... But the man at the centre of it all is a 53-year-old maths professor in the historical city of Nanjing.        
	Twice-divorced Ma Xiaohai, who lost the custody of his kids (they live with his ex-wife in the United States of America) and his house, lives with his mother who suffers from senile dementia. His brother committed suicide due to mental illness; his sister suffers from it too.        
	The professor told reporters that he found internet chat rooms a good way of overcoming his loneliness. The online chats led to a desire to meet, and meetings to further adventures. Mas home seemed a perfect setting for the group, of which only two couples were married.        
	In two-and-a-half years, the 22 members, who knew one another only by their internet names, took part in 35 orgies, with Ma playing the host to 14. But just before the group was busted, Ma had decided to call an end to it. He told reporters that young girls were no longer responding to his advances and he found too many abnormal aspirants to the group. Ironically, he described as abnormal a girl who would call him up at odd hours of the night to ask him to set up sexual encounters. When he offered himself, she insisted that a third person be involved.

	Of the 22 accused, only Professor Ma pleaded not guilty. He maintained in his defence that all that took place was voluntary, without threat or inducement, and everyone involved was an adult. He found nothing wrong in what the group had done; according to him, it was a matter of personal choice. For him, marriage was like a bowl of boiled water that had to be drunk; swapping partners was like a bowl of sweet wine. Interestingly, two of the participants had ended up getting married.        
	Ma received the harshest sentence  three-and-a-half years  while others got two-and-a-half, and three were let off because they turned themselves in. Ma will appeal, his lawyer said.        
	The sentence has met with general disapproval in a society reported to have the second highest per capita number of sexual partners. Some academics have called for opposition to this conviction as a human rights issue. Most prominent among them is Li Yinhe of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, known for her advocacy of gay rights. Writing on the case, Li asks for a repeal of the law itself.        
	Li points out that laws dating back to the Cultural Revolution, that covered crimes such as hooliganism and being counter-revolutionary, had been repealed in 1997, advancing the scope of human rights in the country. But this law on group licentiousness remained as the last relic of Maos era.        
	The law was originally a part of the hooliganism law, and included both swinging and extra-marital sex. The former attracted the death penalty for the main accused and upto 15 years for the accomplices. When the hooliganism law was repealed, extra-marital sex was decriminalized, but group sex remained a crime. Interestingly, this is the first time anyone has been convicted under this law since 1980  the start of Chinas opening-up process.        
	Describing this law as barbaric, Li writes, China is already no longer that barbaric backward country where everyone used to yank each others ponytails [symbolizing a mistake that can be used against you]! We must work hard together to change this last draconian law and cut away this ugly ponytail!

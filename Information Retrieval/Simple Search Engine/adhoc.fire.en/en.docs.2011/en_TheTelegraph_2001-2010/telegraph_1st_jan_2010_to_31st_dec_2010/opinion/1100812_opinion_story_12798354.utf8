                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CHINKS IN THE ARMOUR                                  Soroor Ahmed                              
	At a time when Operation Barga wasnt winning any more elections in West Bengal, the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar constituted the D. Bandyopadhyay commission in 2006 and asked it to submit a report on land reform. It did so in a couple of years, and the Bihar government distributed the CD of the report to all the legislators on the last day of the monsoon session in 2009. The avowed aim was to enact a new bataidari (sharecropping) law.         
	A year later, on the eve of the assembly elections, the ruling Janata Dal (United) is facing desertion from leaders belonging to landed upper castes, Bhumihars and Rajputs, who, till recently, formed the backbone of the party. The irony is that Kumar did not complete his mission of empowering sharecroppers and went back to woo the landed castes. In the process, he earned the displeasure of the sharecroppers who were likely to be benefited by the new law.        
	Strangely, none of the chief ministers confidants had warned him when he undertook these radical steps. Apart from the move to empower sharecroppers, his government took other decisions that did not go down well with its opponents and the upper castes. It raised the percentage of reserved seats in the local bodies from 49 to 86 to dismantle the stranglehold of the Yadav at the grassroots. Kumar also raised reservation for women from 33 to 50 per cent, thereby earning applause from the media and womens groups. Besides this, he introduced a 20 per cent quota for the extremely backward castes, while 16 per cent of the seats were already reserved for the Dalits. Thus, with 86 per cent of the seats reserved, there was hardly anything left for upper-caste men.         
	Four years later, when the former leader of the JD(U), Prabhunath Singh, left the party to join Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal, he raised these two issues. Prabhunath is a Rajput strongman, who, along with Lallan Singh and the late Digvijay Singh, formed a strong triumvirate.                 
	Too fast        
	Though all three were close to Kumar, none dared to counsel him against touching the contentious issue of land reform. Similarly, none opposed his move to increase reservation in the panchayats and urban local bodies. Initially, they thought that these measures  hailed as revolutionary by the press and opinion-makers  would reduce the political clout of the Yadavs.         
	However, by 2008, first Digvijay and then Prabhunath started questioning the move. Digvijay was denied the party ticket in the last Lok Sabha election and fought and won from Banka as an Independent. Prabhunath lost in Maharajganj by a slender margin. Lallan rose his banner of revolt after Kumar hinted in July 2009 that his government would be giving more power to the sharecroppers. But even he was encouraged by two unexpected developments: the humiliating defeat of the JD(U) and the Bharatiya Janata Party candidates in the assembly by-polls for 18 seats in September 2009. The debacle forced Kumar to mend fences with Upendra Kushwaha, a Koeri leader and a bitter critic of the chief minister.         
	This turned Lallan against the party as Kushwaha had publicly abused him in the past. As if this was not enough, anti-upper caste slogans were raised at the function organized to welcome Kushwaha into the party  agle sawan bhado mein, gore haath kado mein (from the next monsoon months of Sawan and Bhado, fair hands of upper-caste women would be tilling the farmland).        
	Thus, in a matter of a few months, the entire socio-political situation underwent a considerable transformation. Perhaps Kumar went ahead with his plans a bit too hastily.

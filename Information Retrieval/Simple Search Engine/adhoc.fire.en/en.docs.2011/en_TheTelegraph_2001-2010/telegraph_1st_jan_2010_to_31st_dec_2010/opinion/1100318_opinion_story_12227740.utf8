                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BLOOD RITES                                                    
	If for nothing else, the government of Abhisit Vejjajiva in Thailand will go down in history for its tolerance of political agitation, even the ones targeting it. Despite the ferocity of the current spate of pro-democracy protests in Thailand, the government has shown remarkable calm in handling the crisis. One of the toughest of the tests was the blood protest on March 16 that saw the Red Shirt agitators of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship smear blood on the prime ministers residence in a bizarre ritual that was expected to paralyse the government with fear. The Red Shirts, who have earlier hurled plastic bags of rotting fish on symbols of power besides creating massive law-and-order problems, are fighting for the reinstatement of the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, to power. He had won the last elections in 2007 by a landslide before charges of corruption saw him flee the country, and he remains immensely popular, particularly among the poor who yearn to go back to his era of debt-relief and cheap loans. The recent round of agitation was set off by a court ruling that said $1.4 billion worth of Mr Shinawatras frozen assets would become State property.         
	It should be plain as daylight to the political establishment in Thailand that the billionaire exile remains a potent political force. Yet, the Vejjajiva government has not only allowed Mr Shinawatras lines of communication with his supporters to remain unhindered, but has also held up recurrent political agitation as a sign of Thailands vibrant democracy. But that is a red herring, for there can be little doubt that politics in Thailand continues to remain under the iron grip of the army and the traditional elite, both of which owe allegiance to the monarchy. Mr Vejjajiva, who came to power in a silent coup in 2008, is himself a beneficiary of this order of things which is unlikely to change unless a truly free and fair election takes place. Mr Shinawatra, from Cambodia (which granted him political asylum), and the Red Shirts, no matter how troublesome, lack the power to force that on the clique controlling power in Thailand. Meanwhile, if Mr Vejjajiva succeeds in the endurance game, and gives timely sops to the poor, there is every chance that he will be able to stave off the eventuality of an electoral upset for some time more.

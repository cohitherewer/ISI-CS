The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Women take centre stage 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WOMEN TAKE CENTRE STAGE                                   Theatre - Ananda Lal                                                  
	What better way to mark the upcoming International Womens Day than to celebrate the work of a new generation of actresses in Mumbai, assembled by the prolific Akvarious Productions, brought here by Sanskriti Sagar and Anamika Kala Sangam. It gives us great pleasure to see so much female talent turning to theatre, not just in numbers but also in quality, for virtually all are uniformly good performers despite their youth. The future looks secure, at least for Mumbai. Now if only a similar womens wave can hit Calcutta.        
	Coincidentally or not, all the plays foregrounded women. One incorporated 15 female characters plus extras, minus any men. Another had four women in the main roles, and only a minor part for one man. The third featured an anti-hero surrounded by six women. I mention this because of the perennial dearth of dramatic scope for actresses, compared to the lions share always enjoyed by men. Only over the last few decades has Western theatre awoken to the need for equity between the sexes, and playwrights have composed drama not just providing equal opportunities, but chiefly or wholly for women. Can we hope that Indian dramatists will follow suit, to feed the casting pool that now exists, as in Mumbai?        
	Its absence until recently may explain why no Indian that I know of has attempted Jakes Women by Neil Simon who, after all, is a top fave of our English-language stage. Written in 1992, it obviously draws upon his own life: the author in the play has lost his first wife, his second marriage is on the rocks, and he starts dating a third lady, just as Simon had. The difference lies in the fact that Jake teeters on the brink of insanity and may indeed have toppled over to the other side  something that Hidaayat Sami does not adequately suggest in his portrayal. Simons fine crafting conveys this literally through mind games, as Jake calls upon his various women, and at different moments his dead spouse, his current wife at an earlier time, his daughter at age 12, his sister and his therapist enter his mindscape, appearing before us and conversing with him (as he wants them to?). Some scenes occur in real time, when they actually talk to him, but everything happens so fluidly that we cannot tell fantasy and reality apart, which the debutante director, Mrunmayee Lagoo, handles well.        
	The Croatian writer, Miro Gavran, has won considerable success with All About Women (2000), already translated into many languages. I cannot understand why. It is clearly a mans-eye-view of women, pretending to explore the female psyche while stitching five stories together cleverly: two friends whose relationship is threatened by the entry of a third, two estranged sisters meeting on their mothers birthday, three catty and ambitious secretaries, three kindergarten girls, and three ladies at an old folks home. The episodes entertain superficially, and the second plot ends in a moving reconciliation, but Gavran subtly demeans women, depicting them as obsessed with men or sex, except for the two friends who, therefore, remain unhappy.        
	I also do not understand why Sami, the director, repeats the show under the title, What Women Want, for Main Course Productions (presented by Sangit Kala Mandir). Purva Nareshs adaptation of All About Women uses English mainly, whereas What Women Want is ostensibly in Hindi, but with lots of English thrown in, and both share half their casts. Much of a muchness to me. The set, and Samis ridiculous gimmick of male stagehands trying to behave cute and funny during scene changes, are common too.        
	Naresh wrote Afsaneh: Bai se Bioscope tak in Hindustani as an imaginary dialogue between Gulab Bai, the first woman to perform Nautanki, and Beni Bai, exponent of the more classy baithaki style, about their professional experiences. Although an excellent idea, it suffers from many conceptual failings. It stresses their wisecracking nature, underplaying their toughness and dignity: presumably Naresh has read the biography, Gulab Bai: The Queen of Nautanki Theatre. The director, Akarsh Khurana, left the stage too static  both divas seated, neglecting Gulabs histrionic prowess  and lost verisimilitude without singing actresses, though Megha Sriram sang for them superbly.        
	Of the dozen actresses, those who essayed multiple roles deserve mention. The most versatile was Ratnabali Bhattacharjee (and not because she hails from Calcutta), changing chameleonically from Jakes stressed-out wife (picture, right) to little girl, concerned mother and feisty old lady in All About Women. Shivani Tanksale displayed the greatest maturity, while Prerna Chawla has a distinctive elfin quality, even as Jakes shrink. Tahira Nath also covered a wide range, from Jakes pragmatic sister to the older Gulab. Whether multiple or otherwise, nobody performed under par.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	In a tight spot                  
	Sir  Recent developments in Vietnam have left the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Prakash Karat, rather nonplussed (Karat ache: Et tu, Valiant Vietnam?, Aug 14). The United States of America is all set to conclude an agreement on nuclear energy with the Communist Party of Vietnam. This agreement would be along the lines of the Indo-US nuclear deal that Karat and his party had so vehemently opposed. Protesting against the deal, the Left Front had even withdrawn its support from the first United Progressive Alliance government. That decision, however, had only succeeded in eroding the Left Fronts strength and influence.          
	Vietnams proposed deal with the US is ironic. Long before the CPI(M) came to power in Bengal, its counterpart in Vietnam had resisted American aggression.The famous slogan, Amar naam tomar naam, Vietnam, Vietnam, was once used to rally support for the left parties. But it no longer has much appeal for the people of the state, which was once a red bastion. The gimmicks of Karat and his colleagues cannot work any longer.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilip Kumar Kar, Jalpaiguri

                
	Sir  The communist government of Vietnam seems to have staged a black comedy. Its decision to conclude a nuclear deal with the US was announced on the same day as the Indian communist party met for a conference in Vijayawada. There the party reiterated the point that its decision to walk out of the UPA-1 government because of the Indo-US nuclear deal had been correct.          
	In West Bengal, the CPI(M) has a long history of making grievous errors and then backtracking on the matters. The party attempted to block the introduction of computers in commercial houses and stop the teaching of English in primary schools. Most memorably, it engaged in forcible land acquisition from unwilling owners in order to set up industrial plants. The Left Fronts withdrawal of support to UPA-1 on the nuclear issue has affected the Marxist governments success in all subsequent elections in West Bengal. Yet the CPI(M) leaders are still unable to admit that there had been a mistake.          
	Now the party leaders have managed to discover a difference between the nuclear deals of the Indian and the Vietnamese governments. The difference, according to them, is that Vietnam will not be forced to acquiesce to a no-uranium enrichment pledge. But this appears to be mere conjecture. The details of the proposed agreement between Vietnam and the US are still being worked out. Vietnam may well be in the same boat as India. The Indian public would appreciate it if the CPI(M) leadership took the trouble to actually think before drawing conclusions.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Grim picture          
	Sir  As suggested by the editorial, Dark side of freedom (Aug 15), the Indian democracy does not seem to have matured at all, even after six decades of independence. Vital information is still withheld from the public to suit the interests of those in power. The nations politics and society are dominated by corrupt and manipulative people. This powerful, well-organized group compels others to conform to its diktats. While these men remain respected pillars of society, innocent people are made to pay for the crimes committed by the former.          
	Information remains in the hands of a powerful few, despite numerous laws and rules to facilitate its circulation. Under such conditions, celebrations of Republic Day or Independence Day make little sense.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Manoj Kumar Sinha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The editorial on Independence Day was not quite appropriate for the occasion. August 15 was not the right day to highlight the negative sides of freedom. The sentiments it expressed do not honour the memory of those who sacrificed their lives to gain freedom for their nation.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S.E. Kabir, Siliguri

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The article, Currency paper pinch (Aug 14), raised some serious questions. It is a pity that even after 63 years of Independence and in spite of massive advancements in technology, India is still not able to manufacture paper for its own currency. The existing security presses should be modernized immediately so that currency paper can be made within the country. If that happens, there would be no need to source it from foreign firms.          
	Yours faithfully,

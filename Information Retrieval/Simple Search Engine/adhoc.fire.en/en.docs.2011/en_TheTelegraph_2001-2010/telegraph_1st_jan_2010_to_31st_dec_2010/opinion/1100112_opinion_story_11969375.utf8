                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPOILING THE EARTH                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Mining licences have been the ticket to wealth, responsible for many rags-to-riches stories over the years. Politicians issue them for big businessmen who, in turn, give unquestioned support to all levels of politicians, who help clear those contracts. More often than not, these contracts breach the law. As a result, endless tracts of pristine forest cover have been raped and mutilated beyond recognition, polluting the environment, our water sources and more. You- scratch-my-back-and-I-shall-scratch-yours has been the norm for the businessmen, politicians and administration as they destroy what had been deemed protected by the lawmakers of this now benighted land of ours. The greed for short-term gain has corrupted our space in many interconnected ways.        
	Tendencies to break the laws and indulge in a variety of illegalities usually mark alliance partners in political coalitions, who use blackmail to put pressure on the apex decision-makers to deviate from the book, consciously commit injustice, and break their own laws. No leader has stood his ground to change the course of this machinery of corruption because every deal is accompanied by unimaginable sums of money to maintain silence. This corruption has seeped into every conceivable area of our lives, but is gradually being rejected by some pioneering incumbents in politics, government and civil society. The latter are showing signs of angry protest against this untenable form of governance.                
	Perverse oath        
	Senior leaders in all parties, their sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, are all grabbing the spoils of mother earth. Where have all the good sense and philosophy gone? Why are our rich, educated and privileged citizens breaking laws, and consciously destroying the moral ethos of an extraordinary civilization? Is there no political commitment to order and ensure honest governance? Will no one at the helm of governance, from all across the country, from all dispensations, have the tenacity to stand up and be counted for doing what is right instead of surreptitiously condoning all that is wrong? Are we utterly bereft of good sense? Are we a truly soft, untenable State?        
	When the tribal rights bill was being hurriedly passed in Parliament, actively supported by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), many of us feared that the misuse of laws would allow the rape of our forests, with the tribals left with paltry sums as remuneration, after being enticed and exploited by a new dispensation posing as their saviours. The process has become far more complicated now than my convoluted preceding sentence! No one has any intention of saving, restoring and nurturing our wilderness, our rivers and mountains, our habitats and living spaces. Those who have the power to grab and usurp are doing so. The agencies that are mandated to patrol such sacrosanct areas are in denial, and when not, are in cahoots with the offenders.        
	What is the point of declaiming from international rostrums Indias commitment to curb the negatives leading to climate change? Why this posturing when constant pressure tactics win and permit projects that are detrimental to our environment and our future? It is as though the Indian State has taken a perverse oath to poison our land and space, and, therefore, our children. Money in the hands of operators and deal-makers and a good rate of growth for the government seem to be the two priorities in decision-making today. There is no debate or discourse on critical issues, and there is no ban on illegalities. Coalitions have to survive at the cost of India, her people and their future. Will the government reject the mining proposals of large multinational companies? Will the government abide by its own laws?

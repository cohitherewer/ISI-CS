	India must stop so that Prakash Karats failed third front can take off. For all the charade of Opposition unity, there is no doubt that the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is the prime mover behind the call for a Bharat bandh on April 27. And for all the rhetoric about the need for a fight against price rise, the real reasons behind Mr Karats  and his partys  return to militant politics are not difficult to guess. The CPI(M) faces crises on several fronts. Mr Karats brinkmanship, which resulted in the Left withdrawing its support to the previous government of the United Progressive Alliance, did little harm to the Congress but has had disastrous effects on his own party. Their numbers in the Lok Sabha drastically reduced after the 2009 polls, the CPI(M) and its leftist allies have lost their relevance in national politics. Worse, the partys long reign in West Bengal is in real danger of collapsing in next years assembly polls. Mr Karat and his party think that the only way they can try and stave off the coming collapse is by returning to their old, militant ways. Hence the sudden spurt in Left-sponsored strikes and other mass protests, ostensibly against the Centres policies. The desperation shows also in the way Mr Karat has tried to get even some UPA partners support his plan for the countrywide bandh.         
	Mr Karat will be deluding himself if he thinks that the people will fall for his game. All past experiences show that Left-sponsored bandhs are restricted only to West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, where the governments become the main sponsors of disruption of public life. The rest of the country ignores such calls. There is no doubt that this will be the case with this Bharat bandh call too. But even in the Left-ruled states, the public anger at strikes and other shutdowns is rising. As on so many occasions in the past, the CPI(M) seems to have failed to read the peoples mood correctly. The party may be desperate to try old ploys, but it must be extraordinarily nave to think that these can help in its recovery, especially in West Bengal. For all its national pretensions, the CPI(M) is a party with an extremely thin geographical spread. It is thus not unreasonable to suspect that the Lefts bandh call has little to do with rising prices. It is all about the CPI(M)s struggle to keep its head above water.

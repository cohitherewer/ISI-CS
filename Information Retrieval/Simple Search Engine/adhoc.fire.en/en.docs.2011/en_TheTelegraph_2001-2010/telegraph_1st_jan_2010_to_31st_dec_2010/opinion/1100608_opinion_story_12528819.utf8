Basu                                                              
	Two charming and intelligent census enumerators visited my home yesterday. Not census enumerators actually; those will come next year. These were, strictly speaking, house listers/National Population Register recorders. From their names and their head scarves, I gathered that these were young Muslim women. But from their enthusiasm for their work and their determination not to let me get away without answering every single question, I also surmised that they have not been listening too carefully to the latest dictates of the Deoband Darul Uloom madrasa.        
	That they did not complain about the outdoor walking in the Delhi heat made me blush about my own continuous whining. From the way they refused to let me save them another trip by taking reliable (really, I know some of my neighbours in and out) information from me about an absent neighbour, I surmised that their sense of integrity is yet intact. They talked cheerfully about all the homes in the neighbourhood from which they had been shooed out by educated, well-off inhabitants. But they did not share my disheartenment on this, they were confident that with a few repeat visits, they would be able to persuade these suspicious, rude men to volunteer information.        
	These were not the only surprises from the visit. The biggest surprise came from discovering that there was a caste question in the forms they needed to fill out. While I knew that the government is tilting towards including caste in the census, I did not know that the question was to be asked at this pre-census stage. But maybe it is only a pilot procedure right now, to test responses or to prepare a master list or something for the actual census next year. The girls certainly did not seem very sure about what they were asking or how they were to record my answer.        
	Once a decision, any decision, has been taken on this matter, if it is positive, we can concentrate on how to analyze and use the information that will be collected on caste, and stop arguing about whether the census should or should not include a question on caste. It is mind-boggling how these arguments have taken on such a either you are for us or you are against us character. That there are pros and cons to both recording as well as not recording caste should go without saying, but few people see it this way; commentators in the media take one side or the other just as easily as the representatives of various political groupings. And editorials in magazines and newspapers are equally vehemently either only in favour of recognizing the reality of caste in India or absolutely against this foolish lighting of the fuse of a huge caste time-bomb.        
	Not that these extreme arguments will have much effect on the final decision, which will be based entirely on political expediency and political pressure. But assuming that it will happen (if the pre-census questions are any indication), we might as well turn to thinking about the ways in which it might be used for the greater good instead of becoming merely one more cynical weapon in the hands of those whose distorted definition of democracy is premised on the right of the many to tyrannize over the few and who believe that power comes from and deserves to come only from large numbers.        
	The saving grace is that the census is much more than a head count. It is unimaginative for both those in favour of or against the inclusion of caste in the census to assume that all we will have at the end of it is the absolute numbers of self-professed members of a particular caste or sub-caste. Of course, well know these numbers, and much will undoubtedly be made of them by all kinds of constituencies seeking all kinds of privileges.        
	But we will also know much more than the size of each caste group. We will have fairly reliable information on other characteristics of each group. This means we will be, in principle at least, able to call the bluff of many groups seeking special status  through job reservations or affirmative action  by checking how well such caste membership actually correlates with socio-economic disadvantage. There is some fear that some or even many members of specific groups will be smart enough or indoctrinated to become dishonest enough to understate their socio-economic status to bolster their claims for special treatment. But it is unlikely that such misstating will be large or systematic enough to greatly distort our overall picture of caste differentials in socio-economic disadvantage. I say this because many of the aspects of SES being measured in the census  nature of home building materials, or access to water, toilets, electricity, cooking fuel, or ownership of assets like a television or scooter  are not easy to hide, certainly not on any large scale, even if individual households are adept at seeming much poorer than they are. Other less physically visible kinds of progress  like education, sources of livelihood, family/household size  may be easier to downplay but again unlikely to be denied altogether, both out of an innate human desire to show off, as well as owing to the fact that most of us are not good actors, and even supposedly good actors are notoriously bad at playing the poor illiterate peasant, as our mainstream social cinema demonstrates. So, a fairly well-trained census enumerator should not be easy to fool on that front  again, at least not in any large-scale or systematic way.        
	This caste census may be our best chance yet to develop a strong empirical argument for denying special or other backward classes status to any group that can muster enough numbers to make the kind of exorbitant claims on public resources that are currently commonplace. The SES by caste tabulations that the census will generate may not give national or state governments the courage to un-reserve groups that no longer have a need for special consideration, but they will at least provide the evidence to deny such privileges to even more groups. Indeed, there may even be some nave political/ administrative authorities that will dare to ask for the transfer of certain currently classified-as-backward groups to merely Indian citizen status, but maybe I am asking for too much here.        
	Also, this will be an interesting time to demonstrate how hollow or how real our promises of commitment to the truly disadvantaged castes and tribes have actually been. The same socio-economic indicators that may show us that some groups do not or no longer need special status may also describe more fully those groups that continue to need it, even after 60 years of supposed pandering to them. Even more important, these data may allow us to fine-tune some of the special considerations  perhaps it is now time to step back on reservations in educational institutions, for example, while still upholding reservations in public sector jobs. Or perhaps, we need to worry about reservations for scheduled tribe families in central India, but can allow those in other parts of the country to compete in a general pool.        
	These are merely stylized examples. But such a comprehensive data set can, in principle (it is dreary, how often one needs to add the in principle caveat to anything we can do in this country), be mined to promote much more egalitarian, just and innovative development policies than our current blind groping allows. Take the field of higher education. Maybe it is time to reserve seats for scheduled caste and ST applicants only if they are first-generation college applicants, only if neither parent has been to college. Lets see how many SC and ST households have been able to use existing reservations to actually get a college degree and if this number is really as large as the anti-reservationists claim, we will have a persuasive, numbers-based argument to drop access for these lucky families to the reserved pool in post-secondary education. This will, of course, be open to manipulation, corruption, and dishonest representation, but is anything that we try to do in this our land of opportunity and moral posturing not open to such blatant misuse? In the absence of infinite resources and in the presence of much exploitation and unfairness in the distribution of these resources, we must continue to aim to mitigate some of these injustices at the same time that we press ahead with promoting a moral system that inculcates shame and guilt in those that cheat the system. That is the personal and family dishonour that we need to learn to cringe about, not the supposed dishonour that comes from a daughter falling in love with someone from a lower caste.        
	And when there are more and more such daughters and sons, who find their partners within their own gotra or outside their own caste and sub-caste (and even religion and country), that is when the census will be in a real fix with its question on caste. I got a taste of this fix when the lovely enumerators wanted to know our household caste. Since I have a husband (from another caste/community) and since the resident male is decreed the household head in our census forms, and since the household caste question is to be answered only with reference to the household head, I am happy to report that my own caste will continue to remain a secret in official records. But even when (if) we reach the exalted stage of not equating household characteristics, interests or identities with the characteristics, interests and identities of its individual members, a mixed caste household will be flummoxed by the caste census. I may be able to state my caste separately from my spouses. But what caste will my poor children claim on that cyclostyled form?              
	And when there are so many such impure and unclassifiable children that any caste tabulations we generate from census data spew out nonsensical results, perhaps then we can haughtily declare that the Indian State is taking us back to a regressive past by asking for our caste. Maybe 200 years from now.
